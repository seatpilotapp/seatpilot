4 **The Book of Rules**  
# Sean Adams  
# Being a designer requires possessing certain dissociative identity disorder  
# characteristics.  
# Previously known as multiple personality disorder, its symptoms result  
# in a designer possessing two personality states. The first is obsessively focused on the  
# most minute details of type\: serif forms or the optical appearance of hanging quotation  
# marks. The second personality is open to radical new ideas and can view any problem  
# with comprehensive and open-ended solutions. Unfortunately, there is no alternative. To  
# succeed as a designer requires being able to acknowledge both ways of seeing the world.  
# The title of this book, Graphic Design Rules, identifies a life-saving suggestion that will  
# prevent the viewer from assuming that the designer is merely a small child or house cat  
# that has learned how to use the computer.  
# But, in the right hands and with radical  
# thinking, one might find a use for Comic Sans \(although highly unlikely, as it is  
# remarkably clumsy and overused\). The thing about rules is that they often work best  
# when broken. Without experimenting with that which is considered entirely incorrect,  
# we might still be using medieval medical techniques, for example. Here, then, is the  
# dilemma\: when to follow the rules and when to ignore them.  
# Experience should be the guide when determining if one should ignore convention  
# and choose low-quality paper stock, combine multiple serif typefaces, or use expected  
# and bland stock photography.  
# On one project, I chose the most inferior quality of paper  
# possible to communicate authenticity.  
# On another, I combined Garamond, Bodoni,  
# Caslon, and Century Expanded because I wanted to.  
# And I’ve applied terribly banal stock  
# photos to a project to add humor.  
# One viewer might be enchanted with these choices,  
# while another might find them disturbing and entirely misguided.  
# But I decided to make  
# these choices after doing the right thing and following the rules for more than twenty  
# years.  
# Design is not only about research and great concepts.  
# Craft is a vital component that  
# separates us from cows. Recently, a designer who travels in radical avant-garde circles  
# told me that craft was the c word. Somehow, the idea that a designer focused on the  
# refinement of form and excellence in execution was equated with vapid and  
# “aesthetically attractive” work. I disagree entirely. Why would a solution that employs  
# sloppy typography, grammatical errors, and dour colors be more intelligent? If our job as  
# designers is to communicate a concept, shouldn’t seducing the viewer be preferable to  
# repulsing him or her?  
5 **Much of Graphic Design Rules is oriented to assist the designer with issues of craft**  
# through rules, suggestions, and methods. This incorporates approaches to typography,  
# composition, color, and images. These are the ingredients, with a strong concept, that  
# create a design solution. If I were a chef, I would strive to work with the best ingredients\:  
# produce, choice of meat, and herbs. I would not expect an excellent meal if I replaced the  
# fresh ahi tuna with canned tuna or tomato sauce from scratch with Chef  
# Boyardee or  
# SpaghettiOs. The same is true with design. Working with a well-designed version of a  
# typeface, such as Garamond, a custom color palette, and extraordinary photography will  
# produce a superior solution rather than the free downloaded typeface, the default palette  
# in a software program, and random stock photography.  
# Once one has mastered the “right” way of designing and is confident that every en dash  
# is appropriately typeset, it is acceptable to allow that other personality to rise to the  
# surface. He or she can then imagine remarkably unexpected and provocative solutions,  
# challenge the status quo, and explore alternative processes in production. However, that  
# personality hellbent on following the rules and on creating perfection needs to step in  
# periodically to make sure the solution communicates clearly and delights the viewer.  
6 **Type & Typography**  
7 **DON’T use Comic Sans**  
# Well, we had to put it in, didn’t we? Comic Sans is arguably the most inappropriately used  
# typeface in history since its first appearance in 1995. It was designed for Microsoft a year  
# earlier by Vincent Connare \(who incidentally is very philosophical about his notoriety  
# among type fans\) to supply user-friendly menus for people who were a bit scared of  
**computers. When it was included as one of the font choices in Windows 95, it took oﬀ**  
8 **faster than a speeding bullet. Everyone with a computer and the notion they could do**  
# graphic design started using it on their homemade letterheads, party invites, curricula  
# vitae, shop signs, well, you get the picture.  
# Comic Sans wasn’t designed to do all these  
# things, so why did everyone like it so much? Connare thinks people like to use it because  
**“it’s not like a typeface.” Ouch! What better reason can there be to not use Comic Sans? TS**  
9 **DO use Comic Sans . . . ironically**  
# Did I just say you shouldn’t use Comic Sans? Well, I was only kidding.  
# One of the great  
# things about typefaces that are vilified due to inappropriate application or overuse is they  
# gain a platform from which they can be used to portray irony, sarcasm, satire, and so on. If  
# you’ve got a dispiriting message that you want to make light of, for instance “Turning  
# forty-six next week and really happy about it—party on!” Comic Sans might just be your  
# typeface of choice. The problem is that those invitees who aren’t graphic designers won’t  
**get the joke. Using type ironically can be very eﬀective and indeed great fun, but only if**  
# the irony isn’t wasted. Therefore, think carefully before you decide to use Comic Sans,  
# Child’s Play, Dot Matrix, Bullets Dingbats, or any other novelty typeface that requires  
# anyone to figure out why you chose the typeface in the first place. If the joke isn’t  
# immediately transparent, you should probably have gone for Times New Roman instead.  
**Ha ha—do you get it? No? TS**  
10 **DO accept that Times New Roman has its**  
# uses  
# Times New Roman is an incredibly useful typeface. It’s well designed, with elegant  
# letterforms, and displays excellent readability and legibility characteristics. It’s also very  
# economical with space, a property that harks back to its origins as a typeface designed for  
# the Times newspaper in 1932. Its biggest problem is that it’s so totally ubiquitous, it has  
# lost its personality. Everyone with a computer can identify it, thanks once again to  
# Microsoft, who’s bundled it with Windows since 1992 and made it the default typeface  
# for Word before switching to Calibri in 2007  
# . It’s also one of the most widely used  
# typefaces in mass-market paperbacks, particularly in the United States. This is why we  
# graphic designers get all haughty about using it.  
# Are we being fair? I’m not so sure. If it’s  
# not such a great typeface, how come it’s used more than any other for so many varying  
# applications? I think it’s time to accept Times New Roman for what it is and give thanks  
# for its usefulness.  
# But will I be using it for my next commercial design commission? No  
# way—it’s Times New Roman, for goodness’ sake!  
# TS  
11 **DON’T use Zapf Dingbats**  
# Good design is about good ingredients.  
# A talented chef uses the best spices, vegetables,  
# and meats.  
# A bad chef chooses the premade cake mix rather than making a wonderful  
# cake from scratch. Zapf Dingbats are well drawn and have an excellent pedigree, created  
# by Hermann Zapf.  
**But they are ubiquitous and oﬀ the shelf. They work well for**  
# handmade signs for lost dogs or birthday parties. Like most design elements, a good rule  
# of thumb is to ask this question\: would my mother design this? Unless your mother is a  
# noted designer, she will likely design an invitation for her weekly bridge game using Zapf  
# Dingbats. Your poster for a client, such as the Melbourne Opera or the Louvre, deserves  
# better. Unfortunately, while they are useful and in some instances \(the triangle and  
# simple star\) acceptable, Zapf Dingbats will create work that is dull, ordinary, and  
# expected.  
# As a designer, one of our jobs is to create delight. Invent a custom form for an  
# arrow, asterisk, or scissors. If great design is in the details, why would choosing a banal  
**detail be the right choice? SA**  
12 **DO worship classic typefaces**  
# What designates a typeface as a classic? First, it doesn’t mean the typeface has to be a  
# hundred years old, as any typeface providing a marker for a prominent graphic style can  
# be considered a classic. In 2009, I was fortunate to work with designer and writer Tamye  
# Riggs on a book about classic fonts. She came up with a great analogy to automobiles\:  
# every year seems to produce its own classic car; the same can be said of fonts.  
# Any  
# typeface that makes a credible mark on typography has a right to join the classics club—  
# Sentinel \(as used in this book\) is a good example of a relatively new font that has become  
# a classic very quickly. The digital revolution has placed thousands of \(often quite bad\)  
# fonts at our disposal, but for me it’s the typefaces that have best made the transition from  
# movable type to digitized font that are the true classics. These are fonts that will always  
# remain relevant and should indeed be worshipped, although respected is probably a  
# better word. Use them wisely and often—they’ll never let you down.  
# TS  
13 **DO learn about typographic**  
# classification  
# It’s normal to make type choices based on the feel you get from a typeface, but knowing at  
# least a little about typographic classification \(the grouping of typefaces that share similar  
# design characteristics\) can help you reach a more informed decision about using  
# specialist type. For example, Transitional serif typefaces from the mid-eighteenth  
# century, such as Baskerville, are evolved interpretations of Old Style serifs dating back as  
# far as the late fifteenth century; they are more elegant and easier to read. This means  
# Transitional serif typefaces are particularly well suited to the setting of long-form text.  
# Some background knowledge on a typeface’s origins can go a long way, especially when a  
# specific historical period is referenced in the text. Using Futura to set your headings for  
# that article about the Industrial Revolution isn’t necessarily wrong, but Baskerville  
# might look a little more appropriate.  
# TS  
14 15 **DON’T choose the latest typeface for**  
# every new project you work on  
# As designers, we’re all susceptible to a bit of typeface mania every now and again. You  
# know how it is—a MyFonts newsletter arrives in your inbox, you scroll down, and there it  
# is. You think, My God! That font is amazing. I must buy it and use it on the project I’m just  
# about to start.  
# But hold on just a second. It might be a great typeface that you can’t live  
# without, but is it truly right for the project?  
# More to the point, will your client respond  
# well to it? For example, if you’re working on a new logo for a mortician, MetroScript  
# might not be a good choice, no matter how much you like it. Likewise, Futura might not  
# be ideal for the badge of the local amateur baseball team’s uniform, unless, of course, they  
# all work together at an interior design shop and are fans of 1920s European architecture.  
# These are extreme examples, of course, but think carefully about the appropriateness of  
# your font choices, and try not to get carried away by your own personal favorites when a  
# tried and trusted font might serve you better.  
# TS  
16 **DO learn that trendy typefaces do not**  
# always prevail  
# Life is full of regrets and errors. Why did I say yes to that last cocktail?  
# Perhaps the  
# adoption of twelve children was overkill? Trendy typography is one of the most egregious  
# of these errors.  
# Curlz may seem wacky and fun, but it will ruin your life.  
# As designers, we  
# have the pressure of remaining aware of shifts in popular culture. Understanding what is  
# trendy is part of the job. The obvious reason for choosing classic over trendy typefaces is  
# that the trendy fonts will likely soon fall out of style.  
# Classic fonts have survived the test  
# of time.  
# Consider your haircut in high school. Is that school photo the one that you use as  
# your headshot for publications? No. Each of us, at some point, has fallen into a trendy and  
# tragic hairstyle. Trendy type is the same. Template Gothic was groundbreaking in 1990.  
# Four years later, all of these projects were dismissed as “so 1990.” These projects now sit  
# unseen in designers’ flat files, like high school senior photos, hidden from public view.  
# SA  
17 **DO accept that legibility and readability**  
# are more important than typographic  
# styling  
**Our purpose as designers is to communicate eﬀectively, but the number of options**  
# available to us can often be overwhelming. First of all, any number of typographic  
# stylings can be applied to a headline or a body of text; designers often submit text matter  
# featuring numerous typefaces. \(We jokingly refer to this type of designer in my studio as  
# a Ten-Typeface-Terry—apologies to Terrys everywhere!\) Sadly, this approach not only  
# makes it very hard for the reader to navigate the text and understand the content but also  
# makes for an unpleasant reading experience. I always turn the page if it is typographically  
18 **confusing—if the audience decides to do the same, then the designer has failed in**  
# providing legibility and readability. Keep it simple, choose appropriately, and respect the  
# words.  
# PD  
19 **DO throw legibility and readability out**  
# the window  
# Legibility and readability are not always of utmost importance. You only have to look at  
# the hugely influential body of work created by David Carson during the 1990s, when he  
# was art director of Raygun magazine—an era that pioneered what later became known as  
# grunge typography. This style of typography was often practically illegible, relying on the  
# visual impact of the type to convey the core meaning of the layout.  
# Admittedly, much of  
# the work produced during that period now looks dated, but, graphically, much of it also  
# still looks spectacular, almost more art than graphic design. Where does art end and  
# graphic design begin, though? There’s a good question. The bottom line\: If you’re  
# designing a public service leaflet for a government department or a book about Swiss  
# furniture design, grunge typography really isn’t the way to go. However, if your audience  
# is likely to respond to typography that is a little more radical, legibility and readability  
# may indeed be sidelined.  
# TS  
20 **DO learn about the anatomy of**  
# letterforms  
# I’ve always been fascinated by how many intriguing terms there are for the components  
# that make up letterforms\: ascenders, balls, chins, dots, and so on.  
# Any designer worthy of  
# the title should really spend time learning the names of these components that make up  
# characters. You’ll find it most useful when it comes to choosing typefaces for a design, as  
# you’ll understand how the individual letterforms are constructed and be able to compare  
# particular typefaces with an expert eye. This is especially important when considering  
# which typeface to use for text matter—you can use this knowledge to help evaluate the  
# appropriateness and legibility of a typeface. If you decide to take on the challenge of  
21 **designing your own typeface, it’s even more important that you know about the anatomy**  
**of letter-forms and how these elements have an eﬀect on a typeface’s appearance and**  
# structure.  
# PD  
22 **Some years ago, it would have been a bad idea to use TrueType fonts for a print project**  
# because there were issues outputting the format to RIPs \(raster image processor\) or laser  
# writers. Software improvements to print and PDF workflows mean that this is not a  
**major issue today, but format choice is still important for web use, as diﬀerent browsers**  
**prefer diﬀerent formats. The TrueType format \(TTF\) and its much improved successor,**  
# OpenType, is probably the best choice overall. Web Open Font Format \(WOFF\) is a much  
# better option, as it is widely supported, as are Scalable Vector Graphic \(SVG\) fonts,  
# which work particularly well on phones and tablets.  
# TS  
23 **DON’T use “free” fonts, unless you are**  
# sure they are of good quality  
# Since the emergence of digital design technology, there has been an explosion in the  
# number of typefaces. This is thanks to the development of relatively easy-to-use  
# typeface-creation software and the rise of websites dedicated to the sharing or selling of  
# typefaces. Many of the typefaces are available online to download free of charge or for a  
# nominal fee. However, on a number of occasions, my studio has found that “free” fonts  
# don’t work as they should—whether on a printout, in a PDF, or within live files. Either  
# they have failed to display properly, or they do not work at all. This has, obviously, created  
**great diﬃculties because, by that stage, the design has been established, refined, and**  
# approved—the only solution is to find a replacement typeface. If there is a deadline to  
24 **meet \(and there always is!\), this can cause tension between you and the client.**  
# Always  
# check the typeface’s integrity, and make sure it works as it should before incorporating it  
# into your design.  
# PD  
25 **DON’T design for print using system**  
# fonts  
# System fonts are made for civilians. These are basic choices provided so everyone can  
# exchange Word documents easily and so a child can make a sign for their bedroom door.  
# Some system fonts, such as Times Roman and Helvetica, are beautiful typefaces. Times  
# Roman was designed for the Times of London in 1932, and Helvetica was designed in  
# 1957  
# . They are legible, clear, and refined. Unfortunately, they are also everywhere.  
# And  
# anything that is everywhere can easily becomes background noise or wallpaper that we  
# do not see. Telephone poles are a good example. Now, there are exceptions.  
# Arial and  
# Georgia are system fonts that are good choices for websites. They are poor choices for  
# printed materials and for instances when you need a distinctive voice.  
# “But Verdana is  
# perfectly fine,” you may say.  
# And yes, it is.  
# But so is raw concrete. I’d rather choose  
# another surface for my house. It is important to have a broad knowledge of typefaces.  
# Recognizing a refined cut of Univers as opposed to system Verdana is what separates a  
# good designer from those designing telephone directory ads.  
# SA  
26 **DO mix typeface choices to create**  
# typographic texture  
**Diﬀerent typefaces don’t always work together naturally, but good combinations of fonts**  
# from opposing type families can create wonderful typographic texture. For an  
# experienced typographer, the process is largely intuitive; let’s face it, everyone is going to  
# have their own opinion about which typefaces combine well. However, it’s useful to have  
# a few ground rules to follow. First, look for historical links between typefaces and try  
# combinations in which the features of each font underpin its role in your layout. For  
# example, an early grotesque slab for headlines with an elegant transitional serif for the  
**text. Second, look at the proportions of diﬀerent typefaces and select font combinations**  
# with harmonious links between, say, character heights and widths. Third, try to pick up  
**on any qualities that diﬀerent typefaces might share, such as elegant stems and bowls,**  
# consistent stroke thickness, and so on. The important thing is to identify exactly what  
# role each font has to play in the layout and take care to stick to the plan. If you don’t, you’ll  
# end up with typographic soup.  
# TS  
27 **DON’T mix typefaces to create hierarchy**  
# Postcards for raves and nightclub events are a wonderful cacophony of typography, color,  
# and sparkly objects.  
# “Look at me! Look over here! No, look here!” they shout. It’s great fun  
# until you need to find an address. Many designers make the error of creating hierarchy  
# using similar techniques, the ill-advised practice of using multiple elements rather than  
# employing sound typographic practices. This leads to solutions that are confusing,  
# chaotic, and desperate. Desperation is not pretty at a singles bar, and it is not pretty in  
# design.  
# Creating clear hierarchy is an exercise in patience and restraint.  
# Choose one typeface for body copy  
# Choose a size  
# Choose a color  
28 **Choose a weight**  
# Choose a case style  
# Now for the headline\: change one attribute, and only one.  
# Change the weight, size, color,  
# or case. Then stop. Do not change the typeface, add a color, make the headline larger, and  
# use all caps. That is good for postcards for a rave, not for clear information.  
# SA  
29 **DON’T mix serif fonts in a layout**  
# Few people can successfully mingle stripes and plaids. Edward, the Prince of Wales,  
# managed to mix plaids and plaids, but he had hours of free time to perfect this, and when  
# you’re very rich, everyone assumes you are correct. When one of us attempts something  
# similar, we end up looking like a member of a barbershop quartet. This is why mixing  
# serif fonts can be disturbing. I’m talking here about mixing serif fonts, such as Garamond  
# with Bembo. They are both beautiful typefaces, but they are too similar. If you are  
# designing a publication to be read only by an educated group of typophiles, the reaction  
# might be\: “Isn’t that ironic?” The rest of us will only see something that looks like a  
# mistake. This will result in the same response as seeing someone mixing plaids\: “That’s  
**just sad and wrong.” SA**  
30 **DON’T use ultrathin typefaces for logo**  
# design  
# There are times when a client requests something that defies the laws of physics. They  
# may request larger type and with additional copy inside a smaller space.  
# Or they may ask  
# for a logo with ultrathin letterforms. Most logos are reduced to fit on a business card or in  
# the corner of a website. The laws of physics dictate that a thin typestyle will be thinner  
# when reduced in scale. If a logo is made with ultrathin letterforms, at some scale these  
# letterforms will appear to be as thin as a single atom. No printer will be able to print this,  
# and nobody will see it. The solution is to create logos that can be scaled to a small size and  
# remain clear.  
# Additionally, good logos are strong and confident. No company or  
**organization should be portrayed as being weak, ineﬀectual, and anemic.**  
# SA  
31 **DO always choose a typeface with an**  
# acceptable range of weights for body  
# text  
# When you need to typeset any amount of body text, please be sure to select a typeface  
# with at least a couple of weights in both roman and bold, and more importantly, one with  
# true italics. It’s a surprisingly common mistake for designers to choose a font based  
# purely on its looks \(not a bad thing per se, so don’t shout me down here\) but with little or  
# no consideration for its versatility. Imagine the scenario\: the presentation is completed,  
# and the industrial theme looks wonderful with DIN 1451 as the text font. Then the editor  
# calls you up and says, “I want to introduce italics in the running text. How can I do that  
# with this font?” Disaster—there are no italic weights, and don’t you dare add a slant to the  
# roman font!  
# Okay, you could switch to Linotype’s DIN Next, which has lots of italic  
# weights, but if you don’t already own it, and the client insists they like the typeface you’ve  
# used, you’ve got an unexpected expense against the project’s budget. Serves you right!  
# TS  
32 **DON’T use any more typefaces in one**  
# layout than is absolutely necessary  
# This is one rule that leaves a little ambiguity. However, a solid gauge is that as soon as you  
# notice that a layout has a lot of fonts, it probably has too many. If we all take an honest  
# approach, we can admit that we rarely need more than one sans serif and one serif font to  
# complete most assignments. Sticking to typefaces that have full sets so that we have  
# usable bold, italics, and whatnot will bring most any document to fruition. If you find that  
**your design uses diﬀerent fonts for the introductory paragraphs, drop caps, captions,**  
# folios, body copies, and pull quotes—well, then you have six typefaces in action already,  
# along with a confused reader, and we haven’t even talked about headlines. Give me back  
# four of the fonts, and let’s try this again. You’ll thank me later.  
# JF  
33 **DON’T set body copy using a script**  
# typeface  
# Have you ever tried to read a block of running text set in a formal script typeface? I  
# repeat, have you ever tried to read a block of running text set in a formal script typeface?  
# It’s hard work, isn’t it? This explains why designers in the know tend not to make that  
# type choice. I’ve racked my brains trying to think of a situation in which you might want  
# to do this, and with the possible exception of a wedding invitation, I really can’t think of  
# one. In fact, I can’t think of a good reason to use a script font for the text on a wedding  
# invitation either, if you expect any of the guests to actually read it. I’m sounding very  
# antiscript here, which I’m not, but for important text that needs to be read easily and  
# understood clearly, scripts aren’t a good choice. Do use scripts for flamboyant headlines,  
# highly characterful logos, or elegant branding, but not for the directions to the church, or  
# your client may find that nobody turns up on the big day.  
# TS  
34 **DO manually kern script fonts**  
# When you do find an occasion to use a script typeface \(you see—I’m not completely  
# antiscript\), it’s important to pay close attention to the kerning, as, invariably, several  
# character pairs will need manual adjustment. Script typefaces evolved from the formal  
# handwriting styles of the seventeenth century, and many of the characters feature  
# strokes that join them to the next letter in a word. The kerning pairs built into every  
# typeface will take care of some, but not all, instances of inconsistencies, for example, a  
# lowercase e and an n or a p and an r. The adjustments are often tiny but will make all the  
**diﬀerence in the elegant flow of your type, particularly at large point sizes, which makes**  
# clearly visible even the slightest misalignment.  
# By the way, if you’re using Adobe  
# InDesign, don’t be tempted to use the optical setting for kerning with a script font. It  
# works very well with other typeface classifications when set at larger point sizes, but for  
# scripts you should stick with metrics for the best results.  
# TS  
35 **DON’T set body copy in a novelty**  
# typeface  
# I turned to my trusty Oxford English Dictionary, which defines novelty as “a decorative or  
# amusing object relying for its appeal on the newness of its design.” The dictionary also  
# uses the word strangeness, which for me is the more appropriate explanation for the  
# unsuitability of novelty typefaces for setting text. To be fair, there is a place in the design  
# world for novelty typefaces, and some clients might love the idea of an entire brochure set  
# in Jokerman. When used appropriately, good novelty typefaces can work, but it takes a  
# good eye and a measured judgment on the part of the designer to get it right. I know I’m  
# sounding like a terrible type snob here, but it’s true—believe me.  
# As for setting body copy  
# in a novelty typeface, it breaks all the rules of legibility and readability \(and taste, quite  
# frankly\), so if you want to be taken seriously as a typographer, don’t go there.  
# TS  
36 **DON’T use display fonts for body copy**  
# For this rule, we should first establish the definition of a display typeface to understand  
**how this diﬀers from other fonts. In essence, display refers to the use of type at large**  
# sizes, such as 72pt, which may be used for titles on a magazine or headlines in a  
# newspaper.  
**As such, display fonts are “cut” diﬀerently because they do not have to**  
# contend with being printed small.  
**A significant diﬀerence, for example, might be display**  
# faces with removed “ink traps” \(indents in and around the corners of the letter strokes\),  
# which may be used with typefaces to compensate for overinking when printed to retain  
# the letterform’s integrity. Using a display face at smaller sizes will mean running the risk  
# of overinking at the printing stage and thus changing the letter-form’s appearance. In  
# addition, many display typefaces appear only in uppercase and have a narrower character  
# set.  
# PD  
37 **DO use real handwriting for convincing**  
# handwritten text  
# Organic design that showcases the unique handwork of the designer is something  
# magical. It is one of the very few instances in which only you can provide a specific  
# solution for the client in question. This appeal has led to a proliferation of fake  
# handwritten typefaces. They look like a perfect solution, or at least a quick fix, when seen  
# in a catalog or on a website, yet in practice, they are far less convincing. The key to  
# handwritten type is that it is one of a kind. You know what’s not one of a kind? A  
# font that  
# anyone can have for a couple of dollars, or worse, freeware that is the hacked-together  
# scribbles of a first-time fontographer. What’s the harm, you say? Well, just look at a word  
# with the letter e in it three times and see how it compares to the nuances in your own  
# handwriting. Your e never quite looks the same. The font never changes.  
# And everyone  
**knows the diﬀerence.**  
# JF  
38 **DO use ligatures if your choice of**  
# typeface accommodates them correctly  
# To enhance your typographic skills and to improve your work, the employment of  
# ligatures should be a consideration when setting large volumes of text. This is not law by  
# any means, but could be a benefit to the reader and your work. When characters share a  
# common design feature, they could be replaced by a single character, a ligature. \(For  
# example, an f followed by an i replaced by fi.\) Ligatures enhance the reading experience  
# by improving legibility and also help to make the typesetting more attractive. Not all  
# typefaces possess ligatures, but many serif families do. Some OpenType families may  
# have additional, “discretionary” ligatures, which can include other character pairs, such  
39 **as ct, st, and cp. When considering a typeface, check what is available within the**  
# character set, and compare this against other families to determine which gives you the  
# most options.  
# PD  
40 **DON’T slope a roman font to create an**  
# italic font  
# I’m always amazed when a designer takes a word and, having set it in a roman cut of a  
# typeface, then forces it to be italic by sloping it at an angle using their design software.  
# This, of course, is not a true italic but merely a word leaning over.  
# A giveaway for spotting  
# this is the fact that few lowercase italics possess a double-story a.  
# Although true italics  
# retain many of the core typeface’s design principles, they also include changes to each  
# letter’s strokes. When a character is forced to tilt, however, it displays none of these  
# alterations. With italics, a more hand-drawn, cursive approach is evident, and some of  
# the characters link together and more ligatures are incorporated into the cut. There is no  
# need to slope; with the wealth of typefaces available, a good typeface family will contain  
# italic styles of most, if not all, roman weights.  
# PD  
41 **DON’T falsely darken fonts to create bold**  
# weights  
# Just as you shouldn’t slope a roman typeface to make it appear italic \(because it isn’t true  
# to the typeface’s design\), lighter weights shouldn’t be adjusted to make them appear  
# bolder. Not only is this unnecessary \(just pick a typeface that has a variety of weights  
# instead\), it also increases the size of the letterform by placing a border around it, which  
# knocks it out of alignment with the rest of the text on the baseline, x-height, and cap-  
# height rules. Distorting the design of the letterform means it loses its inherent  
# personality—you will find that the counters \(the enclosed or partially enclosed circular or  
# curved negative space \[white space\] of some letters\) and serifs quickly fill in and become  
# bloated in appearance. Desktop publishing and illustration packages do allow you to  
# apply a stroke around words, but it is a rather lazy approach and, for the reasons  
# described above, is poor design practice. There are stylistic exceptions to the rule, such  
# as when applying outlines to headlines or titles, but for text matter, use a bold variant and  
# don’t falsely mimic a bold font.  
# PD  
42 **DO reward typefaces that work well as**  
# body copy with long-term commitments  
# When you first start out as a professional, you find yourself drawn to numerous  
# relationships, each with certain benefits \(and drawbacks\). Some may be mentoring  
**alliances, oﬀering long-term benefits, while others carry the thrill of a whirlwind**  
# romance.  
# As we mature, we find ourselves drawn to relationships that provide stability  
# and reliability. Someone who shows up on time and always pays their bill at the bar. Later  
# still, we notice that some people not only are the anchors in our stormy seas but also  
# strive to make us look better than we actually are and oftentimes succeed. It may not  
# have the rush of the new romance, but it is far more fulfilling. If we have any sense  
# whatsoever, we marry these people \(professionally or otherwise\). You do know we are  
# talking about typefaces, right?  
# JF  
43 **DON’T buy into the twelve- good-**  
# typefaces theory  
# The great designer Massimo Vignelli was arguably the most prominent champion of the  
# theory that you only need twelve good typefaces. Now, I’m a massive fan of Vignelli’s  
# work. He designed the New York subway map and the original iconic American Airlines  
# logo, and his work for Knoll during the 1970s still informs the company’s work to this day.  
# Despite all this, I don’t agree with him on this one. It’s true, to an extent, that we now have  
# so many thousands of typefaces because type design as an industry continues to produce  
# typefaces as commercial products. It’s also true that thousands of those typefaces are  
# pretty awful and practically unusable. However, there are more than twelve good  
# typefaces. The important point to make here is that a typeface choice is about  
# appropriateness as well as the design of the typeface itself. We no longer have to restrict  
# ourselves to the narrow selection that was available to typographers in the past—so why  
# do it? By all means, build a selective catalog of typefaces you favor, but don’t stop at  
# twelve, and never stop searching for perfection.  
# TS  
44 **DO increase a serif font’s italics by .5pt in**  
# body copy  
# Gustave Flaubert said, “Le bon Dieu est dans le détail.” This roughly translates to “God is  
# in the details.” A part of being a good designer is having the ability to think in broad  
# strokes and simultaneously being detail-orientated. In some instances, an italic font is  
# created artificially by simply slanting the roman version. This is a sin. True serif italic  
# fonts are completely unique letter-forms, distinct from the roman version. They may be  
# thinner and smaller optically than their roman companion. The type may be uniformly  
# set as 8pt Garamond with roman and italic words, but the italics may look smaller. You  
# can ignore this and state that you are a purist, and all type should be left to their original  
# size, but that would be lazy.  
# A good option to solve this optical problem is to increase the  
# serif italic copy by .5pt. In headline situations, the size adjustment should be explored  
# optically. The fine details in the craft of typography help a project transcend the ordinary  
# to become spectacular.  
# SA  
45 **DO optically adjust point sizes in mixed-**  
# serif and sans-serif body copy  
# Similar to the optical issues of roman and italic serif fonts, mixing sans-serif typefaces  
# with serif typefaces requires optical adjustments. Serif fonts have changing thick and  
# thin stroke weights in each character. Their overall proportion is meant to work well as  
# body copy. Sans-serif fonts have fairly consistent stroke weights within each character.  
# Their x-height is often slightly larger than a serif font. If using a mixture of sans-serif and  
# serif fonts within the same headline, or body text, adjust the size of the sans serif to  
# optically match the serif. This usually requires a slight reduction in the size of the sans-  
# serif font. If ignored, the viewer will read the copy and see the optically larger sans-serif  
# words as shouting over the other copy. It is rare that this is the author’s intent unless the  
# text is accusatory and angry.  
# SA  
46 **DO use oldstyle figures with U&**  
# typography  
# L  
# Years ago, a designer received typewritten pages from a client.  
# A typesetter took these  
# pages and set the copy. Good typesetters were masters of fine detail. Today, designers  
# have taken on the task of typesetting, and the responsibility to maintain the same high  
# standards of quality has changed hands.  
# Oldstyle figures, also called expert figures, are  
# these\: 0123456789.  
# Aligning figures are these\: 0123456789.  
# Oldstyle figures are similar to  
# uppercase and lowercase letters. They have ascenders and descenders. This allows the  
# text to look uniform.  
# A date set within the body copy 12/23/2017 will read as uppercase  
# and lowercase letters.  
# Alternatively, a date set with aligning characters, 12/23/2017, will  
# look like a line of capital letters.  
# Oldstyle figures also exist in italic form, and as with italic  
# text, a slight size adjustment may be necessary. Some typefaces, such as Century  
# Expanded, do not have accompanying oldstyle figures, indicating that the designer, such  
# as Morris Fuller Benton, designed the font without them.  
# SA  
47 **DO use aligning figures with all caps**  
**When we read, we look at individual characters, and reading becomes diﬃcult when the**  
# characters are too similar. Imagine reading War and Peace typeset entirely in Helvetica.  
# Reading is also interrupted when there is an abrupt change of shape.

# traditionally rejected classical forms and only included aligning figures, although recent  
# typefaces such as Joanna Sans Nova, designed by Terrance Weinzierl for Monotype, do  
# feature oldstyle figures.  
# A common typographic error is to use oldstyle figures alongside  
# all capital letters as a headline. In the hopes of creating a design that is classic and  
# traditional, a designer may be tempted to use the seemingly more formal oldstyle figures.  
# This creates a disjointed reading experience. Reading a line of all capital letters  
# inexplicably switches to uppercase and lowercase characters. Do not be tempted by this  
**aﬀectation. It may look “fancy,” but it is only incorrect.**  
# SA  
48 **DON’T use horizontal or vertical scaling**  
# to distort fonts  
# Don’t be surprised if there’s a gasp of horror and a shake of the head anytime someone  
# asks if this is an acceptable treatment of type.  
# As one of the most universally accepted  
# “bad practices” in typography, it is still common among inexperienced graphic designers  
# and typographers. Distorting the type in such a way plays havoc with the balance of the  
# typeface’s structure and creates unusual and awkward stroke widths in the characters. In  
# short, it just looks awful!  
# fter the typeface designer and/or foundry have spent so much  
# time and skill creating a beautifully weighted, consistent font family, stretching or  
# squeezing it to “improve” it shows a serious lack of respect! If you do wish for a typeface  
# with a wider character width or a typeface that is compressed with a large cap height,  
# then there are plenty of extended and condensed \(sometimes called compressed\)  
# typefaces available.  
# PD  
# A  
49 **DON’T stroke your type so that it**  
# destroys the integrity of the letterforms  
# Look, everyone enjoys a little stroke now and again, but let’s not get carried away. If the  
# stroking becomes too heavy, you can barely recognize the form being smothered with  
# such heavy attention. Innuendos aside, there are few times when stroking a typeface can  
# be justified \(production needs and trapping notwithstanding\). When a little fat-tening is  
# absolutely necessary, it is important to truly consider what you’re hoping to accomplish.  
# If you’re applying more than a point of stroke, there is a good chance that you’re forcing  
# the letterforms to do things they were never designed to do. Should you look closer, you  
# will likely find that you have created some odd jags and such as well. If you really must  
# have your type carrying such heft, perhaps try a bolder font.  
# A  
# fter all, what’s the point in  
# using a typeface if it is no longer recognizable?  
# JF  
50 **DON’T ruin a typeface with a filter eﬀect**  
# The computer allows us to stretch, squeeze, slant, and warp type. There are a multitude  
# of filters that open the door for this abuse. You may argue that this activity is acceptable  
# because filters exist.  
# Cars can be driven into trees, but that doesn’t mean they should be.  
# If you consider type as being made of the hardest substance in the universe, your life will  
# be better. Type is not rubber. It is not soft clay.  
# Claude Garamond did not spend decades  
**cutting Garamond, only to have it inflated and distorted. If you need a specific eﬀect for a**  
# project, find a typeface that has the desired attributes. Rather than warping a typeface to  
# create something taller, find a well-drawn condensed font. It is the mark of a poor  
**designer to rely on filters and special eﬀects.**  
# A good, solid idea will not require the Ocean  
# Glass Ripple filter for the headline. Simple, clear, and beautifully crafted elements create  
# good solutions.  
**Adding filters and eﬀects to create interest is comparable to pouring**  
# ketchup over a perfectly grilled steak.  
# SA  
51 **DO learn how to customize type**  
# successfully  
# Not to be confused with a “custom typeface,” which is a face designed from the ground up  
# for a specific use or client, there are two situations in which one might refer to type as  
# customized.  
# One situation would be when a designer has taken an existing letterform and  
# redrawn it slightly by extending the serifs, by adding a swash, by removing part of a bowl,  
# and so on. It’s quite common for logo-design specialists, for example, to customize a  
# typeface in this way in order to set it apart from the original and to create a unique font  
# for their client’s identity. When this is done well and when the concept behind the editing  
# is supportive of the rationale for the changes, highly successful results can be achieved.  
# The other \(less desirable\) option might be to take an existing typeface and alter its  
**personality by applying a filter eﬀect, something we discourage on page 50. Especially in**  
# the latter case, always try to honor the character of a typeface when you attempt any  
# customization in order to retain the qualities conceived by the face’s original designer.  
# TS  
52 **DON’T reverse 6pt text out of a black**  
# background  
# One of the goals of most clients is to create solutions that communicate. In order to  
# communicate clearly, it is necessary to be able to read the copy. While small, delicate  
# typography in white looks wonderful on the screen, most of us need to enlarge the view to  
# 200 percent to read it.  
# A computer-screen image is made of light. Light passes through  
# the monitor onto our optical nerves. The result is a glowing and bright white on a solid  
# black surface.  
**Printed matter is diﬀerent. Light bounces oﬀ the surface of a printed**  
# object. The white copy will never be as bright as a screen, and the black solid will never be  
# as dense and consistent. Reversing small type sizes out of black does not work. It is easier  
# to read black copy on a white background. In printed work, a solid black background  
# requires heavy ink coverage. Smaller type will begin to “fill in” as the coverage is denser.  
# The only available option will be to decrease ink coverage, resulting in a thin and light  
**black. The solution is to maintain a size and weight that will not be adversely aﬀected.**  
# SA  
53 **DO specify at least one plate as 100**  
# percent tint for colored type  
# One of the negative aspects of the digital age is the lack of understanding of the physical  
# world. When designing on the computer, everything looks perfect. The colors are solid;  
# the lines are precise. The type created with 58 percent cyan and 12 percent magenta  
# looks like a nice blue. The printouts that are shown to the client look fine, and we explain  
**that the colors may be slightly diﬀerent when actually printed. Then tragedy strikes.**  
# On  
# press, the type is soft and blurry. The printer adds more ink, and the problem is  
# exacerbated. Hopefully, the type will become sharper when the press sheets dry.  
# But it  
# doesn’t. Why did this happen? Because when the type is created with percentages of cyan  
# and magenta, a halftone screen is created. Halftone screens are made up of tiny dots.  
# Hence, the letterforms are made of tiny dots and will always be soft. The solution is to  
# always use one process color at 100 percent value.  
# One plate will be clean line art, with no  
# halftone dots, and your type will therefore be sharp and refined.  
# SA  
54 **DON’T use excessive leading in body**  
# copy  
# Let’s begin with the basics. Leading is the space between lines of text. The name comes  
# from the actual strips of lead that were used to separate text rows when metal type was  
# set by hand.  
# Appropriate leading allows us to read clearly. Too little leading will make  
# copy too dense and hard to read, as if someone were mumbling. Too much leading and the  
# copy will be too open and hard to read. There will be too much space between the lines,  
# and it will read as if someone were speaking with long pauses in the middle of a sentence.  
# At the end of each line, the reader will need to stop, go get a glass of water, and then start  
# the next line. Traditionally, type exists to be read. It is not meant to occupy space as a  
55 **funny compositional element that serves no other purpose. Excessive leading may be**  
# “interesting” visually, but it is unreadable.  
# And, in the end, making typography  
# unreadable is passive-aggressive behavior toward the reader.  
# SA  
56 **DON’T use CAPS for long passages of**  
# body copy  
# We’ve already discussed on page 22 the importance of keeping the typography simple in  
# order to ensure the legibility of long passages of text. However, with even just the one  
**typeface employed, it’s still easy to create diﬃculties for the reader by setting all the text**  
# in capital letters \(or uppercase\) throughout. It’s universally recognized \(and much  
# research has been done on the subject\) that mixed lowercase and uppercase blocks of text  
# are easier to read than all uppercase. This is primarily due to the fact that, although  
# uppercase text appears larger when set at the same size, it has no ascenders or  
# descenders.  
# As such, the lowercase letters have more variation in their appearance and  
# are therefore easier to recognize, speeding up the process of reading.  
# Another key point is  
# that use of uppercase can come across as aggressive and give the impression that the  
# author is shouting at you. Mixing cases for the bulk of the text creates a gentler, more  
# moderate tone and helps give the occasional use of capitals greater impact.  
# PD  
57 **DON’T have excessive amounts of**  
# reversed-out text  
58 **There are few truths as self-evident as the fact that black text on a white background is**  
# the easiest way for the eye to digest information and communicate it back to our brain.  
# What we do with it after that is up to the individual, but the first part is true for most  
# everyone. Thousands of years of writing, and no shortage of academic and scientific  
# study, have proved this. Given that most texts are presented as such, for this very reason,  
# reversing the course can have a huge impact. You still retain contrast, yet reversed-out  
**text grabs your attention just by being diﬀerent. It’s like a feathered hat. Few people are**  
# wearing them, so everyone notices.  
# But you know what will burn your retinas? A  
# feathered skirt, blazer, and boots combo. That only works on Big Bird. The same is true  
# for reversed-out text.  
**Anything more than just a little is diﬃcult to enjoy.**  
# JF  
59 **DON’T overstyle headings**  
# In the design a book, for instance, the purpose of the headings and subheadings is not  
# only to separate and order the text but also to aid in navigation.  
# Over the course of  
# hundreds of pages, it is vital that the reader is able to find, with ease, the section or  
# subsection they wish to read. It is, therefore, important that headings remain stylistically  
# consistent throughout. It’s tempting, with so many styling variables at our disposal, to  
# start applying treatments to headers until we end up with a hodgepodge of typographic  
# applications. Keep it simple and concentrate more on balancing the size of the headings  
**with the size of the body text to get a clear hierarchy among the diﬀerent heading levels**  
**and a visual connection between those levels. Using a secondary typeface that diﬀers**  
# from the body text is also fine, but remember to practice restraint at all times; by doing so,  
# your designs will be cleaner and more professional.  
# PD  
60 **DON’T add two spaces after a full stop**  
# Ever since the introduction of movable type, the correct amount of space following a full  
# stop has been a source of debate. Type set by hand utilized variously sized “spacers”  
# depending on the chosen font, and it was down to the compositor to decide what looked  
# right. The introduction of the typewriter in the late nineteenth century changed all this  
# because the type was monospaced, with each letter allocated the same character width.  
# A  
**single space after a full stop was deemed insuﬃcient, so the practice of double-spacing**  
# was taught widely, with hot-metal Linotype operators adopting the convention alongside  
# regular typing-pool employees. Nowadays, modern digital fonts contain proportional  
# kerning pairs, and a slightly wider space is always added after a full stop, so a double  
# space is no longer required. It’s ultimately up to the typographer, but the convention is\:  
# always add a single space after a full stop.  
# TS  
61 **DO apply an indent to the beginning of**  
# each new paragraph of body copy  
# Large amounts of body copy will typically be divided into paragraphs, which are made up  
# of multiple sentences that ease the reading process and create pauses for the reader.  
# When a new paragraph begins, it will start on a new line, and there are rules regarding  
# how this new paragraph should be presented. If there is no clear line break preceding the  
# new paragraph, then the first line of the new paragraph should be indented to signify that  
# a new paragraph starts. You should never indent and have a line break, as the two  
**treatments are in eﬀect a duplication of each other. You only need to signify it once.**  
# However, there are exemptions from indenting\: never the first paragraph and never after  
# a heading or subheading.  
# PD  
62 **DON’T indent a paragraph that follows a**  
# heading or paragraph break  
# As explained on page 59, when setting large amounts of body copy, it will be structured as  
# paragraphs; a styling has to be applied to create paragraphs that signify pauses for the  
# reader. It may be that you decide to include line breaks between each paragraph so that  
# they are clearly separated. This approach would probably be used more in literature or  
# promotional print items than in other types of publishing such as newspapers because, in  
# the latter, space is at a premium.  
# Be aware that this approach breaks up the flow when  
# reading and is a bit too stop and start. If you are employing line breaks, you should never  
# indent—the two treatments fulfill the same function. Likewise, if a heading precedes the  
# start of a new paragraph, there is no need to indent.  
# PD  
63 **DON’T indent a paragraph that starts at**  
# the top of a column or page \(unless  
# house style says otherwise\)  
# The rules governing the indentation of paragraphs are invariably linked to either a  
# publisher’s house style or style rules in corporate guidelines, so a degree of flexibility is  
# important. That said, it is essential to be consistent when setting the text, particularly  
# where a new paragraph begins at the top of a column or page. In the books I have  
# designed, body text is indented when a new paragraph begins at the top of a column or  
# page. In corporate literature, however, I find that, because the page grid will often have  
# more columns of text per page, it’s cleaner not to indent at the top of a column. Discuss  
# with the client whether there are any house styles before you begin, as the decision may  
# have already been made for you.  
# PD  
64 **DO set the first few words of a sentence**  
# following a drop cap in small caps  
# Think of this in the same way you might a foyer in a house, or better yet, a hallway or  
# atrium before you enter a huge performance space. The heart of the space still lies ahead,  
# where you will spend hours digesting a barrage of information, unless it is a night at the  
# opera, when you might just catch up on some sleep—but that is another book altogether.  
# Outside the arena, there are blaring and bold signs welcoming you in. Those are the drop  
# caps in our typographic world.  
# Once we are settled in our rows, the body copy is getting  
# ready to take the stage—the meat of the evening. What is needed is a visual transition  
# from the huge drop cap to the workmanlike body copy. Enter the sensible small cap to  
# walk us to our seat.  
# JF  
65 **DON’T use tabs to create indents**  
# Tabs exist to position text at specific measurements within a line length. They are useful  
# when creating tables of information. Tabs should not be used to create indents. Indents  
# move the text inward from the left or right edge of the line length. Indents should be used,  
# oddly, to create indents.  
# Once the first line indent of a paragraph is set, each subsequent  
# paragraph can follow the same measurement. If a tab is used to do this, the designer will  
# need to insert a tab space manually. When multiple paragraphs need indents, this manual  
# approach may lead to errors.  
# A tab might be forgotten. The tab measurement may be set  
# incorrectly. If there are copy revisions—and there always are copy revisions—a manually  
# set tab may move and end up in the middle of a line.  
# A  
# first-line indent is the correct  
**approach. This will not aﬀect any copy changes, and the manual input of individual tabs**  
# is not necessary.  
# SA  
66 **DO hang lines of text from a tab in a**  
# bulleted list  
# A solid swath of body copy is like a team\: to be successful, it needs everyone to fully  
# understand and perform their roles. When someone starts to go rogue and do their own  
# thing, it weakens the whole operation. Each piece has a job, with specific functions, and  
# with good reason. When you have a bulleted list, one must understand each role  
# thoroughly; then all of the decisions that follow are easy. You have a title or main head  
# that deserves some attention on its own. This means that it starts on the left to grab your  
# eye immediately. You might have some intro copy. Not as important, but still needs your  
# attention, so it starts on the left. Then you have the tabbed copy, indented to show that it  
67 **is a subsection. The copy with each tab is a self-suﬃcient little burst and belongs**  
# together as a single notion. So why would you let it slip over to the left on the next line?  
# It’s not a header or body copy. It’s a tab and proud of it.  
# JF  
68 **DO learn the diﬀerence between a**  
# typeface and a font  
# Designers regularly refer to typefaces and fonts as the same thing, but there’s an  
**important, albeit subtle, terminological diﬀerence.**  
# A typeface is a set of characters that is  
# independent of an individual point size but shares other characteristics such as the  
# width of its strokes, the style of its serifs, indeed whether it is serif or a sans serif, and so  
# on. Given this, you can say that Neue Haas Grotesk Text Bold \(used for the headlines on  
# each page in this book\) is a typeface.  
# A  
# font, on the other hand, is all the characters,  
# including numerals, punctuation, glyphs, and so on, for a typeface at one specific point  
# size. Therefore, 80pt Archer Bold is a font. It’s a simple distinction but one worth  
# knowing, especially if you have a tendency toward type geekiness. This rule is applied  
# less rigidly now that OpenType is the established font format because a single OpenType  
# file contains all point sizes of a particular weight or style, making the term more  
# interchangeable. However, it is still useful to observe the distinction when discussing  
# typographic specifications for a project.  
# TS  
69 **DON’T confuse x-height with cap height**  
# It’s a very important rule to remember, and, once learned, the definitions of each will stay  
# with you forever. To clarify, the x-height of a typeface starts from the baseline, on which  
# all the characters sit, and reaches up to the height of the lowercase letters \(not including  
**their ascenders and descenders\). To see how diﬀering typefaces have a range of x-heights,**  
**create a line of type, duplicate it, change the font, overlay it, and examine the diﬀerences.**  
# The ascenders and descenders on letters with small x-heights will look more  
# pronounced. Larger x-heights will make the text look heavier and more solid, so an  
# increase in the leading may be required to compensate. The cap height simply refers to  
# the height of the capital letters from the baseline to the top.  
# Be aware that rounded  
# uppercase letters sit above the cap height and below the baseline, so this measurement  
# doesn’t apply to them. Their additional size is called an overshoot.  
# PD  
70 **DO consider a font’s x-height when**  
# specifying leading  
# When I select which typeface I’m going to use for a new project, I like to start by setting  
**blocks of 9pt body text with 12pt leading to see how my various choices look. The 9/12 text**  
# setting isn’t an arbitrary choice but rather a rough average of the values one might choose  
# for the point size and leading of body text.  
# One of the first things I tend to note is the  
# variation in the x-height between my font choices, partly because the x-height  
# contributes largely to the feel of the setting but also because it influences the leading  
# required for comfortable line-by-line scanning.  
# A  
# font with a large x-height \(for example,  
# Helvetica\) will likely need a little more leading \(or a reduction in point size\) than a  
# smaller x-height \(for example, Centaur\) would require, and this needs to be taken into  
# account when planning your layout and grid. You should also take the height and depth of  
# the ascenders and descenders into account when specifying line feed.  
# TS  
71 **DO learn what leading means and what it**  
# does  
# Leading is a term derived from the early days of typesetting, and it is one of the most  
# important things to understand in becoming a competent designer. You may also hear  
# this called line feed, but that is usually from people who don’t fully grasp leading. The  
# term comes from when typesetters would use strips of lead to create specific space  
# between lines of metal type. The way it is applied in the modern era is much more varied  
# and powerful.  
# Based on a premise of using 120 percent of the size of the type being  
# displayed, the default setting for most programs works fairly well.  
# But this is an area with  
# which the designer can instantly create a response from the viewer interacting with the  
# layout \(feeling tense and claustrophobic as I tighten the paragraph leading or airy and  
# loose as I increase it?\) and should be fully explored and understood.  
# JF  
72 **DO keep consistent leading within a**  
# paragraph  
# Now that we know how powerful leading is—and it is incredibly powerful—we have to  
# understand why we can’t abuse it. If you walk down a corridor and it gradually narrows,  
**you will feel pretty uncomfortable by the end; certainly, you are having a diﬀerent**  
# experience than when you started.  
# A corridor that opens up widely by the end creates the  
**reverse eﬀect, but it is just as jarring. The same is true if you tinker with the leading in a**  
# paragraph.  
# By nature, a paragraph is a complete thought and should retain cohesiveness.  
# The viewer has to have the same experience at the beginning as at the end. No matter  
**what the desired eﬀect is, the point is to remain consistent in order to achieve it.**  
# JF  
73 **DO understand paragraph spacing and**  
# use it wisely  
# Paragraphs are formed so that we can digest the information in reasonable blocks. This is  
# a simple idea but one that some designers fail to take into account. With that perspective,  
# the space between paragraphs takes on a heightened importance. There are a number of  
# ways to accomplish getting our eyes to acknowledge that we have finished one paragraph  
# and are starting another, and each one has its benefits and deterrents. The trick is in  
# finding the best solution for your particular project—indents \(or for the true wild child,  
# outdents\) are not as visually clean as a line break with a half-line space, but they do  
# conserve space. Typographers of the past used various creative ways to make this  
# happen, rarely with readable results, but the masters could finesse it at times \(for  
74 **example, symbols marking the space between paragraphs as the body copy continues to**  
# run and run and run—a magazine sidebar mainstay\). If you understand the process, the  
# answers become more evident.  
# JF  
75 **DON’T apply excessive tracking to body**  
# copy  
# The terms tracking and kerning quite often get confused. Kerning is the adjustment of  
# space between individual letter pairs, whereas tracking is the adjustment of letter  
# spacing of entire lines or paragraphs of text. Tracking is a useful feature when setting  
# body text, but it must be used sparingly so as not to cause problems with legibility. Too  
# much negative tracking and a sentence or paragraph will appear dense compared with  
# the rest of the text. Too much positive tracking and the text will look too airy, blurring the  
**distinction between letters and words and making it diﬃcult to read. The benefits of**  
# tracking are that you can apply it to entire paragraphs, to a single line, or to a single word,  
# and this can enable you to pull back widows and orphans and tidy up awkward line  
# breaks.  
# As a rule of thumb, when using a software package like Adobe InDesign, I would  
# never go past  
# +  
# /–25 on the outside.  
# PD  
76 **DO always kern unsightly character**  
# combinations  
# Quite often, although the typeface you have chosen may be working well, the spacing  
# between some of the letters may look uneven. This is a very common aspect of  
# typography that designers deal with on a day-to-day basis; to compensate, you need to  
# kern the letters. When setting uppercase text, the issues are more evident, as is the case  
# with letters such as T, V, and W, which force the subsequent letter to sit some distance  
# away. When creating their fonts, typeface designers do consider many of the letters that  
# sit awkwardly together \(for example, Kn, To, Ve, Wi\) and create kerning pairs to eliminate  
# the spacing issues. More often than not, however, it’s up to you to adjust and eliminate the  
# unsightly spacing. To do so, simply decrease \(or increase\) the kerning between the  
# characters to improve balance and create an appearance of even spacing in relation to the  
# rest of the word.  
# PD  
77 **DO always kern headlines manually**  
# The familiar adage “The bigger they are, the harder they fall” can be applied to type too.  
# Design software and kerning pairs work in tandem to control the character spacing of all  
# type, and at point sizes below 14pt it’s hardly ever necessary to apply any manual kerning.  
# That’s fortunate—imagine the amount of work that would be needed to sort all that out.  
# However, as point sizes increase for crossheads and headlines, the character spacing  
# becomes more visible, and some attention is often required.  
# Problem pairs can involve,  
# but aren’t limited to, any characters that don’t have vertical stems at the side, so A, K, T,  
# V, W, and Y are common culprits. In reality, any number of character pairs in both  
# uppercase and lowercase may need some manual kerning—depending on the typeface.  
# When you’re searching for potential kerning problems, try squinting at the setting—it  
# helps in making the awkward white spaces between characters more prominent.  
# TS  
78 **DON’T use negative letter spacing**  
# If you’ve ever tried to squeeze too many people onto a sofa at a party, then you know what  
# we’re talking about with negative letter spacing. This doesn’t mean that you can’t nuzzle  
# together to get the job done on occasion; some tracking work to pull up an orphan up here  
# and there might be required. What we are talking about is the tightening together of  
# letterforms to the point that they are uncomfortable or right on top of one another. They  
# weren’t designed to work that way, much in the same manner that too many people  
**crammed on a couch or sitting on our lap is suﬀocating.**  
# JF  
79 **DON’T exceed eighty characters per line**  
# For the sake of readability, the designer should ensure that the measure \(or line length\)  
# isn’t too long. Very long lines can mean that the reader may lose their place midsentence  
# or when shifting their eyes to the start of the following line—a frustrating experience if  
# you have a whole book ahead of you!  
# A way of getting around this is to check the character  
# count in an individual line.  
# A generally accepted standard is around 45–75 characters per  
# line. In a pinch, you can go up to 80, but this depends on the typeface chosen.  
# On the flip  
# side, a very short measure means that the reader’s eyes will be continually zipping back  
# and forth, ensuring a disagreeable reading experience. Working within or close to the  
# limits will help to improve your design.  
# PD  
80 **DO set the second line of a paragraph**  
# longer than the first  
# Once we start walking, we definitely appreciate some forward progress.  
# Any step that has  
# to be retraced, even if it’s a half-step pause, is wasted motion. When we read, that same  
# quality takes over, and once we get going, it’s hard to stop us on our stroll toward  
# comprehension. That is why we like to have the second line of a paragraph set longer than  
# the first. The indented white space, if it is shorter, gives us pause.  
# Creating this is a  
# combination of selective line breaks and tracking as needed. Ragging our copy is an art  
# form in its own right. It is important to note that this should not take precedence over  
# other hard rules of typography \(don’t end the second line with a dangling “a” or “it” or  
# track out  
# +  
# 60 just to make it happen\), but it should be attempted wherever possible.  
# JF  
81 **DO set the penultimate line of a**  
# paragraph longer than the last  
# As we have already discussed, the paragraph is a construct of writers; it doesn’t actually  
# occur naturally like a sentence \(which is a full thought as if uttered in conversation\).  
# Paragraphs are there so that we can digest information easily. Thus, we have come up  
# with numerous tools to let the reader know exactly when a paragraph is ending and  
# another one is starting. In order for these to work, one of the most important aspects is  
# that the last line of set type be shorter than the line before it, creating a bit of white space  
# to alert the eye to a change.  
# A simple meal is structured in much the same way\: appetizer  
# \(slightly shorter first line\), entrée \(slightly longer second line, going into the body of the  
# paragraph\), and the dessert \(shorter final line\). If the dessert is larger than the entrée, you  
# have no idea what kind of meal you have just eaten or if it is over.  
# JF  
82 **DON’T allow a line to break on the words**  
# it or is  
# This is one of those rules that really showcases those who are the true masters of  
# paragraph ragging. You won’t find it in any manual or stated as a hard-and-fast rule in a  
# textbook, but if you work with savvy folks who have been in the trenches of publication  
# design, this is often one of the first tips that they pass on. When working with a justified  
# paragraph, it is harder to accomplish, but when you have one flushed left or right, you  
**should be willing to rework a paragraph seven diﬀerent ways to make it happen. Why do**  
# we care so much? Because finishing a line as such leaves a massive hanging thought and  
# causes an awkward pause in our comprehension. The easiest practice is simply to read  
# the text aloud.  
# Once you do that, you will never let a line end in it or is again. We would  
# never talk that way; why should we force ourselves to read that way?  
# JF  
83 **DON’T hyphenate words of less than**  
# seven characters  
# Many designers are happy to hyphenate shorter words, but for me the minimum  
# acceptable number of characters a word should contain before it can be hyphenated is  
# seven. This in turn means a minimum of four characters before a hyphen and no fewer  
# than three characters following a hyphenated line break. These parameters can be set in  
# a paragraph style sheet at the beginning of a project to ensure the consistency of all body  
# copy \(see page 82\). Why seven? It’s partly a visual thing, as I don’t believe two characters  
# followed by a hyphen look that great, but it’s also an editorial consideration, as I don’t  
# think a word of five characters or less reads cleanly when it’s hyphenated. Experienced  
# readers store words as shapes to speed up the reading process, and seeing the first few  
# characters of a word helps us to fill in the rest before scanning the start of the next line. If  
# you have only one or two characters to work with, this process won’t happen.  
# TS  
84 **DON’T mix centered and flush-left or**  
# flush-right text  
# For hundreds of years, typographic layouts used a largely symmetrical, centered  
# approach. Headlines, subheads, and body text were centered or justified. Symmetrical  
# typography was a product of available technology and the printing press. In the 1920s,  
# Jan Tschichold championed asymmetrical typography. His frustration with the complex  
# and illegible Victorian and Gothic German forms led him to a system of sans-serif fonts,  
# more negative space, and asymmetric typography. He considered asymmetry to be more  
# legible, vibrant, and powerful. This does not make centered typography wrong. It is  
# entirely appropriate in certain contexts. Mixing centered and flush-left or flush-right  
# text, however, is wrong. It is similar to mixing a simple white T-shirt with red velvet  
# pantaloons. It’s not pretty, and it looks foolish.  
# As in most things in life, maintaining  
# consistency creates clarity.  
# A consistent centered layout tells the viewer how and where  
# to look for information. The same is true for an asymmetric layout. Mixing the two  
# creates confusion and chaos.  
# SA  
85 **DON’T use justified text over a short**  
# measure  
# If a designer has several years of experience refining the word spacing and kerning of  
# justified paragraphs, then justifying a short line is okay. For those with less than a decade  
# of experience, this is a bad idea. Justified type requires a minimum number of characters.  
# Too few characters, and the word spacing will become enormous. Large word spacing  
**will create “rivers” of negative space within a paragraph and make reading more diﬃcult.**  
# The underlying logic of good typography should be invisible while facilitating reading  
# and understanding.  
**Creating a justified line length that feels eﬀortless is the correct**  
# solution to good typography. Typography stops being invisible when we are faced with  
# discrepancies, such as unexpectedly large word spaces. When justifying text, a good rule  
86 **of thumb with line-length measures is to use no more than eighty characters and no**  
# fewer than twenty-six characters.  
# But the best approach is to set the text with a line  
# measure that has an optically consistent amount of word and letter spacing.  
# SA  
87 **DO check justification settings for**  
# justified text  
# The desktop publishing programs InDesign and QuarkXPress both provide the means to  
# apply manual settings for justification. The settings are only applicable to justified text,  
# as ragged text uses the optimum letter and word spacing built into a font. If you opt for  
# justified alignment and the word spacing at your chosen font size looks too gappy or too  
# tight, the justification settings will help fix things.  
# A value of 100 percent for word  
# spacing or 0 percent for letter spacing is equal to “no manual adjustment” in real terms. If  
# you want to close up space, enter a value less than 100 percent for word spacing or -0  
# percent for letter spacing; opening up space requires a value greater than 100 percent for  
# words or  
# +  
# 0 percent for letters; and so on.  
# Play around with a paragraph of dummy copy  
**to see how diﬀerent values reflow the text—it’s the best way to learn how the**  
# functionality works. My tip would be to concentrate on the minimum and maximum  
# word spacing, leaving the desired setting at the optimum 100 percent, and always leave  
# the letter spacing set to 0 percent.  
# TS  
88 **DO avoid creating “rivers” in justified text**  
# When a text is justified, a distracting visual oddity can often occur\: Spaces between  
# words arrange themselves on top of one another, forming a curving white line running  
# vertically through the paragraph. This is referred to as a “river.” This can appear in flush-  
# left, flush-right, and centered type, but because of the way justified type increases the  
# word spacing by forcing the line of type to the full measure, the chance of creating rivers  
# increases. Rectifying the problem is straight forward. The first step is to introduce  
# hyphenation into the setting—this can be done manually if you wish to reduce the  
89 **number of hyphens that appear, or it can be set up automatically in your desktop**  
# publishing software.  
**Alternatively, you can track some of the aﬀected lines in or out to**  
# compensate, and problem solved!  
# PD  
90 **DON’T allow widows to appear in text**  
# Widows, one of typography’s more unusual terms, occur so often that even some of the  
# most beautifully crafted works, on closer examination, have been marred by their  
**presence. Diﬀerent than orphans, they are single words or lines of text that have been**  
# separated from the rest of the paragraph and are either sitting alone at the top of the  
# following column or pushed over to the opposite page. There, they sit all on their own,  
# away from the rest of their text, creating an unsightly visual anomaly at the top of the  
# column or page. To rectify and rescue the widow, review the column or page from where  
# it has been forced over and track back these lines, which are more open if justified or are  
# shorter if flush left, to eliminate the widow. The end result will be that the bottom of the  
# column or page finishes cleanly with the end of a paragraph, and the next page starts with  
# a new one.  
# PD  
91 **DON’T allow orphans to appear in text**  
# An orphan \(which, in my view, is commonly and mistakenly referred to as a widow—see  
# page 84 for a definition\) can be described as a single word sitting on its own at the end of a  
# paragraph, or it can be the first line of a paragraph on its own at the bottom of a column or  
# page. Visually, it is not very nice to look at, and it hinders the flow of reading. In order to  
# rectify this, either put in some soft returns in the text preceding it, pushing words over to  
# the next line and adding to the single word, or, if there is space, track back certain lines to  
# pull back words and pull the orphan back up to the previous line. The same goes for the  
# single line at the bottom of the column or page, although I would take the view that it is  
# better to push it over than take it back so that the paragraphs have clean breaks between  
# columns or pages.  
# Better still, if you are working directly with an editor, ask them if the  
# text can be edited in order to fix the problem.  
# PD  
92 **DO check that text is not formatted with**  
# “justify all lines” selected  
# There are three ways to set justified text, each of which treats the final line of a paragraph  
**diﬀerently. The usual method is designated “justify with last line aligned left.” This**  
**means any text on the final line of a paragraph will eﬀectively not be justified at all—it**  
# will be ragged left. The character and word spacing probably won’t match that of the lines  
# that appear before it, but that is the nature of justified setting and the reason that  
**creating a pleasing result with justified text is often diﬃcult to achieve. The second**  
# option is “justify with last line centered,” which is never really going to work with  
# running copy. The third option is “justify all lines,” where the final line of a paragraph is  
# set to the full measure regardless of how many words or characters it contains. If a line of  
# copy almost fills a measure, falling short by only an em or so, this option will work  
# perfectly well. Under any other circumstances, it is best to avoid the option altogether.  
# Never choose it as a default setting when building style sheets.  
# TS  
93 **DON’T hyphenate text that is ragged**  
# right\*  
# I have had many a debate on this and, yes, I should “get out more,” but I \(and many others\)  
# see no reason for hyphenation when the body text is ragged right. Yes, line endings should  
# certainly be tidied up, short words taken over, and orphans and widows dealt with.  
# But  
# the natural line breaks that appear with flush-left/right-ragged negate the need to apply  
# hyphenation. It is an additional element that, when added, actually hinders the reading  
# process and doesn’t look very good.  
# PD  
# \* See page 88  
# for exceptions in certain cases \(like this book\).  
94 **DON’T be scared of our useful little**  
# friend, the hyphen  
# I’m not entirely sure why this is the case, but there’s something going on that has turned  
# designers against hyphenating at the end of lines. I’m going to make a bit of a distinction  
**here, as you see hyphens used to good \(and often atrociously bad, I grant you\) eﬀect in**  
# newspapers and magazines all the time, but for some reason, books, corporate brochures,  
# and packaging featuring justified text seem to have become no-go hyphen areas. The flip  
# side of this is that the same books, brochures, and packaging have simultaneously  
# become safe havens for bad word spacing, which really does defeat the purpose entirely.  
# The answer is, if you’re really that scared of using hyphens, don’t justify text, set it ragged.  
# On the subject of ragged text, there’s nothing to stop you from hyphenating that either, if  
# you’re dealing with short measures and long words.  
# And before you say it, yes, I know I’m  
# contradicting the advice just given on page 87  
# . Hang on a minute, the wail of dissent is  
# getting louder and louder. I think I may have taken this argument a bit too far!  
# TS  
95 **DO embrace the use of Web font**  
# embedding services  
# Anyone involved in designing for the Web in the not-so-good old days will remember the  
# frustration of being limited to a narrow selection of Websafe fonts, or, in other words, the  
# fonts installed as a default by Windows or OSX. Today, the choice of fonts a designer can  
# use confidently, knowing a site will appear exactly as intended, is vast thanks to Web font  
# embedding services. Google Fonts is arguably the most widely used service of this kind  
# \(plus it is completely free, which helps explain why\) and features hundreds of good-  
# quality fonts in its directory. Typekit from Adobe is another excellent option; it is  
# included as part of their Creative Cloud subscription, and, as one would expect from  
# Adobe, all fonts in their directory are of professional quality. If you don’t have an Adobe  
**subscription, they also oﬀer a free service, Adobe Edge Web Fonts. Using a font**  
# embedding service is very simple; a JavaScript tag that can be added to the \<head\> of a  
# website is provided for each font. Job done.  
# TS  
96 **DON’T underline text for emphasis**  
# Using an underline, or an underscore, to emphasize a word isn’t a total no-no, but there’s  
# a much better way—use italics. The term underscore derives from the name of the  
# individual character that typists would apply to words by backspacing and retyping an  
# underline, and underscoring for emphasis is a bit of a “typing” thing rather than proper  
# typesetting practice. Italics, particularly when used in running text, present a much more  
# elegant solution and provide the required emphasis without interrupting the flow. This  
# means emphasis is achieved invisibly without jolting the reader’s attention away from  
# the fluid run of the narrative. If you’re designing an application form or diagram, for  
# example, the rule doesn’t apply so much—it’s more appropriate for larger blocks of body  
# copy. There’s another good reason for not using underscores\: online they denote a  
# hyperlink, and any text that will be repurposed from a print project ideally shouldn’t  
# contain any underscores at all.  
# TS  
97 **DO use true typographer’s quotation**  
# marks  
# These are sometimes called smart quotes, which seems a bit over the top, since there  
# aren’t any other kinds of quotes you can use correctly. Whenever you need to highlight a  
# quotation or utilize an apostrophe, please use the proper quotation marks that look like  
# miniature floating pairs of sixes and nines. The marks that don’t have any curly bits are  
# called straight quotes, and they specifically denote feet \(single prime\), inches \(double  
# primes\), minutes \(single prime\), or seconds \(double primes\), so this isn’t just a styling  
# issue. The sixes open a quotation, and the nines close a quotation and double as  
# apostrophes, providing added value at no extra cost, except for my dental bills that is, as  
# seeing primes used incorrectly in place of quotation marks makes me grind my teeth, so  
# spare a thought.

# if you expect to be dealing with financials or some form involving numerical breakdowns,  
# I strongly advise that you start by choosing typefaces that have extensive character sets  
# and, better still, typefaces that include specific characters for fractions. This is a place  
# where taking a shortcut will make for a very awkward piece of typesetting. There are few  
# things as clunky as two numbers separated by a slash, when a proper, tight fraction is  
# available. Think about it in the sense that a fraction takes up the equivalent visual space  
# of a single character, less than if it were a series of full x-height numbers, and you get the  
# idea pretty quickly. Like the proper use of small caps, this treatment instantly indicates  
# to the reader that this is the work of an experienced designer with a sophisticated ability  
# to deal with type.  
# JF  
100 **DO use an en dash to indicate a range of**  
# values  
# The use, or misuse, of en dashes is a common problem we see in the written content we  
# receive.  
# An en dash should be used when numbers or words that denote a range need to  
# be linked together or to signify an open range. For example, 1939–45 and 100–200 BC  
# E  
# are examples of the en dash being used in a closed range. Note that there is no space on  
# either side of the en dash. When typesetting these figures, and if one is using nonaligning  
# numerals, it is worthwhile to kern a little space between the figures and the en dash so  
# that they don’t appear as if they are colliding.  
# An open-ended range would be set as\:  
# 2011–. Words that are communicating a range would look like this\: January–December  
# 2011.  
# PD  
101 **DO use an em dash to indicate a**  
# conversational break  
# Although used as often as its cousin the en dash, the em dash is the correct punctuation  
# mark to insert into a sentence when a conversational break is required. The em dash,  
# being more significant in presence than a comma, provides greater emphasis in setting  
# apart an aside in a sentence.  
# At the same time, it is not as aggressive as a full stop, so the  
# subject and intent of the sentence is carried through. For example, “Despite the  
# disapproval of his friends—they thought he had forsaken his values—Peter decided to use  
# Comic Sans.” In addition, it can be used to signify an emotive interruption into a  
# sentence\: for example, “I can’t believe it’s—,” which works better than a full stop and  
102 **signifies that the speaker is left hanging. Its use seems to be waning, which I think is a**  
# shame. That said, be careful not to overuse the em dash; it can be somewhat  
# overpowering. Everything in moderation.  
# PD  
103 **DO tuck full stops and commas inside**  
# quotation marks only in the United States  
# No one is quite sure when it happened \(maybe it was linked to that little “independence”  
# dustup\), but when British conventions were sent across the Atlantic, a few of them  
# seemed to have fallen overboard, leaving the Yanks to make their own decisions. While  
# Americans have removed the u in colors to reflect their pronunciation, other decisions  
# are more closely linked to modern typesetting. The placement of punctuation in regard to  
# quotation marks was formed at an earlier time, founded on basic needs—namely, that  
# punctuation signaled the end of a sentence. Therefore, of course it fell outside the  
# quotation mark. However, American typesetters noted the awkward space it creates and,  
# as one of many adjustments, experimented with placing punctuation on the inside,  
# creating a tighter space. This was soon adopted as the correct way to position full stops  
# and commas.  
# JF  
104 **DO place full stops and commas outside**  
# quotation marks everywhere but the  
# United States  
# While American typesetters would surely tell you that they have reengineered the fuddy-  
# duddy old-world ways for the better \(and in this case, it is hard to argue against the more  
# appealing visual white space left by tucking the punctuation inside the quotation marks\),  
# that doesn’t necessarily mean that we can expect the thousands of years of the written  
# word to instantly abide by their new rules. The placement of full stops and commas is  
# based on the intended use of the marks, to signal the end of a thought. Following that line  
# of thinking, full stops and commas have to come after all other elements of that segment.  
**While figuring out the diﬀerences in spelling certain words can occupy a lot of your time**  
# when trying to make a layout for audiences in several countries, this variation is the most  
**diﬃcult practice to go back and forth on.**  
# JF  
105 **DO hang quotation marks outside the**  
# paragraph margins  
# In order to achieve a smoothly aligned left edge for a pull quote, it’s best to “hang” the  
# quotation marks. This involves repositioning the opening quotation mark out to the left  
# so that the initial letter of the text is aligned with the initial letter of the subsequent line.  
# It’s a simple task to do; if you are using a software package such as InDesign, there’s a  
# feature under “Story” with a panel window containing a checkbox called “Optical Margin  
# Alignment.” There, you can key in the point size of the text you are using, and it will refine  
# the alignment and hang the punctuation for you. However, I always find that it is never  
# quite enough to key in the exact match of the text size you have styled, so I always key in a  
# size 20–30 percent bigger to ensure a crisper alignment.  
# PD  
106 **DO add a full stop after an ellipsis at the**  
# end of a sentence  
# When an ellipsis is employed within the text, it can be used in a number of ways\:  
# dramatically, to create a pause in the middle of a sentence, or at the end of a sentence,  
# almost as if the writer has faded away, lost in thought. However, a common mistake is to  
# leave the ellipsis at the end of a sentence unfinished. I understand that there was great  
# debate about this in the past, so whether this entry adds fuel to the fire, who knows? In  
# my professional opinion, however, it needs the full stop in order to provide closure to the  
# sentence. The house styles of some publishers may specify the three-dot option \(i.e.,  
# without the full stop\). In the absence of any such instructions, you should go with the  
# four-dot treatment.  
# PD  
107 **Layout & Design**  
108 **DO learn about the golden section**  
# Back when the idea of the printed book was relatively new, type was generally set in a  
# single justified column and placed symmetrically on a spread with the outer margins  
# wider than the inner, and the bottom margin deeper than the top. The proportions  
# assigned to the text area were invariably worked out using a geometric construct, the  
# most highly regarded of these being the golden section. Measurements don’t need to be  
# specific, as the resultant golden rectangle can be drawn without a ruler, using a set square  
# and compass. The only important measurement is the ratio of short to long side, that  
# being 1\:1.  
# 618, which in itself doesn’t really mean anything unless you’re into ratios. This  
# ratio occurs many times in art and architecture, so it was a natural choice for the basis of  
# book layouts. The page’s margins were often worked out using the Fibonacci sequence \(0,  
109 **1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.\), which you can find out about by reading The Da Vinci Code. The**  
# explanation is quite near the start, so, fortunately, you don’t have to read the whole thing.  
# TS  
110 **DON’T be intimidated by a blank page**  
# This is it. Everything you have trained for, all of your dreams and desires, the full  
# realization of your creative potential awaits you. So why are your knees buckled and your  
# hands shaking? It is just a blank page before you, a barren canvas for your skills to shape  
# to your liking \(or even better still, to the client’s liking\). Yet, it stands out as one of the  
# most intimidating forces that a designer can ever face. No guides to go by, no style sheets  
# deciding our typefaces and sizes for us. No corporate color palette already set out. No  
# images already selected for inclusion.  
# All of the decisions have been left up to us, and the  
# pressure has left all parts of our body paralyzed.  
# Pull it together!!! The opportunity for  
# greatness lies before you. You are ready for this. I just know it. Look that blank page  
# square in the eye and announce to the world that you are an incredible designer. Ready.  
# Set. Go!  
# JF  
111 112 **DO triple check your document size**  
# before you start your layout  
# In the three decades I’ve been working as a graphic designer, I’ve heard a number of  
# horror stories about designers having worked with an incorrect document size \(the  
# client, too, has gotten it wrong on occasion!\). It’s discovered at that crucial stage during  
# final approval after months of labor or, worse, when it’s at the printer. This can, of course,  
# be fixed, but it will cause a lot of stress\: the client will be angry, and there could be a cost  
# issue or a missed deadline.  
# Also, the beautiful design that you have worked so hard on will  
# have to be revised hurriedly into shape, which could result in a poor-quality final product.  
113 **Be as certain as possible from the start\: confirm with the client the document size and get**  
# it in writing, either in a contract or confirmed by email, to ensure avoiding such  
# problems.  
# PD  
114 **DO utilize master pages**  
115 **One of the huge advantages of using desktop publishing software, such as InDesign or**  
# QuarkXPress, when laying out large documents is the master pages feature. With master  
# pages, you can preset all the consistent and repetitive elements that would appear on a  
# page \(running head, folios, heading boxes, text boxes, etc.\) to avoid having to re-create  
# them every time you add a page. In addition, any alterations made to the master page will  
# automatically be adjusted on all the pages you are working on, saving hours of labor-  
# intensive activity and ensuring there are no errors.  
# As soon as you drop the master pages  
# onto your “pages” palette window, you can be sure that the elements you need will be  
**there, allowing you to concentrate on the layouts. You can also create diﬀerent masters**  
# for alternative grid designs within the same document and automatically renumber  
# folios if you move spreads around. Even better, controlling your artworks with a “book”  
**file allows you to update master pages between diﬀerent files without even opening them.**  
# Don’t ignore them\: they’ll save you hours of work!  
# PD  
116 117 **DO build visual pace into book and**  
# brochure layouts  
# If your next assignment is a sixteen-page brochure, visual pace won’t be such a big  
# priority, but if you’re designing a 256-page illustrated book, this rule is for you. There are  
# some types of books or brochures \(or websites\) that demand that certain elements  
# appear consistently from one spread to the next. For example, instructional books with  
# illustrated tutorials \(or perhaps books of graphic design rules\) are likely to feature repeat  
# page structures to aid navigation. However, for publications with content that varies  
# throughout, seeing the same size image with the same amount of text and a caption in the  
# same position every time could become very monotonous by the time you get past the  
# first dozen spreads. Try to vary a layout from one spread to the next so images change size  
# and position, thus allowing the flow of the text to meander and interact with the imagery  
118 **in a more random fashion.**  
# Be careful not to lose navigability—the text and images must  
# maintain a cordial relationship—but always build in as much intentional pacing as the  
# material will support.  
# TS  
119 **DO understand how to design with a**  
# modular grid  
# We are going to learn an awful lot about designing with grids during our days doing  
# layouts, but one of the most useful to work in is the modular grid. Like many things the  
# Swiss masters brought into vogue, it is simple yet deceivingly sophisticated and  
# incredibly intelligent. Formed using consistent horizontal divisions from top to bottom,  
# in addition to vertical divisions from left to right, it determines where various elements  
# and blocks of text line up. The result can be very simple, or it can become terribly  
# complex. The joy is that it will hold together through limitless variations. Sticking to the  
# grid will create an invisible sense of balance among all elements on the layout, even if an  
# image runs the width of three columns of a block of text the height of four columns. Even  
# though the lines aren’t visible in the final product, they pull it all together, and the viewer  
# just feels comfortable interacting with your work.  
# JF  
120 **DO break out of the grid if the layout**  
# prescribes it  
121 **Grids are things of wonder to us designers, especially when they go all multicolumn and**  
**modular. Exciting stuﬀ! Like the saying “Behind every great man there stands a great**  
# woman,” behind every great layout there stands a great grid. If not for those grids, our  
# layouts would stay out late, drink too much, and end up lying facedown in a gutter  
# covered with messy typography.  
# But hey, it’s good for a layout to let its hair down every  
# once in a while and give itself a break. Grids provide layouts with a stabilizing influence,  
# but a layout should take its grid out on the town every so often to say thanks for all that  
# good advice. It’s at times like these that the combination of perfect grid and flexible  
# layout can make the grandest of statements. Without them, the life of a layout can  
# become so passé, if you know what I mean.  
# TS  
122 123 124 **DO design books and magazines as**  
# spreads, with facing pages  
125 **Walk into your closet and choose a shirt with a pair of pants you are going to wear later in**  
# the week.  
# Obviously, you are going to want them to look good together. Take just the shirt  
# out and place it on the bed.  
# A  
# few hours later, walk into the closet and find a pair of pants  
# that matches the shirt you wore yesterday. Lay those pants next to the shirt you laid out  
# earlier. You know what doesn’t match? This random, hideous outfit! You would never  
# dress this way, so why would you design a page in printer’s spreads \(already imposed\) or  
# worse, independently? You know that the left- and right-facing pages will be next to one  
# another for the final viewer, so start from that perspective when designing.  
# Always  
# consider what will appear on the opposite side to the page you’re designing.  
# JF  
126 **DO design spreads with crossovers in**  
# mind  
# Now that we have decided to design with our pages facing each other \(as anyone with  
# common sense would\), we have to consider the work that needs to be done after we have  
# finished.  
# Oh, right, the poor printers who have to realize our vision on paper and bind the  
# pages, allowing for pages to be turned and enjoyed. We know that the viewer will  
# experience the pages side by side—as a spread—so we design with that in mind. We also  
# know that the pages aren’t actually organized that way, that except for the center spread,  
# none of the facing pages actually exist that way for the printer \(thus, the designation  
# “printer spreads” for the formation post-imposition\). So we have to remember that  
**letters that cross over from page to page will likely be cut oﬀ and out of alignment, and**  
**images with specific detail may suﬀer the same fate. Some printers are better than others,**  
# but the onus is on us as designers to make it look its best.  
# JF  
127 **DO create a focal point for every layout**  
# In most cases, a layout will contain a piece of information, such as a headline, that should  
# be the first thing the reader looks at. In Western culture, the focal point is normally the  
# top left corner of a page or spread, so it’s no surprise that that is where a heading is  
# usually positioned.  
# Placing it anywhere else will fight against the natural instincts of the  
# reader to look at the top left corner first. If you want to break away from this convention,  
# and it’s good to break the rules sometimes, the focus must be achieved using a visual  
# device such as color, font size, or a strong graphic element.  
# Bear in mind that readers tend  
**to react in a diﬀerent way to text and images. We’re naturally inclined to gather**  
# information about what we’re looking at, and a well-positioned headline will often trump  
# an image in terms of a hierarchy of focus.  
# TS  
128 **DO always have at least one folio**  
# showing per spread  
129 **When you are deep in a design, it can be easy to lose sight of the final viewer. This can**  
**lead to a number of diﬀerent decisions, but one of the easiest to shed is the tiny, harmless**  
# little folio often at the bottom of the page. It’s not really disruptive, but my spread would  
# look so much nicer if it had a clean section of deep color at the bottom left corner.  
# Over  
# here to the right seems to beg to go all white, and, well, can’t we just eliminate them for a  
# spread? Certainly this works in isolation when designing a single spread, but if we give in  
# once, we are sure to do so a few more times before finishing. Now, the viewer doesn’t  
# interact with a single spread. They have the entire thing, possibly well over a hundred  
# pages in their hands, and they would want to know where they are as they flip through.  
# You see what I am hinting at? Folios don’t need to be on every page, but there needs to be  
# at least one on a page of each spread.  
# JF  
130 **DO periodically check a printed laser or**  
# inkjet printout rather than viewing a  
# layout solely on-screen  
# Despite the amazing quality and resolution of modern screens, whether standalone or as  
# part of the computer, there’s nothing better to judge the quality and detailing in your  
# design than viewing it as a printout at actual size. I always insist, when reviewing early  
# stages of a work at my studio, that we do it with laser prints.  
# Only then can we most  
# accurately understand how the design is progressing, check the balance and structure of  
131 **the layouts, the detailing, and the sizing of the typography, and confirm that all the**  
# content required for the page has been included. We still always start a design with paper  
# and pen. When you design on a screen, a majority of the time, your mind is concentrating  
# on the mechanical aspects of using the software rather than the creative aspect of  
# working the layouts.  
**Only printouts will really reveal how eﬀective your design is.**  
# PD  
132 **DO consider how a layout looks at full**  
# size and as a thumbnail online  
133 **I like small type as much as the next guy.**  
# All things being equal, I like it more than the  
# next guy! I love a detailed and nuanced illustration or photo as well, something that truly  
# rewards closer inspection. I have come to realize that there is a time and a place for this  
# type, but often that place is not in commercial products, even if it is a piece of music  
# packaging that is only manufactured in a limited edition of a few hundred—certainly not  
# on a book cover that will sell all around the world or a can of soda that will be produced in  
# the billions. Why, you ask. Why can’t those layouts have little bits of important type?  
# Because more often than not, they appear online, and that means that most consumers  
# will first interact with the design in an already reduced, tiny form.  
# Be sure that it works  
# both on-screen and in person.  
# JF  
134 135 **DO take care to align baselines of type in**  
# adjacent columns  
# You spend hours picking out just the right suit, spending a small fortune. You decide you  
# can save a little bit on the tailoring, so you go to a discount place around the corner. The  
# day of the big event, you hustle back to get dressed only to discover that something looks a  
**bit oﬀ in the mirror.**  
# Could it be that they have hemmed the trouser legs a little higher on  
# one leg than the other? You look at every angle, and it certainly appears so. Nothing  
**major, you think\: who would notice such a thing, anyway? You set oﬀ and soon find**  
# yourself standing outside the dance floor.  
# A very attractive woman comes up and asks if  
# you are “able to dance.” You flash an uneasy smile and reply, “Don’t you mean would I like  
# to dance?” “No,” she says.  
# “I meant are you able? On account of your legs being two  
**diﬀerent lengths.” JF**  
136 137 **DON’T always attempt to align captions**  
# to the same baseline as body copy  
# It’s a common error among inexperienced designers, as they try to get a grip on the rules  
# of using page and baseline grids, to become obsessed with locking everything to grids,  
# including captions. This doesn’t need to be the case.  
# At the start of a project, as you  
# evaluate the content and decide on the styling requirements, you will have to decide  
# which text elements should be locked to the grid.  
# As your body text is larger than the  
# captions, the leading applied to it \(which your baseline grid has been set to\) will be too  
# great for the captions. This will result in them looking aesthetically poor and loose. You  
# can, however, set the first line of the caption to lock to the baseline grid to align it with the  
# top line of the body text. With this done, it’s simply a case of applying an appropriate  
# leading to the caption and letting it hang.  
# PD  
138 **DO use alternative baseline grids within**  
# caption boxes  
# An alternative to the technique outlined on page 122 is to create your own custom  
# baseline grid for captions. This is particularly useful when your page layout has multiple  
# captions \(such as annotation\) spread across the two pages. Desktop publishing software,  
# such as InDesign, allows you to create adjustable baseline grids within the caption boxes,  
# independent from the baseline set on your master pages. This allows you to ensure  
# alignment between captions if the boxes are positioned correctly. It also allows you to  
# create a ratio between the two baseline grids so you can create a proportionate leading  
# between the two text styles. For example, say your page leading is set at 15pt with 10pt  
# body text. Your captions can be set at 10pt leading with 7pt body text, giving a multiple of  
# three lines for every two from the master baseline grid. If you align the first line of your  
# caption text with any line of the body text, your typography will look so much sweeter!  
# PD  
139 **DO use rounded numerical values when**  
# placing elements on your layout  
# “Graphic designer” and “typographer” should be bywords for precision, and a compulsion  
# to be accurate is essential when working with type and layouts on a computer.  
# A  
# fter all,  
# your project will be printed or published online for everybody to see.  
# One of my major pet  
# peeves \(and it RE  
# ALLY drives me mad!\) is the inaccurate laying out and positioning of  
# elements for artwork, such as employing random and inconsistent measurements  
# throughout. For example, a picture box positioned .412 inches from the top of the trim  
# edge—what’s wrong with .5 inches? A picture scaled to 86  
# .428 percent—why not 86  
# .5  
# percent? Headlines at 30.  
# 697pt—where did that figure come from? I understand we all  
# have a lot to think about and a lot to remember \(the many rules in this book are prime  
# examples\). Invariably, with a deadline looming, the pressure is on, but taking care with  
# your work brings more quality to it and will make you the better designer.  
# Phew!  
# Okay,  
# rant over.  
# PD  
140 **DO ensure spacing is consistent**  
# throughout a layout  
**Rigor is part of the job of being a good designer. It is the diﬀerence between a world-class**  
# designer and a hack. Sloppy and inconsistent spacing is the first clue to identifying a  
# careless designer. First, use a grid to maintain consistent line length, rule width, and  
# image sizes. Second, use the guides to ensure uniformity in the position of text and  
# images. Third, specify a comfortable distance between the baseline of a caption and the  
# bottom of an image.  
# Adhere to this spacing on all images. Fourth, create rules \(stroke  
# size\) as part of the paragraph style of the text. This will maintain a consistent spacing  
# between the baseline of the typography and the rule. It may be tempting to optically  
# determine these spacing issues, but you are not that good. Do it mathematically and  
# consistently.  
# SA  
141 142 **DO establish a visual hierarchy that leads**  
# to the most important information  
# Assembling all of the components for your design is the easy part. Making sure to get the  
**main point across is much more diﬃcult. The first and most important step is to establish**  
# what that point is with your client.  
# Once you are on the same page, set up a hierarchy—  
# the sooner you start, the easier time you will have in creating a successful solution. There  
# is always a star or hero—the most important bit of information that the viewer should  
# take away.  
# Be sure that your layout, right down to your font selections and type size, all  
# reflect this goal. It can be as simple as size or placement, but often you will need to dig  
# into your toolbox for color and other graphic devices. Then determine what is the next  
# most important bit and so on and so on. Using everything you know about type and image,  
# set up the layout so that the viewer has access to all of the needed information.  
# JF  
143 **DO experiment with paragraph layout**  
# only for conceptual emphasis  
# A  
# fter all of this talk about rules, it is probably starting to feel like all we are only telling  
# you what you can’t do. The man is literally keeping you down. Didn’t we all get into this to  
# be creative? Well, here is a bit of freedom of the highest order. Now that you know the  
# rules, you can finally break them wide open. Nothing makes a bigger impact on a reader  
# than an experimental layout of a paragraph, or set of paragraphs. The key is that it has to  
# be intentional and with purpose, or else it just looks shoddy and unprofessional.  
# A layout  
# about a dense forest gets six tall, narrow columns of type nearly side by side? Worth  
# looking in to!  
# A story about reaching a mountaintop is laid out in a cone of type widening  
# with each line? You know it works. Just be sure to do it only when really and truly  
# appropriate.  
# JF  
144 **DON’T ignore the advantages of visual**  
# grouping  
**Imagine if you could take a layout and physically pull it apart in several diﬀerent**  
# directions. If there’s no strong relationship bonding the elements that make up the  
**layout, it’ll split and pull apart, but if you’ve used visual grouping eﬀectively, the layout**  
# will spring back together like elastic when you let go. It’s a slightly odd analogy, I know,  
# but think it through and you’ll see what I mean. Using visual grouping will provide  
# structure for a layout that might otherwise appear as a collection of free-floating objects.  
# Grouping anchors objects together with invisible threads, which our eyes then fill in for  
# us, and allows for easy navigation by drawing the eye through a layout in the correct  
# order. Grouping can be achieved through the use of borders, panels, rules, or even  
145 **typographic hierarchy, as well as the obvious idea of using proximity to form distinct**  
# groups of content. Take care not to create areas of trapped space between groups by  
# watching what’s happening around the edges of your layout.  
# TS  
146 **DON’T group white space in the middle**  
# of a layout  
# When designers talk about white space, what they really mean is blank paper. If you’re a  
# newcomer to graphic design, you might find that you feel uneasy about white space,  
# seeing it as a missed opportunity to add another image or some more text. The thing is,  
# the white space between items is integral to a layout’s structure for two reasons. First, it  
# provides a frame for objects or groups, setting them apart from other elements. Second, it  
# helps to create better visual navigation by drawing a reader’s eye through a layout in the

147 **DO use only as many columns as you**  
# genuinely need  
# A document grid exists to make it easier to create accurate layouts with correctly and  
# consistently positioned content, so it makes sense to keep grids simple.  
# A good grid will  
# also be flexible, of course, as you don’t want to be restricted in what you can do with the  
# content, and the number of columns you use exerts considerable influence on that  
# flexibility. Grids with odd numbers of columns can be particularly useful, as they allow  
# images to break into columns of text, and you can vary the measures for running text,  
# captions, and so on without departing from the grid itself. However, try not to get carried  
# away with the number of columns you introduce.  
# A twenty-seven-column grid is all very  
# well, but it’s very hard to keep track of consistency with that many active columns, and  
# you’re likely to end up with columns that are as narrow or narrower than the gutters.  
# Start with fewer columns and add as required, or use guides to create subcolumns if you  
# need them.

148 **Early in my career, I worked for a design firm that did a lot of work for the tourist**  
# industry, and that meant designing brochures with lots of complex price tables created  
# “by hand” in QuarkXPress.  
# All the rows and columns were separately drawn rules, and all  
# the text was tabbed by hand or a series of individually linked text boxes.  
# Boy, was it  
**diﬃcult and time-consuming work—but what a sense of achievement when you**  
# completed a table with all the footnotes and extras! Until, that is, the client calls to ask for  
# a change—“we need to add three weeks to the season, and, oh, by the way, we secured  
# rooms in two more hotels.” Without table functionality, it’s start again from scratch—  
# you’ll need to redo the whole table, so no going home for you tonight, my friend. With  
# table functionality, just “insert two columns” and “insert three rows” and adjust the size a  
**little, and you’re oﬀ to a bar for a well-deserved beer. It’s not that intuitive a process, to be**  
# honest, but it’s worth sticking with, in case you ever get that call.  
# TS  
149 **DO use footnotes1 only where they best**  
# serve the editorial content  
# While you are considering typographic styling for a book, the author or client may also  
# request the use of marginal annotation. If so, stop and consider what type of book or  
# publication it is and what the comments are communicating. If working on a technical or  
# academic title, it will be useful to employ the annotation as footnotes \(at the bottom of  
# the page\) to aid the reader and expand on their understanding of the material. If these  
# footnotes are more reference-based \(for example, a list of third-party reference  
# material\), then these could be placed at the back of the book as endnotes. Similarly, if a  
# large number of footnotes exist and the title is more narrative, like literature, then an  
# abundance of footnotes placed at the bottom of the page can look unsightly, be  
# intimidating, and significantly break up the flow.  
# Better that these be placed as endnotes.

151 **White space is your friend. Say it with me. White space is my friend. Like in music, it is**  
# often the notes that you don’t play that resonate the most with the listener. Far too many  
**layouts suﬀer from crowding out, filling every last nook and cranny with elements or text.**  
# Say you have a multicolumn layout before you, and the text holds to the style of the rest of  
# the document.  
# But paired with the photo and caption on the page, it leaves enough space  
# for two more paragraphs. The compulsion, then, can be to increase the size of the photo  
# until it all fills out the space perfectly.  
# Or worse, you may want to start adding in extra  
# spot illustrations or pump up the size of a pull quote to force the issue.  
# All of that takes  
# away from the original intent and ends up making the layout uncomfortably crowded.  
# The grid already has the page organized, and less is often more.  
# JF  
152 **DO consider a hang line when given**  
# inconsistent columns of text  
# One of the most maddening things can be when a designer is presented with inconsistent  
# amounts of text, such as paragraphs of various lengths, that need to work in a  
# multicolumn document.  
# But a little perspective helps soothe the nerves and find a  
# solution. When you are given a stack of framed prints to go across a wall and they all  
**diﬀer in height, what do you do? You make a horizontal line where the tops of each piece**  
# start at the same distance from the ceiling so that you have a clear visual organization  
**that celebrates the diﬀerence in scale while still keeping the wall from feeling cluttered**  
# and all akimbo. The same is true in a layout.  
# Creating a hang line, you organize the  
# vertical columns with a horizontal line in your grid. You can even have certain elements  
# only exist above the line, for example. It is referred to as a hang line because the columns  
# of text “hang” from a common line invisible to the viewer.  
# JF  
153 **DO use layers to organize type, color, and**  
# imagery  
# It’s an absolute no-brainer to organize and distribute content into separate layers, which  
# can be color coded and labeled. I think the feature is one of the best things ever  
# introduced into layout applications. Therefore, it’s a mystery why anyone wouldn’t use  
# layers, instead choosing to dump everything into one default layer. What happens if you  
# want to select something that appears behind another object? Lots of fiddling about and  
# multiple clicking—that’s what. Sure, it’s not essential for simple layouts that are only  
# worked on by you, but what if you work with a team or have files that third parties need to  
# edit? The ability to add all the text to its own layer and lock up the color in another so it  
# can’t be moved or deleted accidentally is pretty compelling. Try to get into the habit of  
# using at least one extra layer for all your text, and it’ll pay dividends in the long run.  
# TS  
154 **DON’T use multiple layers of content**  
# unless they provide a benefit  
155 **First, let me define layers here. This is not the good type of layer a designer uses to**  
# organize information using Adobe Photoshop. This is the result of reckless layering of  
# objects, images, and typography to create interest. Interestingly, this same technique of  
# layering images on top of other images, or pieces of typography, was an afternoon hobby  
# of upper-class women in Victorian England and the United States in the nineteenth  
# century. Hopefully, a century of technological advances, aesthetic movements, and  
# educated designers has discarded this technique in favor of clear communication.  
# Unfortunately, there are still designers who are under the false assumption that they  
# have invented a unique and revolutionary style with layers on layers of found images, odd  
# squiggles, and distorted typography. Too often, when faced with a project that isn’t  
# compelling, a designer decides that adding another element will help. This is wrong. This  
# is the same as putting more icing on a badly made cake. Go back to square one; the  
# original idea is probably flawed.  
# Adding to it is only ignoring the reality of a bad idea.  
# SA  
156 **DON’T use**  
# Microsoft Word for layouts  
# If I had a dollar for every client who, seeing themselves as something of a designer, has  
# used Word to lay out a document, I would be a rich man! So why not use it? Well, Word  
# provides little flexibility for a designer to work with, as it is set up for writing letters,  
# making lists, or laying out text-based reports. The clue is in the name\: it is great for  
# writing text, not designing layouts. For the graphic designer, Word’s very limited page  
# layout and typographic features do not allow any flexibility or the precision to craft and  
157 **create designs. In addition, Word has no prepress ability, nor does it have industry**  
# standards, such as Pantone color systems, built in. You should be using dedicated design  
# software, such as InDesign or QuarkXPress, for your work. You wouldn’t use a saw to  
# hammer a nail into wood, so don’t use Word to design your layouts. Ever!  
# PD  
158 **DON’T design in PowerPoint**  
# You might think I am crazy for even making this a rule, but trust me when I tell you that  
# sooner or later, a client will ask you to design something in PowerPoint, while swearing  
# up and down that it is the most creative application ever created and that you just haven’t  
# tried to appreciate its abilities. Now, we can acknowledge that PowerPoint may, indeed,  
# be the most creative application that THEY have ever worked in.  
# But we have other tools  
# at our disposal.  
# PowerPoint is good at one thing and one thing only\: making incredibly  
159 **basic slide shows.**  
# And even there, in layout terms, it is extremely limited. What it has in  
# its favor is that it is used everywhere, thus the push from your client. Frighteningly, its  
# tools seem to have been set up to encourage crimes against design, particularly when it  
# comes to scaling type and images vertically. I shudder just thinking about it. Don’t  
# encourage it, and certainly don’t do it.  
# JF  
160 161 **DO create text threads for stories or**  
# chapters at the planning stage  
162 **When you are first supplied with the copy for a multipage layout, you are usually forced to**  
# break it up into parts to a certain degree, but large portions can usually stay intact. It is  
# best to keep stories or chapters as a single chunk of copy by first importing the text into a  
# series of threaded text boxes. The small signifier at the bottom right of the first text box  
# can be clicked to load the cursor with any overmatter, allowing you to create as many  
# extra text boxes as needed to view the complete linked text chain.  
# Once all the copy is  
# styled, you will know how many pages are needed and be able to start making some  
# design decisions pretty quickly. Why is this preferable to creating separate text boxes and  
**cutting and pasting each item of copy as you go? Because subsequent edits will aﬀect the**  
# entire flow of the story or chapter, and losing that connection is the quickest way to  
# misplace a portion of text in your final file.  
# JF  
163 **DO use spell-check, especially when text**  
# is supplied  
# Many designers believe that they are visual people, and reading is for uptight academics  
# only.  
# Or they are convinced that the spelling format used in the texting world is correct.  
# This is wrong. You’re is not spelled UR. The mark of an ignorant and careless person is  
# most clearly illuminated by misspellings. Nothing is more detrimental than spelling  
# errors in a proposal, email, or presentation.  
# A misspelling on a CV is, frankly, a career  
# killer. In the past, a keen eye and superior education eliminated this issue. Today, spell-  
# check is the solution. The same rules apply to copy supplied by the client. The initial  
# contract should make clear that all copy proofreading is the final responsibility of the  
# client. However, once a project is printed or published online, a misspelled word remains  
# a sign of carelessness. The designer may be assigned the blame, as he or she typeset the  
# copy.  
# Once again, spell-checking the copy, regardless of the source, is the easy and  
# preferred solution.  
# SA  
164 **DON’T rely solely on spell-check to pick**  
# up every text error  
# Every designer should possess a dictionary in support of any computer-based spell-  
# checking software. It’s a must! Spell-check applications are far from perfect, and they  
# will not highlight words that are spelled correctly but out of context, as illustrated in this  
# rule. Foreign spelling also creates issues.  
# Because many words can have more than one  
# acceptable spelling variation, it is always worthwhile checking with the client to see  
# which style they prefer to use for their publications and wheth-er they can provide style  
# guidelines for copy.  
# PD  
165 **DON’T rekey supplied text into a layout—**  
# always copy and paste  
# On occasion, we work with manuscripts that are up to a hundred thousand words long.  
# That’s a lot of content written by an author, edited by a client, and sometimes revisited by  
# a proofreader. The manuscript has been checked, amended, and finalized—and is correct!  
# We therefore always copy and paste the texts into a layout and never rekey in—even if we  
# think it’s saving time or is an easy word—as even the shortest of words have the chance of  
# being misspelled in retyping. If you rekey and make a mistake, the client will spot it,  
# wonder how this mistake occurred, and be annoyed that you introduced errors into their  
# material. They might then mistrust you and wonder what other errors you might have  
# introduced. Worse still, they might not spot the error until the book has been printed!  
# That’s not good for any client–designer relationship. It is more than just a typo—it’s all  
# about trust, respect, and being professional.  
# PD  
166 **DO understand how and why a book or**  
# brochure publication is structured  
# In addition to the anatomy of letter-forms, it is important for the designer to know how  
# books and brochures are structured.  
# A book, or other publication types, has many  
# elements to it other than the cover and text pages. These details need to be factored into  
# the flatplan, or overall layout scheme, and be accounted for and designed in the  
# appropriate manner. Items such as the half-title and title pages and the imprint and  
# contents are integral to book publishing, and it would be embarrassing if you had to ask  
# the client what they are! There are certain orthodoxies in the running order of a book,  
# especially in the front matter and back matter. These vary depending on content but  
# generally follow a similar structure.  
# Once you know the naming conventions and the  
# standards, you can explore how to present them in fun and exciting ways.  
# PD  
167 **DON’T use Paragraph Composer in**  
# InDesign  
# Paragraph Composer is a feature \(and a default setting\) in InDesign that automatically  
# controls line breaks in paragraphs.  
# Although it might be a useful feature for  
# inexperienced designers, I would never use it in my work. Instead, you should always  
# make certain it is switched to the alternative Single-line Composer. The single-line mode  
# allows the designer to control line breaks, without InDesign adjusting tracking and line  
# endings on your behalf. The central problem with Paragraph Composer is that even the  
# slightest modification, such as changing a word, will reflow the entire paragraph. If you  
# have soft returns in the paragraph, this will contribute additional issues. For book  
# editors, it’s a nightmare. Work already completed on the text can be undone if Paragraph  
# Composer prompts auto-formatting, which might create gaps in the body text  
# unbeknownst to the editor.  
# As the designer, keep it single line and make the line-ending  
# adjustments yourself.  
# As they say, no pain, no gain.  
# PD  
168 **There are many ideas about the purpose of design. Some claim that it is in service of**  
# commerce; others postulate that it be used for social change.  
# One side of the industry  
# supports personal exploration, while the other side encourages an impersonal approach.  
# In any case, communication is the most basic requirement.  
# Clear communication is a  
# result of legible and understandable visual forms. Designers are not “type maids.” It is not  
# the designer’s job to take someone’s messy content and clean it up.  
# A good designer  
# clarifies the content with visual form and copy. If the copy is unclear or just plain wrong,  
# suggest changes. If the problem is extreme, suggest hiring a copywriter. The final product  
# in its entirety reflects on the designer. Saying, “I didn’t have anything to do with the copy”  
# will not enhance a designer’s reputation.  
# SA  
169 **DO design responsive website visuals at**  
# various screen proportions, starting with  
# phones  
# In the early days of the Web, one only had to consider a typical range of desktop and  
# laptop screen sizes, but today all successful websites have to be responsive to ensure that  
# they work properly on phones and tablets as well. In fact, given that people are  
# increasingly using their phone before their laptop to view online content, it is arguably  
170 **more important to follow a mobile-first policy when designing any website. This**  
# approach is not especially new\: a similar thing happened when the music industry began  
# to switch from vinyl to cassette tapes and then compact discs. Designers realized that it  
# was better to work on the focused layout of the smaller space before expanding it to the  
# larger area of a 12" vinyl record. Therefore, try to consider the layout of a new site with  
# the current range of phone screens in mind first before scaling it further for tablets, then  
# laptops, and finally large desktop screen sizes.  
# TS  
171 **DON’T employ a Web developer who has**  
# a bad website  
# When we start to assemble a team for a project, we often don’t heed our own advice. We  
# expect that our clients will have done their homework and researched various designers  
# to determine the best fit for their particular project before giving us a call or emailing us  
# \(because we are, indeed, the perfect fit for them\). When this doesn’t happen, we are the  
# first to throw a little fit. However, when we look for a writer, we often don’t read their  
# sample texts, and when we choose Web developers, it’s based on their price and  
# availability, neglecting that they are going to be a creative partner in realizing our vision  
# for the client. Imagine you are putting together a band. If you play hard rock and need a  
# bass player, you don’t hire the guy playing in the horrific calypso band at the shopping  
# center just be-cause he is free on Saturday nights. You already know he has bad taste.  
# Be  
# as selective with your own teammates.  
# JF  
172 **DO remember that type legibility diﬀers**  
# wildly from print to screen  
# It seems like an obvious thing to say that what works in print won’t necessarily work on-  
# screen, but let’s say it anyway.  
# A typeface like Times Roman is generally accepted as one  
# of the most readable serifs in print, even if it lacks a little in style. However, it is an  
**absolute failure on-screen, with its forms distorting and being generally diﬃcult to**  
# understand. Screen legibility is strongly influenced by a typeface’s x-height\: a larger x-  
# height is likely to improve legibility, so keep that in mind. Times New Roman has been  
# adapted with a moderate x-height and works much better on-screen.  
# Certain typefaces  
# like Georgia and Verdana have been constructed specifically with an on-screen  
# application in mind, and we find them lacking in most respects in print form. The most  
# important part of the equation is figuring out where your text is going to be read and  
# designing with that foremost in your mind.  
# JF  
173 174 **DO always use object styles when**  
# working with long documents  
# As designers, we tend to concentrate on the things we see directly in our layouts\: the type,  
# color, images, and so on. What we don’t always prioritize correctly are the properties of  
# the frames that contain those items and the various rules and borders that make up the  
# page “furniture,” or elements. Master pages are great for adding repeat elements to the  
# pages of a long document, but a lot of additional content is added along the way.  
# Object  
# styles containing information about a frame’s color, the stroke thickness, and the text can  
# be applied in the same way that character and paragraph styles are applied directly to  
# selected type. This, naturally, helps to speed up your workflow and, as a by-product, helps  
# to ensure consistency. It’s all too easy to start a project with .5pt rules that accidentally  
175 **become .3pt rules halfway through, and these small details are very diﬃcult to spot on-**  
# screen. You can bet you’ll spot it straight away when you see the printed item—use object  
# styles to achieve perfect consistency, just like peas in a pod!  
# TS  
176 **DO seduce your audience with your**  
# layout  
# The opposite of seduction is repulsion. When we seduce in a bedroom, we use soft lights,  
**play 101 Strings Orchestra albums, and oﬀer alcohol. Turning on the overhead**  
**fluorescent lights, playing Anthrax, and oﬀering heroin may be repulsive, depending on**  
**the date. Design is no diﬀerent. Good design seduces the viewer. The message may be**  
# complex, controversial, or challenging, but the design encourages the viewer to look at it.  
177 **Work that is impossible to access and repulsive to everyone at first glance is a failure.**  
# Seduce the audience. Utilize pleasant colors, legible typography, and clear imagery.  
# Consider Andy Warhol’s Electric Chair series. Silk-screened with vibrant and optimistic  
# tones, these paintings hang on walls above sofas. They look beautiful, but they are a  
# discourse on death and execution. This does not mean that every project should be pretty  
# —we can be seduced by strong images and dark tones.  
# Confused and impossible-to-  
# access work will repulse. The viewer has limited time and will instantly decide which  
# solution to engage with or ignore.  
# SA  
178 **DO follow Coco Chanel’s advice\: “When**  
**accessorizing, always take oﬀ the last**  
# thing you put on.”  
# Too much of a good thing is still too much. You may own beautiful Rolex, Cartier, and  
**Tiﬀany watches, but wearing them all at once does not increase the overall eﬀect.**  
# Designing a poster, book, website, or any other item is the same. More is not more. If an  
# element is purely decorative and serves no purpose, then it serves no purpose. It is a  
# distraction at best. Good design is purposeful. Each typeface, image, ornament, shape,  
# and color must be applied with intent. When we fall in love with our own design, it is easy  
# to ignore the extra, unnecessary items.  
# A good practice, like Coco Chanel’s advice, is to  
# remove one element when you are finished with the design.  
# SA  
179 **DON’T assume small adjustments will**  
# improve a bad layout  
180 **The core of good time management is understanding how much time is needed to**  
# complete a task and stopping when it is finished. Long hours and all-night sessions are  
# typically the result of repeatedly adjusting small elements in a layout. Refinement is a  
**diﬀerent issue. When a designer refines a design, he or she finely crafts the typography,**  
# color, and form. The goal here is to create an immaculate solution, free from sloppy  
# technique. Small adjustments, shifting a line of text up 1 pica, down 1 pica, and back  
# repeatedly are done to attempt to solve a larger issue. This issue is probably a bad  
# fundamental idea. If the basic concept is flawed, endlessly adjusting elements will not  
# correct it.  
# A great concept can withstand any layout issues. When a designer is making  
# these tiny adjustments all night, he or she should stop and ask, “Am I simply adding  
**lipstick to a pig?” SA**  
181 182 **DO use borders with a purpose, not**  
# simply for decoration  
183 **Borders can be a wonderful element, but they are not to be used without thoughtful**  
# consideration. They come in so many variations\: thick and thin, ornate and ragged, rough  
# versus clean. They can allow the designer to convey so much, simply highlight a bit of  
# important information, or liven up a dull image or layout.  
# Borders are our  
# friends . . . when we use them properly. When we toss them in just for decoration, they  
# often do more harm than good. If you have a garden that rabbits are savaging \(curses to  
# you, long ear!\), then a pretty pink fence with widely spaced slats certainly isn’t going to  
# keep them out. What’s the point of dressing up a patch of garden that’s now a field full of  
# holes and half-eaten carrots? The same holds true for your borders in your layout.  
# JF  
184 **DON’T use retro-style graphics**  
# gratuitously  
# For some years now, retro graphics has endured as one of the most popular styles in many  
# graphic design circles. The theory goes that the whole handmade trend is a reaction  
# against all the pixel-perfect imagery that became so de rigueur with the evolution of the  
# digital design age, and retro styling provides a great excuse to use some inked texture or  
# some grubby colors with headlines set in a bold calligraphic script. There are even  
# dedicated apps and Photoshop plug-ins to help you turn pristine artwork into a  
# misregistered screen print or a facsimile of a cheaply printed comic book.  
# Personally, I  
# love the whole retro deal, but I sometimes have to stop myself from justifying the use of  
# retro styling at the center of a concept. If you’re designing an indie poster for a band or a  
# book jacket for a cool new collection of urban fiction, then retro is right on the button, but  
# an attempt to bang a square peg of style into a round hole of appropriateness is probably  
# not going to work.  
# TS  
185 186 187 **DO design signage layouts to be read,**  
# not just seen  
188 **There are few designers who do not like small type. Rarely do clients ask to make the type**  
# or their logo smaller. Smaller type appears more delicate and provides more negative  
# space. The result is aesthetically appealing.  
# But, when it is too small, it is not functional.  
# Signs are a perfect example of this problem. Signage must be read, not simply be  
# aesthetically appealing. In the middle of a fire, the viewer, even a designer, will not stop to  
# appreciate the delicate typography and refined white space of the evacuation map. He or  
# she will need to quickly determine where to find the stairs. This requires typography and  
# iconography large enough to be read quickly, and from a distance. The contrast of the  
# message to the background must be strong. The letterforms need to be sharp and clear.  
# Do not use degenerated, decorative, or overwrought typefaces.  
# And the type size will  
# always need to be larger than you think. There is a good reason why street signs are not  
# set in Curlz.  
# SA  
189 **DO design book covers with title legibility**  
# as a priority  
190 **The best book-cover designers will all readily acknowledge how important it is to keep**  
# readability intact. Many spend days judging how much of a distressed look they can apply  
# to their type solution while still retaining legibility. They will always err on the side of  
# comprehension. With music packaging, people have additional interactions with it; even  
# major and minor brands of food and beverages have consumers tasting and experiencing  
# their product. With books, people read\: it’s as simple as that. That’s not to say that you  
# can’t take chances—by all means, be creative.  
# But always keep in mind that the title and  
# author name need to be clear; and in this age of digital sales, they need to be legible at a  
# very small scale on the Amazon website to sell enough copies so that the publisher can  
**aﬀord to pay your design bill.**  
# JF  
191 **DO design logos that have mnemonic**  
# value  
# We remember by recognizing shape and color. This is not an accident.  
# As an evolutionary  
# tool, remembering that the blueberries are poisonous but the oval red berries are good  
# was invaluable to hunter-gatherers. We use this trait now to recall the items we need.  
# Rather than berries and fruits, the viewer now identifies products. Successful logos take  
# advantage of our ability to recognize shape and color. If a form is too complex as an  
**illustration or disjointed set of elements, it will be diﬃcult to recall. If a logo uses a banal**  
**color palette or colors diﬃcult to identify, such as puce, it may be unsuccessful. Simple**  
# and clear forms with a distinct shape and color, therefore, have mnemonic value.  
192 **Consider the Apple, FedEx, and McDonald’s logos. Each of these has a distinct shape\: a**  
# circle, rectangle and arrow, and an arch. Each of these also has a distinct and simple color  
# scheme\: gray, purple and green, and red and yellow.  
# SA  
193 **DO design logos that can adapt to a**  
# company’s changing needs  
# In 1956, Paul Rand designed the IB  
# M logo, and IB  
# M continues to use a version of the  
# same logo today \(updated by Rand in 1967 and again in 1972\). In 1956, IB  
# M, known  
# previously as International Business Machines Corporation, produced computers and  
# other business machines. Today, IB  
# M is engaged in a range of activities from training and  
# consulting to digital technologies.  
# A neutral logo allows a company to shift direction,  
# change products, move into other categories, but still maintain its identity.  
# A logo that is  
# too specific to a product or activity presumes the company will never change. Good logos  
# don’t describe a company’s activities; they identify its values.  
# SA  
194 **DON’T ignore a client’s corporate**  
# standards  
# Before the cultural revolution of the 1960s, people went to work in accounting, law,  
# insurance, and manufacturing, and did their job. They didn’t consider themselves to be  
# artists. Today, everyone is told to be creative, to be unique and express themselves. This  
# works well when choosing ties but is a recipe for disaster with corporate standards.  
# These standards exist to maintain a clear, cohesive, and proprietary voice for a client.  
# They are not created to restrain creativity simply as a measure of cruelty. In any  
# company, there will be people who will want to ignore the standards and make their own  
# logo or add purple because it is their favorite color.  
# As a designer, you are collaborating  
# with the enemy if you do the same. Reserve the creative expression for the concept, and  
# leave the logo, color, and typeface alone.  
# SA  
195 **DO create logos your client can use**  
# anywhere  
# A well-crafted logo is something that is built to last. It is crafted so that it can be applied  
# to every application imaginable for the business it represents. Don’t produce something  
# that your client won’t be able to use anywhere other than on their website. Logo designs  
# that incorporate bitmaps are restrictive, as they do not allow for unlimited scaling. While  
# this excludes a feathered drop shadow from the discussion, I think we can all agree that is  
# for the better. \(Flip through the portfolios of the logo masters, and let me know when you  
# come across a drop shadow.\) The reason that you need to try to avoid bitmapped logos at  
# the onset is that even if the client may never need it, a wise branding exercise will be  
# prepared for anything that comes in the future. Logos built with vectors can be scaled  
# infinitely with no loss of quality. Logos that contain bitmaps cannot. If you need your logo  
# properly embroidered on shirts, you need a vector version. If you need it silk-screened on  
# recycling bins, you need a vector version. If you need it eight stories high on the side of a  
# building, vector.  
# JF  
196 **DO understand the figure–ground**  
# relationship in logos  
# Logos are a two-dimensional exercise, and with anything two dimensional, one must take  
# into account the figure–ground relationship.  
# Because, in most cases, it is centered on a  
# single strong image, it has on a heightened importance in logo design. The figure part of  
# the equation is essentially the object that we see, and the ground is the surrounding area.  
197 **Applying contrast to make this relationship as obvious as possible, the designer can make**  
# the image clearer. The designer can also use the negative space to create secondary  
# objects, exploiting a reversal in the figure–ground relationship. Graphic designer M.  
# .  
# C  
# Escher is a good example of someone who experimented with this process to great  
# success. More directly, many logo designers have seen fit to use this space to their  
# advantage, like the “arrow” between the e and x in the FedEx logo. It is one of the most  
# important lessons to learn in design, that the space between forms is just as important as  
# the forms themselves.  
# JF  
198 **DON’T make everything on a page the**  
# same size  
# Good composition is a mix of scale, shape, and color working together dynamically in  
# harmony.  
# A good trick to create dynamic composition is to think of the page or screen not  
# as a flat surface but as a window into a three-dimensional world. The closer an object is  
# to the viewer, the larger it will be. The more distant objects will be smaller. If all objects  
# are the same size, they will appear to be static and on a single plane. The use of multiple  
# sizes creates an unexpected composition. Unless the goal is to bore the viewer, the scale  
**must not simply diﬀer slightly but have extreme scale changes from tiny to huge.**  
# Combine giant type with small lines of text. Mix a small set of images with a large one.  
# Use an extreme close-up of a face with a distant background.  
# SA  
199 **DO respect the safety when placing vital**  
# type and images  
# When your parents told you not to play in the middle of the road, it wasn’t so that they  
# could boss you around and show you that they were in control. It was because they knew  
# that if you were playing football or drawing on the pavement in chalk, eventually a truck  
# would come along and make a kid-shaped pancake out of you.  
# And while they might have  
# gotten out of paying for college, they probably didn’t have a spatula big enough to pry you  
**oﬀ the road—AND they likely actually cared about your well-being. The same is true of**  
# the people who make your production templates. The safety is there for a reason because,  
# if you flirt with it often enough, the production process will eventually burn you and trim  
# away vital copy and images. Respect the invisible line. It’s for your own good.  
# JF  
200 **DON’T silhouette and drop shadow every**  
# last image  
201 **The computer allows designers to create forms that were previously extremely diﬃcult**  
# to make. Twenty years ago, hand-cut film created a silhouetted image and a photographer  
# created drop shadows with light and film. Today, the tools in Photoshop can create a  
# silhouette and drop shadow in moments. This may seem like a modern miracle, in the  
# same league as antibiotics and mobile phones, but it is not.  
# As the saying goes\: “  
# Just  
# because you can do something doesn’t mean you should.” Creating a silhouette is the  
# appropriate solution at times.  
# Adding a drop shadow digitally may also be necessary in  
# certain situations. Like eating pastries, these things should be done in moderation. Too  
# many images with silhouettes and drop shadows will make a project look like an  
# advertisement for a stock-image company.  
# SA  
202 **DO return to the creative brief numerous**  
# times during the creative process  
# I cannot stress enough how important a creative brief is to a project. It doesn’t have to be  
# extensive or too involved.  
# Actually, I prefer that it be simple and short. It is a brief, after  
# all. Take the time to talk through your project with your client, establish the priorities  
# they wish to see accomplished, and then rank them in the order of importance. The focus  
# should always be on the top two or three items on your list, with anything else  
# accomplished a bonus. When you both agree on the list, type it up and share it, and agree  
203 **that you will both keep it close. If you refer to it often while designing, it will surely help**  
# you accomplish your goals. For the client, referring to the brief removes a lot of the  
# subjectivity and keeps everyone focused on what is best for the project.  
# A win-win.  
# JF  
204 **DON’T project a personal style at the**  
# expense of the client  
205 **Every city has at least one design firm that becomes famous for the wrong reasons. It is**  
# not because they are helping clients reach unexpected success or financial windfalls or  
# helping change the world for the better—it is because they have a recognizable style. They  
# use the same layouts and fonts whether they are selling swimsuits or houses, saving the  
# seals, or filling theater seats. It is depressing because it is unfounded attention—but it is  
# generally shortlived once the clients realize that not only do their materials look like  
# everything else that the firm has designed but that they have been left in a precarious  
# position in which competitors can steal their branding just by using the same colors and  
# fonts. Style can be a quick fix, but true solutions that provide value to all involved require  
# a great deal more work. We all use our tools in certain ways, and prospective clients  
# should be able to see how we problem-solve while also knowing that the final result will  
# be unique to them.  
# JF  
206 **DO understand designing “above the**  
# fold” in both print and online  
207 **Designing a layout on your screen is far from how it will ultimately be used, whether it is**  
# a publication or a website. You have the ability to zoom in and out, controlling your  
# perspective, and usually keeping it at a size and position that looks best to you. You might  
# revel in a tiny detail at the bottom of a magazine cover or your ability to find room for  
# some fund-raising information toward the lower right on a website front page. Thinking  
# it’s a job well done, you will be quickly disappointed when you go to the supermarket only  
# to see the racks covering up your beautiful work or when you catch your better half  
# clicking past the website or page before ever scrolling down. Respect the fold, and you  
# won’t pay that dire price. The term fold comes from newspaper layout, when the portion  
# you would see in the racks and at your doorstep was the front of the folded final copy, and  
# everything that was vital had to be “above the fold” lest it be missed.  
# JF  
208 **DO know a good design in one’s gut**  
209 **Everyone possesses a “gut instinct.” At times, this intuition tells us to slow down at an**  
# intersection or pause before we scream at the mail carrier. This instinct also tells a  
# designer that he or she has the right solution. It’s the idea the designer had and then  
# sketched on a napkin while meeting with the client.  
# Or the solution he or she keeps  
# returning to when walking home at night. It’s good practice to explore many ideas and  
# concepts. This should be done without editing oneself—one bad idea may lead to a great  
# one.  
# But the right idea will always feel right. Some designers believe work must be hard.  
**They believe that the only good ideas come from endless hours of suﬀering and diﬃcult**  
# labor. Design does not need to be hard and overwrought.  
# A simple and smart idea that  
# feels good may be perfect.  
# SA  
210 **DO understand how visual “closure”**  
# works  
# At some point in our lives, we have met someone who wants to show us a visual trick.  
# While looking at a pattern, we scan farther to the side and are shocked to see a red dot  
# when no red dot exists in the pattern—or any number of tricks our minds can play on us.  
# We can all agree that these things are annoying and so are the people who present them to  
# us. However, they play a very important role in our visual practice\: they allow us to  
# visualize the remainder of an image when we are given incomplete information, which is  
# referred to as visual “closure.” We use this to process and understand concepts quickly  
# without being bogged down by every last detail. Glance quickly at the circles above for a  
# quick demonstration\: do you see four complete circles? As designers, we can use the  
# closure to our advantage and help us be sure that vital information is not lost to the  
# viewer. The eye is in the detail, even if some of the detail is left out on purpose.  
# JF  
211 **DO learn how to format an index**  
# correctly  
212 **On paper, an index seems like it would be the simplest thing in the world to get right, but**  
# typesetting the perfect index requires practice. You need to understand how the various  
# levels of indent work for entries that run to two or more lines. Two levels of indent are  
**suﬃcient for most indexes, with subentries to main topics that run to a second line. If any**  
# one entry runs over to a third line, the indent should remain the same until the next  
# unique entry begins. Try to avoid anything more complex than this in terms of indexing  
# levels.  
# A well-designed index should be easy to navigate. Liberal use of font weights,  
**perhaps a diﬀerent one for the page numbers, can help to improve the look as well as ease**  
# of use. Indexes are usually the last thing that gets done before repro and print, but don’t  
**scrimp on the time and eﬀort you put in, since, theoretically, those pages could be the**  
# most used pages in the entire publication.  
# TS  
213 **Color**  
214 **DO study the color wheel**  
# The study of color and how it’s used revolves around the simple concept of color wheels,  
# which explain visually how color is created from either light \(RGB\) or pigment \(C  
# MYK\)  
**and how the relationship between diﬀerent colors comes about. We normally represent a**  
# color wheel as, surprise, a circle with distinct segments that combine to form 360  
# degrees.  
# Alternatively, color wheels are shown as gradient tints of merging color, with  
# more saturated colors at the outer edge. It’s sometimes depicted as a strip, as in the  
# Photoshop’s Color Picker. The important thing to note is how a color wheel is structured\:  
# red, yellow, and blue—the primary colors—form the three main spokes of the wheel.  
# These colors are blended to form secondary colors\: orange, green, and violet.  
# Blending  
215 **primary and secondary colors produces tertiary colors, and so on.**  
# Complementary colors  
# are those that sit directly opposite each other on a color wheel, for example, primary blue  
# and secondary orange.  
# TS  
216 **DO learn about hue, saturation, and value**  
# Hue \(another name for color\), saturation, and value \(or brightness\) are the three  
# components that combine to form the colors we see around us every day. Saturated colors  
# are strong or vivid; unsaturated colors are weaker and can be created by mixing either  
# black or white pigment \(or more or less light\) to pure hues, such as the primary colors.  
# Value is the measure of how dark or light a hue appears compared with black or white. It  
# all sounds a bit scientific until you experience it\: Squint at a standard color wheel. You’ll  
# notice that the brighter colors like yellow appear brighter because they already have a  
# higher value relative to black compared with, say, dark violet.  
# Another good way to  
# visualize this is with the Color Picker on a Mac. Saturation is 0 percent \(or white\) at the  
# center of the wheel and 100 percent at the outside edge. The slider to the right controls  
# the value, with 100 percent brightness at the top and 0 percent \(totally dark\) at the  
# bottom.  
# TS  
217 **DO understand the diﬀerence between**  
# additive and subtractive mixing  
# This is a simpler concept to explain than some of the other areas of color theory.  
# Additive  
# mixing is all about light, and subtractive mixing is all about pigments. When you look at  
# your computer screen, all the colors you see are the result of additive mixing, with red,  
# green, and blue light combined. Mixing all three colors together produces white light,  
# adding green and blue makes cyan, adding green and red makes yellow, and adding red  
# and blue makes magenta. This is additive mixing. Subtractive mixing happens when  
# printed pigments absorb particular wavelengths of light—what we see on a printed page  
# is actually the reflected light that hasn’t been absorbed by the pigment. This is why we  
# use cyan, magenta, and yellow pigments for process printing—they’re the colors  
# produced by the additive color model, and this works in reverse when printed.  
# Black is  
# added into the mix for four-color process printing to produce a purer black than would be  
# achieved by mixing solid cyan, magenta, and yellow together. This also provides better  
# control over value \(or brightness\).  
# TS  
218 **DO understand the function of diﬀerent**  
# color spaces  
# Color spaces, when combined with color profiles, are important in maintaining color  
# consistency in a workflow. It’s all mathematics, but don’t worry, you don’t actually have to  
# do the math yourself. The models that most designers will recognize are RGB and C  
# MYK.  
# These are device-dependent models, meaning that they’re designed to facilitate color  
# reproduction on devices such as monitors and printing systems. They also have a limited  
# color range—known as a color gamut \(which you can read about on page 182\)—so some  
# colors produced with these models aren’t always true to the original but are governed by  
# the device being used. Device-independent models, on the other hand, mimic the way our  
# eyes perceive color and are technically more faithful to the original. LAB is the most  
219 **common model of this type and has a much larger color gamut than other models. It’s**  
# popular with designers who do a lot of color correction because it can separate an image’s  
# luminance \(or brightness\) from its color.  
# TS  
220 **DO ensure your color settings remain**  
# synchronized across all applications  
# One of the great advantages to using an integrated suite of design tools is the fact that you  
# can create similar \(or similar-ish, at least\) working environments when switching from  
# one application to another.  
# Adobe Creative Cloud applications are particularly good at  
**this, paying special attention to the synchronization of color settings for diﬀerent color**  
# models or working spaces through a centralized function in Adobe Bridge. It also allows  
# the user to synchronize how applications treat images as they move from, say, Photoshop  
# to InDesign or Illustrator. Why is this important? If you can’t rely on consistent color  
# when moving between applications, there’s really no point in paying any attention to the  
# colors you specify, as the final results won’t be predictable or consistent. It’s not a  
# creative process as such, but color consistency is extremely important if you want to see  
# a final output that’s a close match to what you’ve been seeing on your computer screen.  
# TS  
221 **DON’T ignore the constraints of color**  
# gamuts  
# Did you ever wonder why you can create an amazingly vibrant red on-screen but can’t  
# seem to get it to print out with the same kind of intensity of color? The reason that it’s not  
# possible to translate certain colors from screen to paper has a lot to do with color gamuts.  
# A color gamut represents the complete range of colors that any single color model is  
# capable of producing in print. It also represents the complete range of colors that a device  
# can capture, as with a camera or scanner, or display, as on a computer screen. Screens use  
222 **C**  
# the RGB model to display color, and the RGB gamut is larger than the C  
# MYK gamut used  
# for four-color printing. This is why you can’t print that amazing red with C  
# MYK—it’s  
# outside the C  
# MYK color gamut. Spot colors like Pantones are not dependent on the  
# MYK color gamut, as they’re mixed from pigments, so a much brighter red can be  
# achieved if printed as a spot color. This is true of many colors limited by the C  
# MYK  
# gamut.  
# TS  
223 **DO get to grips with color rendering**  
# intents  
# Rendering intents help to address the issue of the RGB gamut being larger than the  
# MYK gamut by controlling what happens when colors are converted from RGB to  
# MYK. There are four rendering intents to choose from, and each produces a subtly  
**diﬀerent result.**  
# Perceptual attempts to preserve colors by compressing them into the  
# MYK gamut tend to alter most colors and can reduce saturation. Saturation keeps  
# colors that can be produced using C  
# MYK but changes any out-of-gamut colors while  
# attempting to preserve saturation. This can cause significant color shifts and isn’t great  
# for color critical imagery.  
# Absolute colorimetric keeps colors within the C  
# MYK gamut  
# intact and converts out-of-gamut colors to the closest possible hue at the expense of a  
# little saturation—but it can also produce a slight color cast in the white areas. Relative  
# colorimetric is the default for most uses, as it’s similar to absolute colorimetric but also  
# adjusts the white point, thus reducing color casts. If in doubt, always go for relative  
# colorimetric.  
# TS  
# C  
# C  
# C  
224 **DON’T neglect the fact that colors**  
# change according to their surroundings  
225 **Color is subjective and emotional. It is challenging to convince someone to like pink if**  
# they were repeatedly locked in a pink closet as a child. This makes color one of the most  
# problematic elements of designing. In addition to the subjective nature of color is the way  
# we see color. First, we all experience color in our own way. Warm red will appear  
**diﬀerent to every person viewing it. To one person, it looks orange; to another, red. It is**  
# vital to be accommodating when dealing with color. Telling someone they are wrong  
# about a color choice is like telling them they are a bad person. If these hurdles were not  
# high enough, color also changes according to its environment. What seems to be a soft  
**yellow in the designer’s oﬃce can be an awful yellow-green under the client’s fluorescent**  
**light. The primary colors, red, blue, and yellow, are the most consistent in diﬀerent**  
# surroundings.  
# Complex colors, such as violet, are more volatile and can easily shift from  
# blue to purple. When showing color options to a client, it is best to explain that color  
**changes in diﬀerent settings.**  
# SA  
226 **DO look at what surrounds us for color**  
# inspiration  
# A common obstacle for designers is choosing colors. The swatch panel of default colors in  
# Adobe Illustrator exists for broad gestures of color. It is not a color palette. It is, like the  
# default shapes in Illustrator, ordinary and overdone.  
# A strong color palette is as  
# important as the typeface choices.  
# A good color palette will be unique, seductive, and  
# harmonious. The natural world is a good place to look for inspiration.  
# A poplar tree is not  
# green. It is a mix of blue green, lime green, silver green, light brown, cool gray, and white.  
# The sunset is not red. It is dark blue, light blue, pink, orange, and yellow.  
# A smart process  
# for creating a color palette is to take an image of a natural setting and sample distinct  
**colors from diﬀerent parts of it. The result will be a system of colors ranging from light to**  
# dark and intense to soft.  
# But they will always remain in harmony and be unique to your  
# experience.  
# SA  
227 **DO draw color inspiration from great**  
# works of art  
# If you’re looking for a new colorway for your latest project, there are lots of very useful  
**resources out there in print and online, with thousands of diﬀerent color combinations**  
# or schemes that can be referenced. However, there’s another way of looking for color  
# combinations that already provide a real-world view of how colors combine—and  
# provided by absolute experts of color. Look at art.  
# People have been experimenting with  
# color combinations for thousands of years, and it’s all out there for us to look at. You can  
228 **even gear your choice of art to the kind of project you’re working on. If you want an earthy**  
# combination of blacks and browns, take a look at some cave paintings. If you want rich  
# and luxurious colors, try something by Hans Holbein the Younger. For bold bright  
# combinations, try Vincent van Gogh or some of Mark Rothko’s work. If you’re not so  
# much into painting but like more graphic work, look at Roy Lichtenstein, Piet Mondrian,  
# or Andy Warhol. The colors are all there for the taking.  
# TS  
229 **DON’T use beige to attract attention**  
# Attracting attention audibly requires the use of loud volume. When you want a friend  
# across the street to notice you, you shout, “Hey, Steve!  
# Over here!” This is also true  
# physically\: tapping someone on the shoulder will get their attention.  
# And it is true  
# visually\: stop signs are red and have large type.  
# Beige is not loud.  
# Beige, gray, and tan may  
# be sophisticated and classic, but they are not good when vying for attention.  
# Beige is like  
# a silent killer. It will slowly creep into a project.  
# An image may feel too bright, so it is  
# desaturated.  
# A type color seems too bold, so it is softened. The final result is an overall  
# beige tone.  
# Online as a website, it appears beige-green on some monitors and is mundane.  
# On a poster, it hangs unnoticed by passers-by. Do not fear color; do not retreat to the safe,  
# quiet, and deadly world of beige.  
# SA  
230 **DO remember that colored type can**  
# provide as much emphasis as bolding  
# There are easy and obvious ways to emphasize type in your layout. That doesn’t  
# necessarily mean that they are always the best avenues to accomplish that.  
# Although a  
# highway can provide the quickest trip to your destination, it can also dull your senses  
# during the trip itself. Similarly, when these predictable methods are used too often, they  
# can become a worse option than doing nothing at all. The simple bold may be your default  
# selection when trying to highlight a word or section, but take time to consider color as  
# well. Using a color to bring out a repeated phrase or word can be hypnotic; using a slash of  
# red to create terror over a phrase can add tension. There are so many powerful tools at  
# your disposal; with just a tiny wash of color, you can forever change the viewer’s  
# perception.  
# JF  
231 **DO think of white space as a color and**  
# use it positively  
# I find the employment of white space in any design to be a crucial factor in a design’s  
# success, and its usage should be a consideration from the outset. I’m not just talking  
# about margins but about factoring in white as a part of the layout so that the elements of  
# the page are separated, framed, and supported. In addition, the positioning and control of  
# white space will guide the reader through the design, quietly hand-holding them through  
# the content. When working on books with mostly photographic content, rather than  
# design the layout with the picture’s format as the priority, I think about how the white  
# space can work with each specific picture to present it at its best. Try experimenting with  
**diﬀerent layouts, using a single image—the extent to which white space can alter the**  
# mood, pacing, and presentation of the content may well surprise you.  
# PD  
232 **DO explore color psychology**  
# Psychology generates skepticism among nonsubscribers, but it’s not all \(ahem\) bull.  
# A  
# bull doesn’t chase a cape because it’s red—in fact, bulls are color-blind. He does it because  
# the matador is waving it in his face\* and because he doesn’t like the matador very much.  
# Seriously though, designers can use color to invoke a range of emotions and behaviors.  
# Red is particularly interesting, coming from the warm area of the spectrum, and can  
# conjure feelings of warmth and comfort as well as anger, hostility, and danger.  
# Colors  
# from the cool end, such as blues and greens, can be used to calm but can also create  
**feelings of sadness or indiﬀerence. It’s well worth reading up on how the psychology of**  
**color works. It’ll help inform your selection of colors for your design projects, oﬀer some**  
# context to those choices, and supply you with some ammunition in case your client utters  
**the line\: “I can see what you’re trying to say, but I don’t like blue.” TS**  
233 **\* No animals were harmed during the writing of this rule.**  
234 **DON’T follow the rules of color**  
# psychology slavishly  
# There are many rules and theories about color.  
# Psychologically, orange is agitating.  
# Blue  
# is calming. Red is exciting.  
# Pink is restful. Like all rules, however, following them  
# slavishly results in solutions that are expected and rigid. Rules can change.  
# At one time,  
# eating steak was considered healthy; now it’s not.  
# Perhaps in a month, it will be healthy  
# again.  
# Orange was once used in fast-food restaurant design to create unease and keep the  
# customer from lingering. Now orange is seen as hip and exciting. It was once a cardinal

235 **DO remember that colors mean diﬀerent**  
**things in diﬀerent cultures**  
# You have spent months perfecting a new brand of perfume that has a name inspired by  
# royalty. Tweaking your glistening crown logo and your type solution filled with flourishes  
# soon gives way to the packaging design.  
# A lush purple finds itself gripping all aspects of  
# the brand. It feels important and expensive while still being romantic and sexy. The line  
# launches to great acclaim, except in Thailand, where the distributor can’t even find many  
# outlets willing to give it a chance. The corporate folks can’t believe that they are only now  
# learning that in Thailand, purple is considered a color of mourning and worn only by  
# widows. Meaning behind colors is an important consideration when working on  
# international projects. Yellow is a color of courage in Japan, but often linked to cowardice  
# in the United States, and in Egypt burdened with the same albatross of mourning that  
**purple carries in Thailand. It’s so easy to use a color but much more diﬃcult \(and**  
# valuable\) to understand its significance.  
# JF  
236 **DO choose colors for a reason rather**  
# than simply because you like it  
**In a lot of ways, this is one of the most diﬃcult rules to abide by and a sign that you have**  
# finally given yourself over to 100 percent being the best possible designer that you can be  
# —working for your client. We all have favorite colors and those that we avert our eyes  
# from.  
# As much as we have learned to appreciate that a scripty font is not appropriate for a  
# monster truck rally, we need to grasp that our favorite colors are rarely the perfect ones  
# to apply on our client’s business design. While it is obvious that branding for an ice  
# company should likely involve blues, it should be just as obvious that the blues be cool in  
# tone, even if you prefer deeper purple-infused blues.  
# Always have a reason for why you  
# selected the elements in your design, right down to the all-important color.  
# JF  
237 **DON’T be afraid to be bold with your**  
# color choices  
# A common insult used by eight-year-old boys is to call someone a wimp. Nobody wants to  
# be a wimp. Most people want to feel significant and strong. Design can reinforce a sense  
# of strength and confidence.  
# Bold color choice is one tactic used to communicate power.  
# This is not an endorsement to use fluorescent pink on every project.  
# Bold color can be a  
# relentless palette of pastel colors or a rich combination of dark gray tones. It can also be  
# extremely bright or unexpected. Mix avocado green and bright orange or brown and pink.  
# As long as it is purposeful and handled with courage, it will be right. Wimpy color choices  
# include the predictable combinations such as flat navy blue and medium gray. These  
# colors are appropriate for a job-interview outfit or lunch meeting with grandparents.  
# They may be appropriate for an extraordinarily stodgy insurance firm. They do not,  
# however, declare “We are the s%\#t@” in the world of design.  
# SA  
238 **DO remember that people like bright**  
# things  
239 **If a baby lying in a cot is presented with two mobiles, one in bright colors and the other in**  
# browns, the baby will always grab for the bright one. This doesn’t change as people age.  
# As designers, we are told repeatedly that the unpleasant tones are the fashionable colors.  
# Drab greens, browns, and dingy yellows are supposedly sophisticated. When a designer  
# presents a packaging solution with these colors and the client resists, the designer may  
# claim that the client just doesn’t understand good design. This is not true. The client is  
# not required to understand “good design.” The client needs to understand his or her own  
# business, the audience, and communication goals. No client has ever requested, “  
# Please  
# design something that will repulse people and make my business fail.” The client  
# responds the way 95 percent of the intended audience will.  
# People will always gravitate  
# toward the bright colors.  
# SA  
240 **DO learn how the transparency of a color**  
**or ink aﬀects what it overlaps**  
# One of the true glories of the silk-screen explosion of the past decade is that it has  
# exposed more and more designers to the joys of overprinting.  
# As process color has  
**become increasing aﬀordable, trying to do so with spot colors on an oﬀset job via**  
# overprinting, duotones, and other tricks seems to be going by the wayside.  
# But you should  
# never forget that you always have more colors on hand than the cartridges of ink would  
# indicate. Seeing inks printed on top of one another—whether it is one of  
# Bradbury  
# Thompson’s famous C  
# MYK experiments or on your current favorite gig-poster artist’s  
**work—allows us to see how inks change one another and can create a multitude of eﬀects.**  
# There is the straightforward third color that comes from adding two others, such as green  
241 **by printing a blue over a yellow, or a totally diﬀerent eﬀect by printing a darker gray over**  
# the same yellow, yielding a subtle shift to a deeper gray in those areas.  
# Oh, the  
# possibilities!  
# JF  
242 **DON’T use Pantone spot colors in a four-**  
# color print job  
# If I had a dollar for every commissioned layout I’ve ever had in prepress that had a rogue  
# Pantone color hiding within its pages, I would have enough for a night out on the town, at  
# the very least. The use of Pantone, or spot, colors in a project destined for four-color  
# printing is disastrous for a number of reasons. First, a spot color must print as a fifth  
# color, which will increase your print bill, mess up your quote, and could cost you dearly.  
# Second, the vast majority of Pantone colors can’t be reproduced accurately from the four  
# process colors \(cyan, magenta, yellow, and black\), even if your software forces a P  
# MS  
# spot color into a C  
# MYK split. The problem lies in the fact that a Pantone book is often the  
# only resource designers have at their disposal when choosing colors, so they make color  
# choices that, in reality, can’t be achieved within the constraints of four-color printing. If  
# you know your project must print only in four colors, put your Pantone book in a drawer  
# and resist the temptation to take a peek at all costs.  
# TS  
243 **DON’T use more than two Pantone colors**  
# with a CMYK print job  
# There’s an obvious benefit to using the C  
# MYK printing process—you can create any color  
# you want by mixing the four inks. To have more than two additional Pantone colors would  
# be superfluous. Maybe you are adjusting ink channels and levels for a fluorescent or a  
# metallic ink \(or both\) with the C  
# MYK set, which is fine, although you should always make  
**an eﬀort to show restraint to avoid a potentially vulgar and “showy” design when printed.**  
# Another reason is the cost. There are five-, six-, seven-, and even eight-color presses,  
# although most commonly found is six. So that’s six plates\: C  
# MYK and two others or, more  
# commonly, one special ink and a varnish, allowing the print job to be done in a single  
# pass.  
# Adding other special colors would require running the sheets through the press  
# again, which would be expensive and wasteful. You also should ask yourself\: will your  
**design really be any better? PD**  
244 **DO use process color-built reds with no**  
# Pantone selected  
# In the village of Pantonia, behind the rainbow-swirled gates, lies a magical factory of  
# Wonkaesque wizardry. It is here that the Oompa Loompas manage to create forty new  
# colors each year, seemingly out of thin air.  
# Plucking a toucan feather yields a decade’s  
# worth of hip and inspirational shades. The village’s dedication to pairing a code number  
# with every blip of intensity that our eye registers is admirable, to say the least.  
# As would  
# be expected in the closet of the average ad agency, there are multiple versions of simple  
# black. So why is it that they have never been able to create a decent red? It’s a sad fact  
# that, no matter how many batches those Oompa Loompas swirl back at the plant, they  
# just can’t get it right. It’s a shame, as red is often called into service in our world. Thank  
# goodness, we can start at 0/100/100/20 and go from there.  
# JF  
245 **DON’T specify print colors with RGB**  
# values  
# I know it’s a real blow whenever we have to face this sad fact, but you can’t print RGB  
# colors. RGB colors are made from projected light; C  
# MYK and Pantone colors are made  
# from pigments that generate reflected light. RGB colors are generally brighter and more  
# saturated because the RGB color gamut is much larger than the C  
# MYK counterpart. It’s  
# tempting to look at a bright red RGB color on your computer screen and think how great  
# it would look flooding the front cover of the brochure you’re working on, but I’m afraid it  
# isn’t going to happen. It’s simply not possible to achieve with the four-color process,  
# although some Pantones can get close because white pigment can be mixed in. So if the  
# budget allows for extra spot colors, that’s the way to go. It’s even more important to bear  
# this in mind now that work is increasingly presented on a laptop or a tablet, so please  
# explain to your client why the finished job won’t look quite the same as it did on-screen.  
# TS  
246 **DON’T create tints from tints**  
# You have a layout all set to go, and a colleague wanders over to ask you what C  
# MYK  
# percentages you’ve used to create that really cool blue-green background tint. You  
# happily take a look while congratulating your colleague on his excellent appraisal of your  
# color choices, only to find that it’s a 45 percent tint of  
# 75 percent cyan and 30 percent  
# yellow, which is, um—hang on while I get a calculator. You see, really annoying, isn’t it?  
# It’s not a disaster as such because the color will still look good in the final job, but it’s not  
# great not knowing what the color actually is. The point I’m making is, by all means, create  
# percentage tints from spot colors but not from colors that are already percentage tints.  
# There is a quick, calculator-free fix. Select the color and delete it from the Swatches  
# panel, replacing it with an unnamed swatch, then add unnamed swatches back in. Your  
# actual color will reveal itself to be 34 percent cyan and 14 percent yellow. Nice!  
# TS  
247 **DON’T screen a color to less than 7**  
# percent and expect to be visible on the  
# printed page  
# You know what looks dazzling in its subtlety on your computer screen? A 5 percent  
# screen of your spot color. You know what has nary a chance of showing up on the printed  
# page? A 5 percent screen of your spot color. The thing about commercial printing is that  
# there can often be variation in how heavy the ink is running on the press.  
# Combined with  
# the gain of ink, or lack thereof, on varying sheets of paper, it is wise to keep a 10 percent  
# minimum variation at the back of your mind. That is a worst-case scenario, but using  
# newsprint or similar sheets can easily see unexpected results come to fruition. The  
# reason? Using a small number of dots to produce a light tint makes it harder to produce  
# an accurate result in the final print. If you really desire a light color, select a light Pantone  
# and use it at 100 percent.  
# JF  
248 **DON’T use process color for small body**  
# text  
# Process colors, cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, combine to create four-color images.  
# Black is a good choice for small body text, as it is legible and prints clearly.  
# Cyan, yellow,  
# and magenta do not work for small body text. Think about how we read\: we look at  
# individual letters and combine them to make words, which make sentences, and  
**paragraphs. Diﬀerentiating the characters is the basis of the process.**  
# A section printed in  
# magenta, cyan, or yellow only is too bright to read quickly and strains the eye. It’s as if  
# you’re asking the viewer to look at the sun. It looks nice, but you will go blind if you stare  
# at it too long. Make sure text is legible.  
# Body text should be set in darker tones or black.  
# SA  
249 **DO learn how colors can share tonal**  
# qualities  
# In its simplest terms, color tone is created by adding gray to a pure hue. Knowing this, you  
**can see that adding the same amount of gray to diﬀerent colors would create the same**  
# tonal qualities.  
# Pantone books can be helpful in selecting colors in varying tones, as they  
# can present a tonal range in sequential colors. More importantly, they provide color chips  
# so that you can match up options and also train your eye to identify and register colors  
# that share tonal qualities. Why is this important? At a base level, the eye requires contrast  
250 **to process information\: if you place a green next to an orange, if they are the same tone,**  
**they will ultimately blend together into one shape. This can be a desired eﬀect, but one**  
# that can be properly achieved only by understanding how it occurs.  
# JF  
251 **DO learn how to group colors into hot**  
# and cold groups  
# When starting a project, I try to think about the colors in the most basic sense possible\:  
# are they hot or cold? There are numerous reasons for choosing a specific palette, and  
# many projects will require a combination of hot and cold colors, while others benefit  
# immensely from being cohesive. Many people will make the mistake of quickly lumping  
# basic colors into hot or cold, with no leeway. The proliferation of color options has  
# allowed for a greater breadth.  
# Blues, in the cool category, can absorb doses of magenta  
# until they find themselves in the hot group, where most purples will reside.  
# Blazing hot  
# yellows can give way to become cooler light greens. Even grays are lumped into cool and  
# warm sections by Pantone. It is a distinction that can give your color selections a sense of  
# community and also create compelling decisions when only one hot or cold color is  
# applied to the solution.  
# JF  
252 **DO use value contrast to divert or draw**  
# the viewer’s attention  
# Fear can be quite useful at times. When encountering an oncoming train, a lion on safari,  
**or an angry ruﬃan, fear can be a wonderful tool. Fear is not good in design. When the**  
# designer is frightened that the solution is too aggressive, bold, or exciting, he or she may  
# fall into the trap of mildness.  
# Perhaps the colors seem too strong and are dampened. Then  
# all the shapes become a similar scale.  
# And finally, the black tones are changed to  
# midrange gray. The result is mild, pointless, and bland.  
# Contrast is your friend. Strong  
# value changes in contrast attract attention. They stand out in a crowded visual  
# environment.  
# At the extreme of value contrasts are 100 percent black and pure white.  
# And they work. The world is saturated with multiple midtone colors, creating an over-all  
# low-contrast impression. Strong black and white tones may seem old-fashioned, but this  
# combination is rarely used. In the midst of a plethora of four-color images advertising  
# products on billboards, imagine the impression of a simple black-and-white, high-  
# contrast solution.  
# SA  
253 **DO learn to love the Eyedropper tool**  
# I’ve been using Adobe InDesign since version 2, but it took me a long time to realize how  
# useful the Eyedropper tool is. I thought it simply stored the color of any object you  
# clicked on, enabling you to fill another object with the same color or apply it the to text,  
# like it does in Adobe Photoshop. How wrong I was—you can copy type attributes too.  
# Click on an item of text, even some text in another document, then drag over another  
# item of text with the Eyedropper, and—bingo!—it copies not just the color of the text but  
254 **many additional stored attributes. While it’s true that good practice dictates the use of**  
# style sheets for all text formatting, especially in long documents, there’s always a use for  
**this functionality when you’re working on a one-oﬀ job, like a poster or flyer, or when**  
# you’re experimenting with type styles prior to committing to the application of style  
# sheets. Time to stop ignoring the Eyedropper tool, I think.  
# TS  
255 **DO use color to create movement**  
# The ability to create movement using color is actually fairly easy, producing the illusion  
# of action. When an image, or sequence of colors, has a wide variation in value running  
**throughout it \(note that this is very diﬀerent from a layout that pans across to build to a**  
**diﬀerent value\), it allows for a kinetic reaction in the viewer’s eye.**  
# Once you have this  
# knowledge, you can harness it to create busy color combinations that dance in front of  
**the viewer or pull back on it to create a soothing eﬀect with colors of the same value. If**  
# you are feeling particularly bold, you can make color sequences of the same color  
256 **repeating in a pattern, generating a rhythmic quality. This also provides you with greater**  
**appreciation for painting, in which this can be seen at its fullest eﬀect—from the high-**  
# contrast rhythm of a Mondrian to the energetic skies of a Van Gogh.  
# JF  
257 **DO use color to create tension**  
# Explaining visual tension is similar to describing a color. It is an aspect of composition  
# that uses unexpected color, shape, or scale to create energy.  
# Often, designers create  
**tension in their work, not to evoke anxiety but to oﬀer the viewer a more dynamic**  
# experience. Using dissimilar, or jarring, color combinations is one way to do this. Taking  
# advantage of spatial properties of color is another way. For example, warm tones appear  
# to advance in three-dimensional space, and cool tones recede. If a large object appears  
# closer to the viewer and smaller objects are more distant, then it would be logical for the  
# large object to use a warm color such as red. If you reverse the expected and use a cool  
# color on the closer, larger object and a warm red on the distant/smaller object, tension is  
# created. The viewer is being told two opposing stories.  
# Color can be used to create  
# tension by combining tones that vibrate, such as blue and red, or by using color in  
# unexpected ways, like coloring a chicken blue or the Brooklyn Bridge pink, which can also  
# create tension.  
# SA  
258 **While recessive and banal should never be the goal of a project, a calm tone can be**  
# desirable. The anxiety produced by representation of unnerving subjects, such as surgery,  
# dental work, and airplane safety, could be mitigated by the use of colors that are calming  
# and reassuring. The first step is to understand the audience and its concerns. Does the  
# audience need to be comforted, to feel safe, or to be put at ease? If so, calm colors can  
# achieve this.  
# Calm colors do not need to be light pastels. The context of each assignment  
# dictates the color choices.  
# Blood red is a bad choice for surgical brochures and websites.  
# While there are exceptions, calming colors are less vibrant. They contain a higher  
# percentage of white or black than a pure primary tone. Yellow can be made calming by  
# adding white.  
# A soft butter-yellow isn’t as jarring and aggressive as primary yellow and  
# still communicates optimism.  
# SA  
259 260 **DON’T place analogous colors next to**  
# each other  
# Well, we were bound to end up in color theory class at some point, huh? Analogous colors  
# are those that appear next to each other on the color wheel. Included within a larger  
# palette, they can create a sense of harmony. If you place them next to each other, however,  
# they bask in their similarity and blend together in the worst possible way. We learned  
# earlier to play tricks with tonal quality, but with this, you could end up with a violet next  
261 **to a red with little to distinguish them but a muddy mess. In dressing yourself, the only**  
# thing worse than not matching is wearing two colors that are almost the same.  
# Picture  
**yourself in a red and orange outfit. You will quickly realize that you would be better oﬀ**  
# going full on with either color, but would be in big trouble if you try to wedge them  
# together.  
# JF  
262 **DON’T place high-intensity**  
# complementary colors next to each other  
# Unless the goal of a project is to annoy the viewer, it is a good rule of thumb to not  
# recklessly slam vibrant primary colors together.  
# Blue and red will create a visual  
# vibration.  
# Blue and yellow are good for nautical applications when visual clarity may be  
# challenged but may be overwhelming on personal stationery. Red and yellow are perfect  
# for McDonald’s but lack the sophistication that may be necessary for a refined high-end  
# Japanese restaurant.  
# As in all decisions, being aware of the context, intended  
# communication, and desired psychological reaction will dictate the choice of colors. Yes,  
# there are instances when using all three primary colors together works.  
# A preschool’s  
# identity may seem to be a good place to use primary colors—and a square, circle, and  
# triangle.  
# But then it will match every other preschool logo from Toledo to Taipei.  
# SA  
263 **DO use fluorescent inks with a purpose**  
# Fluorescent inks can add a shine, similar to an enormous glittering gold necklace  
# swinging from your neck or a crisp shine on your patent leather shoes. They always make  
# an impact. Using them in the proper manner can be the tougher part. Not every occasion  
# is suited to flashy neckwear, though a snappy pair of loafers goes well with most  
# everything. Using fluorescent inks brings an intense brilliance, and a spot color of neon  
# orange or green or yellow will instantly attract all of the available eyes, but the use has to  
# be appropriate. You should know that those stylings are generally reserved for youthful  
# entertainment and fashion-based applications. The more versatile option is adding it to  
# your process inks to increase their intensity and shine.  
# Another specialized use is  
# employing a clear version on a project as a security measure, a version only visible when  
# exposed to UV light.  
# JF  
264 **DO utilize color profiles in your workflow**  
# In order to manage and maintain the color of your artwork files, linked RGB images, and  
# graphics, it’s important to use color profiles and embed them into your work as you carry  
# out any project. These profiles will then link to your color management system, which  
# will maintain color consistency as the project moves from the RGB environment of the  
# computer display to the final C  
# MYK print.  
# At the beginning of any job, I always ask  
# myself a number of questions\: How are we printing this? What stock are we using? What  
# is the color composition of the images? All these factors may have an impact on your  
# choice of profile, which in turn plays an important part in maintaining the project’s  
# integrity and appearance. I often speak to the relevant printer and discuss the available  
# options and ask if they have profiles matched to their own presses that I could use. In  
# doing this, I can then be sure that images embedded with the correct profile will display  
# accurately on-screen and that the final print will be consistent with visuals.  
# PD  
265 266 **DON’T allow rich black tints to exceed**  
# 300% ink coverage  
# Printing what is called rich blacks—the black printing with the three other inks \(C  
# MY\)—  
# can be troublesome when the percentage combination of all four colors adds up to more  
# than 300 percent.  
# All printers have a limit on their total area coverage, which refers to the  
# maximum amount of ink allowed in the darkest areas of an image. The percentages vary  
# from a maximum of around 300–340 percent for coated papers to 240–280 percent for  
# uncoated papers. To be safe, I always check the values of any darker images \(a night shot,  
# for example\) to ensure that the blacks of the sky and shadows don’t exceed 300 percent.  
**Not doing this makes the printing diﬃcult to control when on press because of the huge**  
# amount of ink being laid down. It’s also quite wasteful, and too much ink will lead to “set-  
**oﬀ” when drying, which means the image will be pressed onto the following sheet—a**  
**disastrous and very expensive issue to resolve. Set-oﬀ pages can only be fixed by going**  
# back and amending the guilty files—so always check them first!  
# PD  
267 268 **DO specify colors for packaging a little**  
# lighter than you want them to print  
# The very wise Robynne Raye of Modern Dog Design once bestowed upon me an  
# invaluable piece of advice.  
# “Have you ever seen a piece of packaging printed too light?”  
# she asked me. She then revealed that she often sets the final files up a uniform 5 percent  
# lighter than the versions proposed and approved, knowing that the gain on press will still  
# likely leave them with a darker final product than expected. Decades into packaging  
# assignments, I wish that her observation weren’t true, but all you need to do is ask  
269 **yourself if you have ever seen a package on a shelf and thought that they held back a little**  
# on the ink for this one. The packaging for consumer items is often produced at various  
# stages of the overall production cycle with the printer—sometimes printed with several  
# other jobs, sometimes with jobs for other clients, or in insanely long print runs that use  
# rubber plates. This means that the compromises that need to be made will vary. Trust me  
# when I say that the press person will always add more ink.  
# JF  
270 **DON’T ever specify a color for print**  
# based on its on-screen appearance  
# This is an age-old problem that is still relevant today. When you look at colors on the  
# screen, you see an RGB representation of the color, which is never entirely accurate.  
# An  
# electronic representation of a C  
# MYK or Pantone color will not be the same as ink on  
# paper.  
# Although the two can get close on occasion, there will never be a perfect match.  
**This has always caused diﬃculties for designers and for clients, as what they see on their**  
# screen they believe will carry across and be printed. In addition, what they see on their  
271 **screens will look diﬀerent than when viewed on your screen. To guarantee the correct**  
# color is printed, I always use the color breakdowns or references supplied in the  
# appropriate Pantone book and make sure the client sees them.  
# Obtaining a proof will also  
# ensure that they understand how the colors will reproduce in the final product.  
# Be safe,  
# never sorry.  
# PD  
272 **DO learn about underpainting**  
# Some people understand underpainting. Everyone else doesn’t know how to paint. I was  
# a terrible student in my college painting class. I just didn’t know it. My instructor tried to  
# explain what was lacking in my work by insisting that I take a painting I had completed  
# and paint an entirely new piece on top of it. This stopped me from being precious about  
# my work and also sent me on the most important color exploration of my life. Every  
# single thing that I know about how colors interact with one another was informed by the  
# experience. Midway through the course, she took time to fully flesh out how under-  
# painting works. Using only one paint color, I learned to make a monochromatic sketch on  
# my canvas that added a uniform base and visual style for my final piece. Later, I also  
# learned how important layers of color could be—how yellow under the green grass was  
**diﬀerent from brown. It changed everything.**  
# JF  
273 **DO ask your client color questions**  
# A  
# fter agonizing for weeks over a presentation to a huge nonprofit organization about  
# their fund-raising gala materials, I was stunned to hear, five minutes into the meeting,  
# that none of my options would work. My side of the room was still pulling their jaws back  
# in place when I noticed the telltale look in the eyes of my main contacts sitting across  
# from me. They could have told me this would happen. The reason was that the executive  
# director’s wife hated a certain color, one that made conceptual sense and was strewn  
# throughout all of the options. It is an extreme example, but I knew that I had forgotten a  
# vital step in my usual process\: asking if there is anything I need to know about my client  
# and colors.  
# Always ask in advance, but also be sure to ask following feedback.  
# Can I never  
# use green again? Or should I just shy away from that particular green? It will save you a  
# lot of trouble. Trust me.  
# JF  
274 **DO respect an emotional response to a**  
# color from a client  
# One of the most frustrating things about working in design is when a client makes a  
# subjective comment on color. Some of us, myself included, have set up presentation  
# processes to circumvent this as much as possible. However, it would be terribly naive,  
# and detrimental to your professional progress, to think that this will never occur. When  
# your client says that they can’t fathom using orange in their branding, because it was the  
# color of their rival high school growing up, what do you do? If you think you are going to  
# have any success forcing them to see the reasoning behind using that color, even if you  
# are branding an orange juice company, you won’t. When that emotional/irrational  
# response happens, adjust, adapt, and, most of all, respect it. You don’t have to agree with  
# it.  
# But you are in your client’s shoes, burdened by their color history.  
# JF  
275 **DON’T get caught up in trendy colors for**  
# projects that need to stand the test of  
# time  
# If you were dressing a person and knew that they had to wear the same clothes for ten,  
# twenty, thirty years or more, would you dress them in bell-bottom jeans? Give them  
# feathered Farrah Fawcett hair, or better yet, a Mohawk?  
# Pierce their nose, or cover them  
# in tattoos? Or would you research clothes until you determined what was built to last and  
# what was trendy and sure to fall out of fashion soon? I hope that you would put in the  
# time to do the research. When you are doing the same on your design projects, creating a  
276 **final product or brand that holds its look far past today, you should take even greater care.**  
# Ignore those lists of what colors are hot and seem to be filled with made-up names for  
# nonexistent fruits, and make solid decisions based on research and strategic thinking.  
# JF  
277 **DO remember that the popularity of**  
# certain colors shifts rapidly  
# Each year, many organizations publish lists of colors that will be in fashion the  
# subsequent year.  
# One year, we are told that silver is the color to use to be relevant. The  
# next year, brown is the new black.  
# A designer must stay current with popular culture,  
# taste, and attitudes.  
# But the designer should lead, not follow. When someone says, “That  
# color is so dated,” they are seeing it in a specific context.  
# Avocado green will look dated on  
# a 1970s refrigerator.  
# Avocado green could appear fresh and current on an iPhone cover.  
# Coral will be dated on a 1955 Cadillac. It could be perfect for an identity for a forward-  
# thinking nonprofit institution. The lesson is to create your own rules. If color is used with  
# confidence in purposeful and bold ways, it will be appropriate and original.  
# SA  
278 **DO recognize that color palettes change**  
# depending on an audience’s age  
# One of the most valued abilities in design and advertising is the ability to create for an  
# audience outside your age group. The rabid pursuit of young consumers has made this  
# talent, especially considering that kids can’t enter the workplace to do this for  
# themselves, a golden commodity. With the graying of our populations, an entirely new  
# marketplace has opened up, and marketing to it has become a clear specialty. While many  
**factors go into reaching these diﬀerent groups, one interesting factor, often forgotten, is**  
**that age directly aﬀects how the viewer reacts to color.**  
# Children recognize only a smaller  
# range of colors and respond to a widened palette as they grow older.  
# Children also make  
279 **early associations with specific colors \(apples are red\) and embrace bold and bright**  
# colors.  
# As we become more savvy, or jaded, we also accept a wider range of colors and  
# their applications.  
# JF  
280 **DO research the color palettes of your**  
# client’s competitors  
# Strange things can be revealed when a designer compiles a visual grouping of a client’s  
# competition. Typically, a clear language is visible, and a part of this language is color. For  
# example, a search for financial institutions will disclose vast swaths of navy blues and  
# forest greens. The designer then has the choice to either follow suit or go another way.  
# A  
# designer with little courage will look at the competitive research and determine that the  
# client should look the same. The client may even say, “But everyone else uses blue.”  
# Conformity is valuable in the armed services; it is damaging in a competitive  
# marketplace. The designer’s job is to identify a client’s strengths, weaknesses,  
# competitors, and values, and then to create a visual solution that sets the client apart or  
# above the competition.  
# SA  
281 **DON’T let your personal color**  
# preferences hurt a project  
282 **Consider the design of a book cover for a noted writer’s new romantic novel. She has used**  
# carnation pink on each of her twelve other novels. Her bedroom is carnation pink, and  
# her nickname is Pinky.  
# Pink, however, makes you recoil. You consider it weak and a sign  
# of women’s oppression. What should you do? Clearly, using carnation pink is the correct  
# choice. Trying to convince the author that your favorite colors, ochre and black, are  
**better choices will have two eﬀects. It will make the client angry, and you will be fired.**  
# More important, however, is that the ochre and black would damage Pinky’s brand. The  
# money and time spent to reinforce the identification of pink with Pinky will be annulled.  
# Bluntly, pursuing your own personal color choice over the needs of the project will ruin  
# lives.  
# SA  
283 **DO design logos in black and white**  
# before applying color  
# Already established is the fact that clients may react emotionally to the colors that we  
# present to them.  
# Also, logos need to fit equally well applied on any item, from letterhead  
# and signage to embroidery and everything in between. Now that we have talked through  
# all of the pitfalls, it is the perfect time to give you a little secret into how to circumvent  
# them. Working with your logo designs in black and white will help guarantee that the  
# vector applications work well. Using only black and white while talking about the process  
# with your client will also create solid acceptance of your design, without eliminating  
# something because it was presented in a disliked color.  
# Only the best designs will survive.  
# Those conversations will also provide the base for your final color decisions.  
# Often, both  
# sides will find that they already know the colors they want in the final solution.  
# And never  
# forget, if it works in black and white, it will work in most any color.  
# JF  
284 **DO remember that color + time can =**  
# brand  
285 **One of the most incredible marketing eﬀorts, tied directly to color, took place over the**  
# last few years. The shipping giant UPS has had the brown color as part of its identity  
# since its earliest days, chosen for its dignified and professional appearance. Now, eighty  
# years later, its entire campaign is based around simply calling the company itself  
# “brown.” It is a stunning acknowledgment of how important the color is to the way  
# consumers identify and interact with the company.  
# Built through constant  
# reinforcement, from its delivery vehicles to its employee uniforms, UPS has owned  
# brown in the marketplace to such an extent that they can simply refer to themselves as  
# such. This campaign stands as a vital reminder of how important color can be as a brand  
# asset. It brings to mind companies with incredibly strong brands that lack in the logo  
# department and the decades built on instantly recognizing the Coca-Cola red that sits on  
# the supermarket shelf.  
# JF  
286 **DO accept that there is no such thing as**  
# a bad color combination  
# Rules are meant to be broken. There are valuable and appropriate rules for color.  
# But  
# once a designer reaches a level of proficiency and confidence with color, all rules are  
# thrown out the window.  
# Bad color combinations are timid color combinations. The  
# viewer will sense when a designer is unsure and inhibited.  
# A small patch of violet on the  
# page against an equally wispy patch of lime green will look like an error. Slamming violet  
# and lime green together in a large and bold way will make them look exactly right. Van  
# Gogh combined yellow with rust. In the hands of a lesser artist, timidly applying a small  
# amount here and there, the solution would have been regrettable. Van Gogh’s Twelve  
# Sunflowers is perfect. Doing something bravely and with self-confidence will always  
# convince others that you are correct.

288 **DON’T use stock images just to save**  
# money  
# Don’t get me wrong—I love the fact that we can go online nowadays and find 87,000  
**diﬀerent shots of two businessmen shaking hands while grinning inanely at each other.**  
# This is ultimately a good thing because, if that’s the kind of image you need for a project,  
# the bulk availability and lower overheads of online picture libraries mean stock images  
# are now a relatively inexpensive option. However, you should always think carefully  
# about whether a completely unique image would serve your client better. Remember that  
# other designers can download the same photos or illustrations you’ve selected for their  
# own clients, and the better \(and therefore more popular\) images are pushed to the top of  
289 **the list when you search by subject. If you think your client can aﬀord original**  
# photography or illustration, always try to persuade them to consider that option first. It  
# helps to keep the freelance community in work too.  
# TS  
290 **DO always check to see if a perfect stock**  
# photo might be available  
291 **A very famous designer once told me a story about how one of his most iconic posters**  
# almost didn’t happen. The client wanted a figure interacting with a specific, immediately  
# recognizable cityscape. He was limited in his options and joked to the client that if they  
# rented a helicopter, he could easily get the image. They begged him to at least give it a try.  
**He scoﬀed and thought about just telling them that he researched without luck, so**  
# hopeless seemed the task. He did a quick stock search, only to discover a photographer  
# who specialized in that region, leaving him with a number of options and an incredibly  
# happy client, amazed that he so diligently succeeded in finding such a seemingly rare  
# image.  
# JF  
292 **DO do your best to use client-supplied**  
# images  
# I see you staring at me, that slightly out-of-focus shot of the executive director and four  
# other people who seem mildly important.  
# One of them displays his expensive watch, and  
# they’re all drinking glasses of wine. I can feel you edging your way toward my precious  
# magazine spread. The one I have been filling up with pull quotes and about which I’ve  
# been informing the client that there was no room for you.  
# Besides the many image edits  
**you would require, I take oﬀense that you have been forced on me. You can feel my**  
# disdain, but you move forward undeterred. When my back is turned, you inch directly on  
# top of my monitor, and whisper, “I pay your salary.” A bead of sweat forms on my  
# forehead, as I realize that I have been approaching this all wrong.  
# As I turn to the monitor,  
# resigned to make you the best image you can possibly be, you smile and add, “  
# Plus, I come  
**preapproved.” JF**  
293 **DO also show a client better alternatives**  
# to their own imagery if necessary  
# Most clients have not been educated as designers. They haven’t studied the history of  
# photography. They don’t understand complex rules of composition.  
# And they don’t need  
# to.  
# Clients understand the rules of their respective fields. This may lead to a client  
# supplying really awful imagery. It may be blurry photographs taken by a friend who is  
# interested in photography. It may be simplistic drawings of a client’s pets, drawn by a  
# relative.  
# Or it may be a photograph that sends the wrong message. When the project is  
# finished, there will be no note on the bad images that reads, “This was chosen by the  
# client.” The failure of the project will be on the designer. When faced with bad  
# photography, art, or information graphics, the designer should find a better solution and  
# present it as an alternative. Forcing this down the client’s throat rarely works. Tactful  
# and logical explanation, showing both alternatives, is the best approach.  
# SA  
294 **DON’T assume that an image is good**  
# simply because it’s been published online  
# There are many websites devoted to photography sharing. These allow people around the  
# globe to upload their own images and share them with anyone or everyone else. They are  
# remarkable tools to gaze into the lives of everyday people everywhere.  
# But just because  
# an image has been published online or on a photo sharing site does not make it good.  
# There is no seasoned photography curator accepting the good images and rejecting the  
295 **bad ones.**  
# Of course, some images may be remarkable; other images may be awful. The  
# majority of the images are created not by professional photographers but by everyone  
# else. Would I ask my four-year-old nephew to photograph an urban streetscape for an  
# architecture client’s website? Is my mother’s photograph of her dog in a funny coat a good  
# choice for a corporate capabilities booklet? No. When you’re facing budgetary issues,  
# stock image websites are the best source for stock images. However, hiring a  
# photographer to shoot an original image is typically the best approach.  
# SA  
296 **DON’T repulse your audience with**  
# imagery unless briefed to do so  
# Shocking images are a valuable tool for the designer.  
# An image that challenges viewers, or  
# forces them to acknowledge an issue, is one of the strongest forms of communication.  
# Repulsive and aggressive images are part of this canon. In the right context, this type of  
# imagery can create a result that is spectacular. Repulsive images used for shock value  
**alone are pandering. The solution may receive the desired attention, but the lasting eﬀect**  
# will be one of anger and negativity. If the client is the Sex Pistols, this response may be  
297 **appropriate. Most clients, however, would prefer to create a positive reaction. No**  
# communication is ever neutral. The response will always be clear or confused, positive or  
# negative. The designer’s role is to help guide that perception toward positive and clear.  
# SA  
298 **DO carefully consider the political**  
# content of all image choices  
299 **In the 1930s, the Nazi Party began to censor art it considered politically degenerate.**  
# Obviously, anti-Nazi art was the first censored.  
# As time passed, the political content of 95  
# percent of art produced was deemed degenerate, and the state only allowed benign  
# landscape paintings to be exhibited. Every image has political content.  
# A photograph of a  
# group of people can immediately be deconstructed by race, gender, age, and culture. Even  
**an inoﬀensive landscape painting can be seen as propaganda. Understanding the political**  
# implications of images, icons, and messages is a necessity for designers. Is the woman in  
# a bikini holding a beer simply a picture of someone at the beach? Or is the image,  
# according to feminist theory, an example of the objectification and oppression of women  
# by a patriarchal culture?  
# Each designer will need to determine this for himself or herself.  
# Purposefully using an image and recognizing its political subtext is a basic skill.  
# SA  
300 **DON’T run detailed images across the**  
# gutter  
# A  
# full-bleed image run across a spread in a book or magazine creates great visual impact,  
# and some pictures cry out to be used as large as possible. Magnificent landscapes or  
# architectural shots can work really well, especially when they’re overlaid with a strong  
# typographic headline to open an article or chapter. Take care though, as it’s easy to forget  
# one vital detail—the gutter. When we design spreads, we normally work “spread to view”  
# so we can see left and right pages side by side.  
# On a flat computer screen, we tend to  
# overlook the importance of the gutter because it’s represented only by a fine rule, but in a  
# bound magazine or book, much of the viewable page immediately adjacent to the gutter  
# can disappear into the spine. Images like impressive landscapes can usually absorb this,  
301 **but others, like portraits, won’t. The cardinal sin is to slice through someone’s face with**  
**the gutter. Don’t cut oﬀ someone’s nose to show the face. Take care to ensure that gutters**  
# only pass through neutral image spaces.  
# TS  
302 **DO check that all images have an**  
**eﬀective 300ppi resolution**  
# The industry standard resolution for printing four-color halftones is 300ppi. I say ppi  
# \(pixels per inch\) rather than dpi \(dots per inch\) nowadays, as the vast majority of image  
# reproduction involves a digital workflow, and pixels are more representative of image  
**resolution. It’s generally accepted that the average human eye can’t diﬀerentiate pixel**  
# densities beyond 300ppi, which explains why this is the recommended resolution for  
# high-quality image reproduction.  
# Other factors such as halftone screens \(see page 247\)  
# also influence this choice. Say you have your 300ppi image at 4 × 6 inches.  
# As long as you  
# import the image to your layout at the same size \(or smaller\), you’ll maintain a resolution  
# of at least 300ppi, and the print will theoretically look great. However, if you enlarge the  
# image on the page, you’ll lose resolution. For example, enlarging the image to 8 × 12  
# inches halves the resolution to 150ppi, which will degrade the quality of the final print.  
# The trick is, unless you have no alternative, never enlarge a 300ppi image beyond 100  
# percent within your layout.  
# TS  
303 **DON’T import images with too high a**  
# resolution  
304 **We know that 300ppi is the industry standard resolution for quality printing, but what**  
# happens if we scan a halftone image at 600ppi? You might think it’ll look twice as good  
# when printed, but sadly you’d be wrong. In some cases, slight improvements can be  
# detected in images printed at a higher resolution than 300ppi, but it’s more of a fluke than  
# anything else. The truth is that the extra resolution is wasted, serving only to make the  
# document size larger than it needs to be and slowing down all prepress processing. In  
# addition to this, banding \(an uneven gradation of tone\) can occur with images above  
# 300ppi because the resolution doesn’t correspond favorably with the commonly used  
# 150lpi \(lines per inch\) halftone \(see page 247\). If you send PDFs to print rather than  
# original layout files, there’s a good chance that any imported images over 300ppi will be  
# resampled down to 300ppi anyway.  
# TS  
305 **DO resample all images to 300ppi before**  
# importing them to a print document  
306 **When working on any book design project, I receive hundreds of images to choose from.**  
# Invariably, these images will be a mix of resolutions—some high resolution \(300ppi\) and  
# others that have been shot digitally, which, although large in dimension, are only 72ppi in  
# resolution. If I were to place these latter images at 100 percent in my layout, I would in  
**eﬀect be including low-resolution artwork, which is never of high enough quality to print**  
# with. It is essential, therefore, that you consolidate resolutions to ensure that all images  
# you use are hi-res. To locate the lo-res images before you import them into a layout, use  
# software such as Adobe Bridge and adjust the resolution using Photoshop. If there are a  
# lot of inconsistencies, run an automated action in Photoshop for the adjustments, but  
# make sure that you constrain the proportions with the resolution so the images scale  
# down correctly. Following this process means you can guarantee that every image will  
# reproduce at least 300ppi as long as you do not scale them above 100 percent in the  
# layout.  
# PD  
307 **DO learn about digital file formats**  
**We’re really talking about the various image file formats here, all of which diﬀer slightly**  
# and provide their own unique advantages. TIFFs \(Tagged Image File Format\) remain a  
# top choice for print workflows, as they can accommodate embedded information such as  
# alpha channels, which allow masks to be imported directly into a layout. Native  
# Photoshop files are also a popular choice for the same reasons. J  
# P  
# EGs \(Joint  
# Photographic Experts Group\) are great if you need to keep file sizes down, but be careful  
**how much compression you apply when saving, as quality can suﬀer.**  
# J  
# P  
# A  
# EG is also a bad  
# choice if you think you’ll need to edit the image farther down the line, as quality is lost  
# every time you save a J  
# P  
# EG. Forget about E  
# PS files \(Encapsulated PostScript\), as they’re  
# rarely used now—go with native Illustrator files for vectors.  
# PNGs \(Portable Network  
**Graphic\) are popular formats for online use, oﬀering the advantage of transparency**  
# support. I recommend some further reading, as you may find you’ve not been using the  
# best formats in your own image workflows.  
# TS  
308 **DO learn about bit depth**  
# Bit depth is the number of bits, or binary digits, assigned to each pixel in an image.  
# Bit  
# depth isn’t about resolution, it’s about color quality—the higher the bit depth, the more  
# tones you can achieve—subtle color gradations improve as bit depth increases.  
# Pure  
**black-and-white images in which each pixel is either on \(black\) or oﬀ \(white\) are termed**  
# 1-bit.  
# Black-and-white halftones with gradations from black to white are 8-bit, with 8 bits  
# of color information per pixel.  
# Color RGB images are 24-bit because there are 8 bits of  
# color information per channel, so 8 × 3 = 24.  
# Photoshop can handle up to 32 bits per  
# channel, or 96-bit images, but you’ll find that many adjustments and filters won’t work at  
# this bit depth, and any extra quality provided may be lost during print. When working  
# with 48- or 96-bit originals, it might pay to create a 24-bit copy for use in your layout.  
# Check with your print supplier to see what they can achieve with their equipment.  
# TS  
309 **DO understand the relationship between**  
# resolution and image size  
# This is a pretty straightforward relationship, but it’s important to understand how  
**resolution and image size aﬀect each other.**  
# Any original image recorded by a camera or  
# scanner has its resolution set by the device. However, if you then resize it in InDesign to  
# make it either more or less than 100 percent its original size, the resolution will change.  
# A  
# 300ppi image won’t create more pixels when you enlarge it; the pixels will simply get  
# bigger and more visible, thus reducing the quality of the reproduction. For example,  
# enlarging a 300ppi image to 600 percent within your layout will reduce the resolution to  
# 50ppi. If you’re interested in how the math works, it’s 100 ÷ 600 × 300.  
# Alternatively, set  
**your Links panel to list the eﬀective ppi for imported images, and you’ll easily spot any**  
# image with a resolution that has transgressed acceptable boundaries. You can get away  
# with less than 300ppi if you have to, but don’t make a habit of it.  
# TS  
310 **DO understand the relationship between**  
# image resolution and halftone screens  
# All four-color process images are made from dots and are alternatively referred to as  
# halftones.  
# A photographic print isn’t made from dots and is known as a continuous-tone  
# \(contone\) print. Screening is the term used to describe how a contone is converted to a  
# halftone. The chosen print method and paper stock must be taken into account when  
# selecting which halftone screen to use, with a higher value providing better print quality.  
# A screen resolution of 150lpi is standard for quality printing, while a newspaper will use  
# a screen as low as 70–80lpi. The coarser screen will actually help prevent individual dots  
# from merging when inking the more absorbent newsprint. The relationship between  
# image resolution and screen resolution is simple enough in that image resolution should  
# be about twice that of the screen used, hence the industry standard of 300ppi and 150lpi.  
# There’s some leeway in the equation. Softer images without many straight lines or angles  
# will stand up to coarser screening than anything containing much in the way of fine  
# detail.  
# TS  
311 **DO choose images based on their**  
# appropriateness as well as their quality  
312 **Is it better to use a great shot that’s not a perfect exposure or a perfect exposure that’s not**  
# quite the best shot? Ultimately, the decision might not be yours, as your client may value  
# slick presentation over content quality, but for me, choosing the shot that’s the most  
# appropriate is always the better decision. Think about all the wonderful images that have  
# come out of the journalism field, which does not prioritize getting a perfect exposure.  
# How about those lucky accidental shots when you were doing the right thing by looking  
# down the lens rather than at the settings on the back of the camera. When you look at the  
# very best images, a pattern emerges—content is king.  
# Beautifully exposed images that are  
# exactly right for a cover or spread are, of course, the ideal option, but it’s wrong to choose  
# an image purely because of its technical quality. The reaction and the emotion a shot  
# creates in the viewer must always take precedence.  
# TS  
313 **DO devise a system for the consistent**  
# naming of digital image files  
**It can be diﬃcult when you are working on a large-scale project to manage and identify**  
# the many files that have been supplied. In some instances, a client or a publisher may  
# have supplied the image files with logical and consistent names and in an organized  
# manner.  
# Often, though, you may not be so lucky, in which case it’s worthwhile to organize  
# and rename the files yourself before importing them. This will enable you to find and  
# compare images more easily and to maintain the correct links if the files are ever moved  
# between workstations or servers. For book and brochure projects, you may choose to use  
# the chapter and folio numbers as a prefix for the image, so they appear in running order  
# when listed alphabetically. However, if the pagination changes, this method may cause  
# confusion—a simple system of unique numbering and/or coding that doesn’t follow a  
# page order may prove to be more dependable in the long run.  
# By taking stock of what you  
# have and how the design is structured, a system of organization will likely become  
# evident.  
# PD  
314 **DO work with Camera Raw image files**  
# Adobe Camera Raw is, in a word, brilliant. If you shoot \(or receive a shot\) as a J  
# P  
# EG or  
# TIFF, it is what it is. You can adjust it, color correct it, resize it within reason, but that’s  
# basically it.  
# Camera Raw is like having an oldstyle film negative because you can go back  
# to the original to create new versions from scratch.  
# A Camera Raw file contains all the  
# raw data recorded by the camera at the point the picture was shot.  
# Camera Raw files  
# aren’t compressed or subjected to any in-camera processing, so you can do a whole lot  
# more with them when you open them up in Photoshop’s Camera Raw plug-in. You can  
# reset temperature \(or white balance\), tint, exposure, brightness and contrast, clarity and  
315 **vibrancy, and a whole host of other adjustments. You can even open images at a size**  
# larger than the original, which can be very handy indeed.  
# Ask your photographer for or

316 **DO utilize Adobe’s DNG format when**  
# archiving images  
# We just mentioned how good Adobe Camera Raw is, but it does have its limitations. The  
# format is governed by the make and model of supported cameras, and the Camera Raw  
# plug-in can’t guarantee that it’ll support every camera forever. This means that there may  
# come a time when you won’t be able to open an archived image. Enter the solution—  
# Adobe’s DNG \(digital negative\) format. Saving your images as DNG files removes the  
# compatibility issue. They become “time proof,” making them a much better option for  
# archiving, and you can still open them with the Camera Raw plug-in. The file sizes are  
317 **slightly smaller too, which isn’t a bad thing, and there are cataloging advantages to boot.**  
# This is a huge advantage if you choose to follow the advice on page 252 and create a  
# Digital Asset Management \(DA  
# M\) system. DNG is the way to go.  
# TS  
318 **DO use DAM to catalog image files**  
# What’s more boring, cataloging all your photographic images and illustrations or  
# spending all day searching for that great shot that you may or may not still have on file  
# somewhere?  
# Personally, I would say the latter is more dull and definitely more  
# frustrating. DA  
# M sounds like the dull option, but it’s actually really easy to do once you’ve  
# got your system in place. You can buy specialist software like Extensis Portfolio, which  
# creates standalone catalogs of all your images, or digital assets, as they all have potential  
# commercial value. If you don’t want to fork out for extra software, you can use something  
# like Photos, which comes standard with every Mac, or perhaps the Google Photos online  
# photo album service.  
# Alternatively, you can just file images carefully in named folders  
319 **and use Adobe Bridge for your image searches. Whatever system you go for, get a grip on**  
# metadata, which is defined as “data about data.” Use metadata to embed key words into  
# your image files, and tracking them down in the future will be a breeze.  
# TS  
320 **DO always apply some sharpening to**  
# digital images  
# On close inspection, many images shot with a digital camera will appear to be slightly  
# blurred. This happens because, just like the grain produced in shots from old-style film  
# cameras, digital sensors produce a random speckling of tiny electronic dots across the  
# shot, known as noise. Digital cameras attempt to suppress noise by setting sharpness to  
# the lowest acceptable level, which means that postproduction sharpening will be  
# necessary. Your photographer may do this for you as part of his or her contract along with  
# any required color adjustments, but if not, the odds are that you’ll be using Photoshop to  
# do this yourself. Use Unsharp Mask or Smart Sharpen; don’t use the basic Sharpen filter,  
**as it’s an all-or-nothing option and oﬀers no real control over the end result.**  
# A word of  
# warning—don’t overdo it.  
# Oversharpened images look worse than the “straight from  
# camera” shot, so easy does it.  
# Oh, one more thing, complete any and all image  
# adjustments before you apply any sharpening. It should always be the last thing you do  
# before importing the image to your layout.  
# TS  
321 **DON’T crop well-composed images**  
# excessively  
# When an artist sits down at their easel to sketch out the composition of a painting,  
# they’re thinking carefully about what’s happening at the edges of the work as well as  
# what’s happening at the center. Imagine how horrified they would be if they were to walk  
**into a gallery, only to find that a picture framer had decided to chop six inches oﬀ the top**  
# of their work so it lined up nicely with the other paintings on the adjacent wall.  
# Photographers do the same thing when they look through a camera viewfinder and  
# compose the shot, and photographic images should be treated the same way as paintings.  
# Sure, not all photographs need to be treated with the same reverence, and some are shot  
# with the intention that they be cropped at will, but something like a fine landscape image  
# or an immaculately composed portrait should be treated with respect and cropped as the  
# photographer intended. It’s kind of rude to crop heavily without good cause.  
# TS  
322 **DON’T crop landscape to portrait and**  
# vice versa  
# Another professional’s work should always be treated with respect. This is no less true  
# when working with a photographer; their experience and creative “eye” for a good shot  
# contribute to the careful composition and formatting of each photograph they produce.  
**By taking their picture and cropping to a diﬀerent format, you are likely degrading the**  
**overall quality of the image and negatively aﬀecting its composition—as well as being**  
# disrespectful of the photographer! Most photographers I know often take a landscape  
# and a portrait of the same subject matter, with the orientation dictating their choice of  
# composition.  
# Check if there is an alternative before you start laying out your design. This  
# rule goes for any type of image, art reproduction, or illustrated work too. Meet the  
# challenge and work with what you are given.  
# PD  
323 **DO use the right Photoshop tools for**  
# color adjustment  
324 **If you feel that an image needs color adjustment, it may well need a bit of tonal**  
# adjustment first.  
**Color is directly aﬀected by tonal adjustments because saturation will**  
# increase or decrease when darkening or lightening an image, so check Levels first. Don’t  
# bother with Brightness and Contrast, as the adjustment isn’t sophisticated enough. Drag  
# the black and white point sliders of the Layers dialogue in to meet the ends of the  
# histogram to achieve good tonal balance.  
# A Color Balance adjustment can solve simple  
# color problems, but for better results you need to study the workings of the Curves  
# adjustment. It’s not that complicated and is arguably the most powerful adjustment tool  
# in the whole kit. Read up about the popular S-Curve approach to color adjustment, and  
# you’ll be well on the way to becoming a real pro. Knowledge of the color wheel will help  
# you here too. Here’s a little side tip for any adjustment procedure\: decide what the worst  
# issue is and deal with that first. It may be all that’s needed.  
# TS  
325 **DO always edit images nondestructively**  
# Since they were first introduced way back in 1994, Layers have always been one of the  
# best things about Adobe Photoshop. In 1996, the functionality of the Layers panel took  
# another leap forward with the addition of  
# Adjustment Layers. Now, can you think of any  
# reason you wouldn’t want to take advantage of what’s termed nondestructive editing by  
# using those wonderful Adjustment Layers? It’s nondestructive because if you change  
# your mind about any of the edits you apply, you can readjust them or take them out  
# completely, so this is a bit of a no-brainer, to be honest. However, some folks still manage  
# to forget all about them and either apply adjustments directly to an original image or  
# make endless saved-as versions of files in case they want to go back to an earlier version.  
# This is completely crazy and pretty much inexcusable!  
# As you can see, I feel quite  
# strongly about this one, so check out those Adjustment Layers and use them well, even  
# for basic Levels or Curves adjustments.  
# TS  
326 **DO worship Smart Filters**  
# We know that nondestructive adjustments are the way to go, as discussed on page 257,  
**but what happens when we want to apply other eﬀects without permanently changing**  
# the original image? When Photoshop CS3 was released in 2007, it was the end of a long  
# wait \(after the arrival of  
# Adjustment Layers\) for the brilliant Smart Filters. Smart Filters  
# are possible because of Smart Objects, introduced in CS2 to allow more flexible ways of  
# working with scalable vector graphics and are basically Adjustment Layers for filters.  
# All  
# you have to do is open your original as a Smart Object and apply whichever filters you  
# care to choose. Each applied Smart Filter is linked in a stack to the selected layer and can  
# be edited with Blending Options or reordered as many times as you like or deleted  
327 **completely if you decide you don’t need it after all. They’re applied as a Layer Mask, so**  
# you can also paint areas out to reveal the original image beneath without the applied  
# filters. What’s not to like about that? Smart Filters deserve the attention.  
# TS  
328 **DO eschew deletion in favor of masking**  
# Returning to the theme of nondestructive editing, creating cutouts can also be given the  
# same treatment through the use of Layer Masks. I prefer to keep as many previous  
# workings of an image as is practical because I may, for whatever reason, need to return to  
# an earlier version.  
# On the flip side, I don’t really like keeping dozens of files labeled  
# version 1, version 2, etc., so a mask carries the advantage of not deleting any data from an  
# image. You can always revert to the original if need be. In addition, tiny adjustments can  
# easily be made to a Layer Mask with a small brush, and Photoshop’s excellent Select and  
# Mask tool provides options for detecting, adjusting, smoothing, and feathering any  
# selection. The one thing you always have to remember if you create a cutout with a mask  
# is to check the Save Transparency box when you save the image. You also have to save as  
# either a TIFF or a PSD, since J  
# P  
# EGs can’t contain multiple layers.  
# TS  
329 **DO create clipping paths in Photoshop—**  
# not in InDesign  
330 **It’s easy to create a quick clipping path in InDesign using the built-in functionality, and**  
# it’s equally easy to create a frame directly from the resulting clipping path. This is fine for  
**a one-oﬀ job that needs to be turned around quickly or for something you’re unlikely to**  
# come back to or edit. However, it’s not really the best way to create a proper clipping path,  
**as it only aﬀects the picture box used in your layout.**  
# Additionally, it’s unlikely that the  
# InDesign clipping path will be quite so accurate as the one you first created in Photoshop  
# as part of the original image.  
# Photoshop provides so many more options for creating all  
# kinds of paths and allows you to refine and feather edges in ways that InDesign doesn’t.  
# Remember, too, that if you use the image again elsewhere, your cutout work is already  
# done. Never try to create a clipping path from a polygonal picture box drawn directly in  
# InDesign. It’s a really shoddy way of working, and your print supplier will hate you  
# forever, so best not to, I reckon.

331 **DO always include a photography or**  
# illustration credit when it’s due  
# Image © Tony Seddon 2011  
# A good editorial layout depends very highly on skillful use of space, good typography, and  
# an eye for structure and navigation. However, if the piece is also illustrated, the images  
# are more than likely the element that first elicits a response from the reader. The best  
# layout in the world will never fully succeed if the images are only okay, and will fail  
# miserably if the images are just plain bad. Given this, it’s really only proper \(and polite\) to  
# make sure that the person who created the great photographs or illustrations for a piece  
# gets credited. It doesn’t have to be in 16pt text underneath every image, but if someone  
# wants to know who shot the images for the fashion article or who created the cool  
# vintage-look illustrations for the music feature, they should be able to find that  
332 **information. The majority of photographers and illustrators are freelancers and need to**  
# publicize themselves constantly with the work they do for others. It’s important to try to  
# provide that platform for anyone you work with.

333 **DO allow a photographer or illustrator to**  
# input creatively whenever possible  
# Image courtesy of Nikon  
# I’ve been fortunate to work with some incredibly gifted professionals during my career.  
# These individuals are specialists in their fields and are extremely creative,  
# knowledgeable, and experienced. I’ve found it’s always worthwhile to listen to what they  
# have to say, whether it is a suggestion or an observation. Invariably, their comments will  
# add value and improve your project.  
# Of course, you don’t have to take on every suggestion  
# they make, but it pays to listen, since you never know what may come out of the  
# discussion. There have been a number of occasions when I’ve been on a photo shoot, and  
# the photographer and I have struggled to get an image of a product to work. Despite our  
**eﬀorts, the shot wouldn’t come together, even though the initial idea was great! It’s at**  
# times like these that open communication and a willingness to listen will benefit all  
# parties and result in solutions that lead to successful work.  
# PD  
334 **DON’T edit an illustrator’s original work**  
# without permission  
# As with a photographer’s work, it is important to be respectful of an illustrator’s output.  
# I’ve worked with many; if you brief them correctly and thoroughly, the work they produce  
# will fulfill all the requirements and often exceed expectations. However, there will be the  
# odd occasion when changes need to be made to the illustration, whether it’s adding or  
# removing elements, altering colors, or adjusting the size. In these situations, go back to  
# the illustrator and ask for the changes to be done. It is more professional, and the  
335 **commissioning contract will often include a clause prohibiting modifications to their**  
# work without permission. The last thing you want to do is break the terms of a contract  
# for what will likely appear to be a simple change. Explain the situation, and they will most  
# likely accommodate any alteration requests.

# If there’s a good argument supporting why you should personally create illustrations or  
# shoot photographs for a layout you’re working on, then fair enough.  
# Perhaps you’re  
# genuinely the best choice for that particular task—no reason why you shouldn’t be—but  
# there’s more to it than illustration and photography skills. Time is also a major factor, and  
# the more you decide to do yourself, the more time you’ll need. I have a confession to make  
# —in the past I’ve made bad decisions about how much I personally took on for projects  
337 **when I could easily have delegated work to others while staying within budget. These**  
# decisions are sometimes driven by a desire to increase your personal stamp on a project  
# or simply that you really enjoy the tasks. Take a step back and answer the following  
**question\: Am I truly the best choice for the work? Do I want to be in the oﬃce until 2**  
# a.m.

# L  
# R camera in case  
# you have no budget for photography  
# Part of my education required that I take a color and black-and-white photography class.  
# In retrospect, it was probably one of the three most important classes I have ever taken.  
# Not only did it teach me some visual framing techniques but also, more importantly, it  
# made me comfortable with holding a decent camera in my hands and expecting decent  
# results to come from using it. Little did I know that I would need those skills in tight-  
# budget assignments, shooting band portraits for album packaging, menu photos for small  
339 **restaurants, and anything else that was financially out of reach. I always use top people**  
# when I can, but that isn’t always possible. Now, with everything digital, I shoot my  
# portfolio as well, and not a day goes by when I don’t shoot something for reference or for  
# use as a base to manipulate for an image or a texture in an illustration. I love my camera,  
# and it loves me back.  
# JF  
340 **DO accept that your phone is not**  
# necessarily your best camera  
# Today, we all walk around with a powerful camera packed with features in our back  
# pockets. This wasn’t always the case; not so long ago, a phone’s built-in camera was not  
# capable of capturing an image of publishable quality. The capabilities of camera phones  
# today are quite astonishing, but is your phone really the best option at your disposal? It is  
# typical for images taken with a phone to be viewed on the phone itself, on a tablet, or  
# perhaps on an online space such as Instagram or Flickr. Images viewed at this size on-  
# screen will often look great, but what about printed at a larger size? You may be surprised  
# how they look, with lots of pixelation and color “fringing,” when edges look indistinct and  
# discolored.  
# A phone will never replicate the quality of even a midrange SLR camera \(not  
# yet anyway\). If you need an image for a project, think carefully about which type of device  
# to use. If you are fortunate and have a budget for professional photography, you will likely  
# be quite alarmed if the photographer turns up at the shoot with only an iPhone.  
# TS  
341 **DON’T use Photoshop filters to disguise**  
# a low-quality image  
# At school, a common, clichéd excuse for missing homework is “the dog ate it.” In graphic  
# design, a common excuse for using a Photoshop filter is that “the project needed it.” Both  
# excuses are obvious and pathetic. Nobody is fooled by the dog and homework story.  
# Nobody believes the image was wonderful, but the designer still decided to posterize it.  
# Bad images are bad images. Low-resolution photographs are low-resolution photographs.  
# There is no hiding from low quality. This is an instance when you need to request a better  
# image.  
# Alternatively, you can photograph a new image. You may also set the low-quality  
**photograph aside and create an original image in a diﬀerent media.**  
# And if all else fails  
# and the poor-quality image is the only option, use it large.  
# Print it out and photograph it  
# as a physical snapshot. Make the poor quality highly visible and a part of the solution.  
# SA  
342 **DON’T try to repair a bad image by**  
# desaturating  
# Desaturating an image is criminal. It is not legally criminal, but it is wrong.  
# One of the  
# tenets of modernism is to let materials be what they are. This means wood should look  
# like wood, metal should be metal, and stone should be actual stone. There is no faux-  
# painted marble in a Mies van der Rohe house.  
# Bad images are bad images.  
# Attempting to  
**disguise one by desaturating it has one eﬀect. It makes a bad image look desaturated.**  
# Sepia-toned photographs from the late nineteenth century look good because they are  
# actual sepia-toned photographs. Taking an image photographed in the twenty-first  
# century and making it sepia results in an image that has clearly been manipulated. If the  
# imagery is artificial and attempting to deceive me, how can I believe any of the text? The  
# entire solution is compromised and has lost integrity.  
# SA  
343 **DON’T scan a commercially printed**  
# image that has been screened  
# When a piece is commercially printed, the collection of  
# C  
# MYK dots that make up the  
# base of the image forms the visual you see. The dots can also create a moiré pattern when  
# scanned.  
# Although a photo or a slide might be smooth and continuous, the printing  
# process fragments this. It works perfectly on the original presentation, but if you try to  
# drop that magazine cover into your layout straight from the scanner, be prepared for a  
# bizarre visual pattern to emerge. The trick is to create a photograph of the image. Light  
# that printed piece and be sure that it is squared up and as flat as possible, with no flares or  
# shadows. Take several photos, select the best, sharpen it digitally, and then you have a  
# perfect file to work from. The extra steps are more than worth it.  
# JF  
344 **DON’T enlarge images excessively in**  
# layout  
345 **When you’re placing hi-res images in a layout, it’s essential that you don’t overscale them.**  
# Your hi-res files should have an image resolution of at least 300ppi, the correct resolution  
# for screen rulings used in the litho printing process \(see page 247\). Increasing the scale  
**of the image will reduce the image’s eﬀective resolution when printed.**  
# By way of an  
# example, enlarging the image to 200 percent will reduce the resolution by half to 150ppi.  
# If you need a higher resolution file to achieve the best layout, it’s worth asking the client  
# or the image source if one is available. If a replacement is not possible, then work with  
# what you have. However, there is usually a small amount of leeway available. If the image  
# is of a high quality, you should be able to increase the scale to around 105 percent, maybe  
# slightly more if in a pinch. You will find that most of the detail, as long as it is not too faint,  
# will be retained when printed.  
# PD  
346 **DO enlarge images incrementally in**  
# Photoshop  
**Take a look at the Image Size dialogue in Photoshop, and you’ll see that there are diﬀerent**  
# options \(with helpful labels\) to select when resampling an image.  
# Photoshop has to  
# create or delete pixels using clever things called algorithms when you resize an image,  
# and it recommends either the Preserve Details or Bicubic Smoother feature for  
# enlargements. These settings will give surprisingly good results for enlargements of a  
# fairly high percentage but is limited. Some say as much as 200 percent is acceptable, but I  
# would say the practical limit is actually lower. If you’re ever forced to enlarge a digital  
# image beyond 50 percent, it’s a good idea to consider using the incremental enlargement  
# technique. It’s a simple process involving gradual increases in size of between 1 and 5  
# percent. Using small increments means Photoshop doesn’t have to create as many new  
# pixels for each enlargement, so color accuracy and clarity are maintained to a slightly  
# higher degree. For the best results, always enlarge images in Photoshop first—never  
# enlarge them in the layout.  
# TS  
347 **DO choose images that support the text**  
# without repeating it  
348 **Many of us have attended a lecture where the speaker shows slides of his or her work.**  
# The worst speakers tell us what we see on the screen.  
# A poster with a red headline and  
# image of a hat appears on-screen. The speaker says, “Then I made the headline red and  
# used a hat.” If the audience is sight-impaired, this is acceptable. The best speakers show  
# the work and expand on it with a story, context, or hidden meaning. Text used as captions  
# or headlines should give the viewer additional information. They should not repeat the  
# obvious content of the image.  
# As an example, a portrait of a man might have a headline  
# such as “Wesley Thornton, Hero of the French and Indian Wars.” A headline that reads  
# “  
# Portrait of a Man with a Black Shirt” only tells us what we already know. Images support  
# the text, and the text supports the image. Each adds strength and information to the  
# other.  
# SA  
349 350 **DO keep icons simple and expect them**  
# to convey only a single idea  
# The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines an icon as follows\: a sign that has a  
# characteristic in common with the thing it signifies. Successful icons communicate a  
# singular and typically simple idea.  
# A car on a winding road conveys the message,  
# “winding road ahead.” Poor icons attempt to communicate too many ideas. In addition to  
# the car and winding road, boulders appear to be falling, and children are running across  
# the road. This is no longer an icon. This is now a painting. Many clients will want to say  
# multiple things at once. The designer filters this information and suggests a clarified and  
# more legible solution.  
# SA  
351 **DO know the diﬀerence between similar,**  
# example, symbolic, and arbitrary icons  
# We adore icons.  
# As designers, we help place them all around us. It is important to know  
**that icons fall into four specific categories and to understand the diﬀerence. Similar**  
# icons are usually very literal and use simple objects, actions, or concepts. Many road  
# signs fall into this category. Example icons usually convey a complex action in a single  
# image. They usually use an image that we readily associate with a larger range of activity  
# than the image itself, like a plane for an airport. Symbolic icons are used when an action  
# or concept can be conveyed with a recognizable shape and are more conceptual, like a  
352 **padlock for security.**  
# Arbitrary icons use imagery that bears little immediate connection  
# to the concept and must be learned to make the connection with the meaning.  
# An obvious  
# example is the icon for radioactive materials.  
# JF  
353 **DO create logos that identify rather than**  
# describe  
# Each of us has a name. That name identifies us to the rest of society.  
# Our first name may  
# indicate our gender and origin.  
# Our surname may indicate our cultural background.  
# When introduced to Comte de Meux et Chalon Robert de Vermandois, I might presume  
# this person is a man from a French family.  
# Queen Alfgifu of England will likely be female  
# and British.  
# Beyond these facts, however, I know nothing else. The names do not tell me if  
# Comte de Vermandois is kind or mean, if  
# Alfgifu is generous or thrifty. Good logos do the  
# same job. Good logos identify an organization. They do not tell the viewer everything  
# there is to know about the organization. The logo is the foundation of the visual system. It  
# must exist in a variety of contexts. It should be able to fit in an advertisement selling a  
# product as well as a letterhead expressing condolences. Logos that describe are rarely  
# legible, memorable, or accurate.  
# SA  
354 **DO create logos that work in print and**  
# online  
# Thirty years ago, designers made logos for print, and occasional wayfinding needs. The  
# visual system required a full-color, one-color, and reversed version. Today, logos are  
# applied to print, signage, broadcast, and online applications. The good news is that  
# designers are now able to animate a logo, use a broader color palette, and think three-  
# dimensionally. The bad news is that every logo needs to be legible on a printed piece and  
# reduced to a small number of pixels online.  
# A logo previously spent most of its life in a  
**static two-dimensional world. Four-color logos were diﬃcult and expensive to**  
# reproduce.  
# A simple black-and-white logo with a two-color variation was preferred. Now,  
# multicolored and three-dimensional logos are possible online.  
# But, as in traditional print  
# design, small hairline rules, delicate and tiny typography, and complex colors will not  
# reproduce in print and will fall apart on-screen.  
# SA  
355 **DON’T ever use pixels when you can use**  
# vectors instead  
# Vector graphics have one massive advantage over pixel-based images—they’re not  
# resolution dependent, meaning you can enlarge them as much as you like with no loss in  
# quality. Vectors are made using geometric primitives, which are points, lines, curves, and  
# polygons, and mathematical equations calculate how everything intersects. It sounds  
**complicated, but don’t worry, the software does all the tricky stuﬀ—all you have to do is**  
# draw the lines. They’re not so good for the fine tonal gradations and subtle color shifts  
# that bitmaps can handle, but for diagrams or logos, they’re perfect, and you can avoid the  
# troublesome E  
# PS file format, since native Adobe Illustrator files can be imported directly  
# into page layout programs. If it’s possible to use vectors for an illustration or graphic \(i.e.,  
# one that doesn’t require the typical properties displayed by a photographic halftone\),  
# choose a vector approach every time, and you’ll never have to worry about any of the  
# issues associated with resolution and image size.

# lazy.  
# And it will always look like Live Trace. Especially disturbing are examples of  
# handwritten letterforms that have been subjected to the rigid abuse of Live Trace.  
# Recalling modernist tenets, allow something to be what it is. If handwritten text is  
# necessary, write it, scan it, and use it. Using Live Trace will create forms that appear  
# inauthentic. This deletes any spirit of spontaneity or life. If an object needs to be drawn  
# as a vector form, the designer should use the pen tool and draw the form. This controls  
**any odd curves and stray points. It is the diﬀerence between a sloppy, careless approach**  
# and a meticulous, energetic solution.  
# SA  
357 **DO know that things that are noticeably**  
**diﬀerent tend to be remembered**  
358 **When we solve a problem, we are forced to engage with the issue at hand. Elements that**  
# are unexpected or out of place create a problem that we must resolve. Using an image of a  
# baby with the word Baby below it asks us to do little. Using an image of a baby with the  
# word Dinner below it creates an emotional response, and we are left to question its  
# meaning. This example will be remembered. Speaking to the audience with a remedial  
# tone is condescending. Good design should not function like reading flash cards with  
# simple icons and simple words to describe them. Good design asks questions, poses a  
# point of view, and encourages the viewer to complete the thought.  
# SA  
359 **DO understand the face-ism ratio**  
# Quite simply, the face-ism ratio is the ratio of face to body in an image, which influences  
# how the viewer perceives the person depicted. The more face one can see in an image, the  
# higher the face-ism ratio. There is specific math involved, if you are so inclined to pursue  
# it, but we are going to talk specifically about the significance. This equation is hotly  
# debated in terms of how it is used in regard to gender. Historically, images of men tended  
# to be dominated by the face, emphasizing their personality and intellectual qualities and  
# focusing squarely on character. Images of women, however, tended to show significantly  
# more body, often the entire figure, focusing on their physical attributes and often with a  
# sensual undertone. This is consistent in almost every culture. The point, as a designer, is  
# to pay attention to how much face is shown in a cropped image and to be careful about  
# what that conveys to the viewer.  
# JF  
360 **DON’T allow any images above 105% to**  
# go to print  
# On page 243 we discussed why you should ensure that images are 300ppi before you  
# import them to a layout. In addition, be sure that the scale of the image does not increase  
# beyond an acceptable amount once it has been placed. The rule is never bigger than 105  
# percent.  
**As you increase the scale of the placed image, you are in eﬀect decreasing its**  
# resolution and therefore its quality. For example, if I place a 300ppi image at 150 percent,  
# the image has increased by 50 percent in size over the original—or the original takes up  
# two-thirds the width of the scaled image. This now means that the resolution of the  
# scaled image has decreased to two-thirds the original resolution, or 200ppi. This is a  
# significant decrease, and, when printed, the image quality will likely show the  
# degradation. If absolutely necessary and if the image is of very good quality, then 110  
# percent might be acceptable, but stick with 105 percent and you’ll be safe.  
# PD  
361 **DON’T print images that are less than**  
# 300ppi  
# When sending a project to print, it’s imperative to check that all images have a minimum  
# 300ppi resolution. When publications and books are litho-printed, the printer will  
# employ a screen ruling of 150–175 lpi to create the printing plates for the various colors.  
# In order to calculate the required image resolution for the printer’s screen ruling, simply  
# double the lpi figure. Resolutions lower than 300ppi can sometimes be acceptable,  
# depending on the project and paper stock, but it is generally accepted that 300ppi will  
# work for most screen rulings, including finer screens of 200lpi, which would be  
# considered for use on art books and monographs. The above, when coupled with the  
# previous rule of not overscaling images when placing into layout, will help to ensure that  
# everything prints well.  
# A quick and easy way to check your images is to use Adobe Bridge  
# to collate and identify any files with stray resolutions.  
# PD  
362 **DO consider converting all images to**  
# CMYK before sending to the printer  
# As has been discussed elsewhere in this book, the color printing process uses four colors,  
# cyan, magenta, yellow, and black \(C  
# MYK\), to reproduce color images and graphics. Many  
# of the image files supplied to you, such as digital photographs, will have been created in  
# red, green, and blue \(RGB\) mode, which is incompatible with the printing process \(RGB-  
# formatted images are used for screen-based graphics, such as on websites\).  
# Before you  
# embark on converting them all, it is a good idea to talk to your printer. Not only is it  
# possible to convert the images to C  
# MYK, but also you will be able to add the correct  
# MYK profile to the images, which will be a great help to the printer, particularly if there  
# are a lot of images. Simply find out which C  
# MYK profile the printer intends to use and  
# then carry out the conversion in Photoshop, killing two birds with one stone. If there are  
# a large number of images, you can run a batch of them through an automated action,  
**saving you a lot of work and aﬀording you the time to go and have a cup of coﬀee.**  
# PD  
# C  
363 **DO use a mixed RGB and CMYK image**  
# workflow  
# There’s a rumor kicking around that all images must be converted to C  
# MYK \(see page  
# 284\) before they’re sent for reproduction. This isn’t a bad idea—but it’s also fine to  
# implement a mixed RGB and C  
# MYK workflow as long as you use color profiles.  
# Color  
# profiles \(for example, Adobe RGB 1998 or FOGRA39\) contain data that describes how  
# any one device, which could be a screen or a printer, will deal with the color information  
# contained in an image. They use LAB, a device-independent color model \(see page 180\),  
# to closely preserve colors that move from one color space to another.  
# As most of us now  
# send a majority of our artwork to printers as PDFs, we can set Color Conversion to  
# Convert to Destination \(Preserve Numbers\) when we export a PDF, making sure that any  
# RGB images in a layout convert automatically to C  
# MYK while maintaining color  
# consistency with the RGB original. This cuts out the need to convert all your images  
# beforehand and makes it possible to keep RGB originals that are better suited to color  
# correcting and manipulation in Photoshop.  
# TS  
364 **Production & Print**  
365 **DO include at least 3mm of bleed on all**  
# artwork  
# If you elect to have full-page images that run to the edges of a page, they are referred to as  
**“bleeding” oﬀ the page. When the page is trimmed, you must ensure that additional**  
# image content is provided past the page edge to avoid the potential for any white edges  
# showing, due to the inevitable slight variations that occur during trimming. This extra  
# element of the artwork is called the bleed and should appear only on the trimmed edges  
# of the book—it isn’t necessary at the spine. I have been asked on occasion by a printer to  
# provide 5mm bleed, but the minimum is 3mm, allowing for small degrees of movement  
# with the cutters as the collated sections are passed through the trimming machine. When  
# you place your image and you’re viewing it on-screen, remember that what you are seeing  
# includes the bleed, so make sure that no important element of the picture is too close to  
# the trimmed edge.  
# PD  
366 **DO always insist on obtaining a hard**  
# proof, even for 1C print projects  
# I know you think it is silly.  
# A waste of time, or even worse, a waste of money—but when  
# you stop and think about it, even the smallest job has had time and money invested into  
# and worth the cost of ensuring that it prints correctly. How many times has someone  
# been told that a low-resolution PDF proof will be fine in the final printing, only to see one  
# little photo or logo at 72dpi included? Catalogs and shopping flyers are full of these  
**mistakes. Even the very best printers sometimes have technology foil their eﬀorts, or**  
# they rush a PDF proof out, only to have everyone be sorry in the end. It is always the right  
# choice to review even the simplest job properly.  
# Always.  
# JF  
367 **DO run color proofs on the correct paper**  
# stock  
# Every designer has faced a situation when a client insists that the color of the printed  
# piece is wrong. The client is convinced they saw a proof that was perfect, but what they  
**have been given is diﬀerent. There are several reasons why this could occur\: First, clients**  
# remember what they want to remember. Save the proof and show it to them. Second, the  
# printer made an error. If possible, go on press for each job to verify the correct color.  
# And  
# third, the color proofs were on the wrong paper stock. The client saw proofs on a white-  
# coated stock, and the job printed on an uncoated cream stock. The solution is simple\:  
**always show the client proofs on the correct stock. Explain the diﬀerences between**  
**digital proofs and oﬀset printing. They are entirely diﬀerent technologies and will never**  
# match exactly. If the printer provides an ink drawdown, make sure the ink is printed on  
# the exact paper to be used when printing.  
# SA  
368 **DON’T use laser printers to produce**  
# color proofs  
369 **As described earlier, in much the same way you wouldn’t specify a color for print based**  
# on its on-screen appearance, the use of color lasers should not be relied on at all to  
# provide an accurate color representation. I’ve found that color lasers are great for  
# checking that all the elements are in place. I am always happy if a printer supplies them  
**to me for signing oﬀ on content and editorial changes, but they should never be used to**  
**check color. The first reason for this is that the process is entirely diﬀerent from litho**  
# printing and is much cruder. Litho is an ink-based process using a combination and  
# arrangement of ink dots that, when blended, creates a high-quality output. Lasers are  
# toner based and overlay the colors in a more “instant” and opaque way, resulting in a lack  
# of refinement and accuracy in color and images. The second problem with lasers is the  
# machine itself. It is in constant need of calibration, and I have found that factors such as  
**temperature and toner levels greatly aﬀect the color output.**  
# PD  
370 **DON’T accept a PDF unless time saving**  
# is more important than quality  
# Business is about balancing compromises. Design is about trying to keep those  
# compromises from dampening the integrity of our projects. It is with great pain, since we  
# have extolled the necessity of seeing a hard proof on even the simplest business card, that  
**we oﬀer one up to the compromise gods. We make most of our decisions in regard to how**  
# wonderful a final project could be but based on the available time. Will we have time to do  
# things the right way, to truly give them thought and exploration?  
# Even when the answer is  
# yes, we can have our legs cut out from under us by an accelerated production schedule.  
# Few things in this day and age are not weighed down by the expectation that it be  
# delivered yesterday. We look compromise hard in the eye, and we weigh time versus  
# quality. We fight for quality, but we know that a project that delivers after an event has  
# occurred is of no use to anyone.  
# JF  
371 **DON’T ever assume the printer will**  
# understand exactly what you require  
372 **There are many extraordinary printers. They are committed to meeting deadlines and**  
# providing honest and quick answers, and are immaculate in their craft. Then there are  
# printers who might as well be rhesus monkeys. Some people may walk through life  
# trusting others, believing that most others have the best intentions and want to do good.  
# This is a great, albeit naive, attitude in day-to-day life. To believe this to be the case with  
**all printers is foolish. Designers may be good at oﬀering the client clear design solutions**  
# but can be less than clear with printers. Making any assumption with the printer is risky.  
# Itemize every aspect of the project\: quantity, proofs, schedule, delivery, press checks, and  
# processes. Do not assume anything, ever. In the end, the printer will appreciate the clear  
# direction, and there will be fewer surprises.  
# SA  
373 **DO get your printer involved as early as**  
# possible in your project  
# You seem like a pretty smart cookie.  
# Are you able to keep up on every innovation in design  
# and advertising, from software to philosophical trends? Of course you can’t. No one can  
# fully keep abreast of one’s own vocation, much less another field altogether, no matter  
# how related it might seem on the surface.  
# Printing and design, though they often hold  
**hands, are wildly diﬀerent industries. Recognizing that you should know enough to have**  
# an intelligent conversation with your printer but could never fully understand the ins and  
# outs of the business is a good start. The sooner you engage your printer in your project,  
# the quicker they can enhance it, adding special techniques and innovations in the  
# industry.  
# Better yet, the printer can update you about cost savings while still delivering  
# an amazing product, or let you know of delays or complications in specifying certain  
**materials. It makes all the diﬀerence.**  
# JF  
374 **DO confirm that all materials from the**  
# client fit specifications immediately upon  
# receipt  
# Is there anything more frustrating than being in the middle of cooking a huge meal, only  
# to find that your spouse picked up regular sugar rather than the brown sugar specified on  
# the shopping list? Building an extension on your home and putting the new window into  
# the frame, only to find that it is 90 percent of the necessary size? There actually is  
# something more frustrating—hiring a catering company to cook that meal or a contractor  
# to complete your extension, only to be told that the job can’t be done with the materials  
# on hand, even though they confirmed the receipt of the list of materials days, weeks, even  
# months beforehand. This is the way your client feels when you ask for a bit more copy or  
# an image in a higher resolution right before the deadline of a project. Not only have you  
# announced that you didn’t start on the job until the last minute, but you have also come  
# across as disorganized and far from detail-oriented, a vital trait in this business.  
# JF  
375 **DO build contingency into all printing**  
# schedules  
# In printing, things happen that can delay a project.  
# A client may have last-minute  
# alterations. The press may break. The ink color might be flawed. The paper shipment may  
# be delayed, or incorrect.  
# Printing is a physical process that involves people, trucks,  
# machines, ink, and paper. It is not instantaneous like printing on a desktop digital printer.  
# There are too many components and people involved in any job for it to be completely  
# issue-free. The project might be delayed because the client decided to correct a word in a  
**paragraph after the job began printing. This means that the job had to be pulled oﬀ the**  
# press, new files created, the files proofed and approved, additional paper ordered, new  
**printing plates created \(for oﬀset lithography print runs\), and then rescheduled on press.**  
# This one small change could delay a job by twenty-four hours or more. Unfortunately, the  
# client will not recall making the change; they will only remember that the designer didn’t  
# deliver on time.  
**Add time into the printing schedule to create a buﬀer for the unexpected.**  
# SA  
376 **DO communicate scheduling issues to**  
# your printer as soon as they occur  
# As much as we love our work creating cool and sexy designs, a big part of our role \(and I  
# emphasize BIG here\) is managing the production process.  
# One of the most important  
# parts of this is liaison and communication with the printer. It’s imperative that if the  
# schedule shifts, the information is passed on to the printer immediately, to prevent any  
# disastrous impacts on the production schedule.  
# A client may ask if a delivery schedule  
# can be brought forward or pushed back slightly—never say yes until you have checked  
# with the printer. Don’t make a commitment that cannot be kept, breaching the trust of  
**the client and putting yourself in a very diﬃcult position. Keep open and honest**  
# communication going at all times, and, if things change, get on the phone immediately,  
# ask the right questions, and update the client responsibly.  
# PD  
377 **DO keep an oﬀ-site archive of all**  
# completed projects  
378 **When disaster strikes, you never know what will happen to your work space or assets, so**  
**make sure you have an oﬀ-site archive of your work. If your studio gets flooded, say au**  
# revoir to any computers, and if your studio archives get damaged, then you are in serious  
# trouble! The same goes for a fire. If a thief should walk away with your equipment, you  
# won’t have an opportunity to recover any data.  
**Providing yourself with an oﬀ-site archive**  
# guarantees that you will recover most, if not all, of your lost data. Every piece of work you  
# create is an asset as well as a potential asset\: a fair share of design work can return in the  
# form of updated editions of brochures or newsletters. Many years ago, I learned the hard  
# way when my studio was burgled and all of our Apple computers stolen. Fortunately, we  
# had just backed up our server and workstations, but it was a lesson I’ll never forget! Data  
# is your livelihood; protect it at all costs.  
# PD  
379 **DO back up and archive constantly**

# aCie  
# If you spent six months building a perfect scale model of the Titanic, you would make  
# sure it was put in a solid case to protect it and hope that it will last longer than the  
# original ship. You should feel the same about the design work that you spend weeks or  
# months creating for your clients. If you leave this material lying around on your  
# computer desktop without creating a proper backup on a constant basis \(Apple’s Time  
# Machine application, for example, is excellent\), you’ll have no option but to start from  
# scratch if the files are lost or damaged—not good. Invest in good-quality external hard  
380 **drives or a dedicated server for in-house backups and archived material, or, better still,**  
**maintain an oﬀ-site backup using additional large-capacity hard drives or an online**  
# cloud-based solution.  
# TS  
381 **DO obtain a printer’s template before**  
# beginning a packaging design  
# assignment  
# Every manufacturer has its own guidelines to consider. No matter how many music-  
**packaging projects you have completed, every vendor will have requirements that diﬀer**  
# slightly, such as variation in size or where the folds and scores occur. It may not be  
**noticeable in the marketplace, but it could mean a vastly diﬀerent placement of design**  
# elements\: a formerly left panel now becomes an upside-down top panel, with bleeds and  
**glue panels organized in radically diﬀerent positions. You can’t guarantee that every**  
# element of your design will line up or correspond with the extra bits and pieces that get  
# added to a pack during production. I could go on for days, the point being\: save yourself  
# the huge nightmare of reconfiguring your designs to wedge onto a template; get the full  
# template from the printer before beginning design, so you can accurately predict how it’ll  
# end up. Then, you can embrace it and design something special around its little quirks.  
# JF  
382 **DO assemble a full-scale mock-up of any**  
# packaging / dimensional project  
383 **Building a house on your computer screen is a far remove from using a shovel and moving**  
# earth.  
# On a smaller scale, the same is true about designing anything dimensional,  
# especially packaging. What looks like it might work structurally may not bend as  
# planned, lock together, or even stand up straight. Even after you have made adjustments  
# and tested out the very core structure, you may discover even more nuanced aspects of  
# designing in three dimensions. How does a small piece of type read now that you know it  
# will sit back a little on the shelf? Should the name of the product bend around to the point  
# that you can’t see all of the letters unless standing in a specific spot? How does the design  
# work at the folds and seams? Where does the legal copy sit? A  
# fter all that, does it fit in the  
# shipping containers and the commercial display cases and shelves? Test, test, test.  
# JF  
384 **DO request a paper dummy from your**  
# printer  
# I love paper samples, and it’s always great thumbing through them and deciding which  
# materials are appropriate and how they can be employed in a project. It is always  
# worthwhile to get a dummy, whether for a brochure or a book, to better judge how  
**production factors may aﬀect the design. I also think it is important to show dummies to**  
# clients so that they know what to expect with the final product. If they have something  
**else in mind or would prefer a diﬀerent material for the cover or interior pages—it is**  
# much better to know this at an early stage.  
# Otherwise, you risk receiving negative  
# comments \(“Oh . . . I think the text pages are too light”\) after the final product has been  
# delivered.  
# PD  
385 386 **DO investigate whether to overprint or**  
# knock out additional spot colors and  
# metallics  
387 **Adding a fifth color can be a defining point in a project. Whether it is a spot color to keep**  
# color consistent to corporate branding or a shiny metallic or fluorescent to provide  
# maximum bang for the visual buck, once you have made that move, the most important  
# decision is whether to overprint the additional color or to knock it out and trap it.  
# Be sure  
# to talk to your printer and get their advice, factoring in the sheet you are printing on as  
**well as the desired results. Distinct colors may involve diﬀerent considerations. Metallic**  
# silver ink can have an issue with trapping against dark colors and images; overprinting  
# can require laying on the ink thicker to hold opacity, compromising small or fine type,  
# whereas knocking out can allow for tight control in those areas.  
# Big impact. Important  
# decisions.  
# JF  
388 **DO run advance test proofs when**  
# utilizing unusual printing techniques  
# I always like to err on the side of caution if the design incorporates any unusual printing  
# techniques or methods that require a lot of advance preparation to ensure correct  
# printing.  
# A process that I always test proof in advance is foil blocking \(or any other type  
# of blocking for that matter\), to confirm that the block has been correctly made and that  
# there are no faults in the etching. In addition, you see the actual color of the foil and have  
# an opportunity to make changes if needed. The same goes for color palettes. Requesting  
# test proofs is not unusual during the printing process, and I try to get them done when  
# possible. I test the colors and their tints, with a number of type treatments employing the  
389 **colors to see how they work when applied to typographic elements. It’s a far safer way to**  
# do it, and the client has a chance to comment well in advance of the project going to press.  
# PD  
390 **DO consult a publication’s specifications**  
# prior to designing an advertisement  
# Magazines, newspapers, and publications that use advertising have strict policies  
# regarding the artwork for ads. They may seem sensible, arbitrary, or ludicrous, but it’s  
# their magazine, their art department, and their prerogative.  
# Before designing an  
# advertisement, request an artwork specification sheet and the exact ad order placed from  
# the publication. Regardless of who purchased the ad space, the designer must verify the  
# size and requirements. Unfortunately, people sometimes make mistakes. They think they  
# purchased a full-page ad, but actually ordered a half-page version. The artwork  
# specifications will clearly state trim size, bleed, ink requirements, screen size, and any  
# other pertinent issues to the production of the magazine. Turning over an ad that is RGB,  
# the improper size, and the incorrect resolution will likely be troublesome and is wrong.  
# SA  
391 **DO ensure that all text in black is set to**  
# overprint background colors  
# When I am designing books that are to be coeditioned \(translated into foreign-language  
# editions\), the English text is set on an additional black text layer that overprints on top of  
# the other elements on the page. That way, the black text plate can simply be removed, and  
# a foreign-language text can be overprinted in its place. Even if your work isn’t going to be  
# translated, it is still important that all black text sitting on a colored background be set to  
# overprint. If you don’t overprint the black text, it will “knock out” of the background \(i.e.,  
# the color will show the paper behind the characters\). This can cause registration issues,  
# especially if the text elements are small, such as the folios, captions, and even some of the  
# body text. To make the text overprint in InDesign, select from the palette menu\: Window  
# \> Output \> Attributes. Highlight the text and check Overprint Fill. You can preview the  
**eﬀect via View \> Overprint Preview.**  
# Of course, this treatment works with any color, so  
# have fun experimenting.  
# PD  
392 393 **DO own a copy of, or subscribe online to,**  
# a style manual  
394 **What if there was a book on your shelf or a website you could go to that could answer**  
# nearly every single question you could ever have about correct usage? Something to cut  
# short all those emails, texts, and forum postings, asking friends, relatives, coworkers, and  
# strangers what a certain proofreader mark means or when to use a certain form of  
# punctuation. Surely, you would own such a book or get access to such a site. If only  
# someone would put such a thing together and update it regularly to keep pace with the  
# evolution of language and grammar.  
# A guide for editors and writers alike, and those of us  
# who deal with copy every day. Wait a minute. You say such a thing already exists? It’s  
# called The Chicago Manual of Style.  
# JF  
395 396 **DO press check every project possible,**  
# even business cards  
# Once, while visiting a massive mansion, I was startled by a bathroom sink with faucet  
**handles installed backward, making it awkward to reach to turn them on and oﬀ. I was**  
# certain that, despite the gorgeous and extravagant structure all around it, I could never  
# live with a sink tormenting me so. It reminded me that no part of a job is too small for  
# proper attention to detail, and an oversight can ruin everything around it.  
# Press  
# inspecting a job allows for the designer to make adjustments, as well as ensure that all the  
# elements are in place, every t crossed.  
# At a minimum, you can make certain that the job  
# prints as expected.  
# At best, you can improve the final product, with a color popping or  
# matching to another piece, and make it all that it can be.  
# JF  
# DO match paper stock to the appropriate  
# printing technique  
# Ideally, you should be able to choose from a wide range of paper stocks when planning the  
# print side of a project, but sometimes the printing process will narrow down your choices  
**for you. For example, sheet-fed oﬀset lithography requires paper with good surface**  
# strength, which provides good dimensional stability.  
# Paper stock that stretches during  
# full-color printing is a recipe for disaster, as misregistration will occur between each  
# color as it is laid down.  
# Other factors to take into account are smoothness, absorbency,  
# opacity, and compressibility. Standard stock sizes for sheet-fed processes are also  
397 **important; will they fit your supplier’s press, and how much will be wasted during**  
# trimming? The paper is, more often than not, the most expensive component of any print  
# project, so do your research early and always choose your paper stock with care.  
# TS  
398 **DO be aware of paper show-through**  
# A hotshot architect was recently commissioned to design a Japanese-style apartment for  
# a client and decided to incorporate some cool-looking screens to divide up the guest  
# bedrooms. During a visit to the manufacturer’s factory, the architect was advised to take a  
# look at them outside in daylight, but he arrogantly refused to do so, thinking that his  
# judgment is always the best, no matter what. The screens were installed in the light and  
# airy guest rooms at considerable expense, but the next site visit did not go well.  
# “These  
# are no good,” reported the client.  
# “I can see straight through this screen into the next  
**room.” Paper show-through works in much the same manner. Exposure to light aﬀects**  
# the opacity, and thin sheets, in particular, can allow for the image or text on the  
# subsequent spread to “show through” to the one you are viewing.  
# JF  
399 **DO ask your printer for the panel sizes of**  
# a folded leaflet  
**There are dozens of diﬀerent ways to fold leaflets and brochures, the only restriction**  
# being the sheet sizes of paper stock and the available folding machinery your printer can  
# access. Folding sequences become more complicated as the number of panels increases,  
# which may seem obvious, but it’s not just because of the panel count. The panels that fold  
**in on themselves need to be sized diﬀerently to allow a leaflet to lie flat when completely**  
# folded. Take, for example, the wrapped accordion fold, a standard accordion bookended  
# by integrated front and back covers that are the full width of the folded leaflet, let’s say 4  
# inches. The accordion panels folding within the two covers need to be slightly narrower,  
# allowing them to fold inward comfortably within the cover dimensions. The  
# recommended reduction in width varies between sources, but something in the region of  
# .083 inches should do the trick. The weight of the paper stock also has a bearing on the  
# amount of adjustment. The bottom line is, always request a template from your printer.  
# TS  
400 **DO work in halftones and vectors when**  
# silk screening  
# For ages, silk screening was thought of as one of the roughest forms of printing.  
# As new  
# generations of designers have come to embrace those very qualities, along with the  
# attractive economics when making short-run projects—from posters and T-shirts to  
401 **most anything you can imagine pressing up against a screen and dragging ink along it—it**  
# has emerged as a powerful niche.  
# Currently, it is so popular that I am working on  
# something being produced via screen print every day. I love the thick ink and the way no  
# two pieces are quite the same. It is the polar opposite of process commercial printing.  
# But  
**I have to be mindful that it also diﬀers at the production end. The way screens are**  
# created/burned requires that all art be either vector- or dot-based and exist at 100  
# percent of the color. The open areas of the screen are the portions of the screen that lets  
# the ink through, and shades are not an option. It requires a complete rethinking of how  
# you approach design and production.  
# JF  
402 **DO always have up-to-date paper swatch**  
# books  
**Paper companies have long used the swatch book to show oﬀ the capabilities of their**  
# sheets, combining current design trends with flashy techniques, in the hope that you will  
# choose their line and put it into use on a stunning final product. Most studios, firms, or in-  
# house departments will eventually have a visit from a printer, whose representative will  
# make sure that you have all of the current swatch books. Making sure that swatch  
# references are up to date is vitally important.  
# One day in the future, you may go to spec a  
# sheet and find that a swatch doesn’t exist any longer, or that that finish is gone, or the  
# weight of paper is no longer available.  
# Paper companies are all too happy to send these to  
# you. Take advantage.  
# JF  
403 **DO look beyond a printer’s in-house**  
# paper stock for a wider choice  
# There are many paper and materials manufacturers out there, and it’s beneficial for the  
# graphic designer to be aware of the range of print companies and products available.  
# There are times when a concept may be driven by, or nearly always enhanced by, the  
# materials the designer chooses; often, with an unusual print process thrown into the mix,  
# a really successful and powerful end result can emerge. Familiarizing yourself with  
# what’s available is fun, and all paper makers have swatch books and printed examples  
**available to send out. They usually oﬀer a samples service to help you make decisions on**  
# specifications or for use on mock-ups and presentations. Don’t limit yourself to  
# companies that exist in your home country. There are truly fabulous papers available  
# from around the world, and most can usually be shipped in bulk to your printer.  
# PD  
404 **DO familiarize yourself with international**  
# paper sizes  
# To enable designers, clients, and printers to discuss matters of specification and pricing  
# on a level playing field, it is advantageous to establish an understanding of available paper  
**sizes. Standard US and European paper sizes do diﬀer, so it’s worth getting an overview of**  
# how the respective systems work.  
# Paper sizes in the United States are based on multiples  
# of  
# 8  
# .5 × 11 inches \(or Letter\), but some sheets will be a little larger to allow for images that  
# bleed and to allow for grip when on press. In Europe, the system most widely employed is  
# ISO 216 and is based around the A  
# formats. The A sizes are ordered downward in size,  
**being approximately half the area of the next size in the range, with A0 at 1 m2 and A6 at**  
**just 155.4cm2. In addition, the C series provides formats for envelopes and postcards,**  
405 **where a C4 envelope is slightly larger than an A4 sheet. Finally, the RA and SRA ranges**  
# provide untrimmed format options for commercial printers that are slightly larger than  
# the A sizes and allow for grip when on press.  
# PD  
406 **DON’T specify cheap paper stock**  
# It is said that salt is salt.  
# But if you are a chef, you will explain that salt from the  
**supermarket is diﬀerent from refined salt from New Zealand.**  
# Paper is similar. The  
# layperson will say, “  
# Paper is paper. Isn’t it all the same?” Designers, like a gourmet chef,  
**know the diﬀerence.**  
# Paper stocks vary in tone and surface. They range from sheets made  
# of 100 percent postconsumer waste to very little recycled material.  
# Cheap paper will be,  
# yes, less expensive, but the resulting product will never match a higher-quality paper.  
# A  
# cheap paper will not accept ink as well and may cause scoring and folding issues. There  
# will also be deviations in brightness and whiteness from one sheet to another. Unless the  
# job has an incredibly small budget or paper costs are a large fraction of the budget, never  
# scrimp on paper. The end product may be slightly more expensive but will be infinitely  
# more successful, and the client will be pleased.  
# Alternatively, the client might save some  
# money, hate the final product, and fire the designer.  
# SA  
407 **DO know where the glue sections are**  
# and make sure that they are ink-free  
408 **Do you know what glue likes to stick to?**  
# Paper. Do you know what glue doesn’t like to  
# stick to? Ink. Simple enough, right? However, the glue area on most pieces and products  
# falls inside a fold, which, at the same time, requires that there be bleeds so that the  
# package sports a finished look rather than have paper stock awkwardly peeking out at the  
# seams. Folded mail items need to be closed and glued, possibly with complicated folds,  
# but need to be easy to open for the end user. That means that the areas where glue will go  
# down during production, as well as anywhere the user may place it, need to be well  
# thought out and marked early on.  
# Once that happens, be sure to take extra care to keep  
# them clear.  
# JF  
409 **DO understand when to use diﬀerent**  
# binding techniques  
**There are a number of diﬀerent commercial binding techniques that oﬀer varying**  
# aesthetic qualities and practical applications. Which technique is best for your project  
# depends on specifications such as page extent and format. For example, a 6 × 9 inch forty-  
# page concert program can be either wire stitching or perfect bound \(glued pages into the  
# cover\). The application of case binding, which is used for hardcover books that have  
410 **pages that are collated in sections and held in place by use of an endpaper, would be**  
# wholly inappropriate for a brochure. First, you don’t have enough pages for the cover to  
# physically work \(the thickness of the pages when collated is too thin to allow the binding  
# to be “built”\). Second, even if it were possible, the cost would be prohibitive; case binding  
# is a much more expensive process.  
# Consider not only the suitability of the binding to the  
# project but also the cost implications.  
# PD  
411 **DON’T saddle stitch an extent more than**  
# ninety-six pages  
# Saddle stitching is an alternative term for wire stitching or, simply, stapling. The staples  
**used for saddle stitching are diﬀerent from those in an oﬃce stapler. They’re longer and**  
# made from a rounder profile wire, usually in stainless steel to prevent rusting, which is  
# fed from a roll rather than a clip. It’s called saddle stitching because printed sections are  
# placed over an inverted V, like a sharp saddle, prior to being stitched together on the  
# bindery production line. It’s the most popular way to bind magazines or brochures  
# because it’s the cheapest and is also much quicker than other binding procedures.  
# However, there is one important restriction—it can handle only a limited number of  
# pages. If a publication’s extent goes beyond the ninety-six-page mark, you’ll need an  
# alternative method. The weight of the paper stock must also be taken into account, not  
# only because of page extent but also to account for the unavoidable “creep” \(see page 322\)  
# that will occur.  
# TS  
412 **DO ensure layout allows for “creep” at**  
# trim and spine when binding  
413 **Creep? No, we’re not talking Radiohead here. When a book’s or a brochure’s pages are**  
# folded together or collated into sections prior to being bound and as the pages are stacked  
# together and increase in number, the gauge of the paper forces the inner sheets to  
# protrude until they are misaligned with the outer sheets. The result when trimmed\: the  
# inner’s outer margins will be thinner than those of the outer pages. Not only will this be  
# unpleasant on the eye, but also any items dangerously close to the trim edge could be cut  
**oﬀ. Similarly, one must be aware of the binding mechanism being used, as some**  
# techniques appropriate more of the page gutter than others.  
# An example is perfect  
# binding, where up to .25 inches of the gutter margin on the page can be lost. When  
# deciding on your layout and working out the margins, consider the page extent and the  
# binding so that you can counteract that dreaded creep!  
# PD  
414 **DO use matte and gloss lamination**  
# appropriately  
415 **Lamination is the most popular technique used for finishing the covers of books,**  
**brochures, and magazines. It provides additional stiﬀness to the selected paper stock,**  
# and it helps to protect the printed cover from dirt and marks. Lamination can be applied  
# in the form of a film, which is glued to the stock by passing it through a heated roller, or by  
# the application of a polymer resin, which solidifies when exposed to UV light. It’s broadly  
# categorized as either matte or gloss, but which one should you use and what criteria  
# should be applied to the decision? Gloss lamination doesn’t mark easily and makes  
**printed colors really pop oﬀ the page, so if you’ve got a gardening magazine or a book**  
# about color photography, gloss lamination would work really well.  
# Alternatively, matte  
# lamination feels contemporary and would work well for a cool fashion magazine—and it’s  
# a very popular choice for quality fiction. The one thing to make clear is gloss shouldn’t  
# automatically equate to high style and wealth, as in a “glossy magazine.” That concept is  
# outmoded.  
# TS  
416 **DO learn the diﬀerence between**  
# embossing and debossing  
# This is always a fun question to ask any designer because there’s a good chance the  
# answer will be something along the lines of\: “Yeah, embossing is when the surface is  
# pushed up and—no, hang on a minute—it’s when the design is pushed into the surface  
# and . . . um . . . err . . . bear with me while I look that up.” I usually forget which is which  
# because debossing is also occasionally referred to as embossing, not to mention blind  
# stamping, so I always have to check before specifying one finish or the other. The correct  
# definition is that embossing is where an area of paper or board is raised above the surface  
# so it stands out from the background, and debossing is where an area is pressed into the  
# surface to create an indentation.  
# Both techniques require the use of a precast die,  
**eﬀectively an ink-free printing block, which is applied to the surface under pressure to**  
# create the required shape. So there you have it—at least I think that’s it. I’d better check.  
# TS  
417 **DO press for H&T bands when a**  
# hardcover is specified  
# H&T \(head and tail\) bands are the decorative addition at the top and bottom of the spine  
# when a book is hardcover bound.  
# A small strip of cloth with either a solid color or pattern,  
**they oﬀer a small detail but one with a big impact. In the past, they were an intrinsic part**  
# of the binding process, as the pages to be held together were sewn to this cloth strip.  
# These days, H&T bands do not contribute to the integrity of the binding but are retained  
**as an attractive feature. What I love about them is they really finish a book oﬀ, and it’s**  
# these little details that provide beauty and longevity to a book’s lifespan. They remind me  
# of the traditions of bookbinding’s past and add a colorful finishing touch to the end  
# design. It may be that the budget doesn’t allow for them, but if you don’t ask you don’t get,  
# so always ask!  
# PD  
418 **DO always think about small details that**  
# create a big impact  
# One of the drawbacks of the computer is its inability to simulate special details. Gold foil,  
# embossing, engraving, and die-cuts exist in the three-dimensional world.  
# As most work is  
# done on a computer screen, it is easy to forget these small details.  
# But it is these details  
# that create impact.  
# A book cover embossed with a gold foil sparks an emotional response  
# and transforms the ordinary into something treasured. Engraved business cards may  
# seem old-fashioned and unnecessary.  
# But in a world where most communication is  
# digital, a physical object can be more significant. The extra consideration of the feel of  
# engraved typography begs the holder to caress the business card. These small details may  
**be more expensive to produce than traditional oﬀset printing, but their impact cannot be**  
# overstated.  
# Creating an artifact that will be kept because it has that little extra is true  
# sustainable design.  
# SA  
419 **DON’T specify predictable white**  
# endpapers  
# Being predictable is good in long-term relationships. Marriage with one partner who is  
# loonier than a March Hare with wildly shifting emotions would be hard to maintain.  
# Predictability is good for cars. It is nice to know that it won’t break down in the middle of  
# an intersection.  
# Predictability in endpapers, however, is sad.  
# An expected white endpaper  
# in a book is dull and a loss of an opportunity. Endpapers can be a variety of colors and  
# textures. Endpapers can be printed.  
# As long as the paper stock has the correct content  
# and will remain glued to the book board, anything is game. The endpaper serves in the  
# construction of a book. The endpaper, though, is like a theater curtain\: Blank white  
420 **curtains are dull and send a message that the play will not be particularly exceptional.**  
# Or  
# the theater is incredibly cheap and doesn’t care about the viewer’s experience. White  
# endpapers are exactly the same.  
# SA  
421 **DO clean up the pasteboard before**  
# sending a job to the printer  
422 **This isn’t a case of being overly fastidious with one’s artwork. \(Although one can never be**  
# too tidy!\) It is a way of ensuring that the artwork handed over to your printer is precise  
# and cleaned, and contains no additional elements that could cause errors or faults.  
# Examples could be a lone text box that has a text wrap applied to it. This could cause  
# issues if accidentally moved onto the layout from the pasteboard.  
# Another could be a  
# linked text box that, if moved or deleted, could cause issues with the flow of narrative or  
# content.  
# Also, unused images that are still sitting on the pasteboard will get packaged up  
# with the final artwork and possibly create additional work for the printer when working  
# on image files. The artwork is your responsibility, so keep it clean and precise.  
# PD  
423 **DO check that CMYK colors are not set**  
# to print as spot colors  
424 **I’ve been in situations when artwork set up by a third party has contained many color-**  
# coded sections, not all the colors C  
# MYK \(when they should have been\). Some were also  
# spot colors.  
# A C  
# MYK print job was set up to print with more than thirty spot colors—an  
# impossible specification! The problem is easy to fix, and checking that colors are C  
# MYK  
# should always be added to your checklist as you finalize the artwork. In InDesign, it’s a  
# quick action to highlight the color and switch the color to C  
# MYK. Not doing this can  
# cause confusion and possibly incur costs if a printer has to adjust your files. If you are  
# supplying PDF artwork and the problem has not been spotted prior to the digital-proof  
# stage, the proofs will provide an inaccurate presentation of your artwork.  
# Although most  
# printers will alert you to the fact that the artwork has not been set up correctly, save them  
# the trouble and get it right yourself by checking first.  
# PD  
425 **DO learn about diﬀerent finishing**  
# techniques  
# A printed object is a three-dimensional form. Just because Adobe InDesign displays  
# standard double pages on a spread does not mean that this is the only format.  
# Paper can  
# be cut, perforated, folded in unique ways, and trimmed to unexpected shapes.  
# A business  
# card can be oval, die-cut, or folded.  
# A publication might incorporate techniques such as a  
# gatefold.  
# A letterhead can be trimmed with rounded corners. When appropriate, add  
**scratch and sniﬀ. This might be more diﬃcult to sell to the client if it’s a pet company but**  
# perfect for a florist or candy shop. Remember, the page, book, or poster is a piece of  
# sculpture. It can be flat or as intricate as origami. Unless you are aware of the  
# possibilities, your work will remain flat—no pun intended.  
# SA  
426 **DO consider eﬀectiveness against cost**  
# for special finishing techniques  
# I mentioned earlier on that, with certain projects, production and print considerations  
# often play an important part in the overall concept. For example, two colors may be  
# selected for the way they work together to communicate a specific idea.  
# Often the use of a  
# foil block, a deboss, or a special color can add real value or impact to what you are trying  
**to say—if it facilitates eﬀective communication, then go for it. However, there is always a**  
# risk of creating a design with everything but the kitchen sink. The addition of needless  
**print processes does little to increase the design’s eﬀectiveness or its tactile qualities. If**  
# anything, it can dilute or hinder the design and definitely cost more to produce. I would  
# always balance the intent and ambition of the project against the target audience and the  
# budget. You’ll find that the specification will be refined through consideration, and a  
# better end design will result.  
# PD  
427 **DO learn about PDF / X standards for**  
# artwork delivery  
# You’ll have noticed the various PDF/X options under the Adobe PDF Presets menu in  
# InDesign, but what do they mean? The first thing to explain is that PDF/X isn’t some kind  
# of alternative file format but more a subset of the Adobe PDF specification. The idea  
# behind PDF/X was to create a standard specification for PDF export that would help to  
# eliminate common mistakes, like missing fonts or images, and encourage the  
# implementation of a properly managed color workflow.  
# Put simply, each PDF/X standard  
# requires a PDF file to match certain criteria, such as compression, color conversion for  
# output, transparency flattening. If you attempt to export a PDF/X file with incorrect  
# settings, a warning triangle will alert you to any problems. The PDF/X-1a\:2001 preset is  
# older and quite basic, and it doesn’t support a color-managed workflow. If you need to  
# incorporate color profile information, PDF/X-3\:2003 and PDF/X-4\:2008 are preferable  
**for oﬀset printing and digital output.**  
# TS  
428 **DON’T pretend to know more about**  
# printing than your printer  
429 **Everyone knows someone who hovers over the plumber when he comes to fix a leak,**  
# questioning every turn of the wrench and boring the poor fellow, trapped under the sink,  
# with tales of their own plumbing battles. That same person questions every detail of a car  
# repair, wasting everyone’s time debating each knock and ping and the cost of parts, until  
# all of the mechanic’s veins are bulging in frustration. Don’t be that person. If you are a  
# designer, you use plumbing and drive your car far more often than you send a project to  
# the printer. It doesn’t make you a plumber or a mechanic, and it does not make you a  
# printer. Hire people knowledgeable in their field, and be informed enough to express your  
# expectations for the job. Then, let them do what they do best just as you hope your clients  
# will let you do what you do best.  
# JF  
430 **DON’T accept what a printer tells you is**  
# possible without solid proof  
# I’ve been very fortunate to have worked with some brilliant printers whose expertise and  
# diligence make them invaluable collaborators. However, there have been many occasions  
# when the client has chosen the supplier for me. Usually, this relationship is professional  
# and productive, but because you are not the one holding the purse strings, it can be a  
# challenge to get the best results. Even though both parties are working toward the same  
# objective—keeping the client happy—the designer and printer may not share the same  
# priorities. This is where a little perseverance goes a long way. For example, you might  
# want to make an adjustment to the artwork to improve its appearance but are told by the  
# printer that it is not possible. Don’t take no for an answer\: ask them to explain why and  
# request some kind of verification.  
# Only when you are satisfied that it can’t be done should  
# you look at alternatives. Remember—if you are persistent, you may find that it can be  
# done.  
# PD  
431 **DO understand the strengths and**  
**weaknesses of diﬀerent printing**  
# processes  
# Every good team is an assembly of specialists \(even if your specialty is being serviceable  
# in several roles\), whether it is in professional sports, a Broadway production, or your very  
# own agency/studio. Some team members might provide the big glory moments, others  
# might do the dirty work, and others still might provide microspecialties, the very best at a  
# specific task. When selecting a printer, it is a good idea to think of your vendors in this  
# way, to suit your needs. In order to do so, you need to understand the nuances of the  
# printing processes they specialize in. For each project, think about what you want to  
# accomplish and choose the process that works best. Do you need lithography, screen  
**printing, embossing, etching, thermography? The answer is very diﬀerent if you are**  
# printing a T-shirt versus an annual report, or a business card versus the side of a bus.  
# JF  
432 **The Practice of Design**  
433 **DO think of the idea before the visual**  
# What do you do when you first sit down with a fresh design brief and a blank piece of  
# paper \(or perhaps a blank screen—more on this later\)? Do you get stuck on designing the  
# grid and thinking about what typeface to use, or do you scribble away on a notepad for a  
# while to get the ideas flowing? I would strongly urge you to opt for the latter every time.  
# All too often, designers sit in front of a computer and start on the visual right out of the  
# blocks without spending any time thinking about the idea. This isn’t a great way to work.  
# All your creative energy is going to be focused on designing a visual around an idea that  
# might not end up being the best solution to that brief—and an idea isn’t about typefaces  
# and grids. The visual exists to present and support the idea, and if the idea isn’t great, the  
**visual won’t be great either, despite all your eﬀorts. Reclaim the humble pencil and get**  
# sketching.  
# TS  
434 **DON’T turn to design annuals or portfolio**  
# websites for creative inspiration  
435 **I have to be careful here; I don’t want anyone to think I’m out to dismiss design annuals or**  
# portfolio websites. I love them, and as I type this, I’m sitting with my back to a groaning  
# shelf full of said design annuals and magazines. However, the last thing I do when I’m  
# trying to come up with a new idea to answer a design brief is reach for one of them. The  
# problem with design resources is that they’re full of great ideas that other people have  
# already had.  
# Anything you look at will immediately discount any of your ideas that  
# remotely resemble the annual’s content. That’s a pretty frustrating position to find  
# yourself in because there’s no shame in coming up with a good idea on your own, then  
# finding something similar after the fact.  
# A common adage is that there are no new ideas  
# left, which I don’t believe is totally true but the saying does have some merit. Try to look  
# elsewhere first for your inspiration before checking out the ideas that have gone before.  
# TS  
436 **DO read books that are not about design**  
# The dullest people are those who can discuss only one subject. I have been told that  
# sitting next to me at a dinner party can be unpleasant, as I enjoy discussing American  
# history for hours. Dull people tend to have limited life experience, or they are genetically  
# predisposed to being boring. Designers who only read design books and publications may  
# be well versed in multiple design ideas and noted designers but, like my American-  
# history facts, are dull. Design is about ideas.  
# Almost any subject outside design could be  
# informative.  
# A book on quantum physics may inspire a new way to envision information.  
# Books about history can help us rethink proportional systems.  
# A  
# fiction book may be  
# written in a minimal way and teach us to communicate more succinctly. Most  
# importantly, books force us to question, be introspective, and reconsider our lives. If we  
# are genuine creative people, this is not only a pleasant and straightforward addition to  
# our process but also at the core of a successful method.  
# SA  
437 **DON’T rely solely on Google for research**  
# Google is a wonderful tool to use to search for a good local Chinese restaurant or look up  
# eighteenth-century Virginia history and software tips. Google is a poor substitute for  
# actual scholarly research. Libraries are a better resource.  
# A well-trained librarian is a  
# human Google. He or she can help direct a designer to the correct area of interest.  
# Searching for information on Google is like wearing blinkers. For example, a search for  
# Cecil Beaton will lead to multiple sites about Beaton. Some of these may be well  
# researched and accurate, others may be complete fiction. This search, furthermore, will  
# lead only to Beaton. Scanning books on the shelf of the library could result in accidentally  
# stumbling on Irving Penn, Ansel Adams, or a multitude of other photographers. Research  
# is compiling verifiable data from multiple credible sources.  
# A website about Beaton  
# created by a fifteen year old for a school project is none of these things.  
# SA  
438 **DON’T knowingly plagiarize**  
# The phrase “what goes around comes around” can often be applied to our industry. Visual

**frustrating because all your eﬀorts have been lifted in a moment. Design for the brief and**  
# create your own ideas—that’s the challenge of what we do and where the enjoyment  
439 **comes from. It’s being original that counts, and this is what makes the successful**

# PD  
440 **DO insist on a written brief for every**  
# project  
# John, the designer, is looking forward to working with his new client and arrives in good  
# time for the briefing.  
# “Good to meet you,” says Trevor, the client.  
# “I’ve looked at your  
# website and love your work—it’s so our kind of thing.” “What do you have in mind for your  
# brochure?” asks John.  
# “Oh, we want you to decide, as your work is so our kind of thing,”  
# says Trevor.  
# “I’d really prefer some direction from you first so I know I’m on the right  
# track,” says John.  
# “No need,” says Trevor.  
# “We love everything on your website.” “Well—  
# Okay,” says John. Two weeks later, John arrives to present his concept for the brochure.  
# Trevor looks over the visuals, turns to John, and says, “Oh dear, this approach really isn’t  
# what we had in mind. Sorry, John, but I’m afraid you’ll have to start all over again and not  
# get paid any extra money.” “But . . .,” says John.  
# “No buts, John. It’s that or we’ll have to  
# look elsewhere,” says Trevor. The moral of this sad tale—always get a written brief. The  
# end.  
# TS  
441 **DO ask clients questions in addition to**  
# the brief  
# That written brief is a real plus at the start of any project, but more often than not, it can  
# bring up more questions. These can be many and varied, but don’t be afraid to ask them—  
# just don’t ask questions that are answered in the written brief already! What you will  
# achieve by asking questions is to tighten up the brief, which will invariably help focus the  
# client’s mind and allow them to make decisions about the design, management, and  
# production of the product. I often receive briefs verbally and take notes, but there is  
# always a need to ask additional questions. The obvious is usually stated, such as  
# schedules and budgets \(or sometimes not\), but questions that arise may include  
# assignment of responsibilities between client and designer, budget structure, and billing  
# terms.  
# PD  
# DO confirm all deliverables in writing  
# If you are working for a client who has commissioned graphic designers before, the  
# protocols and division of responsibilities are likely to be well understood.  
# But when you  
# receive a new brief, it is vital that you put in writing what you will deliver and by when.  
# I’ve often gone into a briefing meeting with clients who discuss the project with me as if I  
# have prior knowledge of what’s needed. They have, of course, been discussing and  
# planning the brief for weeks, maybe months; therefore, a key task would be to go back to  
# the start and establish exactly what they require. Get the deliverables established and  
# confirmed in writing. That way, the clients will know exactly what to expect, and  
# everyone will avoid disappointment and any potential tension in the relationship.  
# PD  
442 **DO agree on costs in writing before**  
# beginning each project  
# If there is one subject that is going to cause disagreement between a client and a designer,  
# it’s money.  
# Clients do not like surprises, especially those of the “project cost has gone up”  
# kind! To avoid a dispute, confirm the crucial question of how much a project will cost.  
# Whether working for a fixed fee or a daily rate, make sure you have it in writing and get  
# the client’s explicit acknowledgment of the sum. In addition, if you are preparing a  
# quotation, make sure that all elements of the prospective job are included\: correction  
# costs, print management, meetings, commissioning of photography and illustrations, etc.  
# If this isn’t possible at the beginning of a project, state clearly on your quotation that  
# certain aspects of the project are to be confirmed. If the client understands what they are  
# paying for from the outset, then all will be well.  
# PD  
# DO question a budget if it is clearly not  
# enough to answer the brief  
# Despite the fact that designers possess a creative side, and we all enjoy our vocation, it is  
# our job, and we have to make a living from it. There is no point in working on a project  
# and not getting paid enough \(or worse, taking a loss\). There will be occasions when a  
# client comes to you with what promises to be an exciting project but with little in the way  
# of budget, and, as you read the brief or discuss with the client what needs to be done, it  
# becomes clear that their expectations exceed their bank balance. Don’t be afraid, be  
# willing to raise the issue with them—you are entering into a business arrangement, and  
443 **they are buying your skills and experience in order to achieve the desired results. I find**  
**discussing options and diﬀering formats will often deliver a solution that works for both**  
# parties.  
# PD  
444 **DON’T try to do everything yourself at**  
# the expense of a project  
# If you’re a freelancer working for yourself, this rule doesn’t really apply to you, so please  
# skip to the next page. If you work in a design management role or as any part of a team,  
# then please read on. This rule shouldn’t be confused with the rule on page 264, which  
# concerns commissioning. This one is more about being prepared to relinquish control  
# over aspects of a project that other people can handle as well as or better than you.  
# Delegation of responsibility can be a lot harder than you might think, probably because in  
# the back of your mind, there is a troublesome little thought that someone else’s mistake  
# might come back to bite you, compelling you to try to take responsibility for everything  
# yourself. This attitude can do far more harm than good to a project and is unlikely to  
# produce a better result. It’s more likely to weaken the project, especially in the areas you  
# couldn’t give 100 percent to, and make you look like an idiot. If you learn to put your trust  
# in others, they’ll respond positively and generously.  
# TS  
445 **DO accept that every project will**  
**probably be more diﬃcult than you**  
# expected  
# Designers have a tendency to challenge themselves. We don’t want to do the same project  
# repeatedly, and once we become proficient in one area, we want to venture into new  
# territories. Therefore, almost every project will be more demanding than expected. Even  
# the simplest projects tempt us to rethink and reimagine possibilities. If a person wanted  
# to repeat projects without challenges, a career in a canning factory might be preferable.  
# The downside of the designer’s need to challenge himself or herself is time. Rarely does a  
**project oﬀer too much time.**  
# A designer will work on something until it is dragged from  
# his or her hands.  
# A good rule of thumb is to honestly calculate how long a project will  
# take, then triple that number.  
# SA  
# DO accept that every project will take  
# longer than expected  
# I would really like to write more about why every project you ever work on will take  
# longer than you think it will, but unfortunately my deadline for the submission of this  
# text has passed, and I’ve run out of time. I was sure I had another week to go before I had  
# to hand this in.  
# Oh well—just goes to show, doesn’t it!  
# TS  
446 **DO dress for work according to your**  
# client’s or your employer’s expectations  
# It is a mistake to believe that you are dressing to express your creativity and that these  
# choices only reflect on you. We dress to show respect to those around us. If we are  
# meeting with a group of friends at the local bar, it is reasonable to dress for the occasion,  
# to fit in with the group. Wearing a giant teddy bear suit will make most friends  
# uncomfortable. The same is true when meeting clients or working at the studio. The  
# clothes reflect the respect shown to the client or employer. This works in both directions.  
**If a client is formal, and it is traditional in their oﬃce to wear something less casual,**  
# follow suit. Shorts and flip-flops are a not-so-subtle way of saying “F\*%\# you.” But if a  
# client is casual and takes pride in their relaxed atmosphere, it is a mistake to wear a suit.  
447 **The questions to be asked when confused are these\: What will make my client feel that I**  
# took the time to present myself in the best way? What will create a comfortable situation  
**for myself and others? SA**  
448 **DON’T present an option you don’t want**  
# your client to choose because that’s the  
# one they’ll choose  
# It is an old maxim to never show a client a design you dislike. They will choose it, and you  
# will be unhappy. It is a designer’s job to solve the problem and create the best possible  
# solution. Showing an unsuccessful solution is a disservice to the client and to you.  
# Alternatively, if a client asks for a specific solution, do not ignore this. There is a reason  
# for the request. Few people are simply mad and willy-nilly, throwing out wild ideas. Stop  
# and ask not how to visually solve the problem but why he or she wants the specific  
**solution. The answer may be extremely valid. You, as a designer, will be able to oﬀer a**  
# better solution. Never ignore the client or refuse to explore their solution. Everyone  
# wants to feel important and valued. Nobody wants to be ignored and treated as an idiot  
# because they “don’t understand design.” Explore the suggested solution, and return with  
# that and a better option. Explain why one solution is more successful, not in design  
# terms, but with an eye on the desired result of the project.  
# SA  
449 **DO be nice to colleagues working above**  
# and below you, as things can change  
# In Hollywood, there is an old saying\: “The ass you kick on the way up is the one you kiss  
# on the way down.” If you are selfish, self-centered, and a sociopath, this saying alone  
# should appeal to your sense of survival. If you are not a sociopath, you probably believe  
# that most people should be treated with respect and kindness. It is easier to work with  
# others when there is a feeling of mutual congeniality.  
**Others are more likely to oﬀer help**  
# and support if you haven’t abused them or threatened to harm them in their sleep. This is  
# especially true for well-known designers. If you find yourself courted by the design media  
# and climbing the ladder of fame, never believe your own hype. You are not the best thing  
# since sliced bread. The people you look down on and treat badly will remember these  
# slights. They will tell their friends, who will tell their friends, and soon you will be a  
# global pariah.  
# SA  
450 **DON’T present reams of written research**  
# with a proposal just to impress the client  
451 **The teenager paces the kitchen, telling her parents all about the new safety studies,**  
# referencing quotes from other neighborhood parents, citing peer considerations, and  
# pulling out charts on mileage and fuel economy. Soon, reams of information seem to be  
# flying at them as she piles high automotive magazines and consumer publications; it is  
# getting to be a bit much to take in. The plot is firmly lost during the fifteen minutes of a  
# bold discourse on how the color of an automobile reflects its owner.  
# By the time the kid is  
# going on about how “if this car were an animal, it would be . . .” the couple finally raise  
# their hands and plead for mercy.  
# “If you want us to buy you this car, just ask,” they sputter.  
# A solid idea only requires a little bit of explanation. You are not impressing your client,  
# only boring them.  
# JF  
452 **DON’T present mood boards unless**  
# specifically asked—and even then  
453 **This industry has a lot of dirty little secrets, and one of them is that certain agencies**  
# charge a lot of money for the pleasure of cutting up magazines and printouts of web  
# images onto collages as if they were decorating their high school lockers.  
# Originally  
# conceived to provide inspiration by assembling the types of images, patterns, colors, and  
# various items that a project should aspire to, they have degenerated into messes that are  
# meant to aid clients who can’t “see” where the project should be headed. If you read that  
# last line, you will realize where the issue is. These are meant to be internal tools based on  
# researching competing brands and the tastes of potential users/viewers. They aren’t as  
**eﬀective as a communication between creatives and the client, because your client**  
# should already know all of this information like the back of their hand. If they don’t, and  
# request these, you might have a bigger issue on your hands.  
# JF  
454 **DON’T work for free**  
# As designers, we enjoy what we do. We mistakenly believe anyone could do our job. This  
# is because we have a rare talent and cannot imagine that everyone else doesn’t. It comes  
# so easily that it seems ridiculous that the person next to you at a film couldn’t tell the  
**diﬀerence between Garamond and Bembo.**  
# Consequently, we give our skills away and  
# devalue the profession and ourselves. There has never been a client with too much time  
# and too much money. There are hundreds of important causes that need support.  
# But  
# often, when a nonprofit client approaches a designer and asks for free work, other  
**vendors are being paid. The printer, caterer, staﬀ, and delivery services may all be**  
# charging fees.  
# As a designer, it is assumed that this is the easy job and can be done in five  
# minutes.  
# Compensation is necessary for the client to value the work and respect the  
# designer. This compensation can be in the form of cash, goods, or recognition.  
# But no job  
# should ever be completed simply out of kindness, without payment. If you are moved to  
# do this, stop and volunteer for the Red Cross.  
# SA  
455 **DO invoice regularly and on time**  
# One of the hardest aspects of running a design business is the business. Invoicing  
# regularly and on time is more important than any other aspect of the business. It may be  
# tempting to spend another hour refining the typography on a poster, but invoicing must  
# come first. It is a basic in business to work with clients who pay their bills and to invoice  
# on a regular basis to manage cash flow. Some design firms invoice regularly once a month,  
# but the most successful invoice weekly or daily. If a project is lagging, invoice a progress  
# billing.  
# Always invoice at the completion of each phase. Invoice outside costs  
# immediately, even if this is a bill for those alone. Maintaining cash flow is job one.  
# Invoicing on an irregular basis or too late creates opportunities for mistakes, and the  
# client will perceive the design firm as amateurish.  
# SA  
# DON’T accept assignments purely for the  
# money  
# For some reason, it is inevitable that work created exclusively for financial reward will go  
# horribly awry. There is no logical reason for this.  
# Perhaps it is the distaste felt for the  
# project reflected in its solution.  
# Or this is simply God’s way of saying, “Do what you love.”  
# In addition to the unbecoming outcome itself, it will lead to other similar projects. Good  
# people with good projects know other good people with good projects.  
# And bad people  
# with bad projects know other bad people. If the issue is money alone, graphic design is a  
# poor choice for a profession. If cash above all else is the goal, there are many other  
456 **careers that accommodate this desire. You never know, you might be hit by a bus**  
# tomorrow. No designer should spend his or her final moments working on a project that  
# produces only misery.  
# SA  
457 **DO take days oﬀ—especially if you’re a**  
# freelancer  
458 **A wise older designer once gave some sage advice\: “Never work on Sunday.” The issue is**  
# not one of religion but of sanity.  
# As a creative person, it is important to remember that  
# downtime is as crucial and productive as working time. Taking time away from design  
# provides an opportunity to clear the head and think of new ideas. Minimally, time away  
# from design promotes a balanced life.  
# Passion about design is important. Exploration and  
# refinement take time.  
# But design will expand to fill all time available. If a project has a  
# deadline in fifteen minutes, the project will take fourteen minutes. That same project,  
# with a two-week deadline, will take two weeks. Unless you are doing brain surgery and  
**the patient is moments from death, you can take one day oﬀ from your work.**  
# SA  
459 **DO learn the rules before you break them**  
**Many people have looked at a vintage Picasso and scoﬀed, with thoughts that they, too,**  
# could paint figures with pinched heads and wildly extended arms emanating from boxy  
# shoulders. None of them are familiar with his near-photographic early paintings, or else  
# they would quickly realize that they might be able to make a rough approximation of the  
# style he is best known for, but they would never have arrived at it on their own. Therein  
**lies the diﬀerence.**  
# Picasso spent years plying his craft in the accepted ways, until he was  
**able to replicate nearly any image with lifelike eﬃciency. He understood every nuance**  
# about how the human body was formed. He knew the rules, and he knew them well. It was  
# this understanding that made it so groundbreaking when he discarded them,  
460 **manipulating parts and pieces as they never had been before. His solid foundation**  
# allowed his creativity to unleash itself in the most influential areas, forever changing the  
# world of art.  
# JF  
461 **It takes a very mature person to accomplish this. I know I struggled with this early in my**  
# career.  
# Can I figure out a way to fix this without anyone noticing?  
# Make it up to the client,  
# or coworker, in some other way? I didn’t want to disappoint anyone or admit to myself  
# that I was failing in some way. I soon realized that the best thing to do when you make an  
# error—and we all make mistakes, so don’t pretend otherwise—was to be honest about it.  
# The sooner you come clean with your boss/client/vendor, the sooner you can limit the  
# impact or, better yet, rectify the issues. Everyone involved will respect that you came to  
# them right away \(as they recall their own mistakes in the past\) and appreciate the  
# opportunity to try to fix them as soon as possible. Grown-ups make mistakes. They also  
# fix them. It’s part of being a grown-up.  
# JF  
462 **DON’T ask someone else to do what you**  
# can do yourself  
# Smart people surround themselves with smarter people. Teamwork is important.  
**Learning to delegate tasks to someone better is a key to success. There is a diﬀerence,**  
# however, between collaboration and servitude. Limited people find exceptionally dumb  
# people and gracelessly force them to do menial tasks. If a task can be done well  
**personally, then do it. If you are capable of pouring a cup of coﬀee, then don’t ask the**  
# designer across from you to fetch it. If you have the time and ability to call a messenger,  
**do it. It may seem fun and give you great satisfaction that you are the lord of the oﬃce, but**  
# this will only lead to dissatisfied and angry coworkers. Eventually, they will turn on you.  
# SA  
# DO find a design mentor \(and be  
# prepared to be one in the future\)  
# If you haven’t figured out by this point in the book that the world of design is filled with  
# secrets, there is not much else we can do to help you. Well, I take that back. We can give  
# you an important piece of advice, one that will lead to a lifetime of guidance\: find  
# someone who has been through the battlefield already, and form a trusted and cherished  
# professional friendship. Finding a mentor can happen naturally—you encounter someone  
# more experienced and begin to ask them questions, easily forming a close bond—or you  
# can search out others whose work you respect via networking or professional  
# organizations and begin a conversation.  
# Ask as many questions as they can stand, but be  
# prepared to fill the same role for a young designer in the future.  
# JF  
463 **DO remain humble in your work**  
# There is nothing worse than being trapped with a mediocre and self-satisfied designer—  
# the type of person who will talk endlessly about his or her vast success and experience.  
# By the end of the conversation, you will know their entire CV, in detail, and that they are  
# the most accomplished person on earth. The clear subtext in the conversation is that you  
# are a loser in comparison. Every single person on the planet wants to feel important and  
# valued.  
# Charm is the ability to make the other person feel respected. Humility is a virtue.  
# Humility is not self-hate. Understand that every person has value and is needed and  
# loved by others. This does not make you lesser. Reinforcing the positive aspects in others  
# makes you genuine.  
# SA  
# DO respect focus groups but NOT at the  
# expense of gut feeling  
# Focus groups have found themselves with a bad reputation, in some ways justified, as  
# they have been misused over the years. Having said that, there is a lot of value to be  
# gleaned from direct feedback from potential users. If a focus group is selected properly, it  
# can be vital to shaping how a product or brand is positioned.  
# Creatives are quick to chafe  
# at the feedback delivered from those exercises, but take the time and digest the  
# comments. There can be important information in there, and, if nothing else, respect the  
# time and money the client dedicated to the process. Now that we have gone through all of  
# that, let’s talk about the nagging feeling that lies deep inside us when we know we are on  
# the right track. If your gut is screaming out to stay the course, don’t let an unconvinced  
# pool of people derail you.  
# JF  
464 **DON’T quantify your creative abilities**  
# with software skills  
# Maybe it’s an inevitable by-product of the digitalization of the design industry, but the  
**average designer’s CV looks quite diﬀerent these days. I’m venturing into angry old man**  
# territory here, but when I first put a CV together, I didn’t include a whole paragraph of  
**stuﬀ along the lines of . . .**  
# I can paste up artwork  
# I can draw really straight lines with a mechanical pen  
# I know how to blend Magic Markers with lighter fluid . . .  
# I assumed that potential employers would expect me to be able to do those things, and I  
# hoped that they’d be more interested in my ideas anyway. Fast-forward to today, and  
# many CVs include such long lists of software skills that they begin to resemble a catalog  
# for a computer store. Knowing how to use InDesign doesn’t indicate that you’re a good  
# designer. To be honest, that information isn’t particularly relevant.  
# Besides, people will  
# take it for granted that you can use InDesign because you’re a designer. It says so at the  
# top of the CV you’ve just submitted.

465 **DO rest your eyes periodically**  
# throughout the day  
# The great designer Alvin Lustig slowly lost his sight toward the end of his life.  
# Nevertheless, he continued working, directing others to complete ideas.  
# Alvin Lustig  
# being who he is, I’m fairly certain that his assistants followed his direction, using red, or  
# Clarendon, or whatever he suggested. Many of us don’t have the same command of  
# others. If you were to lose your sight, you may ask your assistant to use a yellow  
# background and singular image of a beach ball. He or she may then choose to ignore you  
# and create a chaotic mess with dark tones but still tell you that the poster is yellow with a  
# beach ball. To combat this scenario, it is critical to rest your eyes. Stop, at least every  
**twenty minutes, and focus on a distant spot, or take a walk around the oﬃce. When the**  
# computer screen begins to seem blurry and dark, you have exceeded your viewing  
# allotment.

466 **DO work with talented illustrators,**  
# writers, and photographers  
# The single most important thing I have learned in my years doing this is to hire amazing  
# people and let them do what they do best. I might be able to write, but I can’t write on  
# every subject and in every tone. I might be proficient with a camera, but others are so  
# much sharper and creative behind the lens. I know my way around a pen, pencil, and  
467 **paintbrush, but incredible illustrators inspire me at every turn.**  
# People in all of these  
# areas have shown the ability to make my projects a thousand times better than they ever  
# could have been in my hands alone. Fight \(and plan\) for the budget to bring on the best,

468 **DO hire a good accountant, and save**  
# more than you spend  
# It is not uncommon to hear a non-designer ask, “I designed my own logo and business  
# card. What do you think?” What can you say? “It’s hideous. You’re a sap.  
# Are you brain-  
# dead?” Of course not, but it is rare that the result is anything more than sad. The designer  
# who says, “I don’t need an accountant. I know how to do this,” is just as stupid. Designers  
# enjoy breaking rules and playing loose with facts. These are not good traits in an  
# accountant. Therefore, hiring a good accountant is a priority.  
# And like hiring a designer,  
# the accountant who charges a ludicrously small amount will probably not provide the  
# best result.  
# As a rule, always hire an accountant more expensive than you believe you  
# should. You will appreciate the results, and you will save money.  
# SA  
# DO build a team that complements, not  
# duplicates, your abilities  
# Not every member of a barbershop quartet needs to sing bass. Similarly, surrounding  
# yourself with a bevy of people who think and act just like you can be more than  
# counterproductive, it can be downright creepy, like a science fiction movie filled with  
# clones moving silently in concert with one another. In practice, it limits the possibilities  
# of how you could approach creative problem solving by curbing the diverse backgrounds  
# and mindsets that could be contributing to your work. The chances that all of your clients  
# are exactly like you is remote at best, and a team with some range will come in handy at  
# every turn.

469 **DON’T be afraid to share ideas and**

# against other designers \(and not for free, I hope\), the last thing you’re going to do is turn  
# up at the meeting and say to your rivals, “Hey guys, do you want to see what I came up  
# with?” However, there are times when sharing ideas will gain you contracts. For example,  
# you’ve designed a brochure, and your client tells you it’s great and that they’d now like to  
# roll out the concept to their new website.  
# Oh no—you’re a print designer and don’t do  
**websites. It’s time to go see the web designer who rents the oﬃce across the hall. The**  
# original concept is yours but what’s to stop you from collaborating with another designer  
470 **with diﬀerent skills to ensure that you keep the contract? It’s a good idea to have**

# project. What was that hitting my keyboard? A drop of sweat? This deadline is really  
# stressing me out. Wait, that’s it!  
# A photo of a water drop would be perfect. Inspiration just  
**before the final cutoﬀ. I just need to swap out this illustration of a hose, and package my**  
**files, send them oﬀ to the printer, wait for my client to be surprised, be on the hook for the**  
# fees to change it back, and possibly be fired.  
# Oh, right, I should always get approval before  
# finalizing a job, no matter how tight the deadline.  
# JF  
472 **DON’T demonize another designer**  
# because you don’t happen to like his or  
# her work  
# Put things in perspective.  
# As important as we say design is to society, it is, after all, only  
# graphic design.  
# A weak solution will not kill someone.  
# A bad poster will not bring about  
# the ruin of Western civilization.  
# An incomprehensible logo will not deprive your family  
# of a home. Forming an opinion about work and viewing it with a critical eye is good.  
# But  
# demonizing a designer who created a piece you dislike is foolish. Hating an evil dictator is  
# a good idea, but a designer who uses a typeface you don’t like is not evil. The best  
# designers are those who remain open to new ideas and new ways of working. The worst  
473 **designers are close-minded and rigid. They are the designers who wander through their**  
# careers despising their peers and truly hating younger designers. The tragedy here is the  
# loss of opportunity to learn, grow, and create friendships.  
# SA  
474 **DON’T discuss one client’s business with**  
# another  
475 **One of the greatest joys in this business is working with people whom you truly like.**  
# Following a taxing project, you might find yourself bonding with a client over a shared  
# childhood experience, or some travel mishap, or a pop culture reference. Sooner rather  
# than later, our favorite clients become some of our favorite people and our friends, and  
# we feel comfortable talking with them about almost anything, including what makes up  
# the bulk of our waking hours—work. It makes sense that they would talk to us about their  
**work at times. Surely, we should reciprocate. Talking about someone in the oﬃce who**  
# annoys you can be precarious—they may be assigned to the client at some point.  
# Complaining about your workload might make them think that you are overburdened,  
# and they might consider sending some work elsewhere. Talking about the secrets you are  
# privy to with your other clients is the ultimate sin, going against your unspoken \(or  
# perhaps written\) agreement with said client and making your other client unsure about  
# how loose you are with their information.  
# JF  
476 **DON’T criticize another designer in front**  
# of a client  
# Consider this scenario\: you need an architect to design your house. The first architect  
# tells you how awful all the other architects are. The second and third architects do the  
# same. You are left with the sense that all architects must be untrustworthy and spiteful.  
# When we criticize another designer to a client, we are doing the same. When trying to  
# convince the client that another designer is bad, we denigrate the entire profession. The  
# design profession is in a constant battle to be respected and understood by the business  
# community. There are enough nondesigners who berate the profession; we do not need to  
# attack one another from within. This only reinforces the idea that designers are  
**temperamental and diﬃcult and have questionable ethics.**  
# SA  
# DON’T criticize work previously  
# commissioned from another designer  
# It is tempting to sit in a meeting and complain about previous work created for a client. It  
# may be true that the solutions are inappropriate or weak. It may seem that pointing out  
# these weaknesses will elevate you somehow. Unfortunately, you may not realize that the  
# work was likely created in collaboration with the client. You are saying, without  
# intending to, “You really don’t know what you’re doing.” Never criticize previous work.  
# Rather than castigating the work, point out some positive aspects. There is a good chance  
# that the work may have good points, but they don’t work cohesively as a group or support  
# a new communication goal.  
# SA  
477 **DON’T pretend you know more about a**  
# client’s business than they do  
478 **A common mistake a designer makes is to believe that he or she is omniscient.**  
# “What you  
**need,” he or she may say, “is a new identity and completely diﬀerent inventory and**  
# accounting system.” Designers, like all people, are not omniscient.  
# A client will always  
# know his or her business better than the designer. The client, for example, may be the  
# director of a museum. While the designer has visited the museum and understands the  
# audience and communication needs, he or she may be ignorant of other issues such as  
**staﬃng, acquisition, and security. Listen to your client.**  
# Clients typically have valuable  
# information that informs the project. Don’t be quick to disregard the client’s issues and  
# concerns. There may be a critical reason that you are not aware of.  
# SA  
479 **DO be available to your clients at all**  
# times, but on your terms  
480 **As you sit outside the restaurant, with your meal cooling and your date freezing, you**  
# listen to your client telling you how they just are not sure about the orange and that  
# maybe it needs a little more red, no, yellow, no, the orange is fine—you come to the  
# realization that the line between work and the rest of your life has forever blurred, to  
# your chagrin. There is no use in pretending that a creative vocation means straight nine-  
**to-five shifts at the oﬃce. We are a service industry, often working for top decision**  
# makers, which means having to be available virtually at all times. Just accept this aspect  
# and move on.  
# But now, get your life back.  
# Being accessible doesn’t always mean being  
# accessible immediately. Decide what is appropriate, and work directly with your clients  
# to establish this. Let them know you coach your kids on Tuesday or that you will return  
# the call in an hour when dinner ends, and they will do the same.  
# JF  
481 **DO actually talk to your clients—real**  
# conversations build strong relationships  
# People hire people they like. It is more costly, time-wise and financially, to find a new  
# client than continuing to work with an existing client.  
# A client will work with a designer  
# over time and build a relationship through good work and dialogue. Strong relationships  
# built on mutual respect are likely to withstand problems. When a project delivers late, a  
# typesetting error is not caught, or a check is lost in the mail, a strong relationship is vital.  
# A longtime client is also more likely to refer you to another client.  
# Building connections  
# happens through honest communication. Take the time to have lunch with a client, play  
**golf, invite her to a barbecue. These small touches build trust and make the diﬀerence**  
# between being a vendor and being a partner.  
# SA  
482 **DON’T discuss design with your client**  
# unless they express an interest  
# When your car is not working, you take it to the mechanic. You want to know briefly what  
# is wrong, how it will be fixed, and how much it will cost. Unless you are an automobile  
# aficionado, you do not care about the type of timing belt, spider gear, shift fork, or slave  
# cylinder. When a designer discusses a solution with a client, the latter will want to know  
483 **what the solution is and how much it will cost to implement. Typically, clients do not care**  
# about complementary colors, the history of  
# Baskerville, or letter-spacing issues. Talk to  
# the client about communication issues, audience perception, and desired results. It is  
# your job to know the fine detail. It is also your job to explain the decisions with language  
# pertinent to business concerns rather than by using design vernacular.  
# SA  
484 **DO count to ten when a client angers you**  
# before opening your mouth  
**Thomas Jeﬀerson said, “When angry, count to ten before speaking. When very angry**  
# count to one hundred.” As tempting as it is to lash out and attack a client when you have  
# been riled up, it is always a bad idea. Rarely do we follow logic and give a measured  
# response while enraged. It is not necessary to answer any question or respond to an  
# accusation immediately.  
# Counting to ten allows both sides to step back and, hopefully,  
# calm down. It is much more common to look back and wonder why you were so mad than  
# to feel that you should have been angrier. Something else to consider is whether the  
# problem is about pride.  
# Pride is a bad reason to engage in an angry episode.  
# People tell  
# themselves stories in order to survive. Let them. It costs you little.  
# SA  
485 **DON’T accept your client’s word as**  
# gospel  
# Clients only know what they already know. They are convinced that they need a small  
# brochure and assign that as the project. This is because they have seen only a small  
# brochure and assume that it is the best solution.  
# Clients often give the wrong assignment.  
# It is not the designer’s job to blindly do what she is told but rather to solve the problem.  
# That solution may be a completely unexpected medium or format.  
# Or the problem may  
# not be about the brochure at all but about the website and social media. Stop and assess  
# the situation. Step back and consider the bigger issues. Never just do as commanded.  
# SA  
**DON’T continue to work for a diﬃcult**  
# client  
# The only people allowed to shout at you should be your mother and, possibly, if not  
# violent, your spouse. There is never a reason for a client to shout at a designer. You  
# deserve to be treated with respect and professionalism. There are clients who are  
# challenging because they have challenging projects.  
**But the clients who are diﬃcult**  
# because they are abusive should not be tolerated.  
# At best, they will refer you to other  
# heinous and disrespectful clients.  
# At worst, you will be demoralized and produce bad  
# work.  
# SA  
486 **DO stick to your side of the project’s**  
# schedule regardless of your client’s input  
# This rule is a bit of a two-way street because it requires some positive input from both  
# sides.  
# Creative projects are always subject to change, and as designers, we have to accept  
# that it’s going to happen sometimes.  
# Because of this, a client should, within reason, be  
# made to feel that they can change their mind if something strikes them as important  
# during the execution of a project. Whatever form that takes, the challenge for the  
# designer is to still deliver on time and on budget—if changes are reasonable.  
# On the other  
# hand, the client has to accept that not everything is possible and that it’s acceptable for a  
# designer to explain why a schedule or budget might not be met if a large change is  
# requested.  
# A reasonable client will accept this and may decide the change isn’t that  
# important. Either way, hold to your time line so that delayed projects don’t end up  
**aﬀecting others.**  
# TS  
487 **DON’T procrastinate—ever**  
488 **Procrastination is, unfortunately, one of the most common habits in the world. It always**  
**seems so much easier to put oﬀ an unpleasant task until tomorrow. The opposite is true.**  
# If you procrastinate, the task will loom larger and larger. It will seem more unpleasant  
# and will revisit your thoughts frequently. The task will not disappear, so why ignore it?  
# The solution is to simply buckle down and do the task. Now is as good a time as any. It is  
# much more pleasant and rewarding to tackle a task and complete it well in a timely  
# manner. When you find yourself cleaning your desk for the fifth time to avoid the  
**financial paperwork, stop. Get to work. Never put oﬀ until tomorrow what you can do**  
# today. The pressure of guilt and worry will be gone, and you can engage in more enjoyable  
# tasks.  
# SA  
489 **DO talk about design as an asset**  
# We often have trouble, as designers, explaining what we do to the outside world. Did you  
# make the formula for the soda? No. Did you do the logo? No. Did you pick the brand  
# colors? No.  
# Oh, so you actually print the cans? No.  
# Come up with the shape?  
# Mold the  
# aluminum?  
# Put it in the box??? No, I designed the packaging. You can see how quickly  
# what we add to the process could get lost, though we all know it is one of the most  
# important aspects. Design can be nebulous to the public but also to clients. Those sitting  
# in boardrooms know that they must have it, but they rarely know what it does. It is our  
# job to be advocates for design. Make it clear at every possible moment that design adds  
# tangible value to what is being created and is essential. Speak in terms that the business  
# world would understand and stand firm. Design is important. They need us.  
# JF  
490 **DO keep it simple**  
# The options available to designers to meet a brief are infinite, and the temptation to keep  
# adding is very strong. It is important, therefore, to remember that the primary purpose of  
# design is to aid communication and facilitate understanding. The best designs and the  
# most successful work are always solutions that have taken a simple, clean, and  
# uncluttered approach. The rules in this book help guide you down that path. However, the  
# design can only come from you. The design process—as well as being ideas-driven—is a  
# series of decisions taken by you to facilitate the brief. Make the right decisions and ask  
# the right questions along the way, and your ideas will succeed.  
# Overcomplicate and  
# clutter your designs with redundancies, and they will be confused and unappealing. In  
# the immortal words of the German American architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe\: “Less  
**is more.” PD**
