Whenever you tell a builder or an architect that you wish to have your own house or  
wish to create your multi-apartment building, the very first thing they will work on  
would be a floor plan. Whatever you wish to design or whatever features that might  
come in your building or residential complex will come in the floor plan. From garden  
designs to your roof, from your plumbing fixtures to your front elevation --  
everything comes under floor plan designs. As Alex Steffen said,  
"More is not better. Better is better. You don't need a bigger house; you need a  
different floor plan. You don't need more stuff; you need stuff you'll actually use."  
In this elaborated guide to understanding floor plans, we will walk you through  
multiple types of floor plans, like HVAC layouts, reflected ceiling plan, front and rear  
elevation, electrical plan, plumbing plan, and more. In addition to this, we will help  
you understand the difference between floor plan, drafting, and blueprint. After  
completing this guide, you will be well versed in different usages of the floor plan  
and how easy and effective it is to create a floor plan using EdrawMax.  
1\. What is a Floor Plan  
In architecture and building designs, floor plans are considered the backbone of  
every construction project. Floor plans are scale drawings that visually illustrate the  
relationship between multiple rooms, spaces, and physical features as viewed from  
above. In architecture 101, we teach students that if you need to understand what a  
floor plan looks like, then imagine yourself levitating in your house and seeing  
everything from the ceiling area -- analyze the exterior and interior walls, look at the  
bathroom area, understand the size of the kitchen, take the dimensions of the rooms  
-- all this and more comes under an effective floor plan.  
Floor Plan\:  
In simple words, a floor plan is a 2D pictorial description that interior designers and  
architects use when they are looking to renovate or design your property. In order  
to properly understand the floor plans, we will describe floor plan elements and  
some of the primary characteristics of a good floor plan.

2\. What is Included in a Floor Plan  
As you will see in this elaborated guide, floor plans typically illustrate  
several building elements1 , including walls, doors, windows, and stairs. In addition  
to this, you will find other important elements in a detailed floor plan, like plumbing,  
HVAC, and electrical systems. In addition to this, several other important features  
are included in a floor plan, like\:  
• Entire space of your property\: Let us suppose that you are at the front side of  
your plot, which you will use to create your house. The entire purchased area  
falls under your floor plan. When the architect creates the floor plan, they will  
include the location and setup of your bedrooms, living rooms, dining rooms,  
kitchen, bathrooms, garage, garden, backyard, and more.  
• Room layouts\: In order to fully understand the rooms, your floor plan should  
illustrate the layouts and areas per floor. These room layouts will further  
depict how different rooms will be connected with each other, how stairs are  
connected to the second floor, how the hallways are connected with  
individual rooms and more.  
• Illustrate doors and windows\: Your floor plan should depict the locations of  
the door entryways, the height and width of the windows, the direction of  
your sitting in the room, the height and width of your doors, and more.  
• Additional features\: The floor plan should plot out the Space you will need  
for built-in appliances like refrigerator, oven, sink, washer, and dryer. Anything  
you need to include in your interior layout should be drawn on your floor  
plans.  
2.1 Floor Plan Key Words  
Architects and builders from different parts of the world use different important  
words to draw the floor plan of any building or corporate complex. Some of the  
important words that come under floor plan are\:  
• Blueprint\: Blueprint is almost similar to floor plans, as they also detail the  
architectural drawings used by the construction team.  
• Rendering\: Rendering, or elevations, are the front, rear, and side drawings of  
the finished construction project.  
• Bumwad\: Bumwad, or scratch paper, or tracing paper, is an onion paper used  
by the architects to draw the initial design of the floor plans.  
• Schematics\: Schematics will include all the primary goals that an architect will  
try to achieve from the said design.  
1 Building Elements\: https\://www.edrawsoft.com/walldoor.html  
https\://www.edrawsoft.com/what-is-floor-plan.html 3 Floor Plan Complete Guide | EdrawMax  
• Dollhouse View\: All the floor plans, when depicted in a 3D view, come under  
dollhouse views.  
2.2 Key Characteristics of a Good Floor Plan  
You will find several floor plans online. Even your architect will present several floor  
plans to impress and get the task done at the earliest. However, when you finalize  
the floor plan, there are certain characteristics that you should consider. Some of the  
key characteristics that make a simple design a great floor plan are\:  
• Versatile\: All of your floor plan designs should accommodate any future  
changes. For instance, no one knew about the COVID-19 pandemic and how  
everyone will have to work from home. Now, those people who thought  
about turning their home into home offices faced much trouble because they  
had not thought about any such scenarios happening. Remember that your  
house design should easily manage any or some changes that might do in  
your living lifestyle.  
• Ideal Rooms\: Some of the family members complain that their children do  
not sleep because of the high television volume. In some cases, children  
complain that they do not get enough privacy in their own homes. So, always  
try to design a floor plan so that everyone in the house enjoys living there,  
and at the same time, everyone has their privacy..  
• Fulfill your lifestyle\: Understand that you and your family are going to live in  
that particular house. If you are an athlete who prefers to go on long runs,  
then creating a backyard is a nifty choice. In addition to this, if you have dogs  
at home, then an open garden for them will come in handy. It signifies that a  
good floor plan or a house design should resemble the kind of lifestyle that  
you and your family prefer.  
What is Included in a Floor Plan\:  
Floor plans typically illustrate several building elements, including walls, doors,  
windows, and stairs. In addition to this, you will find other important elements in a  
detailed floor plan, like plumbing, HVAC, and electrical systems.  
3\. Floor Plan vs. Other Construction Plan  
Since the floor plan topic is so advanced and detailed, most of the time, architecture  
or interior designing students get confused when someone refers to different types  
of construction plans, like blueprints, drafting, site plan, etc. Here, we will help you  
understand the primary differences between other construction plans and how the  
https\://www.edrawsoft.com/what-is-floor-plan.html 4 Floor Plan Complete Guide | EdrawMax  
floor is different from most of them. We will also help you navigate through different  
usages and tips for these different construction plans.  
Floor Plan vs. Drafting  
In architecture and building constructions, drafting2 creates an accurate depiction of  
different objects, buildings, or houses for engineering or technical purposes. The  
floor plans illustrate the relationship between different rooms and room elements.  
However, in drafting, objects are drawn to scale and usually comprise a top view,  
side view, and a main view of the building.  
Usage\: Just like floor plans, drafting or architectural drafter are helpful when  
it comes to construction. Some of the important tasks of an architectural  
drafter are\:  
• With a drafter, you can easily outline the quantity and quality of required  
materials. In most cases, it includes the labor rates, deadline, and the cost of  
completing the project.  
• Creating drafting helps assist with preparing building specifications to suit  
your current requirements.  
Tips\: While creating the architectural draft, there are some important steps  
or tips that you need to consider, like\:  
• Get a list of the objects before you sit down and start drafting.  
• Understand the requirements and work on your drawing accordingly.  
Floor Plan vs. Blueprint  
A floor plan is a view of a building from directly above, while a blueprint3 is a drawing  
created on a special type of paper with some chemicals on it. At the same time, a  
floor plan will show a door and window space. However, a blueprint will specify the  
correct dimensions of the windows and doors.  
Use\: Just like a floor plan, creating a blueprint serves multiple purposes, like\:  
• It defines the entire building's needs.  
• A blueprint will help you stay under schedule and budget.  
• With the help of a blueprint, you ensure that easy maintenance will be done  
in the future.  
2 Drafting\: https\://www.edrawsoft.com/2d-drafting-software.html  
3 Blueprint\: https\://www.edrawsoft.com/article/blueprint-complete-guide.html  
https\://www.edrawsoft.com/what-is-floor-plan.html 5 Floor Plan Complete Guide | EdrawMax  
Tips\: When you create a blueprint for your construction project, follow some  
of these tips to get better results\:  
• Ensure that the title and revision blocks on the blueprint are clearly marked.  
• Blueprints often consist of symbols and numbers -- ensure that you learn  
these symbols and blueprint abbreviations beforehand.  
Floor Plan vs. Site Plan  
A site plan, commonly known as a plot plan, is a technical drawing that visually  
illustrates existing and proposed conditions for a given area. In most of the site  
plans, we illustrate a portion of land that needs to be modified.  
Use\: In comparison to floor plans, which depict the house and the  
relationship between different rooms, site plans represent how the land is  
utilized and include the details of your surrounding areas. Some of the  
important usages of having a site plan are\:  
• It helps in submitting the reference document to the government  
administrator to check and approve.  
• It protects the landowners by complying with the government rules and  
regulations.  
Tips\: When you work on a site plan, you need to follow certain tips, like\:  
• Always adhere to the government rules and regulations.  
• Ensure that you have the right legends and symbols added to the site plan.  
4\. Importance of Floor Plan  
It is practically impossible to create a house or a building without first creating  
a floor plan. It gives you an idea about how your future house or building will look  
and helps all the workers understand their part of the job. Here we will give you  
some amazing benefits and ways to create a great floor plan.  
4.1 The Benefits of Floor Plan  
The floor plan gives you a bird's-eye view of the entire structure. It is a scaled  
overview of a room, bungalow, or building drawn by an architect. Some of the great  
benefits of creating a floor plan are\:  
• Floor plan design served as the perfect medium for visualizing the ideas of  
the builder in reality to the client who actually is going to live in the house.  
https\://www.edrawsoft.com/what-is-floor-plan.html 6 Floor Plan Complete Guide | EdrawMax  
• Floor plans, in general, give a sense of satisfaction along with a virtually real  
space experience with scale-down measurements and dimensions.  
• In most cases, floor plans are useful for the workers to perform the expertized  
tasks.  
• With floor plan designs, one can accurately indicate all the detailed  
dimensions in the column placement with the technically correct  
measurement.  
• If you use a tool like EdrawMax to create your plan, you can change the  
design as many times as required. Hence, by creating the floor plan, you  
reduce the on-site errors, making the construction process faster and more  
efficient.  
• Floor plan designs serve as a vital verification proof and a satisfaction link  
between everyone involved in the construction project.  
• Floor plans also help maintain the ease of communication between the  
engineers and the on-site workers.  
• With the right floor plan designs, you can even plan out the interior spaces  
without too much hassle.  
• With the help of the floor plan, you ensure that the right circulation and flow  
of traffic are maintained between the rooms and corridors.  
• Floor plans also help understand the right connection between different  
public and private areas of the building structures.  
4.2 Circulation and Flow  
When you create a floor plan, what matters the most is how you have designed the  
rooms and how one can navigate from one place to another. Depending upon the  
nature of the building, these circulation and flows play a very important role. For  
instance, if you are creating a movie theater, you will have to ensure that the  
circulation and flow of the traffic are less restrictive and that people can move along  
efficiently.  
Depending upon your floor size, requirements, and features, you can change and  
modify the decor of the building. It should be noted here that you will be able to  
create better circulation and flow diagrams within the building area with fewer visual  
obstructions.  
4.3 Feng Shui in Floor Plan  
In several Asian cultures, people prefer to have certain energies and ways to  
construct their houses. For instance, in India, people usually get Vastu done to  
ensure that the positive energy flows in the right direction and all the negativity will  
stay outside. Similar to this, Feng Shui plays a very pivotal role in East Asian countries  
where the architects and builders consider the art and science of creating a  
harmonious environment.  
https\://www.edrawsoft.com/what-is-floor-plan.html 7 Floor Plan Complete Guide | EdrawMax

your floor plans, there are certain ways to decorate it, like\:

6\. The Floor Plan Symbols?  
Any floor plan design is incomplete without the right symbols. Here we will help you  
understand some of the primary categories of the symbols that are used in floor  
plans. It should be noted here that a floor plan is a summation of multiple plans, like  
reflected ceiling plans, elevations, bathroom plans, garden plans, security and access  
plans, electrical plans, etc. That is why it is necessary to understand every section of  
these symbols.  
Whatever symbols that you see here in this floor plan symbol guide are readily  
available at EdrawMax, even if you do not find some of the floor plan symbols18 that  
18 Floor Plan Symbols\: https\://www.edrawsoft.com/floor-plan-symbols.html

you need in the 'Predefined Symbol' library, you can go ahead and create your own  
symbols just by importing the image from your local machine or the internet.  
Building Plan Symbols  
• Doors\: Doors symbols depict the doors in the building. Some of the most  
commonly used door symbols are single doors, double doors, bifold doors,  
and more.  
• Windows\: There are several window symbols, like a fixed window, single  
casement window, vertical sliding window, double casement window, bay  
window, horizontal sliding window, and double-hung window.

7\. How to Read a Floor Plan  
If you are dependent upon your architect or builder to create the floor plan for you,  
you need a basic understanding of how you can read the floor plan in detail. At the  
same time, you should be well aware of the floor plan measurements, multiple scaling  
options, and how easy it is to measure your own Space.  
Before we guide you through creating your flood plan designs, let us help you  
understand some other important basic terminologies involving floor plan designs.  
7.1 Floor Plan Measurements  
One of the most important pieces of information about the floor plan is  
understanding the measurements. Here are some of the important guidelines to  
understand the measurements of the floor plan\:  
• Depending upon your locations or demographic preferences, you can either  
display the area of any room in square meters or square feet.  
• At the same time, you can display the room dimensions using X and Y  
measurements, like if the width of the room is 12 feet and the length is 20  
feet, then you can write, 12 feet\*20 feet.  
• The inside walls are also measured by illustrating pointing arrows. The  
distance from the arrow line to the parallel wall will help you understand the  
distance from one point to another.  
• It is always good advice to denote the total area of the floor plan or the  
rooms right on the plan. For instance, if the width of the plot is 30 feet and  
the length is 50 feet, you can mention that the total area of the plot is 1500  
sq. ft.  
https\://www.edrawsoft.com/what-is-floor-plan.html 21 Floor Plan Complete Guide | EdrawMax  
7.2 Floor Plan Scale  
Understanding the floor plan scales is another important skill you should learn  
before you remodel your house or create the building from scratch. Even before you  
start scaling, you should understand what units of measure you will use to create the  
floor plans. It means you are going to use the imperial system \(feet and inches\), or  
are you going to follow the metric system \(centimeters and meters\) to measure the  
floor plan.  
So, how do you decide? The easiest way to choose the floor plan system is to  
understand your demographic or your client's demographic. If you are working in the  
USA or for a client who follows USA mathematics, you should use the imperial  
system. However, if you and your clients are from the UK, Australia, or Ireland, you  
should use a metric system.  
Once you get hold of any floor plan, you will see that the scale for plans is shown in  
two different ways\:  
• As equivalent measurements  
• As a ratio  
Common scale to understand Metric Floor Plan\:  
• 2cm to 1m, which means 2cm on the paper represents 100cm \(or 1m\) in real  
size \(1\:50\).  
• 1cm to 1m, which means 1cm on the paper, represents 1oocm \(or 1m\) in real  
size \(1\:100\).  
Common scale to understand Imperial Floor Plan\:  
• 1/8 inch to a foot, which means 1 inch on the paper represents 96 inches in  
real size \(1\:96\).  
• 1/16 inch to a foot, which means 1 inch on the paper represents 192 inches in  
real size \(1\:192\).  
7.3 Tips for Measuring Your Space  
Measuring the floor plan space takes some effort and has a learning curve. If you  
have an architect present with you, they will guide you to start measuring the  
correct Space for your floor plan. In some cases, you might not get good guidance to  
measure your Space correctly. In those cases, you should follow some of the below-  
mentioned tips to measure the Space of the floor plan\:  
• Ask your architect to provide you with a set of printed drawings for you to  
understand them.  
https\://www.edrawsoft.com/what-is-floor-plan.html 22 Floor Plan Complete Guide | EdrawMax  
• Always use an architectural scale to avoid any errors.  
• Always start from the house plan's exterior and then start measuring inwards.  
• Measure the length of one wall along the baseboard, from one corner of the  
room to another.  
• Once you have noted down the exterior measurement of the Space, you can  
start measuring the inner walls.  
• You can then measure the entryways, windows, and doors.  
7.4 The Visual Elements in the Floor Plan  
The easiest way to understand and read a floor plan is by looking at it from a bird's  
eye view. In architecture 101, we teach our students to imagine that there is a house  
without a roof and then locate the front entrance. The next step is to visualize the  
front door, walk through the house, and navigate the other areas.  
The floor plans consist of windows, doors, stairways, and different rooms, including  
the primary room, dining room, laundry room, and more.  
• Walls\: In the floor plan, walls are the strongest visual elements and are  
represented by parallel lines and may be solid or filled with a pattern. In the  
floor plans, breaks in walls indicate doors, windows, and openings between  
rooms.  
• Stairs\: Stairs are drawn as a series of rectangles. Where the stair rises three  
feet above the floor, it is cut with a diagonal line.  
• Furniture, Fixture, and Fittings\: In most floor plans, you will see the locations  
of sinks, toilets, and other important fixtures. In most cases, we also include  
the flooring materials in the floor plans to provide the right scale and help the  
viewers imagine how their rooms will look and feel.  
• Measurements\: In the floor plans, dimension strings are drawn parallel to the  
elements with a 45-degree hash mark at each end, which indicates where the  
measurement starts and ends.  
• Ceiling\: While ceilings are not illustrated in the floor plans, it is always a good  
technique to illustrate them using a dashed line.  
8\. How to Choose the Right Floor Plan  
You should consider several aspects while deciding on the right floor plans.  
Depending upon your requirements and budget, you may have to look for different  
floor plans before finalizing the one that will ultimately become your dream house.  
Some of the important aspects you need to consider before finalizing the floor plan  
are mentioned here. However, it should be noted here that depending on your  
budget and requirements, and these aspects might change or update. Most of the  
time, the zest of choosing the right floor plan will remain the same.  
https\://www.edrawsoft.com/what-is-floor-plan.html 23 Floor Plan Complete Guide | EdrawMax  
• Lifestyle\: If the floor plan is not designed for your lifestyle, then it would  
become very difficult for you to live in. For example, if you are a musician,  
you need a separate room far away from the front side to practice your  
music. In addition to this, if you prefer to work from home, then your house  
plan should include a separate home office layout. Another good example of  
choosing the floor plan based on your lifestyle is considering a dancer who  
would like to have a large practice room on the ground floor.  
• Comfort\: Another important aspect of choosing the right floor plan is  
understanding that you need a place to get the right comfort. If you have  
created fewer rooms, it might become cluttered or crowded at times. So, you  
need to consider adding extra space based upon your preferences and how  
many people will live in the house.  
• Versatile\: As mentioned in this elaborated guide to understanding floor  
plans, all the houses should be well accommodated to certain changes in  
lifestyle. For instance, you should have the flexibility to turn your bedroom  
into a small office or your children's room to an entertainment section once  
they leave the house for their college.  
• Location\: Another important segment that you need to consider before  
finalizing the floor plan is the location of your preference. If you prefer to live  
in a country house, your location will matter the most. In some cases, if you  
have children or women at home, their safety plays a very important role in  
choosing the right floor plan for your building.  
• Budget\: Lastly, all floor plan designs or features should come under your  
budget. A large floor plan with unnecessary spaces will burden your pocket.  
So choose a floor plan that benefits you and your family and is also  
economical.  
How to Choose the Right Floor Plan\:  
• Consider the lifestyle;  
• Consider adding extra space based upon your preferences and how many  
people will live in the house;  
• Consider the floor plan being well accommodated to certain changes in  
lifestyle;  
• Consider the safety of the building;  
• Consider all come under your budget.  
9\. How to Design a Floor Plan in General  
Now that you have understood the measurement and scaling of the floor plan, it is  
time to understand how you can create it using EdrawMax. However, before we talk  
https\://www.edrawsoft.com/what-is-floor-plan.html 24 Floor Plan Complete Guide | EdrawMax  
about the free template and symbols that EdrawMax19 offers, let us understand the  
traditional way of creating a floor plan for your construction project.  
There are several ways of creating the floor plan. However, the best possible way is  
to understand the site, analyze it, put down your requirements, needs, and how  
much you wish to spend on the design. Once you have laid out all the details, you  
can start working on the floor plan design that will eventually become your dream  
house. Some of the traditional ways of creating the floor plan are\:  
Step 1\: Analyze the site  
After finalizing your requirements, you can analyze the site by visiting the area  
firsthand. Check how much land you have and how many rooms you plan to add.  
Once you have noted down the number of bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms, you  
can take the measurements.  
Step 2\: Take Measurements  
If the building already exists, then take the measures of the walls, doors, and  
furniture that you need to add to it. If you create the floor plan from scratch, discuss  
it with your architect and learn more about the door and window sizes. Once you  
have all the dimensions ready, you can start taking the right measurements of the  
interior and exterior walls.  
Step 3\: Draw Walls  
After measuring the entire land and getting the dimensions of the walls and  
windows, you can start drawing the walls. Ensure that you draw the exterior walls  
first and then work on the interior walls.  
Step 4\: Add Architectural Features  
Architectural features are among the most important parts of any floor plan. Add  
some of the most prominent features, like a window, stairs, sink, bathroom units,  
kitchen equipment, etc.  
Step 5\: Add Furniture  
In order to make your floor plan visually appealing, you should also add furniture to  
it. You can have beds, chairs, and TV units in your bedroom areas. You can add a  
dining table, chairs, and more in the dining area.

multiple important areas and dimensions, like the family room is 18\*15, bedroom \#3  
is 9\*11, bedroom \#2 is 11\*9, and the primary bedroom is 15\*12. Creating such  
elaborative plans with the dimensions helps the builder understand how well they  
have to build the house. In addition to this, such house design layouts will also help  
the new homeowners understand the correct dimensions of their huge three-  
bedroom house. You can use EdrawMax's architect's scale to place all the  
dimensions and scales correctly.

Example 3\: Office Layout  
Following is an office layout design created in EdrawMax. As you can see from this  
office layout design, we have placed the correct symbols and legends to ensure that  
the right message is conveyed. If an emergency occurs, the building management  
department must guarantee that the evacuation is conducted quickly and orderly. At  
the same time, building management will know which routes to take in the event of  
any emergency.  
Example 4\: Garden Design  
Following is the floor plan with the garden design. When you create a floor plan, it is  
always good to add the front and backyard garden areas to get a proper view of the  
finished project. This garden floor plan template shows a way to visualize how  
people will move through Space. Garden apartments tend to be at ground level or  
https\://www.edrawsoft.com/what-is-floor-plan.html 34 Floor Plan Complete Guide | EdrawMax  
just partially below grade and are often one-bedroom units. It is also noted here that  
the garden design is quite opulent, including features such as a pool, stables, and  
gardens.  
Example 5\: Landscape Plan  
The following floor plan design constitutes a landscape design, which lets you see  
the overall layout of the public park. Here, you can see that we have walking areas,  
sitting chairs, shrubs, trees, stones, ponds, and more. As you see here, landscape  
planning is the development and application of strategies, policies, and plans to  
create successful environments in both urban and rural settings. The primary focus  
of landscape design is to create the environment around your building.

Example 6\: Seating Plan  
Following is a classroom seating plan illustrating the formation of the entire class  
where the students will sit facing the teacher. As illustrated here, the classroom is  
over 1,430 sq. ft. and can provide seating arrangements to over 209 students and  
teachers. As illustrated here, a seating plan is a diagram or a set of written or spoken  
instructions that determines where people should take their seats. It is widely used  
on diverse occasions. You can create such seating charts for your classroom  
requirements using EdrawMax.

Example 7\: HVAC Plan  
In the following HVAC plan layout, we have illustrated the air return system that  
sucks in air and draws it through a filter. The air is then passed through the main  
system. As we see from the HVAC floor plan template, the second important part of  
the HVAC here is the filter and how the exhaust outlets are created to expel the  
heating systems. As illustrated, HVAC plans are vital for a home or a building's  
planning as it shows how water networks, boilers, and air ducts are installed in the  
apartment area.

Example 8\: Reflected Ceiling Plan  
The following is a reflected ceiling plan design that shows the ceiling plan of a house  
with three bedrooms, each with a bathroom, kitchen, and reception area. As  
illustrated, two bedrooms have the same illumination, including one ceiling light  
outlet, six-light surfaces mounted, and two light surfaces mounted inside the  
bathroom. The other bedroom has one ceiling fan, one light surface mounted, and  
another inside the bathroom. It should be noted here that a reflected ceiling plan is a  
drawing that depicts the items that are positioned on a room's or space's ceiling.
