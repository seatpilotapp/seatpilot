This book originally grew out of courses in pricing and revenue optimization that I de-  
veloped with Michael Harrison at Stanford University and taught at Columbia Business  
School and at the Stanford Graduate School of Business in the early 1990s. Over the last  
20 years, the number of courses on the topic has increased steadily both in business schools  
and in management science and operations research programs. Some of the challenges in-  
volved in developing and teaching a course on pricing and revenue optimization have been  
treated in articles by Peter Bell \(2004\) and me \(Phillips 2003\).  
The primary audience for this book is students at the master’s or undergraduate level,  
as well as managers in revenue management, pricing, and related areas. The book assumes  
some familiarity with probabilistic modeling and optimization theory and comfort with  
basic calculus. Sections that are more specialized or require more quantitative sophistica-  
tion \(or at least more patience\), or that are specialized to a particular interest and may not  
be of general interest, have been marked with an asterisk \(\*\) and can be skipped without  
loss of continuity. In pricing and revenue optimization, as in other applications of analytics,  
what is theoretically elegant is often not practical, and what is practical is often not theo-  
retically elegant. When in doubt, I have erred on the side of presenting the practical. I have  
also simplified models at times, and I generally present heuristic arguments rather than  
formal proofs with the aim of providing insight. For those who want to dive deeper into the  
theory and see proofs of key results, I heartily recommend Kalyan Talluri and Garrett van  
Ryzin’s The Theory and Practice of Revenue Management \(2004b\) and Guillermo Gallego  
and Huseyin Topaloglu’s Revenue Management and Pricing Analytics \(2019\).  
This second edition has been substantially rewritten. This reflects, in part, the evolu-  
tion that the field has undergone in the 15 years since the first edition was published. What  
was fresh and exciting then \(particularly classic revenue management applications at the  
airlines and related industries\) is now standard practice, and what is fresh and exciting  
now \(for example, “learning and earning” algorithms for online pricing\) did not exist 15  
years ago. This edition reflects these developments, with new sections on dynamic pricing,  
price-response estimation, reinforcement learning, and other more recent topics, and with xii  
preface  
­ somewhat less emphasis on classic revenue management applications in airlines, hotels,  
and the like. The goal continues to be to provide the reader with a broad overview of the  
field with a focus on applications. References are provided in “Further Reading” sections at  
the end of each chapter for those who want to dig deeper into particular topics.  
For clarity, I call anyone who is setting a price a seller and anyone who is considering a  
purchase a customer. This seems less clumsy than the more accurate term prospective buyer.  
I use the term consumer in a broader sense to refer to individuals as economic decision  
makers without reference to a specific purchase opportunity. Also, for clarity, I use male  
pronouns for sellers and female pronouns for customers.  
Among those who read drafts of this book and generously provided comments and sug-  
gestions, pride of place belongs to Michael Harrison, who taught the pricing and revenue  
optimization course with me at the Stanford Business School. Not only did Mike read the  
first draft of the first edition and provide many helpful comments, but our discussions  
helped me focus and organize my own thinking. I am also thankful to Brenda Barnes,  
whose careful reading and thoughtful comments on several chapters resulted in substantial  
improvements. The late Ken McLeod of Stanford University Press provided encouragement  
and inspiration in the early days of writing the book. He is very much missed. I also thank  
Dean Boyd, Bill Carroll, Yosun Denizeri, Michael Eldredge, Mehran Farahmand, Scott  
Friend, Steve Haas, Jake Krakauer, Ahmet Kuyumcu, Bob Oliver, Rama Ramakrishnan,  
Carol Redfield, Alex Romanenko, and Nicola Secomandi, who all contributed comments  
and suggestions that improved the book. Thanks also go to my students at Columbia and  
Stanford, who caught many typos. Thanks go to the Columbia University Business School,  
the Stanford University Business School, Manugistics, and Nomis Solutions, all of whom  
provided office space and support at various times throughout the writing of the book.  
The book has also benefited from my extensive interactions and discussions with col-  
leagues over the years, including Bill Brunger, Simon Caufield, Glenn Colville, Guillermo  
Gallego, Tom Grossman, Lloyd Hansen, Peter Grønlund, Garud Iyengar, Anton Kleywegt,  
Steve Kou, Warren Lieberman, Ray Lyons, Costis Maglaras, Özalp Özer, Özgur Özluk, Jörn  
Peter Petersen, Özge S ¸ahin, Kalyan Talluri, Garrett van Ryzin, Van Veen, Loren Williams,  
Graham Young, and Jon Zimmerman, among many others. Special thanks go to Christian  
Albright, Serhan Duran, Jiehong Kong, Warren Lieberman, Joern Meissner, and Nicola  
Secomandi for catching errors in previous printings and providing useful suggestions.  
Since the first edition, I have benefited enormously from spending time in the Decision  
Risk and Operations Division of the Columbia Business School and from numerous dis-  
cussions and collaborations with colleagues there, including Omar Besbes, Daniel Guetta,  
Gabriel Weintraub, and Assaf Zeevi. I am also grateful to Uber and Amazon for the time  
I spent in data science and pricing research groups at both companies — in both cases, I  
was fortunate to work with immensely talented colleagues who helped me grapple with the  
particular pricing challenges faced by modern e-commerce companies. Guillermo Gallego  
and Markus Husemann-Kopetzky provided comments on individual chapters that led to  
significant improvements. Additional thanks go to Fabio Bortone, Carolyn Lacy, Cheyenne  
Morgan, Frank Quilty, Kit Weathers, and Gretchen Yanda for highly focused discussions preface xiii  
on specific topics. Finally, thanks go to my editor, Steve Catalano; my copy editor, Anita  
Hueftle; and the team at Stanford University Press for their support and assistance in creat-  
ing a much improved second edition.  
Very special thanks go to my parents for their love and support.  
Needless to say, any errors in the book are neither my fault nor the fault of any of the  
others mentioned here; they are, as always, due to malign outside influences. This page intentionally left blankpricing and

What is a cynic? . . . A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.  
—Oscar Wilde, Lady Windermere’s Fan  
This is a book about pricing — specifically, how companies should set and adjust their  
prices to maximize profitability. It takes the view that pricing decisions are commonplace,  
that they are often complex, and that they are critical determinants of profitability and  
revenue. Despite this, pricing decisions are often badly managed — or simply unmanaged.  
While most companies have fairly good prices in place most of the time, few have the pro-  
cesses and capabilities needed to ensure that they have the right prices in place for all their  
products, for all their customers, through all their channels, all the time. This is the goal of  
pricing and revenue optimization.  
Pricing and revenue optimization is a tactical function. It recognizes that in many cases,  
prices need to change rapidly and often and provides guidance on how they should change.  
This makes it distinct from strategic pricing, where the goal is to establish a general price  
position in a market. While strategic pricing is concerned with how a product should in  
general be priced relative to the market, pricing and revenue optimization is concerned  
with determining the prices that will be in place tomorrow and next week. Strategic pricing  
sets the constraints within which pricing and revenue optimization operates. For exam-  
ple, a luxury brand may decide that it will not discount its products more than a certain  
percentage in order to maintain its luxury image. This strategic pricing decision could be  
implemented as a maximum-discount constraint within a pricing and revenue manage-  
ment system.  
One of the distinguishing characteristics of pricing and revenue optimization is its use  
of analytical techniques derived from management science, statistics, and machine learn-  
ing. The use of these techniques to set prices in a complex, dynamic environment is about  
35 years old. One of the first applications of pricing optimization was revenue manage-  
ment, which was first used by the passenger airlines in the 1980s. Since then, the rapid de-  
velopment of e-commerce, the availability of customer data through customer relationship  
­ management \(CRM\) systems, and the increasing dynamism of online commerce have led  
to the adoption of pricing optimization in many other industries, including automotive, 2  
background  
retail, telecommunications, financial services, and manufacturing. A multitude of software  
vendors provide “price optimization” or “demand management” or “revenue manage-  
ment” solutions focused on one or more industries. Pricing and revenue optimization has  
become a core competency within a wide range of industries including airlines, hotels, and  
online and offline retail, and it has been widely adopted across a range of other industries.  
Pricing and revenue optimization has also been a fruitful area of academic research.  
In this chapter, we begin by looking at some historical context for pricing and revenue  
optimization. In particular, I provide some perspective on how pricing went from being  
an obscure and mysterious art within many companies to becoming the subject of intense  
scrutiny and analysis. This chapter argues that the pricing problem has become increas-  
ingly difficult and dynamic and is likely to become even more so in the future. It argues  
further that improving pricing is often one of the highest-return investments available to a  
company. Hopefully this will whet the reader’s appetite for the more quantitative material  
to come in the following chapters.  
1.1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT  
For most of history, philosophers took it for granted that goods had an intrinsic value in  
the same sense that they had an intrinsic color or weight. A fair price reflected that intrinsic  
value. Charging a price too much in excess of the intrinsic value was condemned as a sign  
of avarice and often prohibited by law. Prices were set by custom, by law, or by imperial fiat  
with an emphasis on both fairness and stability\: Plato advocated severe penalties for any  
merchant who asked for more than one price for a good on the same day, and he believed  
that prices should be set by law at a rate that provided merchants a reasonable profit.1 The  
general belief that prices should be fair and not set by the merchant to maximize profit  
survived the collapse of the Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity — many sermons  
inveighed against the sin of charging unfair prices to gain excessive profits.2  
The problem of pricing did not exist on a large scale until modern market economies be-  
gan to emerge in the West in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. With the emergence  
of market economies and a growing middle class with more disposable income, prices were  
allowed to move more freely —untethered to the traditional concept of value. Specula-  
tive bubbles such as tulipomania in the Dutch Republic in the 1630s, in which the prices  
of some varieties of tulips rose more than a hundredfold in 18 months before collapsing  
in 1637, and the South Sea bubble in England in 1720, in which the prices of shares in the  
South Sea Company soared before the company collapsed amid general scandal, fed a sense  
of anxiety and the belief that prices could somehow lose touch with reality. Furthermore,  
for the first time, large numbers of people could amass fortunes — and lose them —by buy-  
ing and selling goods on the market. Questions naturally arose\: What were prices, exactly?  
Where did they come from? What determined the right price? When was a price fair? When  
should the government intervene in pricing? The modern field of economics arose, at least  
in part, in response to these questions.  
Possibly the greatest insight of classical economics —usually credited to Adam Smith —  
was that the price of a good at any time in an unregulated economy is not based on any background 3  
intrinsic value but rather on the interplay of supply and demand. This was a major intel-  
lectual breakthrough — on par in its own way with the Newtonian theory of the clockwork  
universe and Darwin’s theory of evolution. In essence, the price of a good or service was  
determined by the interaction of people willing to sell the good with the willingness of oth-  
ers to buy the good. That is all there is to it — intrinsic value, cost, and labor content do not  
enter directly into the equation. Of course, these and many other factors enter indirectly  
into pricing — sellers would not last long selling goods below cost, and a buyer will react  
to a price based on the value she places on the item —but these are not primary. There are  
many reasons why sellers sell below cost when they are in possession of a cartload of veg-  
etables that are on the verge of going rotten — the classic sell-it-or-smell-it situation. Just  
so, the value that buyers place on different goods changes with their changing situation and  
the dictates of fashion. According to modern economics there is no normative right price  
for a good or service against which the price can be compared — rather, there are only the  
actual prices out in the marketplace, floating freely, based on the willingness of sellers to  
sell and buyers to buy.  
While neoclassical economics solved the problem of the origin of price, it raised as many  
questions as it answered. In particular, if prices are not tied to fundamental values — if  
they have no anchor —why do they show any stability at all? Under normal circumstances,  
prices for most goods are reasonably stable most of the time. If prices are based only on  
the whims of buyers and sellers, why is the price of bread not subject to wild swings like  
the Dutch tulip market in 1637? Why does milk not cost five times as much in Chicago as  
it does in New York? How can manufacturers and merchants plan at all and make reason-  
able profits in order to stay in business? How can an economy based on free-floating prices  
work at all? And, assuming that such an economy could work, how could it possibly work  
better than a centralized economy where planners strive to allocate resources across the  
entire economy?  
One of the great achievements of twentieth-century economics was to show mathemati-  
cally how a largely unregulated economy could function\: that an economy consisting of  
individuals who supply their labor in return for wages and maximize the utility of their  
earnings as they buy goods from firms who seek to maximize profitability can be remark-  
ably stable and efficient. Under certain assumptions, this type of decentralized economy  
can be shown to be at least as efficient as any centrally planned economy at producing and  
allocating goods that satisfy consumers. Furthermore, prices in such an economy would  
generally be stable and reasonably predictable. The price for a product would equal the  
long-run marginal production cost of that product plus the return on invested capital nec-  
essary to produce it. A seller offering an item for less than it cost would go bankrupt. If  
someone tried selling for more, other sellers would undercut his price, consumers would  
flee to the lower-priced sellers, and the high-price seller would be forced to lower his price  
or go bankrupt for lack of business. As this happens simultaneously across the economy,  
prices equilibrate and change only as a result of exogenous factors or changes in resource  
availability, taxation, monetary policy, or consumer tastes.  
This view of the world is based in part on the assumption that most markets are perfectly  
competitive, where the concept of perfect competition can be summarized as follows. 4  
background  
A market structure is perfectly competitive if the following conditions hold\: There are many  
firms, each with an insubstantial share of the market. These firms produce a homogenous  
product using identical production processes and possess perfect information. It is also the  
case that there is free entry to the industry; that is, new firms can and will enter the industry  
if they observe that greater-than-normal profits are being earned. The effect of this free entry  
is to push the demand curve facing each firm downwards until each firm earns only normal  
profits, at which point there is no further incentive for new entrants to come into the indus-  
try. Moreover, since each firm produces a homogenous product, it cannot raise its price with-  
out losing all of its market to its competitors. . . . Thus, firms are price takers and can sell as  
much as they are capable of producing at the prevailing market price. \(Pearce 1992, 327–328\)  
There are no pricing decisions in perfectly competitive markets — prices are determined  
by the iron law of the market. If one merchant were offering a good for a lower price than  
another, neoclassical economics assumes that either customers would entirely abandon the  
higher-price merchant and swamp the lower-price merchant or an arbitrageur would arise  
who would buy all the goods from the lower-price merchant and sell them at the higher  
price. In either case, a single market price would prevail. Furthermore, if prices were so  
high in a sector that sellers enjoyed higher profits than the rest of the economy, more sell-  
ers would enter that sector, lowering the average price until the return on capital dropped  
to the market level. In this situation, there are no pricing decisions at all\: Prices are set  
by the market, as stock prices are set by the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. The  
price of Microsoft stock is not set by a pricing manager but by the interplay of supply and  
demand — in fact, most financial instruments such as stocks and bonds satisfy the eco-  
nomic definition of a commodity. Certain other highly fungible goods — grain, crude oil,  
and some bulk chemicals — also come very close to being commodities. In these markets,  
there is simply no need for pricing and revenue optimization\: the market sets the price.  
As any shopper can tell you, most of the real world is much messier — prices vary all over  
the place, sometimes in ways that seem irrational. Buyers often behave erratically, sellers do  
not always seek to maximize short-run profit, neither buyers nor sellers are possessed of  
perfect information, and opportunities for arbitrage are not immediately seized. Table 1.1  
shows prices for a half gallon of whole milk at different markets in a 16-block area of the  
Upper West Side of Manhattan on a single day in November 2019. For a half gallon of non-  
organic milk, prices ranged from a low of \$2.69 to a high of \$4.00 — a variation of \$1.31, or  
49%. Furthermore, the price varied by \$1.10 even for two stores on the same block \(Duane  
Reade and Amsterdam Gourmet\). How could this be? Why would anybody buy milk at a  
high price when they could walk less than a block and save \$1.10? Why do arbitrageurs not  
buy all the milk at the lower price and sell it at the higher?3  
The price variation shown in Table 1.1 will hardly come as a shock to most people — af-  
ter all, both businesses and consumers know that it pays to shop around because suppli-  
ers of the same \(or similar\) products often charge different prices. Furthermore, there are  
other ways than walking to the next store to pay a lower price for exactly the same product\:  
wait until it goes on sale, travel to a retail outlet, clip a coupon, buy in bulk, buy online, or background 5

try to negotiate a lower price. In fact, not only do prices vary between sellers, but a single  
seller will sometimes sell the same product to different customers for different prices!  
This provides the setting for pricing and revenue optimization — sellers have scope to  
adjust prices, and the right price to charge at a given time is not usually obvious. In this situ-  
ation, pricing becomes a decision rather than a fait accompli. If, furthermore, a seller has  
many prices to set and these prices are subject to frequent change, then the use of a comput-  
erized system to manage pricing is almost always required. Pricing and revenue optimiza-  
tion can be viewed as an approach that uses mathematics to set and update multiple prices  
in a dynamic environment. The approaches used in pricing and revenue optimization are  
drawn from management science, operations research, marketing science, statistics, eco-  
nomics, and, increasingly, machine learning.  
A further impetus to the growth of pricing and revenue optimization is that companies  
increasingly need to make pricing decisions more and more rapidly to respond to com-  
petitive actions, market changes, or their own inventory positions. Sellers often no longer  
have the luxury to perform market analyses or extended spreadsheet studies every time a  
pricing change needs to be considered. There is a premium on speed. While there has been  
a general acceleration of all aspects of business, the impact on pricing and revenue optimi-  
zation has been particularly notable. This acceleration — and the corresponding interest in  
developing tools to enable better pricing and revenue optimization \(PRO\) decisions —has  
been driven by four trends.

The success of revenue management in the airline industry provides an example of  
how pricing and revenue optimization can increase profitability in a real-time pric-  
ing environment.  
Increasingly inexpensive data storage and computation makes it feasible to run so-  
phisticated algorithms to calculate and update prices quickly.  
The rise of e-commerce necessitates the ability to manage and update prices in a fast-  
moving, highly transparent, online environment for many companies that had not  
previously faced such a challenge. 6  
background  
•  
The success of machine learning provides new ways to use data to support effective  
decision making.  
Because of their importance to the development of pricing and revenue optimization, we  
spend a little time considering each of these trends.  
1.1.1 The Success of Revenue Management  
In 1985, American Airlines was threatened on its core routes by the low-fare carrier Peo-  
pleExpress. In response, American developed a revenue management program based on  
differentiating prices between leisure and business travelers. A key element of this program  
was a yield management \(now more commonly known as revenue management\) system  
that used optimization algorithms to determine the right number of seats to protect for  
later-booking full-fare passengers on each flight while still accepting early-booking low-fare  
passengers. This approach was a resounding success for American, resulting ultimately in  
the demise of PeopleExpress.  
We delve more deeply into the American Airlines /PeopleExpress story in Chapter 8.  
For now, the importance of the story is in the publicity it garnered. American Airlines  
featured its revenue management capabilities in its annual report, emphasizing that it was  
an application of advanced mathematics. The team that developed the system won a pres-  
tigious prize for the best application of management science in 1991. American Airlines’  
revenue management system was widely touted as an important strategic application of  
mathematics \(Anderson, Bell, and Kaiser 2003\), and the tale of American using its supe-  
rior capabilities to defeat PeopleExpress was the centerpiece of a popular business book  
\(Cross 1997\).  
Not surprisingly this publicity resulted in widespread interest. Companies began to in-  
vestigate the prospects of improving the profitability of their pricing decisions. Ford Motor  
Company was inspired by the success of revenue management at the airlines to institute its  
own successful program \(Leibs 2000\). Vendors arose selling revenue management software  
systems, and consultants offered to help companies set up their own programs. Over the  
next decade, revenue management spread well beyond the passenger airlines to fields such  
as hotels and rental cars that had similar problems of managing constrained and perishable  
capacity.  
Under its strictest definition, revenue management has a fairly narrow field of appli-  
cation. In particular, revenue management is applicable when the following conditions  
are met.  
•  
•  
Capacity is limited and immediately perishable. Most obviously, an empty seat on a  
departing aircraft or an empty hotel room cannot be stored to satisfy future demand.  
Customers book capacity ahead of time. Advance bookings are common in indus-  
tries with constrained and perishable capacity, since customers need a way to ensure  
ahead of time that capacity will be available when they need to consume it. This gives  
airlines the opportunity to track demand for future flights and adjust prices accord-  
ingly to balance supply and demand. background 7  
•  
Prices are changed by opening and closing predefined booking classes. This is a  
by-product of the design of the computerized distribution systems that the airlines  
developed. These systems allow airlines to establish a set of prices \(fare classes\) for  
each flight and then open or close those fare classes as they wish. This is somewhat  
different from the pricing issue in most industries, which is not “What fare classes  
should we open and close?” but “What price should we offer now for each of our  
products to each market segment through each channel?” The difference is subtle  
and may not even be visible to consumers, but it leads to major differences in system  
design and implementation.  
Many companies are understandably wary about adopting revenue management programs,  
protesting that “we are not an airline.” In general, this is the right view — the algorithms  
behind airline revenue management do not transfer directly to most other industries. How-  
ever, the experience of the airlines contains several important lessons.  
•  
•  
•  
Pricing and revenue optimization can deliver more than just short-term profitabil-  
ity benefits. Revenue management enabled American Airlines to meet the challenge  
posed by PeopleExpress. It also meant the difference between survival and bankruptcy  
for National Rent-a-Car. In 1992, National was losing \$1 million per month and was  
on the verge of being liquidated by its then-owner, General Motors. At that point,  
National had been through two rounds of downsizing, and corporate management  
felt there were no more significant savings that could be achieved on the cost side. As  
a last-ditch effort, National decided to work on the revenue side. They worked with  
the revenue management company Aeronomics to develop a system that forecasted  
supply and demand for each car type and rental length at all 170 corporate locations  
and adjusted fares to balance supply and demand. The results were immediate.  
National initiated a comprehensive revenue management program whose core is  
a suite of analytic models developed to manage capacity, pricing, and reservation.  
As it improved management of these functions, National dramatically increased its  
revenue. The initial implementation in July 1993 produced immediate results and  
returned National Car Rental to profitability. \(Geraghty and Johnson 1997, 107\)  
E-commerce both necessitates and enables pricing and revenue optimization. The  
airlines pioneered electronic distribution — their computerized distribution systems,  
SABRE and Galileo, were the internet before the internet. These systems allowed  
immediate receipt and processing of customer booking requests. They also enabled  
airlines to change prices and availability and have the updated information instan-  
taneously transmitted worldwide. In effect, the airlines were wrestling with the  
complexities of e-commerce well before the arrival of the internet. As the internet  
becomes an ever more important channel for sales, the need to continually monitor  
demand and update prices will only increase.  
Effective segmentation is critical. The key to the success of revenue management in  
the airline industry is the ability of the airlines to segment customers between early-  
booking leisure passengers and late-booking business passengers. Note that, for the 8  
background  
airlines, this segmentation was achieved not by direct discrimination — that is, trying  
to charge a different fare based on demographics, age, or other customer charac-  
teristics —but via product differentiation, creating different products that appealed  
to different segments. Segmenting customers based on their willingness to pay and  
finding ways to charge different prices to different segments is a critical piece of pric-  
ing and revenue optimization — one that we address in detail in Chapter 6.  
At heart, airline revenue management systems are highly sophisticated opportunity cost  
calculators. They forecast the future opportunities to sell a seat and seek to ensure that  
the seat is not sold for less than the expected value of those future opportunities. Most  
industries do not face capacity constraints as stark as those faced by the airlines. Manu-  
facturers typically have the opportunity to adjust production levels or store either finished  
or partially finished goods. Retailers can adjust their stocks in response to changes in de-  
mand. However, this does not mean that calculating opportunity cost is irrelevant in these  
industries. On the contrary, in many industries facing inventory or capacity constraints,  
opportunity cost can be the critical link between supply chain management and pricing  
and revenue optimization.  
1.1.2 The Evolving Computational Environment  
A major motivation for the development of more sophisticated pricing and revenue opti-  
mization systems has been the explosion of data available to companies coupled with the  
continued precipitous decline in the cost of both computation and data storage. Four de-  
velopments were particularly important in this regard.  
•  
•  
•  
Between 1985 — the time that airlines began implementing revenue management  
systems — and 2019, both the cost of computation and the cost of storage dropped  
by a factor of about 10,000,000.4 This incredible rate of technological progress has  
had enormous implications not just for pricing and revenue management but for  
society as a whole.  
Starting in the early 1990s, companies began concerted efforts to organize scattered  
customer data into a usable format \(customer relationship management\) as well as to  
break down corporate data silos to make information available across the organiza-  
tion \(enterprise resource planning\). The idea behind enterprise resource planning  
\(ERP\) is to provide a corporate information backbone that supports all business  
users with consistent and timely data from a single source. Ideally information will  
then flow freely among business processes with data islands and fiefdoms eliminated.  
While ERP efforts have not been universally successful, and many organizations still  
suffer from data fiefdoms, substantial progress has been made by many organizations  
toward the goal of retaining all pertinent data and having them readily available to all  
parts of the organization when they are needed.  
The move from on-premises computing to cloud computing has made informa-  
tion technology more flexible and reduced costs even further. When computing was  
primarily on-premises, information technology \(IT\) departments needed to make background 9  
•  
vast investments in computers and the technology and personnel to maintain them.  
With cloud computing \(also called computing as a service\), companies pay to obtain  
IT services from a third party that purchases and maintains the needed hardware.  
Cloud computing uses economies of scale to reduce the cost of computing services  
below what many companies could achieve in-house. Furthermore, cloud computing  
converts IT costs from a combination of fixed and variable costs to variable cost only.  
This provides flexibility for companies to adjust their purchases of computational  
services to their changing demands without the need to maintain extensive internal  
IT departments.  
The development of agile methodologies for software development along with im-  
proved supporting software tools and languages has made development and testing  
of pricing approaches much easier at many organizations than in the past. Histori-  
cally, implementing a new approach to pricing or pricing analytics usually required  
a major investment in software development and implementation often extending  
over a year or more. This meant that new approaches had to be rigorously tested and  
a strong business case established before a company would be willing to invest mil-  
lions of dollars and years of development time in a new approach. Agile development  
and supporting tools have made it much easier to implement new ideas at less cost  
and in a much shorter time frame. Furthermore, it is now often easier for companies  
to revert to a previous approach if a new approach does not work as planned.  
It is worth emphasizing that these trends have affected different companies to vastly dif-  
ferent degrees. Long-established companies are often saddled with legacy systems that are  
hard to replace or modify and that can inhibit adoption of new approaches. The airlines  
represent a classic example — many of their IT systems are built around the concept of a  
fare class. Each fare class can have a different fare and airlines can open or close fare classes  
in order to set different prices according to algorithms described in Chapter 9. However,  
this is not true dynamic pricing because prices are limited to the preset fares. The concept  
of a fare class is embedded so deeply into many airline systems from reservations to dis-  
tribution to accounting that it can be prohibitively difficult for any single airline to move  
to a pure dynamic pricing system even if it wanted to do so.5 Similarly, television networks  
and their customers, advertising agencies, have developed extensive systems to support a  
system of up-front pricing and spot pricing that dates from the early days of the commer-  
cial television industry. While this system seems outdated, it persists in part because both  
ad agencies and networks have heavily invested in software systems based on the current  
market structure.6  
By contrast, many more recently founded tech companies have implemented more  
modern, flexible information technology infrastructure that allows them to move more  
quickly in introducing new pricing approaches. For example, ride-sharing apps such as  
Uber and Lyft are not restricted to a predefined set of fares and can adjust prices much  
more flexibly and dynamically than the airlines. The same is true of many online retailers  
such as Alibaba, Amazon, and Walmart.com. There is irony in this situation — the global  
distribution infrastructure that the airlines spent billions of dollars to implement in the 10  
background  
1960s and 1970s was revolutionary for the time, but in some ways this once pathbreaking  
infrastructure is now a barrier to innovation.  
1.1.3 The Rise of E-commerce  
By the late 1990s, the internet was widely predicted to be a revolutionary and transforma-  
tive technology that would change everything. The fact that the internet drives a greater  
need for pricing and revenue optimization is contrary to some early expectations. A num-  
ber of analysts predicted that internet commerce would inevitably drive prices down to  
the lowest common denominator\: The internet would bring about the world of perfect  
competition, in which sellers lose control of prices. This was part of the vision behind Bill  
Gates’s concept of “friction-free capitalism” \(Gates 1996, 180\). However, reality has turned  
out to be quite different. Studies consistently show that most online buyers actually do little  
comparison shopping — for example, a McKinsey study showed that 89% of online book  
purchasers buy from the first site they visit, as do 81% of music buyers. As a result, online  
prices often vary considerably, even for identical items. Table 1.2 shows the base price and  
shipped price for 13 online vendors as well as a list and an in-store price for Stephen King’s  
novel The Institute; the prices were gathered using an online shopping application.7 Note  
that the delivered price varies by almost \$19.00 across the vendors, with none of the 13  
vendors offering the book at the same delivered price. Note also that the two largest online  
booksellers —Amazon and Barnes and Noble —have neither the highest nor the lowest  
price, and their prices differ substantially from each other. At least in this case, the internet  
seems to be perpetuating rather than eliminating price variability!  
The resemblance between the distribution of online book prices in Table 1.2 and the  
distribution of milk prices in Table 1.1 is not coincidental. It shows that, just like any other  
channel, the internet supports price differentials. For any seller offering a large catalog  
of products \(such as an online bookseller\), the price of each item needs to be set intel-  
ligently based on cost, inventory, current competitive prices, and other information. The  
pricing problems facing an online bookseller are similar to those facing retailers\: Could I  
increase my profitability by raising my price? By lowering my price? How should my price  
be updated as inventory changes — should it be as competitive prices change? As demand  
changes? What is the right relationship between my base price and the total delivered price?  
Multiply these questions by a catalog of hundreds of thousands or even millions of items  
and a need to update frequently, and the full magnitude of the pricing problem faced by  
online merchants becomes clearer.  
While one group of analysts was predicting that the internet would eliminate price dif-  
ferentials and drive prices inevitably toward the lowest common denominator, another  
group of analysts was predicting exactly the opposite — that the internet would enable one-  
to-one pricing crafted to the individual propensities of each buyer. According to this school  
of thought, e-commerce would become a market-of-one environment, in which prices  
would be calculated on the fly to maximize the profitability of each transaction. A customer  
entering a website would immediately be identified, and, based on her past buying patterns,  
a pricing engine would calculate personalized prices reflecting an estimate of her willing-  
ness to pay. While various online sellers have been rumored at various times to be practic- background 11

ing individualized pricing — for example, the Amazon DVD example in Chapter 14 — in  
reality pure market-of-one pricing is not widely practiced, and there are several reasons to  
believe it will never become standard practice. For one thing, there is strong buyer resist-  
ance to pricing discrimination that is perceived as unfair or arbitrary. People seem no more  
inclined to accept online price discrimination than they are willing to accept variable pric-  
ing at the time of checkout based on a clerk’s estimate of their willingness to pay. \(Chapter  
14 digs more deeply into customer reaction to pricing that seems unfair.\) The transparency  
of the internet means that whatever online pricing system a company adopts, the details will  
soon be widely known by customers. Price differentiation by online sellers is always rapidly  
discovered. As a result, market-of-one pricing has not taken over the internet, and when  
price differentiation is employed, it is usually within careful guardrails.  
Given that the internet has neither driven prices to their lowest common denominator  
nor led to real-time personalized pricing, can we conclude that it has no impact on pricing?  
Not at all. On the contrary, e-commerce has been a major motivator for companies to im-  
prove their pricing capabilities. Four specific characteristics of internet commerce increase  
the urgency of pricing and revenue optimization.  
•  
•  
The internet increases the velocity of pricing decisions. Many companies that  
changed prices once a quarter or less now find they face the daily— or even hourly—  
challenge of determining what prices to display on their website or to transmit to  
e-commerce intermediaries. Many companies are only now beginning to struggle  
with this increased price velocity—and it is likely that the pace of price changes  
will continue to accelerate. For example, one article estimated that in 2018 Amazon  
changed 2.5 million prices every day \(Mehta, Detroja, and Agashe 2018\). All indica-  
tions are that online pricing is likely to become even more dynamic in the future.  
The internet makes available an immediate wealth of information about customer  
behavior that was formerly unavailable or only available after a considerable time  
lag. This includes information on not just who bought what but also who clicked on 12  
background  
•  
•  
what, and who looked at what and for how long. This information can be captured  
and analyzed by companies both to support cross-selling and up-selling and to un-  
derstand customer behavior and segmentation.  
The internet provides the ability to experiment rapidly and effectively with pricing  
alternatives and different pricing models. As McKinsey pricing consultants point  
out, “Traditional price-sensitivity research can cost up to \$300,000 for each product  
category and take anywhere from six to ten weeks to complete. . . . On the Internet,  
however, prices can be tested continually in real time, and customers’ responses can  
be instantly received” \(Baker, Marn, and Zawada 2001, 121\). Many e-commerce  
companies experiment frequently with different prices and different pricing ap-  
proaches.  
Even in cases where a customer does not buy online, the internet may provide deeper  
information about costs and competitive prices. This has been particularly true in big-  
ticket consumer purchases, such as home mortgages and automobiles. A 2019 Cox  
Automotive survey found that car buyers spend 61% of their shopping time online  
rather than in a dealership and 80% visited at least one third-party site \(Cox Auto-  
motive 2019\). This means that more and more buyers arrive at a dealership with full  
information on what is available and what the dealer paid for a car. In this environ-  
ment, sellers need to be able to use intelligent targeted pricing to remain profitable.  
Because the internet has had such an important influence on pricing, we pay special atten-  
tion to the problems of optimizing prices on the internet throughout the book.  
1.1.4 Machine Learning Reaches Maturity  
One of the consequences of the rapid evolution of the computational environment de-  
scribed in Section 1.1.2 was a revival of interest in and rapid development of a number of  
computational approaches that once went under the name of artificial intelligence \(AI\).  
Artificial intelligence is a somewhat vague term used for computational agents that can per-  
ceive the environment and make decisions in order to attain a goal. Artificial intelligence  
had experienced a surge of interest and funding from both investors and government re-  
search agencies in the mid-1980s into the early 1990s. At the time, the results failed to live  
up to the absurdly high expectations set by the technology’s advocates, and both interest  
and funding waned for more than a decade — the so-called AI winter. The fortunes of AI  
began to revive around the turn of the millennium as increased computational capabilities  
enabled faster and more efficient implementation of existing algorithms and stimulated the  
development of new algorithms.  
The subfield of artificial intelligence that is most relevant to pricing and revenue optimi-  
zation is machine learning, which can be defined as the ability of computers to detect pat-  
terns in data and make recommendations from data with a minimum of domain-­ specific  
modeling.8 Machine learning is now commonplace within most large organizations. It has  
proven to be extremely effective at supervised learning tasks that involve classifying objects  
into different categories. A widely publicized example is Google’s Inception, which can background 13  
identify objects, people, and animals in photographs with extremely high levels of reliabil-  
ity. Machine learning approaches have proven equally or even more proficient than tradi-  
tional methods at more prosaic tasks such as evaluating credit risk or determining whether  
a transaction is fraudulent. Machine learning has become the weapon of choice for such  
applications and is increasingly supplanting previous approaches.  
Because of this success, machine learning is often offered as a panacea for any complex  
business decision. For pricing, this sometimes manifests itself in the view that a neural net  
should simply be trained to determine the best price for any type of product under any cir-  
cumstances and then turned loose to set and update prices over time. Unfortunately, things  
are not quite so simple. In particular, training a neural net generally requires observations  
that span the range of combinations of possible decisions and environmental factors with  
enough observations to enable statistically reliable recommendations of price for all fu-  
ture combinations that might occur. For most companies, this is still infeasible because of  
the high dimension — the large number of variables — of the pricing problem. But if we  
combine machine learning with some straightforward and plausible assumptions about  
how people respond to prices — for example, higher prices lead to lower demand —we can  
develop approaches that are both feasible and reasonably efficient.  
All four factors that have accelerated the field of pricing and revenue optimization —  
the success of revenue management, the evolving computational environment, the rise of  
e-commerce, and the increasing sophistication of machine learning — point in the same  
direction, toward a future in which pricing will be increasingly dynamic and supported  
by a wealth of information and sophisticated algorithms. Both the time available to set  
prices and the allowable margin of error will continue to decrease while the complexity of  
pricing decisions will increase. Time-consuming offline analyses will become increasingly  
irrelevant — their results will be obsolete before they can be completed because the world  
moves too quickly. Automated pricing and revenue optimization systems will increasingly  
be required to deal with the speed and complexity of pricing decisions.  
1.2 THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF PRICING AND REVENUE OPTIMIZATION  
Of course, the most compelling reason for a company to improve its pricing and revenue  
optimization capabilities is to make more money. “For most companies, better manage-  
ment of pricing is the fastest and most cost-effective way to increase profits” \(Marn and  
Rosiello 1992, 85\). So concluded a pioneering study by McKinsey and Company, which  
concluded that a 1% improvement in profit would, on average, result in an improvement  
in operating profit of 11.1%. By contrast, 1% improvements in variable cost, volume, and  
fixed cost would produce operating improvements of 7.8%, 3.3%, and 2.3%, respectively.  
This analysis has often been replicated\: a 2018 book gave an example of a case in which a 5%  
improvement in price would lead to a profit improvement of 50%, while 5% improvements  
in unit costs, sales volume, and fixed costs would lead to profit gains of 30%, 20%, and  
11.5%, respectively \(Simon and Fassnacht 2018\).9 While other studies have had different  
results, the overall pattern is clear\: improving pricing can have a significant positive impact  
on profit and may be a more profitable area for investment than cost reduction. 14  
background  
When it comes to the benefits of implementing an actual system, the passenger airlines  
typically claimed between 8% and 11% revenue increase from the initial implementation  
of revenue management systems \(Smith, Leimkuhler, and Darrow 1992\).10 A Harvard Busi-  
ness Review article noted that some retailer early adopters achieved “gains in gross margins  
in the range of 5 –15%” from the use of optimization-based assortment and pricing opti-  
mization systems \(Friend and Walker 2001, 138\). Similar gains from markdown optimiza-  
tion have been reported elsewhere — an A /B test measured an increase of 6% in revenue  
from distressed inventory at the fast-fashion retailer Zara \(Caro and Gallien 2012\). More  
recently, a 2019 Gartner report noted that “Pricing Optimization and Management” soft-  
ware “has been observed to deliver a rapid return on investment when well-implemented  
and enthusiastically adopted” \(Lewis 2019, 8\). The same report noted that vendors report  
increased revenue of 1–2% and increased margins of 2 –10%.11  
Putting it all together, we can see there is a strong case for many companies to consider  
investing in pricing and revenue optimization. Not only is improving pricing already the  
“fastest and most cost-effective way to increase profits,” but it is gaining in importance as  
the velocity and complexity of pricing decisions inexorably increase. Furthermore, a new  
generation of information technology provides the information and algorithmic power  
needed to analyze and exploit market opportunities. Finally, pricing is often the corporate  
function that can generate the most return with the least investment.  
1.3 ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK  
The structure and dependencies of the remaining chapters are illustrated in Figure 1.1. The  
topic of each chapter is outlined briefly next.  
Chapter 2 discusses pricing and revenue optimization as a corporate process and con-  
trasts it with other approaches to pricing. It stresses that PRO is a highly dynamic process,  
dependent on continual feedback to ensure that pricing decisions are kept in line with  
changing market realities. It also introduces the concept that the core of pricing and reve-  
nue optimization lies in the formulation of pricing and availability decisions as constrained  
optimization problems.  
Chapter 3 discusses the mathematical representation of customer response to price. It  
introduces the idea of a price-response function and shows how a price-response function  
is based on the distribution of willingness to pay across a population. The chapter presents  
several common forms of price-response function and shows how the price-response func-  
tion can incorporate competitive pricing. Chapter 4 shows how price-response functions  
can be estimated using historical data on prices and demand. It also discusses data-free ap-  
proaches to estimating a price-response function.  
Chapter 5 shows how optimal \(profit-maximizing or revenue-maximizing\) prices can be  
calculated given a price-response function. It defines incremental cost and how it ­ influences  
pricing. The chapter also shows how optimal prices can be calculated using explicit optimi-  
zation as well as using an adaptive reinforcement learning approach. In addition, Chapter  
5 introduces the concept of an efficient frontier as a way to visualize the trade-offs between  
competing objective functions such as maximizing profit and maximizing revenue or mar-  
ket share. background 15

Price differentiation is one of the key concepts in pricing and revenue optimization.  
Chapter 6 discusses how markets can be divided into different market segments such that  
a different price can be charged to each segment. Tactics for price differentiation include  
virtual products, product lines, group pricing, channel pricing, and regional pricing. The  
idea of multipricing is the source of both the benefits of PRO and the challenges involved  
in managing a large portfolio of prices. Chapter 6 discusses how to optimize differentiated  
prices in the face of potential cannibalization.  
Chapter 7 introduces another major theme in pricing and revenue optimization —pricing  
when supply \(or inventory\) is constrained. Supply constraints are ubiquitous.  
They may arise from the intrinsically constrained capacity of a service provider such as  
a hotel, restaurant, barbershop, or trucking company; they may be due to limited inven-  
tory on hand; or they may be due to bottlenecks in a supply chain that restrict the rate at  
which a good can be produced or transported. In any case, constrained supply significantly  
­ complicates optimal pricing. Chapter 7 also introduces the key concept of an opportunity  
cost— the incremental contribution lost because of a supply constraint. Chapter 7 also gives  
examples of pricing with constrained supply in several different industries including air-  
lines, ride-share services, electric power, and theater.  
Revenue management has been one of the most important and publicized applications  
of pricing and revenue optimization over the past three decades. While it has its origin in 16  
background  
the airline industry, it has spread beyond the airlines and is in widespread use at hotels,  
rental car firms, cruise lines, freight transportation companies, and event ticketing agents.  
Some of the core techniques are gaining acceptance and use well beyond these industries.  
Four chapters in this book are devoted to revenue management. The first, Chapter 8, de-  
scribes the background, history, and business setting of revenue management. Chapter 9 is  
devoted to capacity allocation, the techniques used to determine which fare classes should  
be open and which closed at any time for a simple product using only a single product —  
for example, a single airline flight or a single hotel room night. Chapter 10 extends this  
analysis to the case of a network, in which an individual product may use many different  
resources — for instance, multiple connecting flights or multiple-night hotel stays. Chap-  
ter 11 discusses overbooking — the question of how many units of a constrained product  
should be sold when customers may not show or may cancel.  
Markdown management, the topic of Chapter 12, is a popular application of pricing and  
revenue optimization. In a markdown industry, a merchant has a stock of inventory with  
a value that decreases over time. His problem is to determine the schedule of price reduc-  
tions to take in order to maximize the return from inventory. Applications are widespread,  
from fashion goods, to consumer electronics and durables, to theater tickets. Chapter 12  
describes basic markdown optimization models and some of the challenges in implement-  
ing markdown management in the real world, including the issue of strategic customers  
who may anticipate the markdown and thus wait for the sale.  
Chapter 13 treats customized prices. Customized pricing is common in business-to-  
business settings where goods and services are sold either through long-term contracts or  
as part of large individual transactions. In these settings, list prices may not exist or may  
serve only as guidelines to which discounts are applied. The pricing and revenue optimiza-  
tion challenge is to determine the discount to provide to each customer in order to maxi-  
mize the expected profitability of the deal. This requires estimating the trade-off between the  
probability of winning the deal and the marginal contribution if the deal is won.  
Chapter 14 treats the issue of customer perception and acceptance of pricing tactics.  
Much of the classical theory of pricing is based on the idea that consumers are rational  
maximizers of utility and that prices are emotionally neutral signals that guide purchasing  
decisions. However, both common sense and recent research in behavioral economics have  
shown that this idea is incomplete at best and misguided at worst. Consumers can care —  
sometimes deeply — about prices and the way they are presented. In particular, pricing that  
is perceived as unfair can trigger an emotional rejection. Chapter 14 discusses the implica-  
tion of consumer irrationality for pricing.

compare the amount of dispersion for distributions with different means is to use the co-  
efficient of variation, which is defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean. The

and articles. The calculations need to be taken with a grain of salt because they typically

involves both raising and lowering prices.

# and Revenue oPtimization  
This chapter introduces the basic concepts behind pricing and revenue optimization. We  
first look at some of the common pricing challenges faced by organizations — most nota-  
bly a lack of consistent management, discipline, and analysis across pricing decisions. The  
chapter then describes three purist approaches to pricing — cost-plus, market based, and  
value based — and discusses some of their shortcomings. It then introduces pricing and  
revenue optimization. At the highest level, pricing and revenue optimization is a process for  
managing and updating pricing decisions in a consistent and effective fashion. At the core  
of this process is an approach to finding the set of prices that will maximize total expected  
contribution, subject to a set of constraints. The constraints reflect either business goals set  
by the organization or physical limitations, such as limited capacity and inventory. While  
the use of constrained optimization is common to all pricing and revenue optimization  
applications, the type of problem to be solved depends on the specific characteristics of the  
market. Markets vary in terms of timing or cadence of pricing decisions, the nature of the  
goods and services being sold, and the type of customer commitment being priced.  
2.1 THE CHALLENGES OF PRICING  
For many organizations, pricing includes a remarkably complex set of decisions. While  
most companies have a good idea of the list prices they have established for their products,  
they are often unclear on the prices that customers are actually paying. A multitude of dif-  
ferent discounts, adjustments, and rebates are often applied to each sale. For this reason it  
is critical to distinguish between the list price of a good and its pocket price— that is, what a  
particular customer ends up actually paying. The list price is generic, while the pocket price  
may be different for each customer. The price waterfall was introduced by McKinsey and  
Company as a graphical way of illustrating the discounts that occur between the list price  
of a good and its pocket price. A consumer package goods \(CPG\) example is shown in  
Figure 2.1. In this case, 12 price reductions or discounts are applied between the list price  
and the pocket price. These include an 8% competitive discount, a 3% sales special, a 1% 100 8

exception deal, and so on, down to a 1% freight allowance. The net result is that the pocket  
price for this customer is 29% less than the list price.  
The price waterfall illustrates quite neatly that the pocket price paid by an individual cus-  
tomer is often not the result of a single decision, but the cumulative result of many different  
decisions. In fact, for the majority of companies, many discounts are independently set by  
different parts of the organization, without consistent measurement or tracking. In Figure  
2.1, the competitive discount might have been authorized by the regional sales manager,  
while the product bonus was determined as part of a general marketing program and the  
freight allowance was given by the local salesperson in response to a last-minute call by the  
purchaser. As a result, no one is truly in charge in the sense that no one in the organiza-  
tion is responsible for the fact that the discount offered to this customer was 29%, while  
that offered to another might be 18%. In fact, not only is no one in charge, but it is often  
remarkably difficult to determine what the pocket price paid by a particular customer even  
is. As two McKinsey consultants put it\:  
The complexity and volume of transactions tend to create a smoke screen that makes it  
nearly impossible for even the rare senior managers who show an interest to understand  
what is actually happening at the transaction level. Management information systems most  
often do not report on transaction price performance, or report only average prices and  
thus shed no real light on pricing opportunities lost transaction by transaction. \(Marn and  
Rosiello 1992, 86\)  
Without a consistent process of analysis and evaluation, the probability that a particular  
pocket price maximizes customer profitability is like the probability that a blindfolded dart  
player will hit a bull’s-eye — not zero but not very high. In fact, the situation can be even  
worse. Sophisticated buyers often understand a seller’s pricing process better than does the  
seller. A sophisticated procurement department, faced with a price waterfall such as that  
shown in Figure 2.1, would quickly learn how to divide and conquer to obtain the lowest  
pocket price. The buyer’s procurement agent will seek to extract additional concessions  
from sales, will argue for relief from strict interpretation of volume purchasing agreements,  
and will seek extended payment terms from accounts payable. Smart buyers will quickly  
detect a disorganized or dispersed pricing organization and exploit it to their advantage.  
Management often concentrates primarily on invoice prices or list prices. However, the  
price waterfall illustrates that the majority of important pricing adjustments often take place  
after the list price and even the invoice price. A typical trucking company sells less than 5%  
of its business at list price—all the rest is sold at a discount. Only a tiny minority of custom-  
ers purchase a car at the manufacturer’s suggested retail price \(MSRP\). Yet, in many cases,  
managers spend long hours arguing over and analyzing list prices, despite the fact that list  
prices have little or no relationship to what most of their customers will be quoted. As Fig-  
ure 2.1 shows, even companies that focus on the invoice price are still missing much of the  
important action. In this figure, six different discounts were granted after the invoice price.  
The distribution of pocket-price discounts given by a CPG company to its various cus-  
tomers over a year is shown in Figure 2.2. In this case, 9% of the customers received a  
discount of greater than 40%, while 16% received discounts between 35% and 40%, and introduction to pricing and revenue optimization 23

only 3% paid list price. This distribution represents a fairly typical spread of discounts  
for the CPG industry. Note that the distribution in itself does not tell us anything about  
the quality of the pricing decisions being made by the company. However, it immediately  
demonstrates two facts.  
•  
•  
The item being sold is not a commodity. The variation in pocket prices means that  
customers are willing to pay a range of prices for the item and the company is willing  
to sell the product at different prices.  
Only 3% of customers bought at list price. For this item, setting the list price is not the  
critical pricing and revenue optimization \(PRO\) decision. Rather, list price is being  
set high and discounts are being used to target prices to individual customers. The  
key decisions are what discounts to offer each customer.  
It should be stressed that the existence of a pocket-price distribution such as the one  
shown in Figure 2.2 does not by itself say anything about the quality of the pricing deci-  
sions. A company practicing sophisticated pricing optimization may also show a wide dis-  
tribution of prices. The question is\: Is the pocket-price distribution the result of a conscious  
corporate process based on sound analysis, or is it the result of an arbitrary process?  
A key measure of the quality of PRO decision making is the extent to which the pocket  
price correlates with customer characteristics that are indicators of price sensitivity. In  
many cases, large customers are more price sensitive than smaller customers. For this rea-  
son, many companies offer higher discounts to their larger customers. If customer size is  
determining discounts, a seller would expect discount levels as a function of customer size  
to lie within a band something like that shown in panel A of Figure 2.3. The actual map-  
ping of discount level against customer size for the CPG company is shown in panel B of  
Figure 2.3. The correlation of discount to customer size was only about 0.09 for this com-  
pany — statistically indistinguishable from random. This means that something other than  
customer size is determining the level of discounts. 24

Graphics such as the price waterfall in Figure 2.1 and the pocket-price distribution his-  
togram in Figure 2.2 are useful to help companies assess the current state of their pricing.  
The price waterfall can identify how pricing responsibilities are dispersed across the or-  
ganization and where sophisticated buyers may be utilizing divide-and-conquer techniques  
to win higher discounts. The pocket-price histogram can give an idea of the breadth of  
discounts being given to customers. Graphs such as those shown in Figure 2.3 can show  
the extent to which discounts correlate to customer characteristics such as size of customer,  
size of account, and mix of customer business. These graphs often form part of a prelimi-  
nary diagnostic analysis and can be used to illustrate the need for better pricing decisions.  
2.2 TRADITIONAL APPROACHES TO PRICING  
Pricing and revenue optimization incorporates costs, customer demand \(or willingness to  
pay\), and the competitive environment to determine the prices that maximize expected net  
contribution. Other approaches to pricing tend to weigh one of these three aspects more  
than the others, as shown in Table 2.1. Cost-plus pricing calculates prices based on cost plus  
a standard margin. Market-based pricing bases prices on competitors’ prices. Value-based  
pricing bases prices on estimates of how customers value the good or service being sold.  
The finance department tends to like cost-based pricing because it guarantees that each sale  
produces an adequate margin, which seems fiscally prudent. The sales department tends  
to like market-based pricing because it helps them sell against competition. The marketing  
department is often the natural supporter of value-based pricing. introduction to pricing and revenue optimization 25

Alternative approaches to pricing  
Approach Based on IgnoresLiked by  
Cost-plus Costs Competition, customers Finance  
Market based Competition Cost, customers Sales  
Value based Customers Cost, competition Marketing  
Each of these purist approaches has its strengths and weaknesses, which are discussed in  
the following sections.  
2.2.1 Cost-Based Pricing  
Cost-based pricing, also known as cost-plus pricing, is perhaps the oldest approach to set-  
ting prices and still one of the most popular. It has a compelling simplicity — determine  
the cost of each product and add a percentage surcharge to determine price. The surcharge  
is often calculated to reflect an allocation of fixed costs plus a required return on capital.  
Alternatively, it may simply be based on tradition or a rule of thumb. For example, an old  
rule of thumb in the restaurant industry is “food is marked up three times direct costs, beer  
four times, and liquor six times” \(Godin and Conley 1987, 58\).  
The cost-plus pricing approach appears to be objective and defensible. If all competitors  
in a market have similar cost structures, it would appear to be a reasonable way to ensure  
consistency with the competition. In addition, cost-based pricing gives the appearance of  
financial prudence. After all, if all of our products are priced with the right surcharge, the  
company is guaranteed to make back the cost of production plus fixed costs plus the re-  
quired return on capital. Everybody, including the shareholders, should be happy. It is not  
surprising that cost-based pricing, with its dual appeals to objectivity and financial pru-  
dence, often appeals to finance departments.  
The major drawback of cost-plus pricing is widely recognized\: It is an entirely inward-  
focused exercise that has nothing to do with the market. Calculating prices without any  
reference to what customers might \(or might not\) being willing to pay for your product is  
an obvious folly\: Customers do not care about your costs — they care about what they have  
to pay for the product. Furthermore, cost-based pricing does not support price differentia-  
tion — the ability to charge different prices to different customer segments —which is at the  
heart of pricing and revenue optimization.  
Another problem with cost-plus pricing is that the costs used as its basis are often no-  
where near as objective as they seem \(and as the finance department may believe them to  
be\). The calculation of the variable and fixed costs involved in the production of a complex  
slate of products involves innumerable subjective judgments. Furthermore, all of the hard  
cost numbers available to the organization are based on historical performance — produc-  
tion costs in the future may be widely different as the mix of business changes and as pro-  
duction efficiency changes. Basing pricing decisions strictly on costs plus a surcharge can  
lead to highly distorted prices driving lower-than-expected results. This can yield results  
that seem puzzling, since the prices were based on seemingly objective costs.1 26  
introduction to pricing and revenue optimization  
Given these drawbacks, it should not be surprising that experts are uniformly harsh  
toward cost-plus pricing.  
•  
•  
•  
“The problem with cost-driven pricing is fundamental” \(Nagle and Müller 2018, 4\).  
“Cost-plus pricing is not an acceptable method” \(Dolan and Simon 1996, 38\).  
“Does the use of a rigid, customary markup over cost make logical sense in the  
pricing of products? Generally, the answer is no” \(Lilien, Kotler, and Moorthy  
1992, 207\).  
Despite nearly uniform condemnation, cost-based pricing is surprisingly resilient. As  
one author put it, “Cost-plus pricing is a lot like the romance novel genre, in that it’s widely  
ridiculed yet tremendously popular” \(Dholakia 2018\). In fact, surveys consistently find  
that cost-plus pricing is the most widely used approach to pricing across different countries  
and industries. For example, a 2009 survey across multiple industries in the United States,  
India, and Singapore found that “the most frequently used strategy was cost-plus pricing  
\(47.2 percent of firms\)” \(Rao and Kartono 2009, 17\). A 2010 survey of British industry  
found that 44% of respondents priced all or some of their products using cost-plus pricing  
\(Greenslade and Parker 2012\).2 The only good news about the persistence of cost-based  
pricing is that it means there is substantial opportunity for improvement.  
2.2.2 Market-Based Pricing  
Market-based pricing means different things in different contexts. In this book it refers to  
the practice of pricing based solely on the prices being offered by the competition. It is com-  
monly applied by smaller players in situations in which there is a clear market leader — for  
example, a small cola brand might set its price based on the price of Coca-Cola. A survey  
found that 31.7% of firms in the United States, Singapore, and India “match the price set by  
the overall market or price leader” \(Rao and Kartono 2009, 20\). Market-based pricing is,  
of course, also the practice in pure commodity markets, such as bulk chemicals, in which  
offerings are completely identical and transaction prices are rapidly, perfectly communi-  
cated. In these cases, there is no pricing decision per se — all companies take the price as  
given and adjust their production accordingly. For a commodity, there is no alternative to  
market-based pricing.  
Market-based pricing can also be an effective strategy for a low-cost supplier seeking to  
enter a new market. For example, Alamo Car Rental started as a low-cost rental car com-  
pany targeting the price-sensitive leisure market. Alamo’s initial strategy was to ensure it  
was always priced at least \$1.00 lower than both Hertz and Avis on the reservation system  
displays used by travel agents. This strategy was effective at meeting the strategic goal of  
rapid growth and penetration of the leisure market. Similarly, the European airline Ryanair  
has a strategy of having the lowest fare on the market compared to all competitors serving  
the same route within two hours of departure \(Eisenaecher 2019\).  
While market-based pricing is appropriate in certain cases — in a commodity market,  
for small players in a market dominated by a large competitor, and as a way to drive market  
share — it is often used in cases where it is less appropriate. At its most extreme, it means introduction to pricing and revenue optimization 27  
letting the competition set our prices. Slavishly following competitive prices does not al-  
low us to capitalize on the changing value perceptions of customers in the marketplace.  
Furthermore, it does not allow us to capitalize on the differential perception that custom-  
ers hold of us versus the competition. We should charge a higher price to customers who  
value our product or brand more highly. Monitoring competitive prices and making sure  
we maintain a realistic pricing relationship with key competitors is always important —but  
we also need to adjust our position relative to our competitors to reflect current market  
conditions if we want to maximize profitability.  
If all of the competitors in a market use market pricing, it is not clear where the price ac-  
tually comes from and pathological effects can occur. One of these pathological effects was  
uncovered on April 18, 2010, when a postdoctoral student working in Michael Eisen’s lab  
at the University of California, Berkeley, searched on Amazon for a book titled The Making  
of a Fly\: The Genetics of Animal Design, by Peter Lawrence. He was surprised to find that  
the book was being offered new by two different independent book sellers on the Amazon  
marketplace at prices of \$18,651,718.08 by Profnath and \$23,698,655.93 by Bordeebook.  
Adding insult to injury, both sellers asked an additional \$3.00 for shipping.  
Digging in a bit, Eisen found that both sellers were using pure market pricing — that is,  
each seller was basing its price entirely on the price being offered by the other. Profnath was  
setting its price at 99.83% of Bordee’s price — presumably to be priced just below its rival.  
However, Bordee was setting its price 27% higher than Profnath. In the absence of orders,  
the price began to spiral upward. Assuming that Profnath originally priced the book at its  
list price of \$70, Bordee would respond with a price of \$88.90. Profnath would then slightly  
undercut the price at \$88.75, and Bordee would respond with a price of \$112.71, which  
Profnath would undercut at \$112.52. The power of geometric growth meant it would take  
only about 53 of these cycles to arrive at prices over \$18 million.3  
It seems clear that the process that produced the exorbitant book pricing was the result  
of algorithmic pricing on the part of both sellers using extremely simplistic market-based  
pricing rules. One lesson is that algorithmic pricing requires sensible guardrails to avoid  
having prices wander into unacceptable values. However, the more important lesson is that  
setting prices based entirely on competitor prices can easily lose touch with the market-  
place, particularly if all the competitors are also basing their prices on competition. Like the  
other pure pricing tactics, market-based pricing does not generally lead to an optimal price.  
2.2.3 Value-Based Pricing  
Like market-based pricing, value-based pricing \(or value pricing\) means different things in  
different contexts. In its broadest sense it refers to the unexceptional proposition that price  
should relate to customer value. In its narrowest sense, it is sometimes used as a synonym  
for personalized or one-on-one pricing, in which each customer is quoted a different price  
based on her value for the product being sold. In this book it refers to the belief that cus-  
tomer value should be the key driver of price.4 Historically, value-based pricing usually  
referred to the use of methodologies such as customer surveys, focus groups, and conjoint  
analysis to estimate how customers value a product relative to the alternatives, which is then 28  
introduction to pricing and revenue optimization  
used to determine price. This type of value-based pricing is employed most frequently for  
consumer goods — especially when a new product is being introduced. In a 2003 survey,  
52% of companies responding from the United States claimed that they “price this product  
based on our customers’ perceptions of the product’s value” \(Rao and Kartono 2009, 15\).  
There is nothing wrong with the basic idea behind value-based pricing. If a seller faces  
no competition and the seller can determine the value each customer places on his prod-  
uct and charge that value \(assuming it is higher than incremental cost\) and the seller does  
not need to worry about arbitrage or cannibalization \(or about being regulated\), then that  
is what he should do to maximize profit.5 This pure approach to pricing has one serious  
drawback\: it is impossible. For one thing, there is no way to discern individual customer  
value for a product at the point of sale. In addition, the possibility of arbitrage and canni-  
balization almost always limits the ability to charge different prices for different products.  
Finally, competitive pressure means that companies almost always have to set prices lower  
than they would prefer to any group of customers.  
The competitive restriction on value-based pricing is worth emphasizing. There is a great  
difference between the value that a potential buyer might place on our product in isolation  
and what we can actually get that customer to pay in a competitive market. A customer  
may value our product or services highly, but she also almost always has alternatives. For  
example, management consulting firms routinely discuss changing from cost-based pricing  
\(hours worked times rate per hour\) to value-based pricing, under the belief that “a good  
consultant could boost earnings using a value-based model” \(McLaughlin 2002, 1\). Yet less  
than 5% of consultants use value-based pricing. Why should this be? Consider a brilliant  
management consulting organization that can provide services to a client that will lead to  
improved profitability of \$2 million yet only cost \$500,000 to provide. If the consulting  
company has a true monopoly, it should be able to close the deal at \$1.95 million, leav-  
ing the client \$50,000 ahead. But what if there is another, slightly less brilliant consulting  
company with the same cost structure that can provide similar services that would lead to  
improved profitability of only \$1.5 million? That company could counterpropose a project  
at \$1.4 million, which would be a better deal for the client, who would be \$100,000 ahead.  
The upshot is that competition can severely restrict the ability of a company to set a price  
based on value, even when the competition is offering an inferior product. Even the exist-  
ence of an inferior substitute will mean that a company cannot charge full value.  
2.2.4 Summary of the Traditional Approaches  
Cost-based pricing, market-based pricing, and value-based pricing are pure pricing ap-  
proaches — each with serious drawbacks. In reality, most companies are not purists. While  
a company is likely to have a dominant philosophy, very few companies use a single ap-  
proach 100% of the time, and companies will modify their approaches to achieve different  
goals. When Xerox wanted to increase market share, it would place the pricing function in  
the sales organization — prices would drop, and sales would soar, but unit margins would  
drop. When Xerox wanted to increase profits, it would move the pricing function into the  
finance department — prices would increase, as would profits, although sales would drop introduction to pricing and revenue optimization 29  
\(Eric Mitchell, pers. comm., 2003\). Other companies are less disciplined — their approach  
to pricing may change with the flavor of the month\: market based when the emphasis is on  
market share, value based when focusing on the customer comes into vogue, and cost based  
when profits are required.  
Vacillating among pricing approaches may actually be better than strict devotion to one  
approach. Any company that sticks tenaciously to any one of the three pure approaches  
would likely soon find itself in deep trouble. What is often seen in reality is a hybrid — com-  
panies espouse a particular philosophy but use pieces of all three, supplemented by a con-  
siderable amount of improvisation. The upshot is pricing confusion; rarely is a consistent  
justification or approach applied across all pricing decisions. One of the fundamental ideas  
behind pricing and revenue optimization is that a company should clearly articulate its  
goal— that is, what it wants to achieve from pricing. Finally, pricing and revenue optimiza-  
tion as described in this book involves combining costs, competitive pricing, and customer  
value information in determining the price to offer. In that sense, it represents a blend or  
balance of all three approaches.  
2.3 THE SCOPE OF PRICING AND REVENUE OPTIMIZATION  
One of the goals of pricing and revenue optimization is to provide a consistent approach to  
pricing decisions across the organization. This means that a company needs to have a clear  
view of all the prices it is setting in the marketplace and the ways in which those prices are set.  
2.3.1 The PRO Cube  
The goal of pricing and revenue optimization is to provide the right price\:  
•  
•  
•  
For every product  
To every customer segment  
Through every channel  
In addition, the goal is to update those prices over time in response to changing market  
conditions. The scope of pricing and revenue management is defined by these three dimen-  
sions, which can be represented as a cube, as shown in Figure 2.4. Each element within the  
cube represents a combination of product, channel, and customer segment. Each element  
\(or cell\) has an associated price. For example, one element might be  
Medium-size turbines sold to large customers in the Northeast via the direct sales channel  
Another element might be  
Replacement gears sold to small companies via online sales  
In theory, a different price might be associated with each cell within the PRO cube. In prac-  
tice, some cells may not be meaningful. Some products may not be offered through some  
channels, for example. It is also the case that the prices within the PRO cube may not always  
be independent of each other. Our ability \(or desire\) to charge different prices through 30

­ different channels may be constrained either by practical considerations or by strategic  
goals. If we want to encourage small customers to purchase online rather than through our  
direct sales channel, we might institute a constraint that the online price for small custom-  
ers for all products must be less than or equal to the direct sales channel price. Considera-  
tions such as these need to be incorporated in the business rules applied to the pricing and  
revenue optimization process as described in Section 2.4.  
Companies may offer even more prices than the PRO cube would imply. Certain prod-  
ucts might be subject to tiered pricing or volume discounts. Or a company might offer  
bundles of products at different promotional rates or discounts that are not available for  
individual products. Each of these bundles or quantity combinations can be treated as an  
additional, virtual product in the PRO cube.  
The PRO cube is a useful starting point for a company seeking to understand the mag-  
nitude of the pricing challenge that it faces. Enumerating the combinations of products,  
market segments, and channels gives a rough estimate of the total number of prices a com-  
pany needs to manage. Many companies are astonished at the sheer volume of prices they  
already offer. For example, a bank offered home equity loans with rates that could vary by  
any combination of credit band, loan size, term, geography, and loan-to-value ratio. When  
all the possible combinations were enumerated, the bank was surprised to discover that it  
actually had more than 2 million prices in play for home equity loans at any one time. Such  
astonishment is often the first step in realizing the need to establish a consistent pricing and  
revenue optimization process.  
2.3.2 Customer Commitments  
A core concept in pricing and revenue optimization is the idea of a customer commitment.  
Specifically, a customer commitment occurs whenever a seller agrees to provide a customer with  
products or services, now or in the future, at a price. The elements of a customer commitment  
include\: introduction to pricing and revenue optimization 31  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
The products and services being offered  
The price  
The time period over which the commitment will be delivered  
The time for which the offered commitment is valid — that is, how long the customer  
has to make up her mind  
Other elements of the contract or transaction \(e.g., payment terms, return policy\)  
Firmness of the commitment and risk sharing, including contingencies that might  
change the price paid by the customer  
Some examples of customer commitments include the following\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
A list price is possibly the most familiar form of customer commitment. A list price  
is a commitment that a buyer can obtain the item by paying the posted price. List  
price is often \(but not always\) a nonnegotiable or take-it-or-leave-it price. Com-  
mon examples are the shelf prices at the grocery store and drugstore, price per gallon  
displayed on the gasoline pump, and most online retail prices.  
Coupons and other types of promotion are also customer commitments. They allow  
certain customers to obtain a good at a price lower than list for some period.  
In a business-to-business setting, prices for large purchases are often individually  
negotiated. The seller may have published list prices, but in many industries items are  
rarely, if ever, purchased at the list price. Rather, each buyer negotiates an individual  
discount. The discount that a particular buyer receives can depend on the buyer’s  
purchasing history with the seller, the skills of the purchasing agent and the salesper-  
son, and the desire of the seller to make the sale. Chapter 13 describes an approach to  
optimizing such customized prices.  
In other business-to-business settings, the buyer and seller negotiate a contract that  
establishes prices that will be in place for six months, a year, or longer. For exam-  
ple, in less-than-truckload \(LTL\) freight, shippers agree on a schedule of tariffs that  
will govern all the shipments they will make over the next year. These schedules are  
usually expressed in terms of a discount from a standard list tariff. Contracts are  
individually negotiated between each shipper and each carrier. Contracts may be  
exclusive \(as they often are in package express\), or a shipper may establish contracts  
with two or more carriers, as is common practice in trucking and container shipping.  
Contracts between electronics distributors, such as Ingram Micro and Tech Data,  
and wholesalers, such as Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems, are often on a  
tiered-pricing basis, where each tier includes a volume target and an incremental  
discount for hitting that target. An example is shown in Table 2.2. In this case, the  
purchaser will receive at least a 5% discount on each unit purchased during the  
current quarter. If she purchases at least 50,001 units, the discount increases to 6%.  
And if she purchases 80,001 units, the discount increases to 7%. This type of tiered  
pricing provides an incentive for the distributor to push the seller’s products rather  
than those of its competitors. Tiered discounts can be based on either units sold or 32

revenue. The increased discounts themselves can apply either to incremental sales  
above the tier or to all sales during the quarter. We examine approaches to setting  
tiered prices in Section 6.6 on nonlinear pricing.  
Online auction houses such as eBay enable a seller to establish a reserve price for an item  
she wants to sell. On eBay, the highest bidder above the reserve price will be sold the  
item. The commitment by the seller is to honor this policy. In addition, the seller may  
establish a buy-now price that allows immediate purchase. Auctions, either online or offline,  
are also common for many types of used goods. In an auction setting, the pricing  
decision on the part of the seller is the reserve and the buy-now price, if applicable.  
The forms and types of commitments that sellers make \(and buyers expect\) vary from  
industry to industry. As a simple example, airline tickets were historically refundable, mean-  
ing that the airline took all the risk of a customer not showing up — a no-show — a risk the  
airlines sought to mitigate via overbooking. On the other hand, tickets to Broadway shows  
have historically been nonrefundable, meaning the customer takes on the risk of her no-  
show decision. As a result, Broadway theaters do not overbook. The details of the types of  
commitments made in different industries are often the result of complex and contingent  
historical factors and may change over time — just as airlines are increasingly beginning to  
adopt nonrefundable ticketing.  
In fact, it is not uncommon for individual sellers to utilize different approaches for dif-  
ferent products through different channels. For example, an automobile manufacturer is  
likely to sell the majority of vehicles through dealers, using a combination of list price \(in  
this case, the wholesale price\) and promotions. However, General Motors Corporation re-  
ceives about 11% of its revenue in North America from group sales of cars to corporate,  
government, and commercial fleets. These sales are generally priced through individual  
negotiations or bids. Finally, a manufacturer may also be selling some cars directly to the  
public through a deal with an online channel. In this case, the manufacturer needs to apply  
pricing and revenue optimization across the entire range of its channels and pricing mecha-  
nisms in order to maximize total profitability.  
2.4 THE PRICING AND REVENUE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS  
Successful pricing and revenue optimization involves two components\:

decisions

Figure 2.5 The pricing and revenue optimization process.  
Much of the interest in pricing and revenue optimization has focused on its use of math-  
ematical analysis. Quantitative analysis is indeed critical in most pricing and revenue opti-  
mization settings, but it cannot provide sustainable improvement unless it is embedded in  
the right process. A diagram of a closed-loop pricing process is shown in Figure 2.5. In this  
figure, the overall pricing and revenue optimization process has been divided into eight  
activities. Four of these activities are part of operational PRO — that is, they are executed  
every time the company needs to change the prices it is offering in the marketplace. The  
remaining four activities — supporting PRO activities — occur at longer intervals. As the  
figure shows, pricing and revenue optimization is ideally a closed-loop process; that is,  
feedback from the market must be incorporated into both the operational activities and  
the more periodic activity of updating market-response functions. Each of the individual  
activities is discussed below.  
2.4.1 Operational PRO Activities  
Operational PRO activities work continuously to set and update prices in the marketplace.  
The timing of the decisions will depend on the application — airline revenue management  
systems and online retailers can change prices from moment to moment. Other compa-  
nies may update prices weekly or monthly. Independent of the speed at which prices are  
changed, the core operational activities will be similar.  
Analyze alternatives. This activity is the one most widely identified with pricing and  
revenue optimization or revenue management. For many companies, it has historically  
involved the use of spreadsheets to compare pricing alternatives under different scenarios. 34  
introduction to pricing and revenue optimization  
Choose the best alternative. The choice of the best alternative requires a clear under-  
standing of the goal for each price in the PRO cube — is it to maximize revenue or maxi-  
mize price or some combination of the two? When many prices are changing quickly, an  
algorithm is typically required to solve the underlying optimization problem.  
Execute pricing. Finally, the prices that have been calculated need to be communicated to  
the market. This step is also referred to as pricing execution. The mechanics of price transmis-  
sion and distribution vary greatly from industry to industry, company to company, and even  
channel to channel within the same company. For an airline or hotel, prices are updated by  
opening or closing fare classes—a process discussed in more detail in Chapter 8. In other  
cases, a pricing matrix in a database specifies which prices are available to which customers  
through which channels. In other cases, new discount guidelines are communicated to the  
sales force by email. For a company with many products being sold through many channels,  
communicating the correct prices correctly can be a challenge in itself. A number of pric-  
ing execution or pricing management vendors, such as Vendavo, sell software whose primary  
function is to ensure that complex pricing changes are correctly and efficiently transmitted  
through all channels. In the face of a complex PRO cube with thousands or even millions of  
prices, ensuring that each price is correctly calculated and implemented can be a daunting  
task. One of the important functions of pricing execution systems is to prevent price leakage,  
in which incorrect prices are published or salespeople price outside established guidelines.  
Monitor and evaluate performance. As sellers, when we receive results from the market-  
place we need to compare the results with expectations and evaluate overall performance  
against our goals. Are we achieving the lift we anticipated from a promotion? If not, why  
not? Was total market demand less than expected? Did the competition react more aggres-  
sively than we had anticipated? Were customers less responsive to price than we antici-  
pated? Or was it a combination of all three?  
Figure 2.5 illustrates that market feedback occurs at two levels. Analysis of alternatives  
receives the most immediate feedback. Here, the effects of the most recent actions are mon-  
itored so that immediate action can be taken if necessary. The required actions may not  
always be directly related to pricing and revenue optimization. For example, the markdown  
management system used by a major retailer indicated that a particular style of pants was  
selling well below expectations. An investigation found that the pants had been hemmed  
improperly. Once the problem had been corrected, the pants began to sell at the rate ini-  
tially expected. In the more common case, a big difference between realized sales and ex-  
pected sales is likely to be due to an unforeseen change in the marketplace.  
The second level of feedback updates the parameters of the market-response functions.  
If sales of some product are slower than expected, it may indicate that the market is more  
price sensitive than expected and the future market-response function for that product  
should be adjusted accordingly.  
2.4.2 Supporting PRO Activities  
The primary role of the supporting activities is to provide key inputs to the operational  
PRO activities. The supporting activities occur in a much longer time frame. Typically, introduction to pricing and revenue optimization 35  
goals and business rules will change quarterly or less frequently. Market segmentations  
may be updated annually. Price-response functions will be updated much more fre-  
quently, typically weekly or monthly in the case of markdown management or custom-  
ized pricing.  
Set goals and business rules. A key initial step in pricing and revenue optimization is  
to specify the overall goal of the process. Without a clear goal, it is impossible to make  
consistent decisions and to evaluate decisions in order to improve the process over time.  
In general, the goal of pricing and revenue optimization is to maximize expected total con-  
tribution. However, at certain times, in certain markets, a company may wish to increase  
market share or attain a volume sales goal. Whatever the goal, it is most important that it  
be stated clearly and explicitly. As discussed in Section 2.3, the corporate goal for a product,  
segment, and channel combination determines the form of the objective function that will  
be used when optimizing that cell of the PRO cube.  
Business rules apply whenever there is a restriction that may prevent us from pricing  
optimally in some market. Is there a minimum per-unit margin requirement we need to  
meet for all products within a category? Is there a minimum discount we need to offer to  
certain strategic customers? Do we want our retail list prices to be no lower than our inter-  
net prices? Such rules are sometimes referred to as guardrails. Each business rule needs to  
be implemented as a constraint in the optimization problem at the heart of PRO.  
Example 2.1  
A heavy-equipment manufacturer wants to make sure that prices in the North-  
east are never more than 15% higher than the comparable model being offered  
by the leading competitor. This decision results in a constraint to be included  
in the PRO optimization problem\: Our price in the Northeast ≤ 115% competitor  
A’s price in the Northeast.  
Note that business rules are inputs into PRO — that is, they are decisions made not on the  
basis of short-term optimization but on the basis of other considerations a company wants  
to incorporate in its pricing and its willingness to accept the resulting reduction in short-  
run performance.  
Segment the market. An important theme within pricing and revenue optimization is  
segmenting the market in a way that maximizes the opportunity to extract profit. We dis-  
cuss techniques for doing this in Chapter 6. The market segmentation needs to be updated  
periodically to reflect changes in the underlying market. However, this updating should be  
performed much less frequently than the operational PRO processes. For this reason, the  
“Segment market” step in Figure 2.5 is shown with a dashed line outside the main process  
loop.  
Estimate price response. For each market segment identified we need to estimate the cor-  
responding price-response functions. How to do this is the topic of Chapter 4.  
Update price response. It is not sufficient merely to monitor the performance of PRO ac-  
tions against expectations. A company needs to update its models to incorporate what it has  
learned. As long as performance closely matches expectations, the parameters of the models 36  
introduction to pricing and revenue optimization  
need not be changed. However, if performance is significantly different from expectations,  
models need to be updated to reflect the new information.  
The most critical message to take away from the pricing and revenue optimization pro-  
cess illustrated in Figure 2.5 is that PRO should be treated like any other critical business  
process. For a seller to make effective PRO decisions, he needs to clearly identify what he  
is trying to achieve, the constraints he is facing, and the alternatives available. Based on his  
understanding of the market and the constraints, he should choose the alternative most  
likely to achieve his goals. Once this alternative is implemented, he should monitor and  
measure the results against expectations and update his understanding of the market so that  
he can make better decisions in the future. The PRO organization, responsibilities, systems,  
and data-capture methodologies should all be designed to support this process.  
We must recognize that however prices are analyzed and calculated, a human being  
ultimately needs to be responsible for the prices in the market. This does not mean that  
every price needs to be inspected individually by a human being — a practical impossibility  
when thousands or millions of prices are changing each day. However, it does mean that  
prices need to be monitored with appropriate high-level metrics such as the distribution of  
contribution margin and the distribution of prices relative to competition. Extreme devia-  
tions — either high or low — should be audited to ensure they are consistent with the pric-  
ing methodology and not the result of calculation errors or bad data.  
The PRO process presented in this section is highly general. We return to it in later chap-  
ters as we look at how pricing and revenue optimization is applied in specific situations,  
such as revenue management, customized pricing, and markdown management.  
2.4.3 The Time Dimension  
Much of the growing interest in pricing and revenue optimization is being driven by the  
increasing velocity of pricing decisions. Prices in the past changed once a quarter for many  
industries; now they change once a week, once a day, or even once a minute. Increased  
frequency and complexity of pricing creates its own momentum. A company that is able  
to change its prices more rapidly in response to changing market conditions can gain an  
advantage over its more slow-footed competitors. This creates a strong incentive for other  
companies to match \(or exceed\) the frequency of change. E-commerce has been a proven  
driver of increased price velocity. As discussed in Chapter 1, the adoption of computer-  
ized distribution systems — an early form of e-commerce —by the passenger airlines was  
a direct contributor to the ability of the airlines to develop, manage, and update highly  
complex fare structures.  
Pricing follows different patterns in different industries. The rack \(wholesale\) price for  
gasoline fluctuates randomly, largely following the crude oil price, with little obvious trend.  
Fashion goods are priced high at the beginning of the season and are then subsequently  
marked down as the season progresses. By contrast, airline prices tend to rise as departure  
approaches. Different pricing approaches need to be used in each of these markets. Gaso-  
line rack prices are set using dynamic pricing approaches that primarily track changes in  
the underlying supply and demand imbalance. When supply is low \(e.g., Iraqi oil produc- introduction to pricing and revenue optimization 37  
tion is interrupted\) or demand is high \(e.g., the Northeast has a cold winter\), the price  
tends to rise. The price of a fashion item falls across the season, since such items become  
less valuable as the season progresses. On the other hand, the passenger airlines have suc-  
cessfully segmented their customer base into early-booking leisure customers and later-  
booking business customers. To support this segmentation, ticket prices rise as departure  
approaches. These different patterns lead to very different optimization approaches in dif-  
ferent markets.  
Frequent price changes create a challenge for an organization. As price changes become  
more frequent and the pricing structure becomes more complex, it becomes less and less  
feasible for a company to apply an in-depth analysis to each pricing decision. The spread-  
sheet analysis method of making pricing decisions begins to break down. As the complex-  
ity and rapidity of pricing decisions continues to accelerate, many organizations become  
­ overwhelmed. A common symptom is that despite expending more and more effort on  
pricing decisions, the company continually seems to be one step behind the market and the  
competition. At this point, most companies need to adopt a computerized pricing support  
system.  
2.4.4 The Role of Optimization  
As the name implies, optimization plays a central role in pricing and revenue optimization.  
As we see in Chapter 5, formulating and solving pricing decisions as constrained optimiza-  
tion problems is at the heart of pricing and revenue optimization. The formulation and  
solution of these constrained optimization problems draws on techniques from statistics,  
operations research, management science, and machine learning.  
While constrained optimization is at the heart of pricing and revenue optimization, it is  
also the case that no company in the world actually optimizes its prices. The reason is that  
determining optimal prices is, in general, impossible — or at least well beyond our current  
ability. Many pricing and revenue optimization approaches \(including those we study\) are  
based on solving stylized representations of the underlying problem. These representations  
include many of the important features of the real-world problem, but they exclude others.  
For example, many hotel companies have become reasonably proficient at pricing and rev-  
enue optimization. Yet the following is a list of some of the factors often not incorporated  
in hotel pricing and revenue optimization decisions\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
How the price we offer a potential customer now affects her propensity to consider  
this property \(or this chain\) in the future  
How group prices should be optimized to trade off the amount received from each  
group with the number of rooms they will take, considering that we may need to  
refuse bookings to future independently booking customers  
How the probability that this particular customer will cancel, understay \(i.e., check  
out early\), not show, or overstay \(i.e., check out late\) should influence the price we  
quote her  
How the price we quote a customer will affect her propensity to overstay or understay 38  
introduction to pricing and revenue optimization  
•  
•  
•  
•  
How the price we quote a customer should be influenced by the prices currently be-  
ing offered by major competitors in this market  
How the price we display in the system might influence competitors to change their  
prices  
How a group of properties serving a single location \(e.g., all the Marriotts in Manhat-  
tan\) should be priced to jointly optimize use of all the capacity  
How the expected booking order of future customers by length of stay affects the  
optimal price to offer this customer  
Each of these and many other influences is either often not incorporated or is incorporated  
in a very basic fashion in most hotel pricing and revenue management systems. The point is  
not that hotels are poor at pricing and revenue optimization. On the contrary, the industry  
has become increasingly sophisticated over the past two decades. The point is, rather, that  
hotels have been able to improve their pricing significantly without becoming perfect.  
Every industry that uses pricing and revenue optimization relies on a simplified repre-  
sentation of the underlying problem. The only justification for doing this is that it works.  
By capturing 75% or so of the real-world complexity, mathematical analysis almost always  
does better than either unaided human judgment or any of the purist approaches to pricing  
described in Section 2.2. Of course, companies and vendors continue to invest to improve  
the sophistication of their pricing and revenue optimization systems. Over time, systems  
capture more and more aspects of the real world, and the quality of pricing decisions  
improves. However, it is unlikely that any system or approach will ever generate perfect  
recommendations. What pricing and revenue optimization really does is use quantitative  
analysis to make better pricing decisions more quickly. Part of the philosophy of pricing  
and revenue optimization is that good prices on time are far better than perfect prices late. The  
improvement realized on any individual pricing decision may be small, but the aggregate  
effect over hundreds, thousands, or millions of pricing decisions can be very large indeed.  
An alternative approach to modeling demand and explicitly optimizing price \(model-  
based optimization\) is to use a test-and-learn, or learning-and-earning, approach. Under  
this approach, different prices are tested under different market conditions, and the prices  
that lead to better outcomes are chosen more often in the future when those \(or similar\)  
conditions recur. This approach has the advantage that it does not require explicit mod-  
eling of the relationship between price and demand. It has the drawback that it requires a  
considerable amount of testing to reach acceptable performance. For many companies,  
price testing may be difficult or impossible. Furthermore, when it is possible, it may require  
a considerable amount of testing suboptimal prices to find the optimal price, which can be  
costly. Finally, test-and-learn approaches are no better than explicit modeling in determin-  
ing the longer-term implications of pricing decisions.  
In this book, we discuss both model-based optimization and test-and-learn approaches  
to pricing and revenue management. Both have their place. Furthermore, it is likely that  
the most successful next-generation approaches will be hybrids of model-based and test-  
and-learn approaches. Specifically, such approaches will perform price testing and update introduction to pricing and revenue optimization 39  
prices guided by parsimonious but realistic assumptions about the underlying structure of  
customer response. This is, for example, the basis for the data-driven approach to pricing  
described in Section 5.5.  
Finally, I should reemphasize the importance of the feedback loop in Figure 2.5. Pricing  
and revenue optimization is dependent on rapid and effective updating and monitoring  
more than almost anything else. The faster and more effectively prices can be adjusted to  
account for what is currently happening in a market, the better the business results that will  
be generated.

For many companies, pricing involves a complex set of decisions that is often poorly  
managed or unmanaged. In many cases, the pocket prices charged to customers are  
the result of a large number of uncoordinated and arbitrary decisions. The price wa-  
terfall and pocket-price histograms can be useful ways of visualizing the current state  
of pricing management within a company.  
Traditional approaches to pricing include cost-plus, market based, and value based.  
Of these, cost-plus is the most common. Each pure approach ignores important  
aspects of the pricing problem. Most companies are not purists but rely on some  
combination of the approaches, with the emphasis changing over time.  
The scope of pricing and revenue optimization is to set and update the prices for  
each combination of product, customer segment, and channel— that is, each cell in  
the PRO cube.  
The approach used for pricing and revenue optimization must be tailored to the spe-  
cifics of the underlying market structure. From the point of view of the seller, the key  
concept is what type of customer commitment is required in each market. Different  
types of customer commitments require different analytical approaches.  
Pricing and revenue optimization requires a consistent process for decision making,  
evaluation, and updating. A typical process is illustrated in Figure 2.5. This process  
includes operational activities that involve setting and updating prices in response  
to market and cost changes, as well as supporting activities that provide input to the  
operational activities.  
Many of the approaches to calculating optimal prices in this book are based on a  
classic forecast-and-optimize approach in which we derive an explicit model of how  
we believe that demand will respond to the prices we offer and use the techniques of  
mathematical optimization to find the prices that best meet our objective function.  
This approach has the disadvantage that it requires choice of a price-response model  
and explicit estimation of the parameters — if the wrong price-response model is  
chosen, then the resulting prices will be less than optimal. Test-and-learn approaches  
have the appealing quality that they are nonparametric — they do not require the  
choice of a demand model beforehand. However, they have drawbacks as well. Both  
types of model are described throughout the book. 40

2.7 EXERCISE  
Brain and Company is a consulting group that offers a foolproof pricing and revenue op-  
timization service guaranteed to deliver \$2 million in benefit to a customer. It costs Brain  
and Company \$500,000 to provide this service. Unfortunately, Brain has a competitor, Dis-  
senture, that provides a similar, but somewhat inferior, service that only delivers \$1.5 mil-  
lion in guaranteed benefit. It also costs Dissenture \$500,000 to provide this service.  
a. When competing with Dissenture, what price does Brain and Company need to  
charge to guarantee that it wins the business? Assume that neither Dissenture nor  
Brain will price below cost and that both of them know each other’s costs and the  
customer benefits in each case.  
b. How would Brain’s price need to change if it only cost Dissenture \$400,000 to pro-  
vide its service?notes  
1\. Several real-world examples of this effect are described in Cooper and Kaplan 1987.  
2\. In a 2003 survey, 43.7% of responding companies answered that following the rule  
“Price is made up of direct cost per unit plus a fixed percentage mark-up” is either “Im-  
portant” or “Very Important” in setting prices \(Rao and Kartono 2009\).  
3\. One possible explanation for the policies being used by the two sellers is that Bordee  
did not have the book in stock but, if it received an order, it planned to purchase a copy  
from Profnath, while Profnath had the book in stock and just wanted to slightly undercut  
Bordee. More details on the multimillion-dollar biology book can be found in Eisen 2011.  
4\. In the software industry, value-based pricing often refers to pricing policies that  
are based on usage or metrics other than the type of computer or the number of users.  
This practice was pioneered by the software vendor PeopleSoft, which priced its Human  
Resources module based on the number of employees in the licensed company and its  
Financial module based on the annual revenue of the licensee \(Welch 2002\). The goal of  
such approaches is to segment the market according to value in order to capture higher li-  
cense fees from high-value customers. While PeopleSoft’s experience was widely regarded  
as successful, other attempts to implement value-based pricing have been less successful,  
particularly when competition drives fees down.

product and then charging them that value is called perfect third-degree price discrimina-

This chapter introduces the concept of a price-response function. The price-response func-  
tion specifies how the demand that a supplier will experience for a good will change as the  
seller changes his price for that good. I show how the price-response function can be de-  
rived from the distribution of willingness to pay among potential customers. We also look  
at the most common measures of price sensitivity and how they can be estimated from his-  
toric data, and at the most common forms used for price-response functions. The chapter  
also extends these measures to the case when a seller is offering multiple products that may  
compete with each other. This material provides a foundation for the analytic approaches  
to pricing that are described in the remainder of the book.  
3.1 THE PRICE-RESPONSE FUNCTION  
Neoclassical economic theory specifies that, under a set of \(seemingly\) reasonable assump-  
tions, at any point in time, every consumer \(individual or firm\) has a maximum willingness  
to pay for every good on offer by every seller through every channel.1 If the price of a good  
is greater than a buyer’s willingness to pay, she will not purchase. If the good is for sale at a  
price lower than her willingness to pay by more than one seller, she will purchase from the  
one such that the difference between her willingness to pay and the price —her so-called  
surplus — is maximized. She may not purchase from the seller with the lowest price because  
her willingness to pay may vary by seller. Thus, one customer might have a higher willing-  
ness to pay when purchasing from an online seller because of the convenience of delivery  
while another may have a higher willingness to pay to purchase in a store where she can ex-  
amine the item in person before purchasing. A customer may prefer the service offered by  
a particular airline — or be a member of its loyalty program — so she is willing to pay a bit  
more to fly on that airline than for a flight at the same time offered by a competing airline.  
It is also the case that a customer may not know of all sellers who are offering a product or  
may check the prices of only a subset of those sellers. models of demand 43

Customer B 18.00 18.00 18.00  
Customer C 17.00 17.00 19.00  
Price 19.00 17.50 18.50  
Example 3.1  
Three customers are considering purchasing the same book from one of three  
potential sources\: an online bookseller, a chain bookstore, and a local inde-  
pendent bookstore. Customer A strongly prefers the convenience of online  
shopping. Customer B is indifferent between channels and will purchase from  
the least expensive seller. Customer C likes to support her local independent  
bookstore. Their willingnesses to pay for purchasing the book from each seller  
and the price offered by each seller are shown in Table 3.1. In this case, Cus-  
tomer A will purchase online, Customer B will purchase from the chain, and  
Customer C will purchase from the independent bookseller.  
Example 3.1 shows that, when there is a variation in willingness to pay among customers  
in a marketplace, different sellers can offer the same product at different prices and still all  
experience positive demand. The milk prices shown in Table 1.1 and the book prices shown  
in Table 1.2 are real-world examples of such price variation.  
There are many different reasons for variation in willingness to pay. As in Example 3.1,  
different customers can have different preferences among different sellers or channels. One  
important driver of individual willingness to pay is propensity to shop — a customer who  
is willing to spend time comparing prices either online or offline will be more price sensi-  
tive than a customer who does not shop. Propensity to shop is related to the value that  
an individual places on personal time. Students and retirees are often found to be highly  
price sensitive — this can be explained in part by the relatively low opportunity cost of their  
time. Busy professionals tend to be less price sensitive at least in part because they assign a  
high opportunity cost to their time. Of course, there are people in all situations who enjoy  
bargain shopping for its own sake and get a thrill from finding a particularly low price, just  
as there are those who do not take the time to shop and are willing to accept a higher price  
in return.  
A consequence of the distribution of willingness to pay across customers is that the  
demand experienced by a seller for a particular product will vary as a function of price;  
furthermore, the seller’s demand as a function of price can be derived from the underly-  
ing distribution of willingness to pay. Assume that the three customers of the independ-  
ent bookseller in Example 3.1 represent his entire market and that his competitors do not  
respond to changes in his prices. In this case, if the independent bookseller raises his price  
from \$18.50 to \$19.01, his demand will drop from one to zero. On the other hand, if he  
lowers his price to \$13.99, all three customers will purchase from him. We can represent the 44  
models of demand  
amount of demand a seller will realize at any price using a price-response function d = f \(p\)  
where p is price and d is the corresponding demand. The price-response function for the  
independent bookseller in Example 3.1 is given by

The price-response function is a fundamental input to price and revenue optimization  
\(PRO\). There is a different price-response function associated with each element in the  
PRO cube — that is, there is a price-response function associated with each combination  
of product, market segment, and channel. Thus, a multichannel seller will generally have a  
different price-response function associated with online sales than with brick-and-mortar  
sales.  
The price-response function is similar to the market demand function described in  
standard economic texts. However, there is a critical difference\: The price-response func-  
tion specifies demand for the product of a single seller as a function of the price offered by  
that seller. This contrasts with a demand curve, which specifies how an entire market will  
respond to changing prices. The distinction is critical because different firms competing in  
the same market face different price-response functions. In Example 3.1, the price-response  
function faced by the online seller differs from the function faced by the chain bookstore,  
which in turn differs from the price-response function faced by the independent bookstore.  
The differences in these price-response functions result from differences in willingness to  
pay across customers, which in turn stem from such factors as the varying effectiveness of  
seller marketing campaigns, perceived differences in quality or customer service, conveni-  
ence, location, and loyalty, among other factors.

For our purposes, variation in willingness to pay among customers is the normal situ-  
ation. However, most readers will be familiar with the concept of perfect competition  
introduced in every basic economics textbook. Perfect competition occurs when sellers  
offer identical products, all customers are indifferent among sellers, every seller is infini-  
tesimally small, and customers and sellers have perfect information about all prices. In  
this case, customers will purchase only from sellers offering the lower price and the price  
will equilibrate to the long-run marginal cost. A commonly cited example is wheat. Each  
wheat farmer supplies an insignificant fraction of all of the wheat grown in the world.  
No matter how much an individual farmer produces —1,000 bushels or 10,000 — it will  
be too little to have any effect on the global market price. If he tries to sell whatever he  
decides to produce above the market price, he will sell nothing, and if he prices below  
the market price, he will face demand far more than he can produce. In this situation,  
his motivation is to produce as much as he can at an incremental cost below the market  
price.  
Under perfect competition, the seller has no pricing decision —his price is set by the op-  
eration of the larger market. The seller can only improve profit by finding ways to decrease  
his costs or increase the amount he can produce at an incremental cost below the market  
price. At any price below the market price, the demand seen by a seller would be equal to  
the entire demand in the market — the amount D in Figure 3.2. At any price above the  
market price, he sells nothing.  
A seller in a perfectly competitive market has no need for pricing and revenue optimiza-  
tion — indeed, he has no need of any pricing capability whatsoever, because the price is set  
by the marketplace. This is true of pure commodity markets such as zinc oxide and Brent  
crude oil and stocks sold on the New York Stock Exchange — in these cases, no one decides  
on a selling price, because the price is determined by the interplay of supply and demand.

Sellers decide only how much to produce and sell. In this case, the price-response function  
is as shown in Figure 3.2.  
The vast majority of marketplaces, however \(and all of the markets that we consider\),  
are not perfectly competitive. Rather, as a supplier moves his price up or down, he will see  
his demand change — as in the price-response function shown in Figure 3.1 for the inde-  
pendent bookseller. The primary drivers of the relationship between price and demand are  
variation in preferences, information, propensity to shop, and differential access to alterna-  
tives across customers.  
3.1.1 The Price-Response Function and Willingness to Pay  
The demand for a product from a seller is the result of thousands, perhaps millions, of  
individual buying decisions on the part of potential customers. Each potential customer  
observes the seller’s price and decides whether to purchase the product. Those who do not  
purchase may purchase the same or a similar product from the competition, or they may  
simply decide to do without. The price-response function specifies the number of custom-  
ers in a segment who decide to purchase a seller’s product through a channel at every price.  
We usually cannot directly track the thousands or even millions of individual decisions  
that ultimately manifest themselves in demand for our product — although online sellers  
can often track most or all of the customers who viewed the prices of their products. Sec-  
tion 4.2.2 shows that information on the number of customers who viewed the price of  
a product can be an important input to understanding price sensitivity. In any case, the  
price-response function results from the distribution of willingness to pay across the con-  
sumer population.  
We assume that, at any time, every customer in the population has a willingness to pay  
for every product being sold through every channel. Each customer compares her willing-  
ness to pay to the prices being offered by one or more competing sellers. If more than one  
alternative is priced below her willingness to pay, she will purchase the option with the  
highest surplus, defined as the difference between her willingness to pay and the price. As  
in Example 3.1, not every customer will choose the cheapest alternative.  
Assume that we have a population of customers of size D. The number of customers  
who will purchase at a price p is equal to the number of customers whose willingness to pay  
for the product is greater than or equal to p. \(For simplicity, we assume that if a customer’s  
willingness to pay is exactly equal to the price, she will purchase.\) Define the function f\(x\)  
as the density function for willingness to pay across the population, and define D as the po-  
tential demand— the number of customers who are potentially interested in purchasing the

product and are aware of its price. Then, for any price p, ∫ is the fraction

\( \) = \( \)

which we denote d\(p\), can be written as

F \( \) p is the probability that a random draw from the distribution with density function f \(x\)  
will have a value greater than or equal to p. In our case, it is the probability that a randomly  
chosen customer will have a willingness to pay greater than or equal to p.  
The implication of Equation 3.1 is that a price-response function can be generated from  
any willingness-to-pay distribution and that every price-response function corresponds to  
a willingness-to-pay distribution. Conversely, we can derive the density function for the  
willingness-to-pay distribution from the price-response function according to  
f \(p\) = d'\(p\) /D ,  
which is nonnegative because the price-response function is downward sloping.  
Example 3.2  
The total potential market for a spiral-bound notebook is D = 20,000, and  
willingness to pay is distributed uniformly between \$0 and \$10.00 as shown in  
Figure 3.3. This means that

The price-response function d\(p\) = \(20,000 – 2,000p\)+ is a straight line with  
d\(0\) = 20,000 and demand equal to zero for prices greater than or equal to  
\$10.00, as shown in Figure 3.3.  
One of the advantages of Equation 3.1 is that it partitions the price-response function  
into a potential-demand component D and a willingness-to-pay component f\(x\). This is  
often a convenient way to model a market. For example, we might anticipate that total de-  
mand varies seasonally for some product while the willingness-to-pay distribution remains  
constant over time. Then, given a forecast of total demand D  
t over season t, we can calculate  
expected demand over the season as

pose the problem of forecasting total potential demand from the problem of estimating  
price response. It also allows us to model influences on willingness to pay and total demand  
independently and then to combine them. For example, we might anticipate that a targeted 48

advertising campaign will not increase the total population of potential customers D  
t but  
that it will shift the willingness-to-pay distribution. On the other hand, if we open a new  
retail outlet, we might anticipate that the total demand potential for the new outlet will be  
determined by the size of the population served, while the willingness to pay will have the  
same distribution as existing stores serving populations with similar demographics. We  
also find this decomposition useful in the approaches to customized pricing described in  
Chapter 13.  
Customer willingness to pay is not constant but shifts with changes in taste and changes  
in circumstance. A customer’s willingness to pay for a cold soft drink increases as the  
weather gets warmer — a fact that the Coca-Cola company considered exploiting with  
vending machines that changed prices with temperature \(see Chapter 14 for a discussion  
of the temperature-sensitive vending machine idea\). Willingness to pay to see a movie is  
higher for most people on Friday night than on Tuesday afternoon. A sudden windfall or  
a big raise may increase an individual’s maximum willingness to pay for a new car. To the  
extent that such changes are random and uncorrelated among customers, they will not  
change the overall willingness-to-pay distribution, since increasing willingness to pay on  
one person’s part will tend to be balanced by another’s decreasing willingness to pay. On  
the other hand, systematic changes across a population of customers will change the overall  
distribution and cause the price-response function to shift. Such systematic changes may  
be due to seasonal effects, changing fashion or fads, or an overall rise in purchasing power  
for a segment of the population. These systematic changes need to be analyzed and incor-  
porated into estimating price response.  
A disadvantage of the willingness-to-pay formulation is its assumption that customers  
are considering purchasing only a single unit. This is a reasonable assumption for rela-  
tively expensive and durable items. However, for many inexpensive or nondurable items, models of demand 49  
a reduction in price might cause some customers to buy multiple units. A significant price  
reduction on a washing machine will induce additional customers to buy a new washing  
machine, but it is unlikely to induce many customers to purchase two. However, a deep  
discount on socks may well induce customers to buy several pairs. This additional induced  
demand is not easily incorporated in a willingness-to-pay framework—willingness-to-pay  
models are most applicable to big-ticket consumer items and industrial goods.  
3.1.2 Properties of Price-Response Functions  
The price-response functions used in PRO analysis have a time dimension associated with  
them. This is in keeping with the dynamic nature of PRO decisions —we are not fixing a  
single price that will last in perpetuity but setting a price that will stay in place for some  
finite period of time. The period might be minutes or hours \(as in the case of a fast-­ moving  
e-commerce market\), days or weeks \(as in retail markets\), or longer \(as in long-term con-  
tract pricing\). At the end of the period we have the opportunity to change prices. The  
demand we expect to see at a given price will depend on the length of time the price will be  
in place. Thus, we can speak of the price-response function for a copy machine model over  
a week or over a month, but without an associated time interval there is no single price-  
response function. Given this, every price-response function we consider has the following  
three properties \(unless noted otherwise\)\:  
1\. It will be nonnegative. That is, demand will be greater than or equal to zero at every  
2\. 3. price.3  
It will be downward sloping. That is, demand decreases \(or at least does not increase\)  
as price increases.  
It will be continuous. That is, it will have no gaps or jumps. The price-response  
function for the independent bookseller in Figure 3.1 has a small number of  
discrete steps because there are only three potential customers. As the number of  
customers increases, the price-response function will approach a more continuous  
function. While price-response functions are not truly continuous because of the  
discrete nature of customer demand and because prices can only occur at discrete  
intervals such as \$.01, we often treat them as continuous for mathematical conveni-  
ence.4  
Under these three conditions, a price-response function can be written in the form shown  
in Equation 3.3. Furthermore, every price-response function obeying the three conditions  
above corresponds to a probability density function on willingness to pay and vice versa.  
The correspondence between price-response functions and probability density functions is  
a useful property to which we return when discussing specific price-response functions in  
Section 3.3.  
The statement that price-response functions are downward sloping is a form of the so-  
called law of demand— demand decreases when prices are increased and vice versa. As we  
have seen, the law of demand is a natural and inevitable consequence of the fact that the  
price-response function is based on a distribution of customer willingness to pay. However, 50  
models of demand  
it should be noted that downward-sloping price-response functions do not mean that high  
prices will always be associated with low demand. A hotel revenue management system  
will experience higher average rates when occupancy is high and lower average rates when  
occupancy is low. What the downward-sloping property does indicate is that, in any time  
period, demand would have been lower if prices had been higher, and vice versa. This is  
consistent with both economic theory \(in which consumers maximize their utilities subject  
to a budget constraint\) and to real-life experience.  
3.2 MEASURES OF PRICE SENSITIVITY  
It is often useful to have a measure of price sensitivity — the rate at which demand will  
change as the price changes. The three most common measures for price sensitivity are  
slope, hazard rate, and elasticity. We define each of these measures in terms of the price-  
response function and show how they can be estimated from data. In order to estimate  
these properties from data, we assume that we have observations of demand at two different  
ˆ  
ˆ  
prices d  
\(p1\) and d  
\(p2\). Here, the caret indicates that the demand is actually being observed  
from data rather than derived from a model. For the measures described in this section to  
be accurate, p1 and p2 need to be relatively close to each other — say within 5% or so, and a  
sufficient number of observations are needed to achieve statistical significance.  
3.2.1 Slope  
The slope of the price-response function at a given price is measured by its derivative d'\(p\).  
Unless the price-response function is linear, the slope of the price-response function will  
change as the price changes. The empirical estimate of the slope of the price-response func-  
tion between two prices is given by the difference in demand divided by the difference in  
prices\:

\(3.4\)  
Because the price-response function is downward sloping, d'\(p\) will always be less than or  
equal to zero, which means that a proper estimator dˆ  
\(p1, p2\) of the slope should also be less  
than or equal to zero.  
The slope can be used as a local estimator of the change in demand that would result  
from a small change in price. Assume that we have observed the demand at prices p1 and p2.  
Then, we can use Equation 3.4 to estimate dˆ  
\(p1, p2\) and, by the definition of the slope, for  
some price p close to p1, we can write

That is, we can use the estimate of the slope to estimate the demand at a nearby price.  
Example 3.3  
A semiconductor manufacturer has estimated that the slope of its price-response  
function at the current price of \$0.13 per chip is –1,000 chips /week. models of demand 51  
From Equation 3.5, he would estimate that a 2-cent increase in price to \$0.15  
per chip would result in a reduction in demand of about 2,000 chips per week  
and a 3-cent decrease in price would result in approximately 3,000 chips /week  
in additional demand.  
It is important to recognize that the accuracy of the approximation in Equation 3.5 de-  
grades for larger changes in prices and that the slope cannot be used as an accurate predic-  
tor of demand at prices far from the current price. It is also important to realize that the  
slope of the price-response function depends on the units of measurement being used for  
both price and demand.  
3.2.2 Hazard Rate  
The hazard rate of a price-response function at a particular price is equal to minus one  
times the slope of the price-response function at that price divided by the demand. That  
is, h\(p\) = –d'\(p\) /d\(p\). Because the slope of demand is negative, the hazard rate is positive.  
Larger hazard rates mean higher price sensitivity. When the price-response function can  
be represented in the form d\(p\) = DF \( \) p , the hazard rate can be written h\(p\) = d\(p\) /F \( \) p ;  
that is, it is equal to the density function of the willingness-to-pay distribution at the price  
divided by the complementary cumulative distribution function. Given observations of de-  
mand at two prices, the corresponding hazard rate estimator is

3.2.3 Price Elasticity  
Perhaps the most commonly used measure of price sensitivity is price elasticity, defined  
as the ratio of the percentage change in demand to the percentage change in price; that is,  
100  
ε \( \) = –  
p p d p d p d p  
\[ \( \) – \( \)\]/ \( \)  
2 1 1  
\(3.6\)  
1 2  
100, ,  
\( – \) /  
p p p  
2 1 1  
where ε\(p1, p2\) is the elasticity of a price change from p1 to p2. The numerator in Equation  
3.6 is the percentage change in demand, and the denominator is the percentage change in  
price. Reducing terms gives  
\[ \( \) – \( \)\]  
ε \( \) = –  
p p d p d p p  
2 1 1  
, . \(3.7\)  
p p d p1 2  
\( – \) \( \)  
2 1 1  
The downward-sloping property guarantees that demand always changes in the opposite  
direction from price. Thus, the minus sign on the right-hand side of Equation 3.7 guaran-  
tees that ε\(p1, p2\)  0\. An elasticity of 1.2 means that a 10% increase in price would result in  
a 12% decrease in demand, and an elasticity of 0.8 means that a 10% decrease in price would  
result in an 8% increase in demand.  
ε\(p1, p2\), as defined by Equation 3.7, is called the arc elasticity between the two prices  
p1 and p2. It requires both prices to be calculated and, unless the price-response function  
.  52  
models of demand  
­ displays constant elasticity, it will be different for any choice of p2, which means that it is not  
uniquely defined for a choice of p1. We can derive a point elasticity at p1 by taking the limit  
of Equation 3.7 as p2 approaches p1\:

In words, the point elasticity of demand at a particular price is equal to –1 times the slope  
times the price, divided by demand. It is also equal to the hazard rate times the price. ε\(p\)  
is also called the own-price elasticity of demand to distinguish it from cross-price elastici-  
ties, which we discuss below. Since d'\(p\)  0, point elasticity will be greater than or equal  
to zero.5 The point elasticity is a useful estimate of the change in demand resulting from a  
small change in price.  
Example 3.4  
A semiconductor manufacturer is selling 10,000 chips per month at \$0.13 per  
chip. He believes that the price elasticity for his chips is 1.5. Thus, a 15% in-  
crease in price from \$0.13 to \$0.15 per chip would lead to a decrease in demand  
of about 1.5  15% = 22.5%, or from 10,000 to about 7,750 chips per month.  
One of the appealing properties of elasticity is that, unlike slope, its value is independent  
of the units being used. Thus, the elasticity of electricity is the same whether the quantity  
of electricity is measured in kilowatts or megawatts and whether the price units are dollars  
or euros.  
Like slope, point elasticity is a local property of the price-response function. However,  
the term price elasticity is often used more broadly and somewhat loosely. Thus, statements  
such as “gasoline has a price elasticity of 1.22” are imprecise unless they specify both the  
time period and the reference price. In practice, the term price elasticity is often used simply  
as a synonym for price sensitivity. Items with “high price elasticity” have demand that is very  
sensitive to price, while “low price elasticity” items have much lower sensitivity. Often, a  
good with a price elasticity greater than 1 is described as elastic, while one with an elasticity  
less than 1 is described as inelastic.  
Elasticity depends on the time period under consideration, and, as with other aspects of  
price response, we must specify the time frame we are talking about. For most products,  
short-run elasticity is lower than long-run elasticity because buyers have more flexibility to  
adjust their buying behavior to higher prices in the long run. For example, the short-run  
elasticity for gasoline has been estimated to be 0.2, while the long-run elasticity has been  
estimated to be 0.7. In the short run, the only options consumers have in response to high  
gas prices are to take fewer trips and to use public transportation. But if gasoline prices stay  
high, consumers will start buying higher-miles-per-gallon — or even electric — cars, de-  
pressing overall demand for gasoline even further. A retailer raising the price of milk by 20  
cents may not see much change in milk sales for the first week or so and conclude that the  
price elasticity of milk is low. But he will likely see a much greater deterioration in demand  
over time. The reason is that customers who come to shop for milk after the price rise will models of demand 53

still buy milk, since it is too much trouble to go to another store. But some customers will  
note the higher price and switch stores the next time they shop.  
On the other hand, the long-run price elasticity of many durable goods — such as auto-  
mobiles and washing machines — is lower than the short-run elasticity. The reason is that  
customers initially respond to a price rise by postponing the purchase of a new item. How-  
ever, they will still purchase at some time in the future, so the long-run effect of the price  
change is less than the short-run effect.  
It is important to specify the level at which we are calculating elasticity. Market elasticity  
measures total market response if all suppliers of a product increase their prices — perhaps  
in response to a common cost change. Market elasticity is generally much lower than the  
price-response elasticity faced by an individual supplier within the market. The reason is  
simple\: If all suppliers raise their prices, the only alternatives customers have is to purchase  
a substitute product or to go without. On the other hand, if a single supplier raises its price,  
its customers have the option of purchasing from the competition.  
Table 3.2 shows elasticities that have been estimated for various goods and services. Note  
that a staple such as salt is very inelastic — customers do not change the amount of salt  
they purchase very much in response to market price changes. On the other hand, the price  
elasticity of the market-response function faced by any individual seller of salt is quite large,  
since salt is a fungible commodity in a highly competitive market. This effect can be seen in  
Table 3.2 in the difference between the short-run elasticity for automobile purchases \(1.2\)  
and the much larger elasticity \(4.0\) faced by Chevrolet models. The table also illustrates that  
long-run elasticity is greater than short-run elasticity for airline travel \(where customers re-  
spond to a price rise by changing travel plans in the future and traveling less by plane\), but  
the reverse is true for automobiles \(where consumers respond to price rises by postponing  
purchases\).  
3.2.4 Cross-Product Measures of Sensitivity  
The measures we have considered so far have been own-product measures of price sensitiv-  
ity — that is, they measure the sensitivity of demand for a product to its own price. When a  
seller is offering more than a single product, he may also be interested in how changing the  
price of one product will affect the demand for other products. If lowering the price of one  
product increases the sales of another, then the two products are said to be complements—  
an example is hot dogs and hot-dog buns. If lowering the price of one product decreases the  
demand of another, then the two products are said to be substitutes —think Coke and Pepsi. 54  
models of demand  
If changing the price of one product has no effect on the demand for another, then the two  
products are said to be independent. Cross-product measures quantify both the direction  
and the magnitude of the effects.  
Assume that a seller is offering n products with prices p = \(p1, p2, . . . , pn\) that have cor-  
responding demands d\(p\) = \(d1\(p\), d2\(p\), . . . , d  
n\(p\)\).6 Here, the notation di\(p\) is used to  
make clear that the demand for product i can depend not only on its own price but on the  
prices being offered for all the other products. In this case, we let di\(p\) /pj denote the  
derivative of the demand for product i with respect to price j. The sign of the derivative de-  
pends on the relationship between the two products. If di\(p\) /pj \> 0, then products i and j  
are substitutes. If di\(p\) /pj \< 0, then the two products are complements. If di\(p\) /pj  
=  
0,  
they are independent.  
We define the cross-price elasticity between product i and product j as  
  


. \(3.9\)  
The cross-price elasticity between product i and product j is the percentage change in de-  
mand for product i resulting from a 1% change in the price of product j. To estimate εij\(p\),  
we could run a price test in which we hold all of the prices constant, except for the price of  
product j. Let p1 be the vector of original prices and let p2 be the vector in which all prices  
are the same, except that price pj has been replaced by a perturbed price pj +  . In this case,  
we can calculate an estimator of the cross-price elasticity by  
ˆ

Some typical values that have been estimated for cross-price elasticities are .66 for butter  
and margarine and .28 for beef and pork \(Frank 2015\). This would suggest that a 1% in-  
crease in the price of butter would lead to a 0.66% increase in demand for margarine.  
Note that estimating cross-price elasticity is substantially more difficult than estimat-  
ing own-price elasticity for two reasons. First, there are a lot more cross-elasticities than  
own-price elasticities — a seller offering n products has n own-price elasticities and n2  
– n  
cross-price elasticities. With 50 products, this would mean 50 own-price elasticities and  
2,450 cross-price elasticities.7 The amount of price-testing required to estimate all 2,450  
cross-price elasticities would be well beyond the capability of most sellers. Second, the vast  
majority of cross-price elasticities are quite small, almost always less than 1 and thus sig-  
nificantly closer to zero than own-price elasticities, which means that more samples are  
required to generate statistically reliable estimates.  
For a seller who is offering a large number of products, calculating cross-price elasticities  
between all pairs of products is usually impossible. This means that the seller needs to select  
clusters of products among which he believes that cross-price elasticity may be significant  
and estimate cross-price elasticities among products in the cluster under the assumption  
that cross-price elasticity between a product in the cluster and one outside the cluster is  
negligibly small. For substitutes, the clusters consist of similar products, often defined in models of demand 55  
the same category or product family \(e.g., big-screen televisions, men’s jeans\). For comple-  
ments, the appropriate clusters consist of items that are typically purchased together \(e.g.,  
hot dogs and hot-dog buns\). Clusters of substitutes are usually derived from a seller’s pre-  
existing product hierarchy, while clusters of complements can be generated by examination  
of sales records to determine what products are typically purchased together.  
A measure related to cross-price elasticity that is sometimes useful is the diversion ratio,  
which measures what fraction of the change in demand for product i that occurs with a  
change in product i’s price is borne by product j. That is, if we raise the price for product i,  
what fraction of the reduced demand for product i will translate into increased demand for  
product j? If i and j are perfect substitutes—and the only two substitutes for each other—we  
would expect the number to be close to 1. If i and j are independent, then the diversion ratio  
between them should be close to 0. The formula for the diversion ratio between i and j is

termine which product is the buyer’s second choice for a particular product. It is also used  
in evaluating merger proposals with the thought that a high diversion ratio for the products  
of two companies means that they are viewed as close substitutes by the market.  
3.3 COMMON PRICE-RESPONSE FUNCTIONS  
In this section we consider five common price-response functions. For each one I pro-  
vide an overview of the function, explain how to calculate the different measures of price  
response for that function, and discuss its appropriate application. \(More details and ad-  
ditional price-response functions can be found in van Ryzin 2012.\) Information about the  
functions is summarized in Table 3.3.  
3.3.1 Linear Price-Response Function  
We have seen that a uniform distribution of willingness to pay generates a linear price-  
response function. The general formula for the linear price-response function is  
d\(p\) = D\(1 – bp\)+  
,  
where D \> 0 and b \> 0 and the notation \(x\)+ indicates the maximum of 0 and x. The linear  
price-response function is shown in Figure 3.4. The satiating price— that is, the price at  
which demand drops to zero — is P = 1/b. The slope of the linear price-response function  
is D'\(p\) = Db for 0 \< p \< P and D'\(p\) = 0 for p  P. The hazard rate is h\(p\) = b/\(1 – bp\) for  
0 \< p \< P and undefined for p  P. The elasticity of the linear price-response function is  
\(p\) = bp/\(1 − bp\), which ranges from 0 at p = 0 and approaches infinity as p approaches  
P, dropping again to 0 for p \> P. For the linear price-response function, the parameter D  
represents demand when p = 0 and \(1 – bp\)+ is the complementary cumulative distribution  
function \(Equation 3.2\) of a uniform distribution with f\(p\) = 1/b for 0  p  P. 56

Figure 3.4 linear price-response function.  
We use the linear price-response function in many examples because it is a convenient  
and easily tractable model of market response. However, it is not a realistic global repre-  
sentation of price response. The linear price-response function assumes that the rate of  
change in demand from a 10-cent increase in price will be the same for all prices. This is  
unrealistic, especially when a competitor may be offering a close substitute. In this case, we  
would usually expect the effect of a price change to be greatest when the base price is close  
to the competitor’s price. models of demand 57  
3.3.2 Exponential Price-Response Function  
The exponential price-response function has the form d\(p\) = De–bp with D \> 0 and b \> 0.  
The slope of the exponential price-response function is D'\(p\) = –bAe–bp, which can also be  
written D'\(p\) = –bD\(p\). The hazard rate is constant with h\(p\) = b, and the elasticity is linear  
in price\: \(p\) = bp. The exponential price-response function has the property that the loga-  
rithm of demand is linear in price—that is, ln\[d\(p\)\] = ln\[D\] – bp—thus the parameters of  
the exponential price-response function can be estimated by applying linear regression using  
the logarithm of demand as the dependent variable and price as the independent variable.  
The exponential price-response function is finite but not satiating — there is no price at  
which demand goes to 0. The exponential price-response function corresponds to the case  
in which willingness to pay follows an exponential distribution.  
3.3.3 Constant-Elasticity Price-Response Function  
As the name implies, the constant-elasticity price-response function has a point elasticity  
that is the same at all prices. That is,  
\( \)  
′ d p p  
–  
=  
ε  
d p  
\( \)  
for all p \> 0 and some constant elasticity  \> 0. The constant-elasticity price-response func-  
tion is  
d p Ap  
\( \) =– ε  
, \(3.10\)  
where A \> 0 is a parameter chosen such that d\(1\) = A. For example, if we are measuring  
price in dollars and d\(\$1.00\) = 10,000, then A = 10,000. The slope of the constant-elasticity  
ε ε– \( \) = \( \)  
price-response function is ′ D p Ap +1  
. The hazard rate associated with the constant-  
elasticity price-response function is h\(p\) = p, and the elasticity is, of course, constant at .  
An important property of the constant-elasticity price-response function is that the  
logarithm of demand is linear in the logarithm of price; that is, ln\[d\(p\)\] = ln\[A\] – ln\[p\].  
Thus, given historic observations of price and demand, linear regression can be applied to  
the logarithms of the demands and the logarithm of prices to estimate the parameters of the  
constant-elasticity price-response function.  
Examples of a constant-elasticity price-response function for different values of the elas-  
ticity parameter are shown in Figure 3.5. Note that constant-elasticity price-response func-  
tions are neither finite nor satiating. Demand does not drop to zero at any price, no matter  
how high, and demand continues to approach infinity as price approaches zero, which  
would imply that the potential demand is infinite. Because of this property, the constant-  
elasticity price-response function does not correspond to any well-defined distribution of  
willingness to pay.  
It is interesting to analyze the impact of price on revenue for a seller facing constant-  
elasticity price response. Let R\(p\) denote total revenue at price p. Then R\(p\) = p × d\(p\), and  
R\(p\) = pAp– = Ap\(1–\)

Taking the slope of this function gives  
R'\(p\) = \(1 – \)Ap– = \(1 – \)d\(p\).  
Since d\(p\) \> 0, the derivative of revenue with respect to price for a constant-elasticity price-  
response function will be always greater than 0 for  \< 1\(inelastic demand\) and will always  
be less than 0 for  \> 1 \(elastic demand\). This means that the seller facing constant inelas-  
tic price response can always increase revenue by increasing price. In fact, profit will also  
increase, so a seller facing constant inelastic demand should raise his price as high as he  
can — to infinity, if possible.  
On the other hand, if  \< 1, a seller can maximize revenue by setting the price as close  
to zero —without actually becoming zero — as possible. If  = 1, then total revenue will not  
change as the seller changes his price. Because these properties are not found in real-world  
markets, the constant-elasticity function is problematic as a global price-response function.  
For this reason, constant elasticity is better suited to represent local price response than  
to use as a global price-response function. In real-world markets, price elasticity typically  
increases with increasing price for all goods and services.  
3.3.4 Logit Price-Response Functions  
Both the linear and the constant-elasticity price-response functions are useful local models  
of price response. However, they both have rather severe limitations as global models of  
customer behavior. This can be seen by considering their corresponding willingness-to-  
pay distributions. The linear price-response function assumes that willingness to pay is models of demand 59  
uniformly distributed between 0 and some maximum value. The constant-elasticity price-  
response function assumes that the distribution of willingness to pay drops steadily as price  
increases, approaching, but never reaching, zero. Neither of these functions seem to repre-  
sent customer behavior realistically.  
How would we expect customers’ willingness to pay to be distributed? Consider the case  
where we are selling a compact car. Assume that competing models are generally similar to  
ours and are selling at a market price of about \$22,000. We would expect customers’ willing-  
ness to pay to be concentrated near the market price. Many customers might be indifferent be-  
tween our car and competing models. Some might be willing to pay a small premium for our  
model, and others might be willing to pay a small premium for the competing model. When  
the market price is \$22,000, not many customers will be willing to pay \$32,000 \(or more\) for  
our car. On the other hand, as we drop our price below the general market price, we will ini-  
tially attract a lot of customers who will be happy to purchase our car at a discount from the  
market price. There would be very few customers for whom we would need to offer a \$12,000  
discount before they would even consider purchasing our model instead of an alternative.  
This suggests that we would generally expect customer willingness to pay to follow a  
bell-shaped distribution with a peak around the general market price. This is, in fact, a  
characteristic of many price-response functions used in practice. A bell-shaped distribution  
of willingness to pay generates a price-response function of the general reverse S-shaped  
\(or reverse sigmoid\) form shown in Figure 3.6. When a seller prices very low, he sees lots  
of demand, but demand changes slowly as he increases prices because, even if his price in-  
creases by a small amount, his offering is still a great bargain. In the region around market  
price, demand is very sensitive to his price — small changes in price can lead to substantial  
changes in demand. At high prices, demand is low and changes slowly as he raises price  
further. Empirical research has shown that this general form of price-response function fits  
observed price response in a wide range of markets.

The most popular reverse S-shaped price-response function is the logit\:

Here, a, b, and A are parameters with A \> 0 and b \> 0. Parameter a can be either greater  
than or less than 0, but in most cases we will have a \> 0. Note that the potential market can  
be written as d\(0\) = Ae  
a/\(1 + e  
a\). Thus, A scales the total size of the market, while b relates  
to prices sensitivity, with larger values of b corresponding to greater price sensitivity. The  
price-response function is steepest at the point pˇ = a/b. In Figure 3.6, a/b = \$1.00. This  
point can be considered to be approximately the market price.  
The logit price-response function is shown for different values of b in Figure 3.7. Here  
we have fixed p˘ = \$13,000, so a = \$13,000b for each function. Demand is very sensitive to  
price when price is close to p˘. Higher values of b represent more price-sensitive markets.  
As b grows larger, the market approaches perfect competition. In other words, the price-  
response function increasingly approaches the perfectly competitive price-response func-  
tion in Figure 3.2.  
Logit willingness to pay follows a bell-shaped curve known as the logistic distribution.  
The density function for the logistic distribution is similar to the normal distribution, ex-  
cept it has somewhat fatter tails — that is, it approaches zero more slowly at very high and  
very low values. An example of the logistic willingness-to-pay distribution is shown in Fig-  
ure 3.8. The highest point \(mode\) of the logistic willingness-to-pay distribution occurs at  
p˘ = a/b, which is also the point at which the slope of the price-response function is steepest.  
This is a far more realistic willingness-to-pay distribution than the distributions associated  
with either the constant-elasticity or linear price-response functions. For that reason, the  
logit is usually preferred to linear or constant-elasticity price-response functions when the  
effects of large price changes are being considered.

3.3.5 The Probit Price-Response Function  
Given that the most intuitively realistic density function for willingness to pay is bell-  
shaped, it is reasonable to ask, What about the most common bell-shaped curve of them  
all— the normal distribution? In fact, normally distributed willingness to pay corresponds  
to the so-called probit price-response function. The probit price-response function can be  
written as d\(p\) = A\[1 –  \(p; , \)\], where A \> 0 is a measure of the overall market size and  
 \(p; , \) is the cumulative normal distribution \(which has no closed-form representa-  
tion\) with parameters  and . We must have  \> 0, but  can be greater or less than \(or  
equal to\) zero.  
Those with some familiarity with probability theory will recognize that  is the mean  
and  is the standard deviation of the willingness-to-pay distribution. The slope of the  
probit is greatest when p = , which is intuitive because the mean of the willingness-to-pay  
distribution is an estimate of the market price, and we would anticipate a high level of price  
sensitivity at that price. Note that, when price is equal to the mean of the probit, demand  
will be equal to d\(\) = A / 2.  
The slope of the probit is given by  
d'\(p\) = –A \(p; , \).  
The hazard rate for the probit is given by h\(p\) =  \(p; , \)/\[1 –  \(p; , \)\], and the elastic-  
ity is \(p\) = p \(p; , \)/\[1 –  \(p; , \)\]. The demand at p = 0 is given by d\(0\) = A \(0; , \).  
While the probit function has some theoretical appeal because it corresponds to a nor-  
mal distribution of willingness to pay, the fact that it has no closed-form representation  
means that the logit function is far more commonly used in practice. Research has shown  
that the probit and logit functions give very similar results in most cases. However, the pro-  
bit function is difficult to work with because there is no closed-form version. Also, the two 62  
models of demand  
distributions \(and their corresponding price-response functions\) behave in a very similar  
fashion in the region around the market price. In fact, “By judicious adjustment of the coef-  
ficients, logit and probit models can be made to virtually coincide over a fairly wide range  
. . . and it is practically impossible to choose between them on empirical grounds” \(Cramer  
2003, 26\). Since this is so, and the logit is much easier to work with, the logit price-response  
function is much more widely used than the probit.  
3.4 SUMMARY  
•  
•  
•  
A key input into any PRO problem is a price-response function that specifies how  
demand for a product changes as a function of price. The price-response function is  
typically nonnegative, continuous, and downward sloping.  
Three common key measures of price sensitivity are the slope, hazard rate, and  
elasticity of the price-response function, where the slope is defined as the derivative  
of the price-response function, the hazard rate is the negative of the slope divided by  
demand, and elasticity is the percentage change in demand that would result from  
a 1% change in price. All three measures are local properties of the price-response  
function, in that they can be used to estimate the effects of small changes in price but  
not large changes.  
In most cases, price-response functions can be considered as the measure of the  
number of people whose maximum willingness to pay \(or reservation price\) is  
greater than a certain price. In this case, a price-response function corresponds to  
a particular distribution of willingness to pay across a population. For example, a  
linear price-response function corresponds to a uniform distribution on willingness  
to pay.  
• linear and constant-elasticity price-response functions are both commonly used in  
analysis. However, both tend to be unrealistic when applied to large changes in price.  
In such cases, a reverse S-shaped model, such as the logit or the probit, is likely to be  
more appropriate.

Consumer theory specifies a set of axioms that govern consumer preferences. Assuming that  
these axioms hold, each consumer will have a utility function that specifies her relative util-  
ity among different potential bundles of goods. Given this utility function, the prices of all  
goods, and her budget, we can derive her willingness to pay for any specific good. Details  
of the axioms and the derivation of willingness to pay can be found in standard microeco-  
nomic textbooks such as Nicholson 2002 and Frank 2015.

3.6 EXERCISE  
The average ticket prices for concerts held by six different artists in 2018 were as follows\:8  
Artist Ticket price  
Bruno Mars \$176.67  
The Eagles \$159.10  
The Rolling Stones \$155.26  
Jay Z/Beyoncé \$111.42  
Guns N’ Roses \$96.46  
Kenny Chesney \$87.21  
Dead and Company \$30.50  
Given that the incremental costs of mounting a show are roughly the same for all per-  
formers, what do you think accounts for the wide variation in the average ticket price  
commanded by the artists? Do you believe that all of these artists are seeking to maximize  
expected revenue from their concerts? If not, why not, and what might they be trying to do?  
During this same period, the average ticket price to see Springsteen on Broadway, in which  
Bruce Springsteen performed alone in a Broadway theater, was \$508.66. Why do you think  
this price is so much higher than the other ticket prices listed?notes  
1\. The existence of a willingness to pay \(which may be less than zero\) for every good  
in the market at every point in time can be derived from a set of simple and apparently  
intuitive axioms on customer preference. An example is the axiom of completeness, which  
states that, given any two products A and B, a consumer either prefers A to B or prefers B  
to A or is indifferent between them. Another example is the axiom of transitivity, which  
states that if a consumer prefers A to B and prefers B to C, she must also prefer A to C.  
With the addition of a few other axioms, we can derive the result that, for any product at  
any time, a consumer has a maximum willingness to pay for the product. A discussion of  
the axioms and a description of how they lead to a maximum willingness to pay for every  
product in the market can be found in any standard microeconomics textbook discussion  
of consumer theory. Similarly, the existence of a business’s maximum willingness to pay is  
a consequence of the standard theory of the firm in which firms act to maximize profit. In-  
troductions to consumer theory and the theory of the firm can be found in any stan­ dard  
microeconomics textbook such as Frank 2015 or Mankiw 2017. Deviations from these  
assumptions are considered irrational and their implications are discussed in Chapter 14.  
2\. Here we have arbitrarily assumed that, if the surplus for two channels is tied, a  
customer will purchase from the leftmost in the table of the two channels with the same  
surplus.  
3\. This means that what we are selling is a good— something people are willing to  
buy — rather than an illth— something people are willing to pay to get rid of. This is not a  
restrictive assumption —we can convert an illth with negative price to a good with posi-  
tive price by exchanging the buyer and the seller. Thus, instead of assuming that people  
sell trash \(an illth\) at a negative price, it is more natural to assume that people buy trash  
removal \(a good\) at a positive price.  
4\. In reality, strict continuity of price-response functions often does not hold. In par-  
ticular, prices for most items sold in the United States do not vary by less than 1 cent and  
most items are sold in discrete units. We could easily have the situation where d\(\$5.11\) =  
5,000 and d\(\$5.10\) = 5,010. In this case, price response is not technically continuous or  
invertible — there is no price such that d\(p\) = 5,005. However, as long as these jumps are  
small relative to overall demand, we can act as if the price-response function is continu-  
ous between consecutive prices and round to the nearest penny once we have solved for  
the right price, knowing that our final price will be off by at most 1 cent.  
5\. Here we use the convention that own-price elasticities should be positive, hence the  
minus sign in Equations 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8. This means that the products obeying the law of  
demand will have positive own-price elasticities. This enables us to associate a term like  
“more elastic” with higher values of the elasticity, which seems intuitive. However, note  
that, in the literature, elasticity is sometimes calculated without the minus sign, which  
means it will be reported as negative. models of demand 65  
6\. Throughout the book, I use boldface variables to denote a vector. Thus, in the text,  
p = \(p1, p2, . . . , pn\) is a vector with n component prices, and pi is the ith component price  
of the vector.  
7\. The number of potential cross-price elasticities with n products is the number of  
combinations of different products, or n2 – n. For products whose price is small relative to  
a consumer’s total income, the cross-price elasticity of product i with respect to product  
j will be the same as the cross-price elasticity of product j with respect to product i. This  
means that, for example, the percentage change in the demand for margarine resulting  
from a 1% change in the cost of butter will be the same as the percentage change in the  
demand for butter resulting from a 1% change in the cost of margarine. In this case, the  
number of cross-price elasticities that need to be computed is equal to n\(n – 1\) /2. On  
the other hand, if the price of one or both of the products is large relative to consumer  
income, then the cross-price elasticities are likely to be quite different. As an example, a  
10% drop in housing prices is likely to stimulate far more home purchases with accompa-  
nying homeowner’s insurance than a 10% drop in homeowner’s insurance rates is likely  
to stimulate new home purchases.

2018. 4 Estimating Price rEsponse  
Chapter 3 introduces the concept of a price-response function that specifies how demand  
for a product offered to a segment of customers through a particular channel varies as a  
function of price, and Chapter 5 shows that prices can be optimized, assuming that we have  
appropriate price-response functions in hand. It is clear that a seller would love to have a  
price-response function for each cell in the pricing and revenue optimization \(PRO\) cube,  
but it is not clear where these functions would come from. This chapter describes a number  
of approaches for estimating price response. We focus primarily on data-driven approaches  
in which future price response is estimated on the basis of an analysis of historical data. A  
major benefit of data-driven approaches is that they are objective\: if future customer behav-  
ior is similar to past behavior, then data-driven estimation should provide a good predictor  
of how demand will respond to price in the future. In addition, data-driven approaches  
facilitate ongoing evaluation and updating. New observations of demand can be used to  
evaluate the predictive power of the current model and to update its parameters to reflect  
changes in market conditions or customer behavior.  
The primary obstacle to using data-driven approaches is the availability of data. The  
ideal data set would contain a large number of observations specifying how past customers  
responded to a wide range of prices. If a seller does not have access to such a data set — if  
the number of historical observations is too small or does not include a sufficiently wide  
range of prices — then an alternative approach such as conjoint analysis or customer sur-  
veys needs to be used. Such data-free approaches do not require extensive historical data,  
but they can be limited in their ability to accurately represent price response across a large  
number of pricing segments.  
In this chapter, we start by considering the type of data required to support a data-  
driven approach and some different ways that a seller can obtain the necessary data, such  
as randomized tests and A /B tests. The chapter illustrates regression-based approaches to  
estimating price-response functions with an extended example. It shows how data on po-  
tential demand can be used to improve price-response estimation. We discuss the issues  
of collinearity and endogeneity in the data and how they can bias the estimation of price estimating price response 67  
sensitivity. Finally, we discuss the situation in which historical data are not available. In this  
case, alternative approaches such as surveys or conjoint analyses may be useful.  
4.1 DATA SOURCES FOR PRICE-RESPONSE ESTIMATION  
Any data-driven approach to estimation requires a data set that includes information about  
historic sales. At a minimum, the data set needs to include prices and total sales by time  
period. In some cases, this may be the only data available. However, in many cases there  
may be more data about such relevant factors as competitive prices or promotions. A par-  
ticularly powerful piece of data that is often available in online retailing is a measure of po-  
tential demand— the number of customers who took an action \(such as clicking on a link\)  
to observe the price of a product. As discussed later, when potential demand information is  
available, using it in an estimation of the price-response function can significantly improve  
accuracy. Other data that may be available include day-of-week, seasonal, and competitive  
prices, along with other variables. To the extent that these improve the accuracy of estima-  
tion, they should be included in the price-response model.  
Two conditions are necessary for a data set of historical outcomes to support price-  
response estimation. First, there must be a sufficient number of observations for the result-  
ing estimates to be statistically significant. In the case of a single price-response function  
based on price alone, this means at least 40 or more observations. If additional variables  
are incorporated in the price-response function, then more observations will be required.  
Second, there must be enough variation among the prices in the data to provide a basis for  
estimation. If the same price was always offered for the same product, then it is extremely  
difficult \(if not impossible\) to estimate a price-response function. If both conditions are  
not met by the data currently available, then the seller needs to either collect more data or  
utilize a data-free approach.  
There are several ways in which a seller might obtain data to support price-sensitivity  
estimation. The ideal is to perform randomized price tests. If this is not possible, A /B tests  
are a good alternative. In cases in which neither randomized tests nor A /B tests are feasible,  
a seller may need to rely on so-called natural experiments, in which different prices are of-  
fered to similar groups for reasons other than price testing. In addition, changes in price at  
either side of a pricing-segment boundary can be used as part of a regression discontinuity  
design. In the remainder of this section, we consider each of these approaches to obtaining  
a data set to support price-response estimation.  
The methods described in this section apply to list-pricing situations in which a take-it-  
or-leave it price is displayed for a particular product for each customer arriving through a  
particular channel. This list-pricing modality is the standard practice for most retail markets  
\(both online and offline\) as well as consumer products such as travel, hotel, rental cars, and  
so on. In contrast, in many business-to-business settings and in consumer credit, customers  
approach a seller that offers the desired product, and an individualized price can be quoted  
to each customer based on knowledge of the customer’s characteristics and desired product.  
Chapter 13 covers the issue of estimating price response and optimizing prices in such cases. 68  
estimating price response  
4.1.1 Randomized Price Testing  
The gold standard for statistical inference is randomized testing. In a randomized test, mem-  
bers of the population are assigned either to a control group or to a test group \(sometimes  
called the treatment group\). There may be one or more test groups. The test groups receive  
different treatments while the control group does not receive any treatment. In a price test,  
the control group is quoted business-as-usual prices and the treatment groups are quoted  
alternative prices. The idea behind randomized testing is, as far as possible, to eliminate any  
systematic differences among the test groups and the control group that could influence the  
outcome. If this is done successfully, it is reasonable to infer that differences in outcome ob-  
served among the groups can be attributed solely to the differences in treatment.1 In price  
testing, the inference is that any systematic differences in demand rate among groups are  
attributable to the differences in prices.  
Ideally, a randomized test should meet four conditions\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Assignment to the treatment and control groups must be imposed—consumers  
cannot choose the group that they are assigned to. If individuals are allowed to select  
their group, then selection bias might influence the results\: an individual’s choice of a  
particular treatment could be correlated with her response.  
The test and control groups must be balanced with respect to observable charac-  
teristics that might influence outcome. For this reason, so-called randomized tests  
are often not truly randomized\: individuals are often systematically assigned to the  
treatment and control groups in a way that ensures that the groups are balanced with  
respect to observable characteristics. For an online retailer, this might mean assign-  
ing customers to test and control groups so that aspects such as total purchases in  
the last year are balanced. For a brick-and-mortar retailer, this might mean assigning  
stores to test and control groups so that similar characteristics are balanced.  
There must be a sufficient number of observations in each group for the differences  
in outcome to be statistically significant.  
The treatment \(e.g., different prices\) should be the only difference in the way the  
control group and the test group are treated — for example, the groups should not be  
exposed to different marketing campaigns \(unless that is part of the treatment being  
tested\).  
In a price test with a single test group, customers are assigned either to the test group  
or to the control group according to the principles listed above. Customers assigned to the  
control group are quoted the control price pc , and customers assigned to the treatment  
group are quoted a test price pt  pc. After a sufficient number of observations, demands  
ˆ  
ˆ  
from the test group and the control group, which we label d  
t and d  
c, respectively, are ob-  
served. \(Recall that the caret above a variable indicates that it is an observation from the  
data.\) Refering to Equation 3.7, the arc elasticity between pt and pc  
can be estimated as  
ˆ  
ˆ  
ˆ  
ˆ  
\[\(d  
–d  
c  
t\)\(pc  
+ pt\)\] / \[\(d  
+ d  
c  
t\)\(pt  
– pc\)\]. Ideally, price testing would use multiple test groups,  
each with a different price. These prices and corresponding demands can be considered estimating price response 69  
points on a price-response function, and the estimation approaches that we consider later  
in this chapter can be used to estimate the corresponding parameters.  
The internet is generally well suited for randomized testing. In an online price test, each  
successful applicant can randomly be quoted a price chosen from a number of predeter-  
mined alternatives. The test ends when a sufficient number of responses have been obtained  
at each price. Furthermore, online retailers usually \(but not always\) have access to informa-  
tion on potential demand, which can be used to derive more accurate estimates of price  
response, as we see in Section 4.2.2.  
4.1.2 A /B Testing  
In an A /B test, customers with some characteristic are chosen to receive a control price  
and customers with a different characteristic are chosen to receive a test price. The differ-  
ence from randomized testing is that selection of customers into the treatment and control  
groups is not random — although the idea is to choose the test and control groups so that  
assignment is as close to random as possible. In a well-constructed A /B test, the charac-  
teristic used to separate customers into test and control groups is not correlated with the  
variable of interest — in this case, price response.  
Brick-and-mortar retailers perform A /B price tests by offering test prices through a set  
of test stores. The remaining stores offer pricing as usual. In evaluating the outcome, de-  
mand at the test stores should not necessarily be compared to the overall take-up at all other  
stores. Rather, each test store should be paired with a control store such that members of  
each pair are as similar as possible to one another in terms of characteristics such as demo-  
graphics, urban /rural, and competitive environment. This pairing should be done before  
running the test to avoid selection bias. The goal is to eliminate all other possible factors in  
order to isolate the influence of price on take-up.  
The problem with an A /B test is that, by definition, it is not randomized — changes in  
competition or the underlying economic environment can influence outcomes at the con-  
trol store but not at the test stores, or vice versa. These potential influences are the source  
of many of the objections that can be raised after the fact to the results of A /B tests, such  
as “The test stores performed better because those regions saw stronger economic growth  
than the control stores.”  
In the absence of true randomization, objections to A /B tests can be hard to answer.  
One approach to controlling for external influences in A /B tests is difference-in-differences  
\(DiD\). For a test-store and control-store pair, DiD compares the change in response in test  
stores before and after the price test to the change in response in control stores. The idea  
is that the magnitude of the price effect is best measured not by the difference in demand  
between the test store and the control store during the test period but by the difference  
between the changes in demand before and during the test period.  
Example 4.1  
A retailer wants to test the price sensitivity of a popular television. The price of  
the television has been \$550 at all its stores during the month of March. To run 70  
estimating price response  
a test, he chooses two stores — Store A and Store B — that are similar in terms  
of customer demographics. For the month of April, he raises the price of the  
television set to \$600 in Store A \(the test store\) and holds the price at \$550 in  
Store B \(the control store\). The corresponding sales in each store are shown in  
Table 4.1.  
The difference-in-differences approach relies on the parallel-trends assumption\: in the  
absence of the treatment, it is assumed that the test group and the control group would  
have evolved in parallel. For Example 4.1, this is equivalent to the assumption that sales at  
Store A would have grown at the same rate as those of Store B if the price had been the same  
for both stores in April. If the parallel-trends assumption does not hold, then the resulting  
analysis of test results will be invalid.  
One difficulty is that we cannot verify directly whether the parallel-trends assumption  
has held for an A /B test because we cannot observe what sales would have been for the  
control set under the treatment. However, it is useful to verify that the parallel-trends  
assumption held for the test and control sets before the test. If so, then it is at least reason-  
able to assume that it held during the test. If the parallel-trends assumption did not hold  
before the test, then it is not likely that it held during the test. The idea is illustrated in  
Figure 4.1. Each of the two graphs in this figure shows sales for a test store and a control  
store for several weeks prior to and during the test. In the left-hand graph, sales in the test  
and control move largely in parallel before the start of the test. In this case, it is plausible  
to claim that the parallel-trends assumption holds and that the difference in sales during  
the test is due primarily to the treatment. In the right-hand graph, sales in the test and the  
control groups were moving in different directions prior to the start of the test. It is thus  
much less likely that the difference in sales during the test is due primarily to the treat-  
ment; it would appear that factors other than just price are driving the difference in sales  
between the two stores.  
A criticism of A /B tests is that they may be subject to the so-called Hawthorn effect,  
which occurs when the fact that the staff of a store know that it has been chosen for a  
test changes their behavior in a way that influences the outcome. If local staff know that  
their store is being used to test special pricing, they may increase the effort they put into  
selling the product. This is particularly true if they believe that the results will be scruti-  
nized more closely than usual. This change in behavior may in itself change sales, thereby  
confounding the results of the test. For this reason, a store’s staff should be unaware that  
it is a test store in an A /B test. If this is not possible, then both the test and the control

customers.  
Proper A /B tests can supply important information about price response, but they also  
have drawbacks. First, for any product, estimating the price-sensitivity function requires  
measuring response at more than just two points. Furthermore, sellers want to estimate  
price sensitivity not just for a single product but for all cells in the PRO cube. This may  
mean estimating price-sensitivity functions for hundreds or thousands of price segments.  
In many cases, information technology limitations or corporate policy may limit the abil-  
ity of a seller to run a sufficient number of controlled price tests to cover all pricing seg-  
ments.  
4.1.3 Switchback Tests  
Switchback tests are often used in cases when a seller does not want to offer different prices  
to customers for the same product at the same time — a practice that many consumers feel  
is unfair \(see Chapter 14\). A switchback test is a special form of an A /B test in which the  
control price is charged to all customers through a certain store or a channel for a period  
of time, then the price is switched to a test price for a period of time, then it is changed  
back to the control price \(or to another test price\) for some period of time, and so on. For  
example, an online retailer might charge the control price for an hour, then switch to a test  
price for an hour, and then switch back to the control price for a month. In a switchback  
test, the customers who arrive during the periods when the control price is charged serve  
as the control group, and the customers who arrive during the periods when a test price  
is charged serve as the test group. A retailer who switched back and forth hourly between  
test and control prices for a week would have 84 hours of test observations and 84 hours  
of control observations at the end of the week. A brick-and-mortar retailer might switch  
prices daily or weekly at one of his stores to observe the response.  
Switchback tests need to be designed so that time is not a confounding factor — online  
customers shopping in the morning may have very different price responses than custom-  
ers shopping in the evening, and customers who do their shopping during the weekend 72  
estimating price response  
may be very different from those shopping during a weekday. For this reason, the switch-  
backs need to be designed so that control and test prices span different days and times.  
4.1.4 Natural Experiments  
The term natural experiment refers to a situation in which different treatments — in our  
case, different prices —were offered to different groups of customers for reasons other than  
running a test or optimizing prices. If the differential treatments were imposed randomly,  
then a natural experiment can supply useful information about price response. An example  
of a natural experiment would be a software defect or data entry error that caused some  
customers to be quoted erroneous prices while others were quoted standard prices. If the  
erroneous prices were quoted to a random set of customers, then the difference in take-up  
between customers quoted the random prices and those quoted standard prices can be used  
to estimate price sensitivity. Another example of a natural experiment might be imposition  
of a local regulation that causes prices to be different in one jurisdiction from a neighboring  
jurisdiction. In this case, differences in demand on either side of the jurisdictional bound-  
ary might be used to estimate price sensitivity.  
By definition, natural experiments cannot be planned, and they rarely provide ideal in-  
put for analysis. However, it is worthwhile for sellers to be aware of the possibility and to  
consider any situation in which different prices were offered to similar populations as an  
opportunity to better understand price response.  
4.1.5 Regression Discontinuity Design  
A seller who has not varied prices much over time may be able to use a regression discon-  
tinuity design \(RDD\) to estimate elasticities at the boundaries of his pricing segments. In  
most situations, we would expect that price sensitivity varies continuously across a segment  
boundary, while price jumps from one side of the boundary to the other. We would also  
expect that customers close to the boundary on either side should share similar price sensi-  
tivities, and we can use the price jump across the boundary as a sort of natural experiment  
to estimate price sensitivity.  
Regression discontinuity design was used to estimate the sensitivity of customers to the  
price of an Uber ride. The researcher used data from the first 24 weeks in 2015. At that time,  
Uber was applying a surge multiplier to prices based on the balance between supply and  
demand — if demand exceeded the available supply of drivers, a multiplier greater than one  
would be applied to the standard fare, with the multiplier increasing the more that demand  
exceeded supply. \(More information on how ride-sharing companies calculate dynamic  
prices can be found in Section 7.6.4.\) At the time, Uber calculated the surge price to a high  
number of decimal points but only displayed the surge price at discrete increments to fa-  
cilitate the user experience. Thus, Uber might calculate that the ideal surge would be 1.6214,  
but it would charge the customer 1.6 times the standard fare. In all cases, Uber would round  
to the nearest surge increment. It is this rounding that provides the price discontinuity that  
can be exploited — a 1.249 surge would be rounded down to 1.2 while a 1.251 surge would  
be rounded up to 1.3. It is reasonable to assume that conditions \(and the characteristics of estimating price response 73  
customers\) when the calculated surge is 1.249 should be almost the same as those when  
the calculated surge is 1.251, so the fact that one group got charged 1.2 and the other 1.3  
is very close to a randomized experiment. By applying this methodology to a sample of 50  
million UberX customers in Uber’s four largest cities, the company was able to estimate  
price elasticities, which fell largely between 0.4 and 0.6. \(For more details on this analysis,  
see Cohen et al. 2016.\)  
4.2 PRICE-RESPONSE ESTIMATION USING HISTORICAL DATA  
Assume we have a data set that includes at least historical demand and prices. It may also  
contain additional information relevant to demand such as competitive prices and promo-  
tional activity. In its most general form, the problem of estimating price response can be  
specified as finding a functional form and parameters for a model that best fits the data. We  
consider models of the form  
dijkt = fijk \(pt, xt; **θ** \) + ijkt, \(4.1\)  
where  
•  
fijk is a price-response function for product i sold to customer segment j through  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
channel k,  
dijkt is demand for product i sold to customer segment j through channel k during  
time period t,  
pt is the vector of prices for all products sold through all channels to all customer  
segments,  
xt is a vector of independent variables \(or features\) that influence demand,  
**θ** is a vector of parameters for the price-response function, and  
ijkt is an error term, typically assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution with  
zero mean.  
The specification in Equation 4.1 is general in the sense that it allows demand in any  
particular cell of the PRO cube to be a function of the prices in all other cells. This allows  
for the possibility of substitute and complementary products. Equation 4.1 also includes a  
vector of independent variables xt = \(x1t, x2t, . . . , xKt\). Elements of the vector xt can include  
any information we have available at the time we are setting price that could influence de-  
mand and /or price sensitivity. Examples include day-of-week, holidays, seasonality, prices  
offered by competition, and promotional activity. When we start the estimation process,  
we have historic values of dijkt, pt, and xt for some set of time periods t = 1, 2, . . . , T. The  
goal of estimation is to find the values of the parameters **θ** = \(θ 1, θ 1, . . . , θ L\) such that the  
function fijk \(pt, xt; **θ** \) best fits or predicts2 the values of dijkt for t = 1, 2, . . . , T. Regression is  
the standard approach to this type of problem.  
To illustrate the process of price-sensitivity estimation, we draw on an extended exam-  
ple. We assume a seller has been conducting switchback price tests in which he has set a 74  
estimating price response  
different price each day for nine weeks and observed the resulting demand. In order to  
compare different approaches on an apples-to-apples basis, the seller has designated the  
data from the first six weeks \(42 days\) of the test as the training set and the data of the last  
three weeks \(21 days\) of the test as the test set. The parameters of different models will be  
estimated using the training set \(a process known as training\) and the performance of the  
models compared on the test set. The purpose of maintaining separate test and training sets  
is to prevent overfitting, which we discuss in more detail in Section 4.3.2.  
The data for the 42 days in the training set are shown in Table 4.2 and the data for the test  
set in Table 4.3. We assume for simplicity that the seller maintained adequate inventory on

hand so that he did not run out of stock on any day during the training period or the test  
period, which means that the observed sales are equal to demand on each day.  
Tables 4.2 and 4.3 include two additional columns. Weekend is equal to 1 if the day is  
Saturday or Sunday and is equal to 0 otherwise.3 Potential is a measure of potential demand.  
For the moment, we ignore these two variables and apply regression to a model where only  
demand and price are available. In Section 4.2.2, we extend the approach to include addi-  
tional variables, in particular potential demand.  
4.2.1 Regression  
Let us start with the simplest interesting model using the data in Table 4.2; that is, let us fit a  
model of the general form d\(p\) = f \(p\), where f \(p\) is a price-response function. In this case,  
the three simplest potential models that could be used are those described in Section 3.1.4  
and listed in the first three rows in Table 3.3 — namely,  
• linear\: d\(p\) = D\(1 – bp\)+  
•  
•  
Exponential\: d\(p\) = Ae –bp  
Constant elasticity\: d\(p\) = Ap–  
The goal of the estimation process is to determine the values of the parameters of each of  
these functions that best fit the historic data — that is, the values of A and b for the linear  
and exponential functions and the values of A and b for the constant-elasticity function  
such that the corresponding predictions of demand based on actual price are as close as  
possible to those shown in Table 4.2. This is a regression problem. There are different forms 76  
estimating price response  
of regression, depending on the nature of the data and the functional form being fit. Of  
these, linear regression is the simplest and most familiar. Linear regression is a standard  
function in any statistical software including SAS, R, and the Analysis ToolPak in Excel.  
\(The discussion that follows assumes familiarity with linear regression and, for the home-  
work problems, access to software with linear regression capabilities.\)  
Linear regression can be applied directly to find the parameters of the linear price-response  
function. While the exponential and constant-elasticity price-response functions  
are both nonlinear, they can be transformed into linear relationships by taking the loga-  
rithm of each side. The exponential price-response function then becomes  
ln\[d\(p\)\] = ln\[A\] – bp, \(4.2\)  
and the constant-elasticity price-response function becomes  
ln\[d\(p\)\] = ln\[A\] – ln\[p\], \(4.3\)  
where ln\[x\] indicates the natural logarithm of the value x. Equations 4.2 and 4.3 are both  
linear, which means that we can apply linear regression to these transformed versions to es-  
timate the parameters for each function. For the linear price-response function, the x vari-  
able is price and the y variable is demand. For the exponential price-response function, the  
x variable is price and the y variable is the logarithm of demand. For the constant-elasticity  
price-response function, the x variable is the logarithm of price and the y variable is the  
logarithm of demand.  
Applying linear regression to each of the price-response functions using the data from  
the training set in Table 4.2 gives us the parameter values shown in Table 4.4, which shows  
the estimated parameter values and the associated r 2 values estimated for each of the three  
models based on the training data set.4 Note that the product whose price we are testing ap-  
pears to be highly price-elastic, with an estimated elasticity of 12.8. This is observable from  
the raw data as demand is generally significantly lower on days when the price is high. Sec-  
ond, based on the r 2 values reported in the table, the three methods appear to have about  
the same quality of fit to the historic data. However, this can be misleading\: The r 2 values  
computed for the exponential and constant-elasticity price-response functions are based  
on transformed data. In particular, they are based on how ln\[d\(p\)\] fits to the logarithm  
of the demand observations rather than to how d\(p\) fits to actual demand. To perform an

­ apples-to-apples comparison, we need to convert the predictions of ln\[d\(p\)\] generated by  
the exponential and constant-elasticity functions to d\(p\) and perform the comparison on  
that basis. Following that, we can estimate the quality of model fit based on the demand  
values of the test set in Table 4.3.  
We convert the ln\(p\) and ln\(d\) values to prices and demands using the identity that  
x  
=  
e  
ln\(x\). Table 4.5 shows the actual demands for each day during the test period along with  
the demands predicted by each of the three models.  
At this point, an obvious question would be which of these three models is better. To  
answer that question, we need measures of how well the predictions of each model match  
the observed data. Three metrics are commonly used to measure model fit.  
Root-mean-square error \(RMSE\). RMSE is a measure of the average difference between  
a forecast value and an observed value. It is defined as

Here, pt is the price for period t, and d  
t is the corresponding demand \(the “hat” in d  
t indi-  
cates that it is an observation\); d\(pt\) is the model prediction of demand based on pt, and T  
is the total number of observations.  
Mean Absolute Percentage Error \(MAPE\). MAPE measures the average absolute per-  
centage difference between forecast values and observed values. It is defined as 78

MAPE is an average of the percentage errors in the forecasts relative to the observations.  
A forecast that is 10% high contributes the same amount to MAPE as one that is 10% low.  
Weighted MAPE. MAPE has an obvious shortcoming — a high percentage difference  
between forecast and observation is worse when the magnitude of the item being forecast is  
large compared to when it is small. If we forecast demand of 1 item for a day and actual de-  
mand turns out to be 3, the absolute percentage error is 200%. This is the same percentage  
error as if we forecast demand of 200 items and demand turns out to be 600. Both of these  
are treated the same in computing MAPE —however, the second missed forecast seems  
much worse. If we are dealing with observed values that have a wide range in magnitude, we  
should be able to do better on a percentage basis in forecasting the larger values and recog-  
nize that a 200% miss in forecasting a value of 200 is worse than the same percentage miss  
in forecasting a value of 1. One way to incorporate this effect is by weighting each entry in  
MAPE by the magnitude of the observation — in our case, demand. This gives us weighted  
MAPE, which is calculated by

Each of the three measures of fit calculated for each model based on the test set data are  
shown in Table 4.6. The exponential and constant-elasticity models have virtually identical  
performance on all three measures. The linear model is slightly better than the other two in  
terms of RMSE and weighted MAPE but slightly worse in terms of MAPE. All three price-  
response functions are shown graphically in Figure 4.2. In the region of the test — that is,  
for prices between \$6.45 and \$7.35 — the exponential and constant-elasticity functions are  
essentially indistinguishable, which explains why their performance is so similar.  
The situation in Table 4.6 is quite common — test results often give no clear-cut win-  
ner among competing price-response functions, and some functions give almost identical  
results. One possibility in this case is to pick a winner among the three and set the corre-  
sponding optimal price. The rightmost column in Table 4.6 shows the optimal price calcu-  
lated from each of the three price-response models, assuming that the incremental cost per  
unit is \$6.00. Since the linear model outperformed the other two on RMSE and weighted  
MAPE, the seller could simply set a price of \$6.76 and move forward. A second option is to  
do more testing. One outcome of the test is that the optimal price under any of the models

linear, exponential, and constant-elasticity price-response functions with param-  
falls between \$6.50 and \$6.80. The seller could run another few weeks of tests, considering  
only prices within that range to refine the parameters of the model.  
Another, perhaps more appealing, approach is to incorporate additional variables into  
the estimation. Table 4.2 includes information on whether a test date was a weekend or  
weekday and on demand potential that was not included in the model estimation. Both  
of these variables, along with others that might be available, have the potential to improve  
model fit \(Exercise 1\). However, for purposes of price-sensitivity estimation, incorporation  
of potential demand data is particularly powerful.  
4.2.2 Incorporating Potential Demand  
In brick-and-mortar retail, sellers can usually only observe realized demand — the number  
of products that they sold. They do not have a good idea of the number of people who  
might have actively considered purchasing a product but did not — either because the price  
was too high or for some other reason. In contrast, online retailers can usually see the num-  
ber of people who visited a product page and were quoted a price. For example, Amazon  
provides sellers in its marketplace with statistics on glance views, defined as customer visits  
to a product detail page. Amazon also provides marketplace sellers with their glance view  
conversion rates for each product, defined as the number of orders divided by the number  
of glance views. Information such as glance views, which we call potential demand, can be  
extremely valuable in enabling more accurate price-response estimates. 80  
estimating price response  
It is likely that a brick-and-mortar seller would not have access to information on the po-  
tential demand for every product in his store. In this case, the seller can only estimate price  
response using data on product sales along with additional features such as day of week and  
seasonality. On the other hand, an online retailer is likely to have access to information on  
potential demand — for example, that shown in the rightmost column of Table 4.2. When  
such information is available, we can use it to decompose the price-response function into  
potential demand \(which we assume is independent of price\) and a conversion rate, which  
incorporates customer response to price. In this case, we can write the price-response func-  
tion in Equation 4.1 as  
dijkt = Dijkt  ijk \(pt, xt; **Θ**\) + ijkt,  
where Dijkt is potential demand during time period t and ijk is a price-response function  
that estimates the fraction of potential demand that converts into sales as a function of price  
and the other explanatory variables. For the case of this single product during a single time  
period, we can drop the subscripts and write the price-response function with potential  
demand information as d\(p\) = D\(p\) + , which is very similar to Equation 3.1, recogniz-  
ing that the fraction of potential demand that will result in a purchase at a price is equal to  
the fraction of customers who have a willingness to pay greater than the price plus an error  
term. When we can observe potential demand D, then we can consider the problem as be-  
ing one of estimating the parameters of the conversion rate function \(p\) based on empirical

listed in Table 3.3 lend themselves particularly well to this setting\: the logit and the probit.  
As discussed in Chapter 3, the logit corresponds to a logistic distribution of customer will-  
ingness to pay and the probit to a normal distribution of customer willingness to pay. While  
the normal might seem to be the more natural choice, the two functions are quite similar  
and they predict similar levels of price response when presented with the same data. The  
logit, however, is much easier to work with and is much more commonly used, and we use  
it for the remainder of this section.

\(4.6\) estimating price response 81  
The quantity on the right side of Equation 4.6 is called the log conversion odds. It is the  
logarithm of the fraction of quotes that converted at a given price divided by the fraction  
that did not convert. To estimate the parameters of the conversion-rate function, we regress  
the observed log conversion odds against the price by applying linear regression to Equa-

This gives estimated values of the a and b parameters of a  
= 36.67 and b  
= 5.25\. When we  
apply the logit function using these parameters to the test data set in Table 4.3, we find that  
the resulting RMSE = 4.40, MAPE = .19, and weighted MAPE = .08. These values are sub-  
stantially lower \(i.e., better\) than the fit statistics for the linear, exponential, and constant-  
elasticity price-response functions shown in Table 4.6, demonstrating that incorporating  
potential demand information in price-response estimation can significantly improve fit  
of the price-response function; this result is generally independent of the functional form  
used \(Exercise 2\). In fact, sellers that have access to potential demand data have an advan-  
tage because the data allow them to decompose demand influences that are not price related  
and the irrelevant data, or noise, in potential demand from actual customer price response  
as embodied in the conversion function.5  
4.3 THE ESTIMATION PROCESS  
In Section 4.2, we went through the process of fitting three different model forms \(linear,  
exponential, constant-elasticity\) to a training data set and then measuring the quality of the  
model predictions on a test data set. While this is a toy problem, at a high level the steps  
are similar to those that would be performed in a real exercise. In particular, a data-driven  
estimation of price response typically involves the following steps\:  
1\. 2. 3. Obtain historical data on prices and demands and other explanatory variables via  
one of the approaches described in Section 4.1. Sufficient historic data must be  
gathered to support estimation, and the data typically require some preparation to  
be put in the format required for estimation.  
Divide the data into a training set and a test set.  
Estimate different models using different variables with the training set, and meas-  
ure their performance on the test set. Choose the best among the candidate models.  
Each of these steps is discussed in the following sections.  
4.3.1 Data Preparation  
Alternatives for obtaining price and demand data to estimate price response are described  
in Section 4.1. A couple of comments need to be added. First, while the problem of obtain-  
ing data is straightforward to describe, experience has shown that obtaining a sufficiently  
clean data set to perform useful analysis is often the most painful and time-consuming  
part of the entire process. Often, the raw data are quite messy and unsuited for analysis. As 82  
estimating price response  
a simple example, in many cases returns are entered as negative sales on the day they are  
received. Not only can this result in negative sales for a day, but also it is not clear that this  
is how returns should be incorporated in price-response estimation in the first place. Most  
organizations seeking to estimate price response for the first time find that cleansing the  
data takes far more time and resources than initially planned.  
Another common issue is the treatment of stockouts and sellouts. A retailer who sells  
out of a brand of bottles of aspirin by Wednesday does not know what total demand would  
have been had the aspirin remained in stock. Similarly, an airline that sells all of the seats  
for a particular flight a week before departure does not know what the total demand for  
that flight would have been if additional seats were available. This is a problem of censored  
data— for a given price, we do not observe the corresponding demand; rather, we observe  
sales, which is the minimum of demand and capacity.  
There are several approaches to estimating demand in the face of censored data. Perhaps  
the simplest is a scaling approach. While a seller may not be able to observe potential de-  
mand once he has stocked out, it is likely that he can observe historical sales by period as  
well the period in which the stockout occurred. The scaling approach simply scales the ob-  
served sales by one over the fraction of the demand that normally occurred by the stockout  
time. For example, an airline might sell out a flight one week before departure. Looking at  
its history of flights that did not sell out, the airline could calculate that bookings up to one  
week prior to departure typically represented 3/4 of sales for the flight, with the remaining  
1/4 booking in the last week. In this case, it could estimate the demand for the flight as 4/3  
times sales.  
Example 4.2  
A retailer stocks 30 bottles of a popular multivitamin every Friday night. His  
average weekly sales are 24.8 bottles. When he does not stock out, his average  
sales for each day are as follows\: Saturday, 6.2 bottles; Sunday, 4.8 bottles; Mon-  
day, 1.6 bottles; Tuesday, 2.2 bottles; Wednesday, 3.4 bottles; Thursday, 3.4 bot-  
tles; and Friday, 3.2 bottles. He runs a low-price test and sells his entire stock  
of 30 bottles by Wednesday evening. Using the scaling model, he estimates that  
demand for the entire week would have been \(24.8/18.2\)  30 = 40.9 bottles.  
4.3.2 Choosing a Training Set and a Test Set  
The reason for partitioning the historical data into a training set and a test set is to avoid the  
problem of overfitting, which occurs when some of the variables that have been included in  
the model actually reduce the predictive power of the model. If we start with a very simple  
model, we will find that adding more variables will always increase the performance of the  
model as measured on the training set. That is, if we add any external variable to the re-  
gressions we performed in the previous section, the performance of every single one of the  
functional forms would improve — that is, RMSE would decrease. However, at some point,  
additional variables are being fit only to the noise in the training set data. The situation is  
illustrated in Figure 4.3\: as more and more variables are added to a model, the model error  
on the training set —whether measured by RMSE, MAPE, or another metric —will always estimating price response 83  
Model

Training set  
Number of variables

set as the number of variables in the model is increased.  
decrease. However, at some point adding more variables begins to reduce the predictive  
power of the model; at this point the model is said to be overfit. If a model is overfit, then it  
should have a worse fit on the test set than an alternative model, even though it has a better  
fit on the training set. For this reason, we use the training set to train \(i.e., fit\) models and  
the test set to measure their performance.  
Opinions differ on how much of the data set should be held out as a test set. Common  
practice is 33%, but some sources advocate 50%. Perhaps more important than the size is  
the requirement that the test set and the training set be balanced to the extent possible —  
that is, the profile of the customers purchasing and the external influences on them should  
be matched as closely as possible between the two sets.  
4.3.3 Model Selection  
Once data have been acquired and test and training data sets established, the final phase  
in estimation is model selection. This includes the selection of the functional form for the  
model \(e.g., linear versus logit\), as well as estimation of the parameters for the chosen  
functional form.  
Typically, a functional form is chosen prior to estimation. This means that the primary  
task is to choose the variables to be included in the model. For example, given the data  
in Table 4.2, should we include Weekend as an explanatory variable in the model? When  
relatively few exogenous variables are available, we can test including all of them and ex-  
clude those that do not improve the model fit. We can create new explanatory variables by  
transforming exogenous variables \(e.g., taking the logarithm\) and by crossing variables \(e.g.,  
creating a new variable — for example, Price times Weekend\). The goal of model selection  
is to determine a set of explanatory variables and corresponding parameters that results in  
the best prediction of observed demand.  
To initiate the modeling process, we choose a simple initial model, apply logistic regres-  
sion to estimate the coefficients of the model on the training set, and then measure the fit of  
this model on the test data set. This model is called the champion. Once we have established 84  
estimating price response  
an initial champion, we can determine a final model using a champion-challenger process,  
which proceeds in five steps\:  
1\. Choose a set of variables and variable transformations that has not been tried be-  
fore.  
2\. 3. 4. 5. Run a regression using the variables, variable combinations, and variable transfor-  
mations on the training set. The resulting model is called the challenger.  
Measure the performance of the challenger on the test data. If the challenger per-  
forms better than the champion, then the challenger becomes the new champion. If  
the champion outperforms the challenger, then the champion remains the cham-  
pion.  
Go to step 1 and continue until performance is no longer improving as new chal-  
lengers are evaluated.  
Once a final champion has been chosen, reestimate the coefficients of the model  
using all of the available data \(training data and test data\).  
This process is repeated each time a new challenger model is proposed. This means  
that, at any time, the current champion has demonstrated the best performance of all of  
the considered models as measured using the test data. It is important to update the test  
data periodically with recent observations to ensure that model performance is measured  
against data that reflects the most current market conditions.  
The approach of starting from a simple model and adding variables and cross-variables  
in a way that sequentially improves the model \(as measured on the test data set\) is known as  
forward stepwise regression. You may wonder, why not take the opposite approach\: start by  
including all the variables and all their transformations and crosses, and then sequentially  
eliminate those that are not significant — all those with high p-values \(indicating low statis-  
tical significance\), for example. This approach is called backward stepwise regression. It is a  
bad idea for three reasons. First, if the number of combinations and variables to be tested  
is greater than the number of observations in the training set, most regression packages will  
not converge. This limits the ability to consider variables and combinations. The second  
reason is that using all possible variables and combinations of variables will lead to a model  
that is overfit —that is, it looks great in fitting the training set but does a terrible job on the  
test set. In this case, the p-values may not give a good signal regarding which variable to  
remove. Finally, it could be the case that multiple variables are correlated and that no single  
one of them has a strong influence on demand, so all of them would be excluded. However,  
if the others had been excluded, one of the remaining variables might have a significant  
influence and should be included. This is an issue of collinearity, which is described in the  
next section.  
4.4 CHALLEGES IN ESTIMATION  
The previous section describes a forward stepwise regression process for estimating the  
coefficients of a price-response model. While the process of choosing explanatory vari- estimating price response 85  
ables can be complex, the overall idea should be clear\: sequentially add new variables and  
combinations of variables to find the model that best fits the historic data as measured by  
performance on the test set. Unfortunately, finding a model that simply fits the data well  
is not sufficient for purposes of pricing optimization. To determine an optimal price, we  
need to have more than a price-response function that predicts demand; we need a price-  
response function that accurately represents the causal link between price and demand.  
This is a stricter requirement than predictive accuracy and it requires testing, and poten-  
tially modifying our model, for two possible conditions\: collinearity, in which one or more  
of the exogenous variables influences price, and endogeneity, in which some variable not in  
the model influences both price and demand. If either of these situations exist, then we will  
need to modify our model if we want to accurately represent the dependence of demand on  
price. We consider each in turn.  
4.4.1 Collinearity  
Collinearity occurs when one or more of the other explanatory variables in the model influ-  
ences both demand and price. As a simple example, the process of forward stepwise regres-  
sion might reveal that the previous period’s price is significant in predicting this period’s  
demand.  
Example 4.3  
A seller estimates a linear model based on historical data using both price and  
unit cost for an item as explanatory variables. He obtains a model that fits his-  
torical data well\:  
d\(p, c\) = \(100 – 1.3p – .24c\)+  
,  
where c is unit cost. Furthermore, both coefficients have p-values \< .01. How-  
ever, the seller runs a regression of price on cost using the same set of historical  
data and finds that the equation p = 1.21c + .02 has an extremely good fit. This  
indicates that \(not surprisingly\) price is highly collinear with cost and that cost  
should probably be dropped from price-response function.  
In Example 4.3, the source of collinearity is clear\: cost influences demand through its  
influence on price; that is, higher costs lead to higher prices, which leads to lower demand.  
It is unlikely \(although not impossible\) that cost has a direct influence on demand; it is  
more likely that the significance of cost in the estimation was the result of cost “reaching  
through” price to influence demand. In this case, dropping cost as an explanatory variable  
would almost certainly result in a model that better represented the causal influence of price  
on demand.  
The test for collinearity is straightforward — a linear regression is run using price as  
the target variable and the exogenous variables as explanatory variables. That is, we test a  
model of the form p = a1x1 + a2x2 + . . . + aixi + , where p is price, xi is an exogenous vari-  
able, and ai is the corresponding coefficient. We run a linear regression using the training  
set observations. If any of the exogenous variables comes up as significant in the regression, 86  
estimating price response  
then it is possible that that variable is collinear with price and should be eliminated from the  
estimation of price response. \(More sophisticated approaches to dealing with collinearity  
are discussed in econometrics texts such as Woolridge 2015.\)  
Note that collinearity is an issue only when price is correlated with other variables in the  
model— collinearity among nonprice explanatory variables alone is not a problem. Also,  
collinearity is only a problem when the source of historical data is not the result of a rand-  
omized experiment or A /B test. When prices are assigned randomly, the link between price  
and other explanatory variables is broken and — assuming that the randomization has been  
effective — collinearity with price will not be an issue.  
4.4.2 Endogeneity  
Collinearity is an issue for price-response estimation when price is correlated with other  
explanatory variables. Endogeneity can be an issue when anticipated demand influences  
price or when both demand and price are influenced by exogenous variables not included  
in the model— so-called omitted variables. Airlines provide an excellent example of the  
phenomenon. Figure 4.4 shows the average fare and the corresponding total demand for  
45 past departures of a flight with a 100-seat aircraft assigned. A naïve reading of this data  
would be that demand for this flight does not obey the law of demand —higher prices seem  
to result in higher demand. The reality is, of course, that the pattern in Figure 4.4 results  
from the fact that airline revenue managers are good at anticipating demand and adjusting  
the price to reflect imbalances between supply and demand \(we discuss in detail how they  
do this in Chapters 8 and 9\). As a result, it is higher demand — or more precisely the an-  
ticipation of higher demand on the part of revenue managers — that is driving higher prices  
rather than vice versa.  
A \(very\) naïve approach to the data shown in Figure 4.4 would be to assume that the  
demand for the flight followed a linear price-response function d \(pt\) =D – bpt  
+ , where  
 is a mean-zero error term. Applying this model to the data in Figure 4.4 and performing

linear regression would give the nonsensical result of an upward-sloping demand curve.  
A more realistic model might include variables that represent the actions of opening and  
closing booking classes — call the vector of these variables x. The problem is not simply  
that x is omitted from the model; it is that x is omitted and it is correlated both with price  
\(because opening and closing booking classes changes the average price on the flight\) and  
with the demand on the flight \(because the revenue managers anticipate demand in mak-  
ing their decisions\). When one or more variables have been omitted and those variables  
influence both price and demand, then endogeneity is likely to confound the estimation of  
price sensitivity.  
Detecting endogeneity and deriving methods to develop estimation procedures that ac-  
count for \(or clear\) the endogeneity have been among the most active areas of econometric  
research of the last few years. The lesson for price-response estimation is that all price-  
response regressions should be tested for endogeneity. The Durbin-Wu-Hausman test is  
the most popular test and is available in most statistical packages, such as R and Stata. If sig-  
nificant endogeneity is present in the estimation, then you need to consider carefully how  
to proceed. One approach is to find and include all variables that have been omitted from  
the model and are correlated with both price and demand. However, in many cases historic  
values of these variables might not be available. Another approach is to find an instrumen-  
tal variable that is correlated with price but uncorrelated with the error term. Chapter 13  
discusses this approach to bid-response estimation in the context of customized pricing.  
Finally, the ultimate cure for endogeneity, as for collinearity, is price testing. Data from a  
properly randomized price will be free from both collinearity and endogeneity.  
4.5 UPDATING THE ESTIMATES  
The coefficients of a price-response function cannot simply be estimated once and then  
held constant for all time. Rather, the coefficients need to be updated over time in response  
to changing market and competitive conditions. Most sellers periodically update the coeffi-  
cients of their price-response functions at intervals ranging from one month to six months.  
One consideration is the number of new observations that have been received — there is no  
gain in updating when there have not been sufficient observations to lead to a statistically  
significant difference. However, it is also important to reestimate coefficients whenever a  
substantial change in market or competitive conditions has occurred. A large rise or fall  
in incremental cost or competitive prices could mean that the price of an item moves to  
a range in which customer response is very different. It is important to recognize that the  
estimation techniques described in this chapter are valid only near the range of prices in the  
historical data. For example, the estimates of the parameters for the models shown in Table  
4.4 are valid only for the range of prices in the training set — that is, \$6.45 to \$7.35. If prices  
significantly outside the test region need to be considered, then the model may not be valid.  
In this case, the seller should monitor demand carefully and reestimate price-sensitivity  
coefficients as soon as practical.  
In addition to making periodic updates, a prudent seller will continually compare actual  
demand to the predictions of his model. This approach is consistent with the closed-loop 88  
estimating price response  
pricing process shown in Figure 2.5. If the price-response model predicts that take-up in  
a particular pricing segment at the offered price should be 85% but actual take-up is only  
65%, this is a signal that the price-sensitivity coefficients for that segment should be up-  
dated. However, it can be the case that price sensitivity within a segment may change in  
a way that is not reflected in changes in take-up rate. To the extent that it is feasible, the  
most prudent approach for a seller is to perform periodic price tests to ensure that current  
estimates of elasticity are still valid and, if they are not, to reestimate the coefficients of the  
price-response function.  
4.6 DATA-FREE APPROACHES TO ESTIMATION  
The approaches to price-sensitivity estimation discussed so far rely on the existence of a  
database containing a significant amount of price and demand history. In some cases, these  
data may not be available either because the product is too new to have generated a sig-  
nificant number of observations or because there is insufficient price variation in the data  
to support estimation. In this case, it may be impossible to use data-driven approaches to  
estimate price sensitivity, and alternative, data-free approaches must be used. The most  
popular of these approaches include the following\:  
•  
•  
Surveys and focus groups\: Both surveys and focus groups can be used to elicit infor-  
mation about the importance of price relative to other aspects of a product. Both rely  
on extrapolating response from a relatively small group of customers to the entire  
population.  
Conjoint analysis\: Conjoint analysis is a systematic method for eliciting customer  
trade-offs among price, brand, and other features. Each participant in a conjoint  
study is given a series of choices between two different possible offerings with dif-  
ferent features and prices. For example, a particular choice might be “Would you  
prefer a 20-year fixed mortgage of \$100,000 at an APR of 5.5% or a 25-year \$100,000  
mortgage with an initial fixed APR of 3.5% for a year that converts to a variable-rate  
mortgage at prime plus 2% after the first year?” For each choice presented, partici-  
pants specify either which alternative they prefer or that they are indifferent between  
the two alternatives. To estimate price sensitivity, price must be included along with  
other attributes such as term, brand, and channel. The idea behind conjoint analysis  
is that, by structuring the alternatives and the sequence of choices appropriately, the  
preference structure of each participant can be determined with a relatively small  
number of questions. If a study includes a sufficient number of participants with  
backgrounds representative of the population as a whole, the results can be used  
to construct a price-response function for the entire population. Conjoint analysis  
has been widely used in designing and pricing new products across a wide range of  
industries, and there is an extensive literature on how to conduct effective conjoint  
analyses.  
Data-free approaches to price-sensitivity estimation have one important strength\: they can  
be used to elicit information about combinations of features and price that the seller has estimating price response 89  
not previously offered. This is relevant for new products and may be important if market  
conditions have changed so dramatically that past customer behavior is not a reliable pre-  
dictor of future behavior.  
However, data-free approaches have their drawbacks. Surveys are subject to response  
bias\: recipients who return a survey may not be representative of the population as a whole.  
For conjoint analyses, it may be difficult to obtain results from groups of participants who  
are both representative of the population as a whole but large enough to provide statistically  
reliable results. In addition, participants in surveys and focus groups often give the answer  
that reflects the choice they think they should make rather than the choice they actually  
would make in the real world. In many cases, they overestimate their willingness to pay for  
additional features.  
Finally, surveys and conjoint analyses typically present choices in a structured manner  
\(“How important is customer service to you in choosing an online seller?” or “Would you  
prefer product x to product y?”\) that does not necessarily reflect the way purchase deci-  
sions arise and are addressed by customers in their daily lives, in which purchase options  
are not generally evaluated in a pairwise manner. For this reason, focus groups, surveys,  
and conjoint analyses can give sellers an idea of the general level at which prices should be  
set, but optimization of the prices across a number of pricing segments typically requires a  
data-driven approach.  
4.7 SUMMARY  
•

The gold standard for estimating price response is the randomized price test. The  
goal of randomization is to isolate the effect of price on take-up by choosing test  
and control populations that are balanced in terms of all other variables that might  
influence take-up. Ensuring balance may require assigning participants to groups in  
a fashion that is not truly random.  
Many sellers find price testing to be difficult or impossible. As a result, the data used  
to estimate price response are usually derived either from \(nonrandomized\) A /B  
price tests or from natural dispersion in historical pricing, or both. This dispersion  
might result from so-called natural experiments \(accidents\), from pricing disconti-  
nuities, or from field pricing discretion.  
To fit a price-response function to a data set including prices and demands, the data  
is divided into a training set and a test set. For a particular set of candidate vari-  
ables, regression is performed using the training set. The fit of the resulting model is  
measured on the test set using measures such as root-mean-square-error and MAPE.  
Candidate models are tested by adding, transforming, combining, and removing  
predictive variables. Each time a new model is estimated, its performance on the  
test data is compared to the previous model. If the new model is more predictive, it  
becomes the new champion. This process continues until new models are no longer  
demonstrating improved performance.  
In estimating the parameters of a price-response function, we are not only inter-  
ested in the predictive accuracy of the model; we are also interested in the causal link 90  
estimating price response  
•  
between price and demand. This means that we need to ensure that the results of a  
regression exercise do not demonstrate collinearity, in which price is influenced by  
other variables in the model, or endogeneity, in which variables that influence both  
demand and price have not been included in the model.  
If historical data are not available or there is no price dispersion in historic data, then  
data-free methods such as surveys or conjoint analysis can be used. It is generally  
advisable that price testing be used to supplement these approaches moving forward  
so that price response is ultimately based on actual market observations.  
4.8 FURTHER READING  
Some of the material in this chapter was adapted from my book Pricing Credit Products  
\(2018\), which discusses the problem of estimating price response in the context of con-  
sumer lending.  
Two instructive examples of the use of the difference-in-differences \(DiD\) method in re-  
tailing are Gallino and Moreno 2014, which uses DiD to evaluate the effect of a buy-online /  
pick-up-in-store program for a retail chain, and Blake, Nosko, and Tadelis 2015, which uses  
DiD to estimate the effectiveness of online advertisement purchases.  
Many classic econometric texts on the application of regression go into detail on the  
process of linear regression as well as such topics as the treatment of collinearity and endo-  
geneity. Examples include Wooldridge 2015 and Greene 2003. A book that takes a modern,  
machine-learning-based approach to estimation is Business Data Science, by Matt Taddy  
\(2019\). Chapters 2, 5, and 6 are particularly relevant.  
Testing for endogeneity and developing estimation approaches that produce unbiased  
coefficient estimates in the presence of endogeneity has been an extremely active area of  
econometric and statistical research in the past decades. In fact, survey of the literature  
found that the treatment of endogeneity was the primary source of difference among esti-  
mates of price sensitivity in similar industries \(Bijmolt, Heerde, and Pieters 2005\). David-  
son and MacKinnon 1993 provides a particularly clear description of endogeneity testing  
and the use of instrumental variables to account for endogeneity in estimation. A good  
overview of approaches to estimation in the presence of endogeneity is found in the book  
Mostly Harmless Econometrics\: An Empiricist’s Companion, by Joshua Angrist and Jörn-  
Steffen Pischke \(2009\).

1\. The requirement that the treatment is the only difference between the test and  
control groups is enforced in medical research by the use of triple-blind trials in which the  
patient, the administering physician, and those evaluating the results do not know which  
individuals belong to which group. This prevents patients from changing their behavior  
according to whether they are receiving the treatment or the placebo. It also prevents phy-  
sicians from unconsciously providing a different level of care to a patient on the basis of  
whether that patient has been assigned to the treatment or control group. Finally, it pre-  
vents researchers from evaluating outcomes differently, depending on whether a patient  
was in the control or test group.  
2\. In this section and in the field of statistical estimation, the terms predict and predic-  
tion are used to refer to the ability of a model to fit historical data — in our case, the ability  
of our model to generate good values of historic demand dt given historical prices pt and  
historical values of exogenous values xt. This is different from the everyday use of the  
terms to refer to the ability to predict future values.

values in the data are italicized. Thus, Weekend represents the observed value of whether  
an observation occurred on a weekend or not.

A difficulty arises if take-up is equal to 1 on a particular day. In this case, r  
t = 1, and  
the left side of Equation 4.7 is undefined. In this case, it is common practice to replace the  
left side of the equation with a large positive number. 5 Optimization  
Chapter 4 introduces the concept of a price-response function, which specifies the demand  
that a seller will experience for a product at any positive price. This chapter shows how to  
use a price-response function to generate the optimal price, where optimal can mean ei-  
ther profit-maximizing or revenue-maximizing. We begin by considering the elements of  
profit, including the appropriate use of costs and ancillary revenues in maximizing profit.  
In Section 5.2, we derive conditions that must be satisfied for a price to be optimal \(again,  
we consider both revenue-maximizing and profit-maximizing prices\) and that can be used  
to calculate optimal prices. Sections 5.3 and 5.4 present conditions that guarantee that a  
unique optimal price exists and extend the optimization approach to the case when a seller  
is setting prices for multiple products simultaneously. Section 5.5 describes a data-driven  
approach to optimizing a single price — that is, an approach in which we do not assume any  
particular form for price response. Section 5.6 discusses the issue of competitive response,  
and finally, Section 5.7 shows how an efficient frontier can help a seller who is interested in  
two different objective functions — say, maximizing profit and maximizing revenue —visu-  
alize the trade-off between them.  
5.1 ELEMENTS OF CONTRIBUTION  
The goal of pricing optimization is typically to maximize total contribution, defined as in-  
cremental contribution times sales. Unit contribution is the expected incremental revenue  
from each transaction minus the expected incremental cost associated with each transac-  
tion. In the case where we are selling a single unit at a known price and we know the incre-  
mental cost associated with the unit, contribution per unit can be written as p – c, where  
p is price and c is incremental cost. Throughout the rest of the book, we typically write  
unit contribution in this form. However, in many cases, calculating the revenue and costs  
associated with a customer commitment may not be so straightforward. For example, in  
many freight industries, the customer commitment is a contract to carry all of the freight  
tendered for the next year at an agreed-on set of rates. At the time the commitment is  
made, how much freight will actually be tendered and on which lanes is unknown to both 94  
optimization  
the shipper and the carrier, and so both the revenue and the cost of service associated with  
the contract are uncertain. In this case, expected revenue and expected cost of the contract  
need to be modeled explicitly.  
Most industries are not as extreme as freight; however, in many cases, the calculation of  
the revenue and associated cost may not be entirely straightforward. This section addresses  
two particular issues in estimating contribution — calculating incremental costs and incor-  
porating ancillary revenue.  
5.1.1 Incremental Costs  
Cost seems like it should be the simplest component of pricing and revenue optimiza-  
tion. After all, a company may not know the price-response functions it faces, but surely  
it should know its costs. Unfortunately, things are not quite so simple. With any exposure  
to the field of accounting, one quickly realizes that the simple question “How much did it  
cost us to provide this product to this customer through this channel on Thursday?” does  
not have a unique well-defined answer. Rather, the cost of providing even a simple product  
depends on what the answer will be used for. As a consequence, accountants have derived  
a host of product-costing methodologies, including fully allocated costs, partially allocated  
costs, marginal costs, avoided costs, and financial costs, to name just a few.  
While each costing methodology has its place, pricing and revenue optimization deci-  
sions are based on the incremental cost of a customer commitment, where incremental cost  
is defined as follows.  
The incremental cost of a customer commitment is the difference between the total costs a  
company would experience if it makes the commitment and the total cost it would experience if  
it does not.  
Calculating incremental cost for a customer commitment depends critically on the con-  
text and nature of the commitment. Here are some examples.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
A drugstore sells bottles of shampoo and replenishes its stock weekly. Because selling  
a unit will result in an additional unit order, the incremental cost for selling a bottle  
of shampoo is the wholesale unit cost.  
An airline is considering whether to sell a single seat to a passenger on a future flight.  
The incremental cost is the additional meal and fuel cost that would be incurred  
from flying an additional passenger plus any commissions or fees the airline would  
pay for the booking.  
A retailer buys a stock of fashion goods at the beginning of the season. Once he has  
bought the goods, he cannot return them and cannot reorder. During the season he  
wants to set and update the prices that will maximize the total revenue he will receive  
from the fashion goods. Since the cost of the goods is sunk and selling a unit will not  
drive any additional future sales, his incremental cost per sale is zero.1  
A distributor is bidding for a year-long contract with a hospital to be the preferred  
provider for disposable medical supplies. From previous experience, the distributor optimization 95  
knows that this hospital is an expensive customer requiring high levels of customer  
support and having wide variances in orders and high rates of product returns. The  
expected incremental cost of the contract includes not only the expected cost of the  
items the hospital will purchase but also the expected cost of customer service, oper-  
ating costs and holding costs driven by the wide variance in orders, and the expected  
costs of returns. In this case, these costs need to be associated with the contract, but  
some of them, such as the cost of customer service, may not be specifically associated  
with any particular product.  
These examples illustrate some of the key characteristics of incremental cost. These  
characteristics can be summarized as follows.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Incremental cost is forward looking. It is based on the effect a customer commitment  
will have on future costs. Costs that have already been taken or that are driven by de-  
cisions already made prior to the customer commitment are sunk and do not enter  
into the calculation of incremental cost.  
Incremental cost is marginal. It is the expected cost of making this customer commit-  
ment. The incremental cost of making this commitment may not be the same as the  
average cost of similar commitments made in the past.  
Incremental cost is not fully allocated cost. Only costs that change as the result of a  
customer commitment are part of the incremental cost. Overhead, or fixed costs of  
staying in business, generally should not be allocated to any specific commitment. As  
a result, the incremental cost of a customer commitment is usually less than the fully  
allocated cost. Further, the sum of the incremental costs of all commitments will be  
less than the total operating cost of the company because an unallocated residual  
fixed cost will remain after all the incremental costs have been totaled.  
The elements of incremental cost can depend on the type, size, and duration of the com-  
mitment. Specifically, if the customer commitment is a multiunit order, then order-  
based or setup costs need to be allocated across all the units in the order.  
The incremental cost of a commitment can be uncertain. Trucking companies such as  
Roadway Express and Yellow Freight sell contracts to shippers. Each contract covers  
the next year and commits the trucking company to carry all the freight tendered  
by the customer at an agreed-on tariff. The incremental cost associated with one of  
these contracts is likely to be highly uncertain at the time the commitment is made.  
First, the amount, timing, and origin and destination of the freight the customer will  
tender over the next year is uncertain. In addition, the cost of moving the customer’s  
freight will depend on the freight the company will move for other customers, which  
is also uncertain. This cost will depend in part on what portion of the customer’s  
freight is backhaul business, which can utilize excess capacity on existing truck trips,  
and what portion will be headhaul freight, which will require adding new truck trips.  
In each case, the calculation of incremental cost requires understanding the nature of the  
customer commitment and then estimating the additional costs that would be generated by 96  
optimization

making the commitment — or, equivalently, the costs that would be avoided by not mak-  
ing the commitment. A simple rule of thumb is this\: If changing a price would not change a  
particular cost, then that cost should not influence the price.  
The methodology for calculating incremental costs is closely related to activity-based  
costing \(ABC\). Activity-based costing is a management accounting approach to allocat-  
ing costs to their underlying causes in order to give a clearer view of the real drivers of  
cost within an organization. In our case, the underlying cost-drivers are various aspects of  
the customer commitment. As an example, consider the hypothetical incremental cost ele-  
ments associated with the Acme Hotel shown in Table 5.1. Three categories of cost are rep-  
resented\: a transaction cost that is generated by every booking, a daily cost that depends on  
the number of days in the rental, and a commission. The commission is 15% for bookings  
through online booking platforms such as Expedia and Orbitz and 0 for bookings through  
Acme Hotel’s own website.  
Example 5.1  
Both Mr. Smith and Ms. Jones want to stay for two nights in the Acme Hotel  
with costs shown in Table 5.1. The nightly rate available to both Smith and  
Jones is \$150.00/night. Mr. Smith is booking through an online booking plat-  
form, while Ms. Jones is booking through the Acme Hotel website. The incre-  
mental cost for Mr. Smith’s two-night stay is \$31.26 + 2\(.15  \$150 + \$12.42\)  
= \$101.10, while the expected unit cost for the same rental to Ms. Jones is  
\$31.26 + 2  \$12.42 = \$56.10.  
Note that, in calculating the incremental costs, only cost elements that vary with as-  
pects of the customer stay are included. Costs such as front-desk salary and corporate over-  
head are not included because they will not change, depending on whether Mr. Smith or  
Ms. Jones makes a booking.  
5.1.2 Ancillary Products and Services  
In many industries, particularly service industries, ancillary products and services can be  
an important source of revenue. An airline passenger may also purchase a beer, a meal,  
or duty-free goods aboard her flight. Sporting events and concerts sell food, beverages,  
and “merch” \(T-shirts and other souvenirs\). Insurance is a highly profitable sideline for  
automobile sellers, rental car companies, online travel booking companies, and mortgage  
lenders. Paid warranties are very profitable add-ons to sales of automobiles, appliances, and  
consumer electronics. These additional sources of contribution from a customer above and optimization 97  
beyond the price she pays are called ancillary products or services. An ancillary product is one  
that would not be sold without the sale of the main product — thus, no one without a ticket  
to the soccer game can buy a beer in the stadium. This differentiates ancillary products  
from product complements that may be sold together but can also be sold individually,  
such as hot dogs and hot-dog buns.  
Ancillary contribution is the net contribution from sales of ancillary products or services.  
To maximize expected contribution, a revenue management company needs to include the  
estimated ancillary contribution for each booking request. This can be challenging because  
the amount of ancillary contribution that will be received from a prospective booking is  
typically unknown at the time a pricing or availability decision needs to be made.  
To incorporate ancillary contribution into revenue management, we typically use the  
expected ancillary contribution per customer, which we will label πC. If each attendee at a  
soccer match purchases, on average, 1.4 beers and the incremental contribution \(not price\)  
from each beer is \$1.00, then πC = \$1.40. The expected contribution per customer is p +  
πC  
– c. In general, higher values of πC will tend to lead to lower optimal prices — thus, an  
event that expects to make high profits from ancillary revenue should set its ticket prices  
lower\: it can make up for the lost revenue per ticket by the ancillary contribution from the  
additional customers attracted by the lower price.  
Expected ancillary contribution may vary among elements of the pricing and revenue  
optimization \(PRO\) cube, and this can provide a rationale for varying price by product, cus-  
tomer segment, and /or channel. For example, many borrowers who take out a consumer  
loan in the UK also take out insurance against defaulting on the loan because of job loss or  
injury. Insurance is highly profitable for most lenders, which means that it is a sensible tac-  
tic for lenders to offer lower prices to customer segments that the lenders have determined  
are more likely to take out insurance. As a more extreme example, hotels associated with  
casinos commonly estimate the gambling revenue that they can expect different customer  
segments to generate. They then charge lower prices \(even 0\) or provide expanded avail-  
ability to customer groups that they believe will generate high levels of gambling revenue.  
Example 5.2  
Both Mr. Smith and Ms. Jones have previously stayed in hotels in the Acme  
chain many times. The customer relationship management \(CRM\) system for  
Acme shows that Mr. Smith has never ordered room service or eaten in the  
hotel restaurant in any of his previous stays. Ms. Jones, however, has always  
ordered dinner from room service, from which the hotel makes an average  
contribution of \$15 per meal. On this basis, Acme forecasts that Mr. Smith will  
take no meals at the hotel and that Ms. Jones will order two room-service din-  
ners. In this case, referring back to Example 5.1, the total expected contribution  
from each of them would be as follows\:  
Direct  
revenue  
Expected ancillary  
contribution  
Incremental  
cost  
Expected  
contribution  
Mr. Smith \$300 0 \(\$101.10\) \$198.90  
Ms. Jones \$300 \$30 \(\$56.10\) \$273.90 98  
optimization  
In Example 5.2, incorporating expected ancillary contribution and incremental cost into  
the calculation reveals that Ms. Jones is expected to be about 38% more profitable than  
Mr. Smith, even though they are paying the same room rate. The hotel operator could make  
use of this information by providing a coupon for Ms. Jones for a lower rate. Alternatively,  
if there is only one remaining room available at the property, a profit-maximizing hotelier  
would prefer to provide availability to Ms. Jones rather than Mr. Smith. Thus, revenue  
management decisions such as those discussed in Chapter 8 should be based on maximiz-  
ing expected contribution.  
While ancillary revenue is important in some applications, it is not explicitly included in  
most of the calculations that follow. However, in cases where expected ancillary contribu-  
tion can be significant, the contribution term p – c should be understood as including the  
additional term πc, representing expected ancillary contribution.  
5.2 THE BASIC PRICE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM  
The difference between the price at which a product is sold and its incremental cost is called  
its unit margin. The sum of the margins of all products sold during a time period is called  
the total contribution. We denote the total contribution achieved at a price p by Π\(p\). In  
most cases, the seller’s goal is to maximize total contribution. The unit margin from a prod-  
uct priced at p is m\(p\) = p – c, where m\(p\) is unit margin and c is incremental cost. The basic  
single-price optimization problem is  
max \( \) \( \) \( \).  
Π p p – c d p=  
\(5.1\)  
p  
The fundamental trade-off faced by the seller seeking to maximize total contribution is il-  
lustrated in Figure 5.1. If the seller’s price is equal to incremental cost, his total contribution  
will be 0. As the seller increases the price from c, unit margin increases faster than demand  
decreases so that total contribution increases. At some price, the rate at which demand

decreases balances the rate at which unit margin increases — this is the price that maxi-  
mizes expected total contribution. In most cases, the total-contribution function Π\(p\) is  
hill shaped, with a single peak, as shown in Figure 5.1. The top of this peak is the maximum  
total contribution the supplier can realize in the current time period, and p\* is the price  
that maximizes the total contribution. Note the fundamental lack of symmetry in the total-  
contribution curve\: The supplier can lose money by pricing too low \(below incremental  
cost\), but he cannot lose money by pricing too high — the worst that can happen is demand  
gets driven to zero. This means that a risk-averse seller would tend to overprice.  
5.2.1 Optimality Conditions  
The problem in Equation 5.1 is an unconstrained optimization problem, and standard op-  
timization theory tells us that the maximum will occur at the price for which the derivative  
of Π\(p\) is equal to 0. The derivative of Π\(p\) with respect to price is  
Π'\(p\) = d'\(p\)\(p – c\) + d\(p\). \(5.2\)  
To find the price that maximizes total contribution, we set Π'\(p\) = 0, or  
d'\(p\)\(p – c\) + d\(p\) = 0.  
Thus, to maximize total contribution, p\* must satisfy  
d\(p\*\) = –d'\(p\*\)\(p\* – c\). \(5.3\)  
We can also establish conditions for a price to maximize total revenue, defined by  
R\(p\)  
=  
pd\(p\) Let p ˆ denote the price that maximizes expected revenue; then the equivalent  
condition to Equation 5.3 for the revenue-maximizing price is  
d\(p  
ˆ \) = –d'\(p  
ˆ \)p  
ˆ  
. \(5.4\)  
Equation 5.4 implies that the price that maximizes revenue is the same as the price that  
maximizes total contribution if costs were set to 0. This means maximizing revenue is  
equivalent to maximizing profit in industries in which incremental costs are either zero or  
very close to zero. This includes some service industries such as movie theaters or sporting  
events, as well as television and online advertising. Incremental costs are zero \(or at least  
very small\) in many cases in which a company has already purchased a fixed amount of  
nonreplenishable inventory, such as in the case of fashion-goods retailers, who purchase  
inventory for an entire season at one time. Once the inventory has been purchased, the  
incremental cost of a sale is zero — and the seller should set a price that maximizes revenue  
from his fixed stock of inventory.  
Example 5.3  
A widget maker is looking to set the price of widgets for the current month. His  
unit cost is \$5.00 per widget and his demand for the current month is governed  
by the linear price-response function d\(p\) = \(10,000 – 800p\)+. \(Recall that the  
notation \(x\)+ indicates the maximum of 0 and x.\) In this case, d'\(p\) = – 800. 100  
optimization  
Substituting into the condition 5.3, we obtain the condition on the optimal  
price that \(10,000 – 800p\*\)+ = 800\(p\* – \$5.00\), which means that p\* = \$8.75.  
At the optimal price, total widget sales will be 3,000 and total contribution will  
be \$11,250. If the widget maker were looking to maximize revenue, he would  
choose the price p  
ˆ such that \(10,000 – 800p  
ˆ \)+ = 800p ˆ or p ˆ = \$6.25 with cor-  
responding sales of 5,000 and revenue of \$31,250.  
Conditions 5.3 and 5.4 can be used to define three conditions that can be used to find  
profit-maximizing and revenue-maximizing prices.  
Marginal revenue equals marginal cost. We can rewrite Equation 5.3 as  
p\* d'\(p\*\) + d\(p\*\) = cd'\(p\*\). \(5.5\)  
The term on the left-hand side of Equation 5.5 is marginal revenue— the derivative of total  
revenue with respect to price. This is the rate at which revenue changes as price increases.  
Typically, marginal revenue is greater than zero at low prices but less than zero at higher  
prices. The term on the right-hand side of Equation 5.5 is marginal cost\: the rate at which  
cost is changing with price. Note that marginal cost is always less than or equal to zero — an  
increase in price results in lower demand, which in turn leads to lower total costs. Equa-  
tion 5.5 is a mathematical expression of the well-known principle that total contribution is  
maximized when marginal revenue equals marginal cost.  
The equivalent condition for revenue maximization is total revenue is maximized when  
marginal revenue equals zero. This makes sense — as we increase price from zero, total rev-  
enue initially increases with price, implying that marginal revenue is positive. However,  
at some point, demand begins to decrease at a rate such that total revenue will decrease as  
price is increased. The point at which revenue stops increasing and begins to decrease is the  
point of maximum revenue and the point at which marginal revenue equals 0.  
Figure 5.2 shows the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves for the widget maker in  
Example 5.3. Marginal revenue decreases linearly. Marginal cost is constant at − \$4,000. The  
contribution-maximizing price lies where these two curves cross—in this case at p\*  
=  
\$8.75.

case at p  
ˆ = \$6.25.  
Equation 5.5 provides further useful guidance on price changes that could improve total  
contribution. If marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost, then the seller can increase  
his contribution by increasing price. If, on the other hand, marginal revenue is lower than  
marginal cost, he should decrease his price to increase contribution.  
Hazard rate equals inverse margin. Equation 5.5 can be rearranged as –d'\(p\*\) /d\(p\*\) =  
1/\(p\* – c\). Recalling that –d'\(p\*\) /d\(p\*\) = h\(p\), where h\(p\) is the hazard rate associated with  
the price-response function, we find that the contribution-maximizing price satisfies  
1  
=  
h\( \( \)  
p\*\) p\* – c  
.  
\(5.6\)  
Stating that in words, at the contribution-maximizing price, the hazard rate is equal to the  
inverse margin. The equivalent condition for revenue maximization is  
h\( ˆ  
p\)  
=  
1  
ˆ ,  
p  
which means that at the revenue-maximizing price, the hazard rate is equal to the inverse  
price.  
Elasticity equals inverse unit margin. Recall from Section 3.2.3 that elasticity is equal to  
price times hazard rate; that is, \(p\)= h\(p\)p. We can derive an elasticity-based condition for  
contribution maximization by multiplying both sides of Equation 5.6 by p\*, which gives us  
p\*\)= p\*  
ε \( \(  
p\* – c\)  
.  
\(5.7\)  
In words, at the contribution-maximizing price, the elasticity is equal to the inverse unit mar-  
gin rate, where unit margin rate is defined as the unit margin as a fraction of total price.2  
Equation 5.7 can be rearranged to derive another formula for the optimal price\:

Equation 5.8 can be used to calculate the optimal price when both the elasticity and the  
incremental cost are known.  
Example 5.4  
A seller faces a constant-elasticity price-response function with an elasticity of  
5 and his cost is \$3.00. This means that his profit-maximizing price is given by  


The equivalent condition for revenue maximization is  
\(p  
ˆ \) = 1, \(5.9\)  
which means that, at the revenue-maximizing price, the elasticity is equal to 1. 102  
optimization  
5.2.2 Price Elasticity and Profitability  
We pause to consider the implications of the relationship between price elasticity and unit  
margin specified in Equation 5.7. Equation 5.7 can be used to estimate the implicit elastic-  
ity— that is, the belief that a seller must have about the elasticity of his price response if he  
believes that his current price is maximizing expected profit.  
Example 5.5  
A seller believes he is pricing optimally, and his unit margin rate is 20%. This  
can only be true if the elasticity at his current price is equal to 5.  
Imputed price elasticity can serve as a reality check on the credibility of a company’s cur-  
rent pricing.  
An extremely important implication of Equation 5.7 is that higher unit margin rates are  
associated with products that have lower price elasticity.  
Example 5.6  
Norton’s Salt is an extremely common brand of table salt sold in bulk in gro-  
cery stores. The unit cost for Norton’s Salt is \$1.50 per one-pound container  
and it has a price elasticity of 6. La Cloque Rouge Fleur du Sel is a specialty  
salt harvested by hand from certain salt ponds in the south of France and sold  
in fancy packaging for use in gourmet cooking. The unit cost for La Cloque  
Rouge is \$4.20 per one-pound package and it has a price elasticity of 1.5. The  
contribution-maximizing price for Norton’s is 6  
5  \$1.50 = \$1.80, and the con-  
.  
tribution-maximizing price for La Cloque Rouge is 1 5  
 \$4.20 = \$12.60. Thus,  
.  
5  
the unit margin is \$0.30 per pound for Norton’s and \$8.40 per pound for La  
Cloque Rouge.  
Example 5.6 illustrates the importance of price elasticity in determining unit margin. In  
general, high elasticity is associated with highly commoditized products, which have easy  
substitution and lots of competition. These products will have low unit margin rates, which  
means that they typically need to be sold in large volumes to cover fixed production costs  
and cost of capital. Low elasticity is associated with highly specialized or unique products  
and services, luxury products, and less competitive markets. These products will typically  
demonstrate higher unit margin rates, which means that they can profitably be produced in  
lower volumes. The primary job of marketing and branding can be described as seeking to  
lower price elasticity by creating product differentiation. In the example, La Cloque Rouge  
may be chemically indistinguishable from Norton’s \(or not\), but its branding, market po-  
sitioning, and packaging have distinguished it to the extent that it enjoys a much lower  
elasticity and, hence, can command a higher unit margin.  
5.3 EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS OF OPTIMAL PRICES  
We have shown that a profit-maximizing price can be determined by solving any one of  
the optimality conditions in Section 5.2.1 for the value of p\*. However, we have not shown optimization 103  
that such a price actually exists. We have also not shown that, if such a price does exist, it  
is unique — if hundreds of different prices satisfy one of the optimality conditions, then  
that condition is not very useful. In addition, as those who remember their calculus will  
realize, a price that satisfies the first-order conditions is not necessarily a maximizer; it  
could be a point that minimizes profit \(or more rarely an inflection point in which profit is  
neither maximized nor minimized\). This section presents conditions under which a price  
that meets the optimality conditions listed in Section 5.2.1 will be the price that uniquely  
maximizes profit.  
For what follows, we assume three additional properties of price-response functions in  
addition to the three specified in Section 3.1.2.  
1\. 2. 3. Differentiable. The price-response function has a unique derivative at each point.  
Increasing elasticity. Elasticity increases \(or is constant\) with increasing price.  
Elasticity greater than 1. Elasticity exceeds 1 for some finite price.  
Of these conditions, number 2 may seem the least obvious; however, it is a property of  
all commonly used price-response functions as well as a real-world phenomenon. You can  
confirm that all of the price-response functions in Table 3.3 have elasticities that increase  
with price — except for the constant-elasticity function, which has the same elasticity at  
every price. The intuitive reason that elasticity should increase with price is that demand  
decreases as price gets higher so that a small change in price has a much larger percentage  
impact at a high price than at a low price.3  
Finally, we require that the elasticity is greater than 1 for some price. This eliminates the  
case in which elasticity increases with price but never exceeds 1. In this case, as discussed  
above, the seller could always increase both revenue and profit by increasing his price. Since  
this is unrealistic, it must be the case that elasticity exceeds 1 for some price and thus, since  
elasticity is an increasing function of price, it will exceed 1 for all prices greater than that.  
We can now make some statements about existence and uniqueness of optimal prices. If  
properties 1–3 above hold for a price-response function that also obeys the four conditions listed  
in Section 3.1.2 and unit cost is greater than or equal to zero, then  
1\. There exist unique profit-maximizing and revenue-maximizing prices p\* and p ˆ with  
2\. ˆ  
p\*  p  
.  
The profit-maximizing price p\* satisfies p\*  c so that the seller does not realize nega-  
tive contribution at the profit-maximizing price.  
These statements can be proved mathematically, but they can also be seen clearly in Figure  
5.3\. Elasticity is a continuous, increasing function of price denoted by \(p\). The revenue-  
maximizing price p  
ˆ occurs where the elasticity is equal to 1. In the figure, this occurs where  
the elasticity curve intersects 1. The intersection of the elasticity curve with \(p – c\) /p occurs  
when \(p\) = \(p – c\) /p, which, according to condition 5.7, occurs at the profit-maximizing  
price p\*. It is clear that, for any nonincreasing elasticity curve, there must be one and only  
one intersection between the elasticity curve and each of the two downward sloping curves,  
which demonstrates the existence and uniqueness of the two prices p ˆ and p\*. 104

Existence and uniqueness of the revenue-maximizing price p  
ˆ and contribution-  
It is also obvious from Figure 5.3 that the intersection of the elasticity curve with \(p –  
c\) /p must occur at a price p\* \> c . This means that the unit margin at the profit-­ maximizing  
price is greater than or equal to 0. Furthermore, \(p – c\) /p  1, which means that the reve-  
nue-maximizing price will be less than or equal to the profit-maximizing price, with equal-  
ity occurring only in the case that c = 0. Note that the revenue-maximizing price may be less  
than the unit cost \(as it is in Figure 5.3\), in which case a revenue-maximizing seller would  
lose money on each sale.  
One way to check the optimality of p\* is to use the marginality test, which states that a  
particular price is maximizing contribution only if raising the price by a penny or lowering  
the price by a penny results in reduced contribution. The principle of marginality should  
be fairly intuitive — if we could increase contribution by changing the price, then the cur-  
rent price would not be optimal—but it is a useful check nonetheless. Table 5.2 shows the  
results of varying the price in Example 5.3 from \$8.74 to \$8.76. As expected, the price of  
\$8.75 results in the highest margin of the three alternatives. However, the pattern of change  
among the prices is instructive\: At \$8.74 we are selling eight more units per month, but  
this is not enough to make up for the lost margin per unit. At \$8.76 we are making a penny  
more per unit sold, but this is offset by the loss of sales of eight units. The optimal price,  
\$8.75, exactly balances the gain in units sold from the potential loss of margin from raising  
prices further. optimization 105

5.4 OPTIMIZATION WITH MULTIPLE PRICES  
The optimality conditions presented in Section 5.2.1 pertain to a seller selling a single prod-  
uct. Of course, in many cases, a seller will be setting prices for many products, representing  
multiple cells in the PRO cube. If demand for products is independent, then the seller can  
set the price for each product independently using any one of the approaches described so  
far. However, in many cases, product demands will not be independent — some products  
may be substitutes for each other, and some may be complements. In this case, the optimal  
price for a particular product will depend on the prices of other products, and optimal  
prices for different products cannot be calculated independently.  
Assume that a seller is setting n prices given by the vector p = \(p1, p2, . . . , pn\) and demand  
mappings such that di\(p\) is the demand for product i as a function of the entire price vec-  
tor p. Then the profit optimization problem is to find the vector of prices that solves the

is the incremental cost of product i. Lower bounds are required because an unconstrained  
optimum might result in some prices that are substantially lower than cost, or even less  
than 0. Note that the demand for each product depends not only on its own price but also  
on the price of all other products.

If the price of product i does not influence the demand for any product other than itself,  
then Vi\(p\*\) = 0 and Equation 5.10 reduces to Equation 5.3. In this case, the optimal price  
of product i can be found independently of the prices of any other products using methods  
described above. If Vi\(p\*\) \> 0, it means that, as a whole, product i has more complements  
than substitutes and its price should be lower than its independent optimal price because its  
sales stimulate other sales. If Vi\(p\*\) \< 0, then substitution dominates complementarity and  
the optimal price of product i is higher than its individual optimal price. The idea is that, as  
we raise the price, some of the loss from lost sales is recaptured through sales of substitutes.  
The problem of setting optimal prices in the face of substitutes and complements re-  
quires finding the values pi  
\* of that simultaneously satisfy Equation 5.10 for all i. This can be  
a complex undertaking, but I propose an iterative algorithm that can be used if we know all  
elasticities and cross-derivatives.

If complementary and substitution effects are not too strong \(as is usually the case\), the

number of obvious implementation challenges, notably its assumption that we know not  
only own-price elasticity but the cross-price derivatives for all combinations of products.  
5.5 A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO PRICE OPTIMIZATION  
Applying the optimality conditions described in Section 5.2.1 to find the profit-maximizing  
or contribution-maximizing prices requires that we know the price-response function for  
a product. This is a strong requirement. Assume that we know nothing about the price-  
response function for a product, except that it satisfies the conditions listed in Section 5.2.1.  
Furthermore, we assume that the following two additional conditions hold\:  
1\. 2. We are able to test the demand response at different prices.  
The product sells sufficiently rapidly that we can quickly observe demand respond-  
ing to different prices. optimization 107

Regions for raising, lowering, and holding price in the learning-and-earning  
Figure 5.4 algorithm.  
In this case, we can use a multi-armed bandit approach to determine the optimal price that  
maximizes a given objective function. This is a test-and-learn \(or learning-and-earning\)  
approach in which we observe the payoff from different decisions — in this case, different  
prices — and gradually favor the prices that generate the highest total contribution. \(More  
details on multi-armed bandit approaches are given in Appendix B.\)  
To see how this approach can be used to update prices for a seller who seeks to maximize  
profit, consider Figure 5.4, which graphs elasticity \(p\) and the inverse unit margin curve  
p/\(p – c\) for some product for every p  c. As in Figure 5.3, the unique profit-maximizing  
price is where the two curves cross. Note that, if p/\(p – c\) \> \(p\), then p \< p\*, and we could  
move closer to the optimal price \(and increase profitability\) by increasing the price. If p/  
\(p – c\) \< \(p\), then the current price is too high, and we could move closer to the optimal  
price by lowering the price.  
The seller does not know the price-response function and thus does not know the elas-  
ticity at any price. However, he has the capability to set different prices and observe demand  
at those prices. This suggests the following approach to finding the optimal price.

ˆ\(pk\)| \< , then pk is close to p\*.  
Stop the algorithm and set the price to pk.  
b. If \(pk – c\) / pk – 

k ← k + 1 and go to step 2.  
c. If   
ˆ\(pk\) – \(pk – c\) / pk \> , the current price is too high. Set pk+1 ← pk –  and  
k ← k + 1 and go to step 2.  
The learning-and-earning algorithm described above has the great advantage that it  
makes no assumption about the functional form of the price-response function. Rather, it  
estimates the elasticity at the current price and determines whether to raise the price, lower  
the price, or hold the price the same. While it does not require a form for the price-response  
function, it does require that the following values be specified\:  
•  
•  
•  
 is the distance between prices that are being tested to estimate elasticity.  
 is the stopping condition — the difference between the estimated elasticity and the  
inverse unit margin.  
 is the amount by which the price is adjusted if the elasticity is not sufficiently close  
to the inverse unit margin.  
These values are called hyperparameters and they determine how quickly \(and if at all\) the  
approach will converge to the optimal price. For example, if  is set too small, the price  
will approach the optimal price very slowly —which means that a lot of time will be spent  
learning rather than earning. However, if  is set too large, the price may not converge at  
all\: it may bounce back and forth between a price that is below the optimum and one that  
is above the optimum. For this reason, it is usually ideal to reduce  from iteration to itera-  
tion so that the steps get smaller over time. One common approach is to set  as the initial  
step size and then set the step size on iteration k according to k  
= /k. \(More details can be  
found in Sutton and Barto 2018, sec. 2.5.\) In general, setting and updating hyperparameters  
involves quite a bit of tuning — starting with plausible values and adjusting with experience  
to improve performance.  
In theory, the data-driven algorithm would be run once until it converged to an optimal  
price, which would then remain in place forever. A finite period of learning would be fol-  
lowed by an infinite future of earning. However, things are rarely that simple. In reality, it is  
likely that the price-response function \(and hence the local elasticity\) will change over time.  
Reasons for change include competitive actions, seasonality, life-cycle changes, introduc-  
tion of substitutes, and changes in consumer tastes, among other factors. With such events,  
the current price is likely to be no longer optimal. The most common cure for this issue is  
to initiate testing for a price that is believed to be optimal with some small probability in optimization 109  
each period. If elasticities have changed, then initiate the learning-and-earning algorithm  
for price optimization again to determine the optimal price under the new conditions.  
5.6 COMPETITIVE RESPONSE AND OPTIMIZATION  
Chapter 4 shows that if we have access to competitive prices, we can incorporate them in  
price-response estimation. However, this would seem to take us only partway to nirvana.  
After all, if we are taking competitive prices into account in setting our prices, we should  
anticipate that our competitors will take our price into account when they set their prices. If  
we drop a price, we should anticipate the possibility that competitors will match it, possibly  
erasing much of the additional demand we might otherwise expect. The results of chang-  
ing a price would certainly be different, depending on whether our competitors decided to  
match it.  
Attempts to predict competitive response and incorporate it into current pricing deci-  
sions generally fall within the realm of game theory, and there is a vast literature on the  
application of game theory to pricing. While game theory is an important tool in strategic  
pricing, it is less relevant to the tactical decisions of pricing and revenue optimization. Most  
pricing and revenue optimization systems do not seek to forecast competitive response  
and incorporate it explicitly into their recommendations. There are many reasons for this,  
but I believe that one is particularly important\: pricing and revenue optimization is based  
on playing the best response \(i.e., finding the expected contribution-maximizing price\) to  
whatever the competitors are currently doing. Theoretical examinations of markets find  
that this is almost always a good thing to do and often the best possible action. For example,  
if price response in a market is well modeled by a multinomial logit function and sellers all  
set their prices to maximize profit based on the prices set by others, the market will con-  
verge to a unique set of equilibrium prices for all sellers. Game theory is not required in this  
case to determine the profit-maximizing price for any seller \(Gallego et al. 2006\).  
The philosophy of pricing and revenue optimization is to make money by many small  
adjustments, searching for and exploiting many small and transient opportunities of profit  
as they appear in the marketplace. It is about making a little more money from each trans-  
action. It is not about finding the great pricing move that will stagger the competition.  
Many of the price adjustments called for by pricing and revenue optimization are likely to  
fall below the radar screen of the competition and may not trigger any explicit response  
whatsoever. Furthermore, if competitors respond to our prices in the future as they have  
in the past, the price-response functions estimated according to the methods described in  
Chapter 4 will already incorporate the response of competitors.  
This does not mean that competitive response need never be considered in pricing. The  
potential competitive responses to major bet-the-company bids or substantial changes in  
pricing strategy need to be carefully considered. For example, in the early 1990s, Hertz Rent-  
a-Car initiated the use of a sophisticated pricing optimization system. Previously Hertz, like  
other national car rental companies, had changed prices only rarely. Whenever one of the  
companies dropped a price, the others were likely to follow immediately — often with even  
larger drops — precipitating an industry-wide fare war. Hertz took great pains to commu- 110  
optimization  
nicate to the industry that its new system would be changing prices much more commonly  
than before — some prices would go up, some would go down, but all would change much  
more frequently. The communication was successful\: Hertz was able to initiate its revenue  
management program without inciting retaliatory price wars. Once Hertz initiated revenue  
management, it was able to generate additional revenue through thousands of small adjust-  
ments to prices that its competitors were unable to match.  
Similarly, online pricing enables much more rapid access to competitive prices via  
scraping competitor websites. For a third-party seller on Amazon, there is great value to  
winning the buy box, or becoming a featured offer. However, in most cases a seller can only  
win the buy box if he offers the lowest price \(or at least matches the lowest price\) for an  
item. Because winning the buy box is effective in driving sales, sellers are inspired to match  
\(or undercut\) other sellers, which can leading to pricing dynamics that drive the price to a  
floor. Once the price has reached the floor, it is costly for a seller to raise his price and risk  
losing the buy box. This situation is similar to a classical Bertrand game, in which two sell-  
ers competing to sell an identical item in a marketplace are both forced to lower their price  
to just above marginal cost.4  
5.7 OPTIMIZATION WITH MULTIPLE OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS  
In many cases, sellers are not interested in only a single objective. Many times a manager with  
profit and loss responsibility has been enjoined to maximize both profitability and market  
share. However, the optimization approaches that we have considered so far in this section  
can only deal with a single objective function\: either maximize profit or maximize revenue.  
As we have seen, in most cases doing both simultaneously is not possible—the price that  
maximizes profit is not the one that will maximize revenue and vice versa, except in the  
special case in which incremental cost is zero. In this section, we discuss how a seller can un-  
derstand the trade-offs between different objective functions and incorporate them into de-  
cision making. We use the example of maximizing revenue versus maximizing profit, but the  
same concepts can be used for any two competing objectives such as profit and market share.  
Example 5.7  
The CEO of the widget-making company in Example 5.3 decides that the firm’s  
goal for the next month will be to maximize revenue from widget sales as part  
of the long-term strategy to increase market share. The revenue-maximizing  
price can be found by solving Equation 5.4. The resulting revenue-maximizing  
price is equal to \$6.25, with corresponding sales of 5,000 units and revenue of  
\$31,250. The corresponding per-unit margin is \$1.25, and the total-contribu-  
tion margin is 5,000 × \$1.25 = \$6,250. We can compare this to the maximum  
margin contribution of \$11,250 and conclude that to maximize total revenue,  
the company needs to give up \$11,250 – \$6,250 = \$5,000 of contribution mar-  
gin to gain \$5,000 in additional revenue.  
The decision that management needs to make in Example 5.7 is whether it is worth  
giving up a total contribution of \$5,000 per month to buy an additional 2,000 units of optimization 111

­ demand. While this trade-off is clear, it may be that management is interested in some  
goal other than pure profit maximization or pure revenue maximization. Figure 5.5 shows  
how profit and revenue change as a function of price for an example seller. In this figure,  
revenue is maximized at the price p ˆ = \$4.00 and profit is maximized at the price p\* = \$6.00,  
with p ˆ  p\*. \(Recall that the two prices will be equal only if the incremental cost is zero.\)  
Now, assume that the seller is interested in both revenue and profit. Then, as evident from  
Figure 5.5, he would only consider prices in the interval between p ˆ and p\*. For prices below  
p ˆ , he could increase both revenue and profit by increasing price. For prices above p\*, he  
could increase both revenue and profit by decreasing price. Thus, if profit and revenue are  
the only two goals he is interested in, he would only consider prices greater than p ˆ and less  
than p\*.  
This leaves open the question of which price in the range \[p ˆ , p\*\] he should choose. If the  
seller knows his trade-off between profit and revenue, then it is straightforward to accom-  
modate this trade-off. Let us say, for example, that he is willing to give up \$1.00 in profit in  
order to drive an additional \$5.00 in sales. This trade-off could reflect management’s judg-  
ment about how the stock market values growth relative to profit in determining his share  
price. In this case, he would seek to maximize R\(p\) + 5Π\(p\), where R\(p\) and Π\(p\) are rev-  
enue and profit, respectively, at price p. More generally, let us assume that the seller’s trade-  
off is \$1 of profit in order to gain dollars of revenue. We call α the seller’s ­ revenue-profit  
trade-off. The seller is seeking to maximize the objective function pd\(p\) + αd\(p\)\(p – c\),  
which is equivalent to maximizing d\(p\)\[\(1 + α\)p – αc\]. This means that we can write his  
objective function as  
  


  

This means that the seller can find the price that satisfies his revenue-profit trade-off by  


  

cares only about revenue, and he acts as if his unit cost is zero. As α → , the seller cares  
only about maximizing expected profit. 112  
optimization  
\*  
Example 5.8  
The widget maker in Example 5.3, with a unit cost of \$5.00 and facing the  
price-response function of d\(p\) = \(10,000 – 800p\)+, decides that he has a  
­ revenue-profit trade-off of 10; that is, he would be willing to forgo \$1 of profit  
to gain \$10 in revenue. In this case, he can determine the corresponding opti-  
mal price by setting d\(p\) = \(10,000 – 800p\)+ = 800\[p –  
  
10  
    
11  
  \$5.00\], which gives  
p = \$8.52. The corresponding revenue is \$27,127.68 and the total contribution  
is \$11,207.68.  
If a seller knows his revenue-profit trade-off, then he can use any of the optimal price cri-  
teria listed in Section 5.2.1, substituting the modified cost for the actual cost. For example,  
the optimal price with a revenue-profit trade-off of α must satisfy the condition

\( \*\)  
p p  
=  
\* – \[

Note that when α = 0, Equation 5.11 becomes the revenue-maximizing condition in Equa-  
tion 5.9, and as α approaches infinity, it approaches the profit-maximizing condition in  
Equation 5.7. Furthermore, both the direct optimization approach and the data-driven ap-  
proach described in Section 5.5 can easily be adapted to work with the modified cost in  
order to find the price that achieves the desired trade-off.  
The methods above can be used by a seller to determine the price that meets his revenue-  
profit trade-off assuming that he can quantify that trade-off. In many cases, a seller cannot  
provide a value for his revenue-profit trade-off. In this case, an efficient frontier can help the  
seller visualize the potential trade-offs between revenue and profit. An efficient frontier,  
such as the one shown in Figure 5.6, shows all of the possible combinations of revenue and  
profit \(or any two other objectives\) that a seller could achieve by varying the price of an item.  
Let R\(p\) and Π\(p\) denote the revenue and profit, respectively, realized at price p. The dotted

The rightmost point on the solid part of the curve represents the maximum revenue that can  
be achieved and the corresponding profit\: it is the point \(R\(p  
ˆ \), Π\(p  
ˆ \)\).The leftmost point on  
the solid part of the curve represents the maximum contribution that can be achieved and  
the corresponding revenue\: it is the point \(R\(p\*\), Π\(p\*\)\). The solid curve connecting these  
two points is the efficient frontier, which consists of the only achievable combinations of  
profit and revenue that the firm would consider. The dashed points represent combinations  
of profit and revenue that the seller could achieve at some price, but in every case there is a  
price on the efficient frontier that generates both more profit and more revenue.  
The efficient frontier is a convenient and frequently used approach to help visualize the  
trade-offs involved in pricing. In the case of a single price, the efficient frontier can be gen-  
erated by starting at the revenue-maximizing price and calculating both profit and revenue  
for prices at regular intervals up to the profit-maximizing price . These can then be graphed  
to generate an efficient frontier.  
Example 5.9  
A seller has an incremental cost of \$4.00 and faces a linear price-response func-

his profit-maximizing price is \$8.00. Revenue and profit for each price at \$0.10  
intervals between \$6.00 and \$8.00 are shown in Table 5.3. Plotting these out  
gives the efficient frontier shown in Figure 5.6.  
The situation is more interesting when we consider two or more products. In the case  
of multiple products, the feasible set of revenue and profit combinations is a region rather  
than a curve as in the example of a single price. An example is shown in Figure 5.7. In this

figure, the shaded area is the set of feasible revenue and profit combinations — that is, the  
combinations of revenue and profit that could be achieved by setting different prices for  
two different products. In fact, it is only points on the boundary of the feasible region that  
are of interest to a seller who cares only about revenue and profit. To see this, consider a  
seller whose current set of prices results in the revenue and profit combination represented  
by point A in Figure 5.7. This seller could realize the same revenue but higher profit by set-  
ting the prices that result in the revenue and profit combination at point B. Alternatively,  
the seller could realize the same profit but more revenue by pricing at point C. Finally,  
the seller could realize more revenue and more profit by pricing at one of the points on  
the boundary of the frontier between B and C. In any case, a seller who cared only about  
revenue and profit would not \(knowingly\) set prices that resulted in the revenue and profit  
combination at point A.  
In the case of multiple products, the efficient frontier is the set of undominated revenue  
and pricing pairs, which means that for a price on the efficient frontier, additional profit  
can be achieved only by reducing revenue and vice versa. Points not on the efficient frontier  
are dominated, which means that either one or both of profit and revenue can be increased  
without decreasing the other. Let p = \(p1, p2, . . . , pn\) denote the vector of prices offered by  
the seller. Then, in Figure 5.7, point D corresponds to the revenue and profit achieved at the  
profit-maximizing set of prices — that is, \(R\(p\*\), Π\(p\*\)\). Point E is the revenue and profit  
combination achieved at the revenue-maximizing price, \(R\(p ˆ \), Π\(p ˆ \)\). The boundary of  
the feasible region between these points is the efficient frontier.  
As in the case of a single price, the multiprice efficient frontier can help a seller visualize  
the trade-off between revenue and profit that he faces and can help him choose accordingly.  
In fact, the slope of the tangent line to the efficient frontier at a point is the ratio between  
incremental revenue and incremental profit at that point. Thus, in Figure 5.8, line A has a  
slope of about 0.33. This means that a seller choosing point D values an additional dollar of  
profit about 3 times as much as an additional dollar of revenue. The slope of line B is about  
2.5, which means that a seller choosing point E values each additional dollar of profit only  
about 1/2.5 or 40% of the value of an additional dollar of revenue. optimization 115

Points on the efficient frontier that might be chosen by two different sellers.  
There are two ways in which the efficient frontier can be calculated with multiple prices.  
The first is to solve the optimization problem with an objective function of maximizing  
αR\(p\) + \(1 – α\)Π\(p\), where 0  α  1 is a parameter that determines the trade-off between  
incremental profit and incremental revenue. To trace out the efficient frontier, the seller  
could solve the optimization problem αR\(p\) + \(1 – α\)Π\(p\) for different values of α— say,  
α = \(0, .1, .2, . . . , .9, 1.0\)— and then plot the results. The points plotted will be points on  
the efficient frontier such as the one in Figure 5.8.  
An alternative is to maximize profit with different revenue constraints. The idea would be  
to first maximize revenue and profit to determine both the profit- and revenue-­ maximizing  
vectors of prices \(p\* and p ˆ , respectively\) and the profit and revenue corresponding to each  
ˆ  
vector of prices. Then the maximum revenue that the seller can achieve is R  
= R\(pˆ\), and  
ˆ  
the revenue he would achieve at the profit-maximizing price is R\* = R\(p\*\) \< R  
. The seller  
ˆ  
would then choose n equally spaced values of revenue between R\* and R  
, where the ith  
  
value of revenue is given by Ri = R\* + i

supplier would solve the optimization problem  
Maximize Π\(p\),  
subject to R\(p\)  Ri  
.  
The resulting values of Π\(p\) and R\(p\) are points on the efficient frontier.  
5.8 SUMMARY  
•  
The cost used in pricing and revenue optimization is the incremental cost of a cus-  
tomer commitment. It is the difference between the total costs a company would  
incur from satisfying the commitment versus not making it. The incremental cost  
will vary with the duration and size of the commitment and is not a fully allocated  
cost. A rule of thumb is that if a change in demand resulting from a change in price 116  
optimization  
would not change the cost, then the cost should not be included in determining the

maximizer\:  
For a single product, the following are equivalent conditions for a price to be a profit  
•  
Marginal revenue equals marginal cost.  
•  
The derivative of total contribution with respect to price is zero.  
•  
The hazard rate equals the inverse unit margin.  
•  
Elasticity equals the inverse unit margin.  
For a single product, the revenue-maximizing price is always less than or equal to  
the profit-maximizing price. They are only equal if the unit cost is equal to zero. The  
following are equivalent conditions for a price to be revenue maximizing\:  
•  
Marginal revenue equals zero.  
•  
The derivative of revenue with respect to price is zero.  
•  
The hazard rate equals the inverse of price.  
•  
Elasticity equals one.  
Assume that the price-response function for a single product satisfies the following  
conditions\:  
•  
•  
It is decreasing in price.  
It is continuous.  
•  
It is differentiable.  
•  
It has elasticity that increases with price.  
•  
It has elasticity greater than 1 for some finite price.  
Then there exists a unique profit-maximizing price that is greater than the unit cost.  
There is also a unique revenue-maximizing price that may or may not be greater than  
the unit cost.  
The relationship between elasticity and unit margin implies that products facing  
lower elasticity will have higher unit margin rates than those facing higher elasticity.  
This means that — all else being equal— sellers should deploy their marketing, adver-  
tising, and product improvement budgets in a way that is targeted to reducing price  
elasticity for their products.  
A data-driven approach can be used to set prices that approach the profit-maximizing  
price p\* by using the following facts\: at prices higher than p\*, elasticity is greater  
than the inverse unit margin, and at prices lower than p\*, elasticity is lower than  
the inverse unit margin. The data-driven approach tests demand at different prices,  
estimates the elasticity, and then uses the relationship between elasticity and inverse  
unit margin to calculate a new price.  
Often, sellers are interested in both profit and revenue. If a seller can quantify his  
trade-off between profit and revenue, he can determine the price that best meets  
the trade-off by solving an optimization problem with an objective function that optimization 117  
appropriately weights profit and revenue. If the seller cannot quantify his trade-off,  
an efficient frontier can help him visualize the possible combinations of revenue and  
profit that he can achieve.  
5.9 FURTHER READING  
Activity-based costing \(ABC\) and the related discipline of activity-based management  
\(ABM\) arose in the mid-1980s from the realization that typical cost accounting systems  
often resulted in a distorted view of the value of different activities primarily because of  
improper allocation of fixed costs. ABC is a management accounting approach designed to  
help management understand the incremental cost implications of doing more or less of  
certain activities \(e.g., carrying fewer or more passengers\), as opposed to financial account  
systems where all costs are allocated according to various regulations \(e.g., SEC or FASBI\)  
to provide standardized and consistent reports to regulators and shareholders. The idea  
was popularized in Kaplan and Cooper 1997. For an updated view of ABC, see Kaplan and  
Anderson 2007. While some organizations \(although by no means all\) have adopted ABM,  
the significance for pricing optimization and revenue management is understanding that  
the costs that are relevant to pricing decisions are only those that would change given the  
change in demand resulting from the pricing decision.  
The Bertrand model was probably the earliest example of game-theoretic reasoning in  
economics\: it was articulated by the French mathematician Joseph Louis François Bertrand  
in 1883 and developed into a mathematical model by Francis Edgeworth in 1925. Since  
then, there has been an extensive economics literature on the application of game theory  
to pricing. For thorough treatments of game theory with a focus on economics, standard  
refences are Fudenberg and Tirole 1991, Myerson 1991, and Gibbons 1992. For a survey of  
game-theory models in pricing, see Kopalle and Shumsky 2012.  
The efficient frontier was introduced by Harry Markowitz \(1959\) to illustrate the trade-  
off between risk and return in an investment frontier. For an explanation of how it can be  
derived and used in this context, see Luenberger 1998, chap. 6. The efficient frontier has  
been widely used in many situations in which there is a trade-off between two competing  
alternatives. For more detail on its use in pricing and revenue management, see Phillips  
2012b, and for the use of efficient frontiers in consumer credit pricing, see Phillips 2018,

Frank accept this offer? Explain your answer.notes  
1\. The problem of finding optimal prices for a good with limited stock whose value is  
decreasing over time is a markdown pricing problem discussed in detail in Chapter 12.  
2\. The unit margin rate L\(p\) = \(p – c\) /p is also known as the Lerner index, which was  
named after the economist Abba Lerner, who proposed that it be used as a measure of  
market power. If the price being charged by a firm is denoted by p, then L\(p\) = 0 would  
indicate that a firm has no market power \(price equals incremental cost\) and L\(p\) = 1  
would indicate very high market power. Note that the condition for a profit-maximizing  
price can be written as \(p\*\) = 1/L\(p\*\).  
3\. Elasticity increasing with price is equivalent to a property of the underlying  
­ willingness-to-pay distribution called increasing general failure rate \(IGFR\). Any price-  
response function corresponding to a willingness-to-pay distribution with an increasing  
general failure rate will have unique profit- and revenue-maximizing prices. Such dis-  
tributions include the normal, the uniform, the exponential, and the logistic. For more  
details, including a list of distributions that do and do not satisfy the IGFR property, see  
Lariviere 2006.  
4\. The Bertrand model of competition is based on two sellers selling an identical prod-  
uct. Both sellers have the same incremental cost, c. Customers observe the prices of both  
sellers and are indifferent among sellers\: if one seller is cheaper, they will all purchase  
from that seller, and if the sellers offer the same price, demand will split equally between  
the sellers. Bertrand argued that, if either seller charged a price p \> c, the other seller’s best  
response would be to charge some price p', with p \> p' \> c. Since this holds true for both  
sellers, their prices would inevitably converge toward cost. In fact, prices would equilibrate  
at c +  , where  is the smallest increment of price allowed \(e.g., \$0.01\). 6 Price Differentiation  
In this chapter we examine one of the most fundamental concepts in pricing and revenue  
optimization —price differentiation. Price differentiation refers to the practice of a seller  
charging different prices to different customers, either for exactly the same good or for  
slightly different versions of the same good. It can be a powerful tactic for sellers to improve  
profitability. It also adds a new level of complexity to pricing, often driving the need to use  
analytical techniques to improve the calculation and updating of prices over time. Price  
differentiation can also be dangerous if not managed correctly — it can lead to loss of profit  
through arbitrage and to negative reactions to pricing that some customers may perceive  
as unfair.  
Tactics for price differentiation include charging different prices to different customers  
\(or groups of customers\) for exactly the same product, charging different prices for differ-  
ent versions or amounts of the same product, and combinations of the two. It also includes  
charging different prices for combinations of products than for individual products sold  
separately. I use the term “price differentiation” rather than the standard economic term  
price discrimination in part to avoid the negative connotations associated with the word  
“discrimination.” However, I also want to stress that price differentiation includes not only  
charging different prices to different customers for the same product \(group pricing\) but  
also the less controversial strategies of product versioning, regional pricing, channel pric-  
ing, and nonlinear pricing.  
While “price differentiation” and “dynamic pricing” are often used interchangeably,  
there is an important distinction between the two concepts. Price differentiation refers to  
strategies for charging different prices to different customers based on differences in their  
willingness to pay. Price differentiation usually \(but not always\) means that different prices  
are in play for the same \(or very similar products\) at the same time. Dynamic pricing, on  
the other hand, refers to changing the price of a product over time. Dynamic pricing is  
often employed to balance supply and demand — as in the case of the variable-pricing ap-  
proaches discussed in Chapter 7. Prices may also change over time as a result of changes in  
the desirability of a product over time — such as the declining appeal of a fashion item as price differentiation 121  
the end of the season approaches. In this case, all customers may see the same price at the  
same time, but the price they see changes over time.  
The distinction between price differentiation and dynamic pricing is important but not  
as clear-cut as it may seem. If two customers are being charged different prices for the same  
product at the same time, that is definitely price differentiation. When a ride-sharing ser-  
vice raises prices for all customers in a location during rush hour, that is dynamic pricing  
\(see Section 7.6.4 for details\). However, as we shall see, time can also be used as a segmen-  
tation dimension. Airline prices tend to go up as departure approaches in part because  
airlines know that late-booking customers typically have a higher willingness to pay for a  
ticket than early-booking customers. In this case, prices may be changing over time both as  
a form of price differentiation and to balance supply and demand \(Chapter 8 discusses how  
airlines change prices over time as a form of price differentiation\). Furthermore, a seller  
can perform price differentiation and dynamic pricing simultaneously — airlines raise and  
lower prices for the same flight prior to departure \(dynamic pricing\), but at each point in  
time they may be offering different prices to customers purchasing the ticket in Europe  
than in Japan \(price differentiation\).  
There is both art and science to price differentiation. The art lies in finding a way to  
divide the market into different segments such that higher prices can be charged to the  
high-willingness-to-pay segments and lower prices to the low-willingness-to-pay segments.  
There is no one way to segment customers that applies to all possible markets. Instead, a  
variety of techniques can be applied in different ways, depending on the characteristics of  
a market, the competitive environment, and the character of the goods or services being  
sold. The science lies in setting and updating the prices to maximize overall return from all  
segments.  
We start by using a simple example \(based on the widget maker from Chapter 5\) to il-  
lustrate the motivations behind price differentiation.  
6.1 THE ECONOMICS OF PRICE DIFFERENTIATION  
Let us return to the case of the widget maker in Example 5.3. The widget maker, looking  
for a way to increase his profitability, might start by taking a close look at his price-response  
function. He would realize that 10,000 customers are willing to pay some amount greater  
than zero for his widget, 5,000 are willing to pay \$6.25 or more, 3,000 are willing to pay \$8.75  
or more \(the contribution-maximizing price\), and 1,200 are even willing to pay \$11.00 or  
more. The marketing department might see an opportunity to improve profitability. After  
all, 2,000 of the customers who are currently purchasing at \$8.75 would be willing to pay  
\$10.00 or more for the product. Those customers are getting a great deal at \$8.75, but from  
the seller’s point of view, it is at least \$1.25 in additional revenue left on the table from  
each sale. Furthermore, 3,000 customers are willing to pay more than the production cost  
\(\$5.00\) but less than the sales price of \$8.75. Each of these is a potentially profitable sale lost  
because the price is too high. What if the seller could determine the maximum amount that  
each customer would be willing to pay and could charge that amount to everyone willing 122

to pay more than the per-unit cost of \$5.00? This would be pricing nirvana — the ultimate  
in one-to-one pricing.  
The total potential opportunity for profit improvement from price differentiation is  
shown in Figure 6.1. With a single price, the widget maker charges \$8.75 per unit and  
realizes a total profit of \(\$8.75 – \$5.00\) × 3,000 = \$11,250. This is the area of region A in  
Figure 6.1. Better price differentiation would enable the seller to charge each customer who  
is willing to pay more than \$8.75 per unit her exact willingness to pay. This would provide  
the additional revenue in region B in the figure. There is an additional opportunity to sell  
widgets to customers who are willing to pay more than \$5.00, the unit production cost,  
but less than \$8.75. This potential profit is shown as region C in the figure. The sum of the  
three regions is the total contribution that the widget maker would realize if he were able  
to charge every potential customer exactly at her willingness to pay. This is an upper bound  
on what could possibly be realized under any price differentiation program. Charging every  
customer exactly her willingness to pay is known as first-degree price discrimination in the  
economics literature.1  
While it is unrealistic to assume that this total potential could ever be captured, the sheer  
magnitude of the potential gain means there is a powerful motivation for sellers to tailor  
different prices to different customers according to their willingness to pay. Assume that the  
widget maker finds he can divide his market into two segments. One segment consists of  
all customers willing to pay more than \$7.00 for widgets. The other segment consists of all  
the customers willing to pay \$7.00 or less. The corresponding price-response functions are  
d1\(p1\) = min\[4,400, \(10,000 – 800p1\)+\],  
d2\(p2\) = \(5,600 – 800p2\)+  
,  
where d1\(p1\) is the price-response function for customers with a high willingness to pay and  
d2\(p2\) is the price-response function for customers with a lower willingness to pay. These price differentiation 123

Contribution \$11,250 \$11,250 \$800 \$12,050 7.0  
two price-response functions are shown in Figure 6.2. The sum of these two functions is the  
original price-response function. The difference is that now the seller can offer a different  
price to each of the two segments. We assume for this example that the widget maker can  
perfectly identify customers as belonging to one group or the other and can then offer each  
customer the appropriate price, without any opportunity for resale or arbitrage between  
the two groups.  
The widget maker can determine the optimal prices for each segment by solving for any  
of the optimality conditions in Section 5.2.1 twice — once for each segment. The results  
and a comparison to the unsegmented case are shown in Table 6.1. Dividing his custom-  
ers between those with willingness to pay greater than \$7.00 and those with willingness to  
pay less than \$7.00, and charging the optimal prices to the different segments, enables the  
widget maker to increase his revenues by 18% and his contribution by 7%. It is interest-  
ing to note that customers also benefit. The same 3,000 customers who would buy under  
a single price at \$8.75 still get to buy at \$8.75. In addition, 800 additional customers get to  
purchase at the new low price of \$6.00. These 800 customers are priced out of the market  
if the seller can only charge a single price. In this case, price differentiation is a win-win 124  
price differentiation  
situation, since the seller is certainly better off and all of the customers are at least as well  
off as before. However, price differentiation is not always a boon for consumers, as we see  
in Section 6.5.  
6.2 LIMITS TO PRICE DIFFERENTIATION  
If price differentiation is such a powerful way for sellers to increase contribution, why is it  
that sellers do not always do it for all customers? There are three powerful real-world limits  
to price differentiation.  
•  
•  
•  
Imperfect segmentation. The brain-scan technology required to determine the precise  
willingness to pay of each customer has not yet been developed. The best that can be  
done is to create market segments such that the average willingness to pay is different  
for each segment.  
Cannibalization. Under differential pricing, there is a powerful motivation for  
customers in high-price segments to find a way to pay the lower price. In the widget  
example, there is a strong motivation for high-willingness-to-pay customers who are  
being charged \$8.75 per widget to masquerade as low-willingness-to-pay customers  
and pay only \$6.00 per widget.  
Arbitrage. Price differentials create a strong incentive for arbitrageurs to find a way  
to buy the product at the low price and resell to high-willingness-to-pay customers  
below the market price, keeping the difference for themselves.  
The presence of any one of these factors can drastically reduce or even eliminate the ben-  
efits of price differentiation.  
Example 6.1  
Assume that the widget seller has segmented his market and is charging the  
two prices shown in Table 6.1. If 300 — that is 10%— of the high-willingness-  
to-pay customers are able to find a way to purchase widgets at the lower cost of  
\$6.00, it would totally eliminate the benefits of price differentiation.  
The deterioration of benefits in Example 6.1 could arise from imperfect segmentation,  
cannibalization, arbitrage, or a combination of any of them.  
6.3 TACTICS FOR PRICE DIFFERENTIATION  
The previous section establishes two properties of price differentiation.  
1\. 2. Successful price differentiation allows sellers to increase profitability by charging  
different prices to customers with different willingness to pay.  
Cannibalization, imperfect segmentation, or arbitrage can destroy — or even re-  
verse — the benefits of price differentiation. price differentiation 125  
The first property means that sellers have a tremendous incentive to find creative ways  
to position and price their products differently to different market segments. The second  
means that price differentiation needs to be carefully planned and managed in order to be  
effective. In this section we look at some of the most common and effective approaches to  
price differentiation used in different markets.  
6.3.1 Group Pricing  
Group pricing is the tactic of offering different prices to different groups of customers for  
exactly the same product at the same time.2 The idea is, of course, to offer a lower price to  
customers with a low willingness to pay and a higher price to those with a high willingness  
to pay. In practice, pure group pricing requires determining whether a customer belongs to  
an identified group and using that information to determine which price to offer. Examples  
of pure group pricing include  
•  
Student discounts  
•  
Senior citizen discounts  
•  
•  
•  
Ladies’ Night specials  
Family specials  
Discounts for favored customers  
•  
•  
Favorable terms offered by manufacturers or wholesalers to large retailers such as  
Walmart  
Lower prices offered to government, educational, and nonprofit organizations by  
suppliers  
Four criteria must hold for group pricing to be successful.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
There must be an unambiguous indicator of group membership. Examples of such  
indicators include a student ID card or a driver’s license that lists age. Furthermore, it  
must be difficult or impossible for members of one group to masquerade as mem-  
bers of another. Otherwise, cannibalization could easily reduce or even erase the  
benefits of price differentiation.  
Group membership must strongly correlate with price sensitivity. Senior citizen dis-  
counts are predicated on the knowledge that senior citizens, on average, are more  
price sensitive than the public in general.  
The product or service cannot be easily traded among purchasers. This is necessary to  
avoid arbitrage, in which some customers with access to low prices resell to custom-  
ers who are quoted higher prices.  
The segmentation must be both culturally and legally accepted. Group pricing can be  
extremely controversial. Certain group pricing practices — setting different prices for  
different races, for example — are illegal in many jurisdictions. Other group pric-  
ing practices such as gender-based pricing may or may not be illegal \(depending 126  
price differentiation  
on the location\) but may be extremely unpopular. Note that the social acceptability  
of many group pricing practices depends not only on the prices themselves but the  
ways in which the prices are communicated. Thus, a senior citizen discount may be  
­ acceptable, while a middle-age surcharge would likely not be acceptable. We examine  
these issues in depth in Chapter 14.  
Taken together, these criteria are so stringent that pure group pricing is relatively rare in  
direct consumer sales. Group pricing is most common in services. There are a number of  
reasons for this. Many service suppliers can verify group membership; for example, a movie  
theater can check a driver’s license before applying a senior citizen discount. Most services,  
from health care to haircuts, are intrinsically nontransferable, so arbitrage is not an issue.  
Airlines check passenger identification in part as a way to prevent arbitrage. Finally, group  
pricing is common in consumer and small business lending where the rate for a mortgage  
or loan might depend on the credit rating of the customer.  
Pure group pricing is also common in business-to-business sales. Chapter 13 discusses  
how businesses can estimate price responsiveness and develop customized prices for differ-  
ent business segments. Customized pricing in business-to-business sales is often combined  
with some form of product versioning, particularly in industries where individual orders  
are very complex and /or configurable.  
6.3.2 Channel Pricing  
Channel pricing is the practice of selling the same product for different prices through dif-  
ferent distribution channels. Here are some examples.  
•  
•  
Barnes and Noble sells books for different prices online than in its stores.  
Special web-only fares for airline tickets are available through the internet but not  
through travel agencies.  
As with other price differentiation schemes, there can be more than one reason why  
a seller might charge different prices through different channels. One is cost\: for many  
companies, selling through the internet is cheaper than selling through traditional chan-  
nels. In 2002, the average distribution cost for an airline ticket booked through an offline  
travel agency was \$30.66 compared to \$11.75 for one booked directly on an airline’s website  
\(Barnes 2012\). This cost difference alone would be motivation for an airline to charge less  
for tickets purchased on its website than through a travel agency.  
However, it is also the case that customers arriving via different channels have different  
price sensitivities. For personal loans, it has been shown that customers inquiring through  
the internet are more price sensitive than those contacting a call center, who are in turn  
more price sensitive than those who apply for a loan at a retail branch. Furthermore, in-  
ternet customers who access a consolidator website or use a shopping bot tend to be more  
price sensitive than those who go directly to a bank’s website. This is not surprising given  
the characteristics of the channels — it is generally easier and more convenient to shop and  
compare prices during a single internet session than by making many phone calls. Thus,  
differential willingness to pay is also a motivation for channel pricing. price differentiation 127  
6.3.3 Regional Pricing  
Regional pricing is a common price differentiation technique. Here are some examples.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
In Latin America, McDonald’s sells hamburgers for higher prices in wealthy neigh-  
borhoods than in poorer ones \(The Economist 2004\).  
A round-trip New York–Tokyo ticket purchased in Japan will usually cost more for  
many airlines than the same ticket purchased in the United States.  
A cold 20-ounce bottle of Coke costs \$1.50 at the local drugstore, \$1.99 at a gas  
station, \$2.79 at the airport newsstand, and \$3.49 at a hotel gift shop \(Simon and  
Fassnacht 2018, 210\).  
In the United States and in Canada, banks often charge different rates for mortgages  
in different regions of the country.3  
In each case, the price difference is based on the supplier’s desire to exploit differences  
in price sensitivity between locations. One limiting factor in regional pricing is typically  
­ arbitrage — entrepreneurs can theoretically purchase in the lower-price location, transport  
to the higher-price location, and resell, keeping the difference. Note that, in each of the  
cases listed above, arbitrage is difficult or impossible.  
In addition to arbitrage, another limiting factor in regional pricing is the potential for  
region to be perceived as a proxy for other customer characteristics such as income levels  
or ethnicity. Redlining was the name given to the policies of many U.S. banks not to lend to  
customers in certain urban neighborhoods — neighborhoods that were typically predomi-  
nantly African American. Redlining was widely condemned and was ultimately outlawed in  
the United States.4 More recently, a 2015 ProPublica study revealed that Princeton Review  
charged higher prices for its test preparation services in zip codes that had higher pro-  
portions of Asian Americans than other zip codes. Princeton Review admitted differential  
pricing by region but denied discrimination in “the literal, legal and moral meaning of the  
word” \(Larson, Mattu, and Angwin 2015\).  
6.3.4 Couponing and Self-Selection  
We have seen that group pricing is often both difficult and unpopular — difficult because  
it requires the seller to categorize customers on the basis of price sensitivity before quoting  
them a price, and unpopular because it often seems unfair to consumers. It is often much  
more convenient to differentiate prices in ways that allow customers to self-select. In a self-  
selection approach, both the list price and a discounted price are available to all customers,  
but it takes additional time, effort, or flexibility to obtain the discounted price. The idea is  
that those willing to make the additional effort to get the discount are generally more price  
sensitive than those who are not. Here are some examples.  
•  
Retailers commonly offer discount coupons through newspapers, direct mail, and  
email.  
•  
Retailers often offer mail-in rebates for purchasers of a good. 128  
price differentiation  
•  
•  
Movie theaters charge lower prices for a weekday matinee than for a Saturday night  
show. \(This is also an example of variable pricing, as discussed in Section 7.6.5.\)  
Brand-name retailers such as Ralph Lauren, the Gap, and Liz Claiborne operate out-  
let stores in out-of-the-way locations, making merchandise available for a substantial  
discount. For example, Ralph Lauren operates several branded stores in Manhattan  
that sell its clothing at full price. It also operates a so-called factory store in Eliza-  
beth, New Jersey, about 20 miles away, in which it sells some of the same items at a  
deep discount. Local customers are likely to be more price sensitive than Manhat-  
tan dwellers. Manhattan dwellers who are willing to make the trek to New Jersey  
are likely more price sensitive than those who are willing to simply purchase Ralph  
Lauren from a local store.  
The common thread among these examples is that the seller has chosen a mechanism that  
allows customers to self-select, depending on the value they place on time or flexibility. Any  
customer can obtain an item at a discount if she is willing to make an additional effort. Re-  
search has confirmed that users of coupons are more price sensitive than nonusers of cou-  
pons \(Narasimhan 1984\). Locating outlet stores away from large cities segments the market  
between those who are willing to spend additional time in transit — for example, driving  
from Manhattan to Elizabeth, New Jersey, and back— and those who are not. Peak-load,  
day-of-week, and time-of-day pricing segments the market between those who have the  
flexibility to change their plans in order to save some money and those who are not willing  
to do so. Since these mechanisms are based on self-selection, they are far more acceptable  
to most consumers than mechanisms in which the seller unilaterally selects customers to  
receive discounts.  
6.3.5 Product Versioning  
When pure group pricing is not feasible, companies use other strategies to differentiate  
prices. The most notable of these is designing or developing products \(either virtual or real\)  
that may have only minor differences but enable the seller to exploit differences in price  
sensitivity among customer segments. This can involve developing an inferior variant and /  
or a superior variant of an existing product. We look at examples of both strategies as well  
as their logical extension into the creation of a product line.  
Inferior goods. Consider the following cases.  
•  
Well-known international brand names such as ExxonMobil and Shell sell excess  
gasoline in bulk at low prices to so-called off-brand independent dealers who resell it  
under their own brands.  
•  
•  
A well-known premium wine producer sells some of its production under a different  
label at about half the price.  
Brand-name vegetable canners sell their products under their own brand but also sell  
to retailers who sell the product to consumers as a house brand or a generic brand.  
While the specifics of each of these cases differ, the motivation on the part of the seller is the  
same — a desire to sell a product cheaply to customers with lower willingness to pay with- price differentiation 129  
out cannibalizing sales of the full-price product. This is achieved in each case by creating an  
inferior version of the standard product.  
A particularly extreme example of inferior goods is the category of so-called damaged  
goods. This is a term coined to refer to the situation in which a manufacturer or supplier  
creates an inferior good by damaging, degrading, or disabling a standard good \(Deneckere  
and McAfee 1996\). Since this process usually starts with the standard good, it may actually  
cost the supplier more to create the inferior good, which it then sells at a lower price. One  
example is the 486SX processor developed and sold by Intel Corporation.  
The 486SX processor of Intel Corporation was initially produced in a curious way. Intel  
began with a fully functioning 486DX processor, then disabled the math coprocessor, to pro-  
duce a chip that is strictly inferior to the 486DX but more expensive to produce. Neverthe-  
less, in 1991, the 486DX sold for \$588, and the 486SX for \$333, a little over half the price of  
the chip that is less expensive to produce. \(Deneckere and McAfee 1996, 149; emphasis in  
original\)  
Another example is the Tesla. According to an article in the Economist, “The cheaper  
models in Tesla’s line-up have parts of their batteries disabled by the car’s software in order  
to limit their range” \(2019, 3\). When Hurricane Dorian was heading toward America’s East  
Coast in August 2019, Tesla, with the “tap of a keyboard in Palo Alto,” was able to tempo-  
rarily remove the artificial restrictions and “give drivers access to the full power of their  
batteries” \(3\). The implication is that the range restriction for the less expensive models was  
imposed simply to create an inferior product that could be sold at a lower price.  
Complex application software packages such as supply chain software or enterprise re-  
source planning \(ERP\) software are often sold at different prices, depending on the number  
of features purchased by a customer — the more features purchased, the more expensive the  
license. In many cases, the software is configured for a particular customer by starting with  
the complete package and then disabling the features that the customer did not purchase.  
The concept of damaging a good to create an inferior good to sell at a lower price may  
initially seem somewhat bizarre. However, it is really only a special case of the more general  
category of inferior goods. There can be a tremendous gain from offering an inferior good  
at a lower price, even if the supposedly inferior product is more expensive to produce.  
Starting from a standard product and then paying to have it damaged is only a special case  
of this more general principle.  
Superior goods. Spendrups is the largest brewery in Sweden. Traditionally Spendrups  
brewed medium- or low-priced lagers aimed at the mass market. In the 1980s, it created  
Spendrups Old Gold, which it advertised as a premium beer and sold in a special, highly  
distinctive bottle. Although Old Gold did not generally fare better than Spendrups’s other  
brands in comparative taste tests, Spendrups was able to establish Old Gold as a premium  
brand and maintain a price 25% to 50% higher than that of its other brands. This is the  
obvious complement to the inferior-good strategy\: creating a superior good to extract a  
higher price from less price-sensitive customers. When sales of Old Gold began to flag, it  
was relaunched in a distinctive 10-sided bottle in 2010 to maintain the premium image.  
Another example of the superior-good strategy was employed by Proctor-Silex. In 1985,  
Proctor-Silex priced a top-of-the-line iron at \$54.95, while its next best model was priced 130  
price differentiation  
at \$49.95. The only difference between the two was that the top model had a small light  
indicating when the iron is ready to use. The difference in manufacturing cost between the  
two models was only \$1.00, yet Proctor-Silex was able to maintain a \$5.00 price difference  
because, as a Proctor-Silex marketing manager put it, “There is a segment of the market  
that wants to buy the best, despite the cost” \(quoted in Birnbaum 1986, 175\). By creating  
a superior product, Proctor-Silex enabled the less price-sensitive segment of the market to  
self-select and extracted an additional \$4.00 in contribution margin from each high-end  
customer. In some ways, a superior-good strategy is safer than an inferior-good strategy  
because it does not threaten cannibalization of existing sales. Of course, it presumes an  
ability to create and establish a product that the market perceives as truly superior to the  
existing product and presumes that there is a customer segment willing to pay a premium  
for the superior product.  
Product lines. Establishing a product line is the natural extension of creating inferior or  
superior products. A product line is a series of similar products serving the same general  
market but sold at different prices. For our purposes, we consider vertical product lines,  
where almost all customers would agree that a higher-priced product is superior to a lower-  
priced one. This applies, for example, to a hotel that charges more for an ocean-view room  
than a parking-lot-view room — almost all customers would prefer the ocean view. It also  
applies to personal computers offered by Apple, where each product in the line has higher  
performance \(faster CPU, more memory, etc.\) than the product just below it in the line.  
This can be contrasted to horizontal product lines, where different customers prefer differ-  
ent products within the line, even at the same price. Coca-Cola’s offering of Classic Coke,  
Diet Coke, Cherry Coke, Diet Cherry Coke, Coke Zero, and so on is a horizontal product  
line because no single product is unambiguously higher quality or more desirable than  
another.  
An example of a vertical product line is shown in Table 6.2, which gives prices for four  
versions of the QuickBooks financial software offered by Intuit. The versions are the Simple  
Start version, which costs \$25.00 per month; the Essentials version, which costs \$40.00 per  
month; the Plus version, which costs \$70.00 per month; and the Advanced version, which  
costs \$150.00 per month.5  
In all likelihood, there is only a tiny difference \(if any\) in the marginal cost of producing  
and delivering the four different versions of QuickBooks software. Yet the Advanced pack-  
age is priced six times higher than the Simple Start version. The rationale for the product  
line and the broad difference is market segmentation —very small businesses that need  
less functionality and have fewer users are presumably more price sensitive than larger

Another example of product-line pricing is illustrated in Table 6.3, which shows the  
rates on display through the online travel agency Expedia for a Budget Rental Car one-day  
rental from the Seattle airport on a midweek day in January 2020. Budget lists 10 different  
products, with prices ranging from \$68.00 per day for an economy rental to \$123 per day  
for a premium SUV. By providing a menu of alternatives at different prices, Budget allows  
customers to self-select\: The economy-minded will choose the economy or compact cars,  
while those who are willing to pay for greater comfort may opt for the full-size or luxury.  
Furthermore, those traveling with large families may want or need to rent a larger car or  
an SUV. It is important to stress that the range of rates offered by Budget for these differ-  
ent products to rental car companies is not driven by cost differences. Taking into account  
the revenue from resale, life-cycle costs do not vary much among different car types. More  
important, there is little or no difference in the daily incremental cost to Budget for renting  
out an economy car or a premium SUV. The spread in daily rates is driven almost entirely  
by Budget’s desire to segment its market.  
The pricing menus offered by Budget and Intuit are openly communicated and available  
to all comers.6 Consumers get to choose among the alternatives, and the concept of paying  
more to get more is widely accepted. This makes product-line pricing more acceptable to  
most customers than group pricing.  
For service companies like Budget, creation of a product line has an important side ben-  
efit — it creates opportunities for upgrading. A rental car company or a cruise line has the  
ability to oversell lower-quality car types and upgrade customers into higher-quality types.  
Not only does this provide the company with greater flexibility to manage its inventory,  
but being upgraded is usually viewed favorably by customers. An important advantage of  
pricing differentiation by establishing a product line is that consumers generally perceive  
it as fair.  
6.3.6 Time-Based Differentiation  
Time-based differentiation is a common form of product versioning. Here are some ex-  
amples. 132  
price differentiation  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Target.com offers Standard Shipping of 3 –5 business days free for items of \$35 or  
more. For selected items and locations, 2-Day Shipping and Express Shipping of  
1-Day are offered at an additional cost.  
Passenger airlines offer discount rates to customers who book a week or more prior  
to departure. Hotels offer higher rates to customers who “walk up” to obtain a room  
for that evening.  
Software- and hardware-support contracts charge more for two-hour response than  
for two-day response.  
Fashion goods cost more during the beginning of the season and are marked down  
toward the end of the season.  
In each of these cases, companies have created differentiated products that allow custom-  
ers to self-select. In the case of Target, customers who are willing to wait for delivery can  
pay less. For passenger airlines, customers who have the flexibility to book earlier can pay  
less. For the passenger airlines, it costs no more to accommodate a passenger who books  
later than one who books earlier. It may be that the higher price charged by Target for early  
delivery exactly matches the incremental cost. But it is likely that Target is also using time  
of delivery as a segmentation variable, relying on the willingness of some of its customers to  
pay a premium to have the product in their hands sooner, just as the airline is using time of  
booking to segment customers.  
Time-based differentiation plays an important role at passenger airlines, hotels, and  
rental car companies, in which time of booking and other factors, such as willingness to  
accept a Saturday night stay-over, are used as indicators of whether a potential customer is  
traveling for leisure purposes or business purposes. Those traveling for leisure purposes are  
presumed to be more price sensitive than those traveling for business. This segmentation  
is the foundation of revenue management in those industries, and Chapter 8 discusses it in  
detail. The willingness of some customers to wait to purchase fashion goods at a discount is  
the basis of markdown management, which is treated in Chapter 12.  
6.3.7 Product Versioning or Group Pricing?  
We have treated product versioning and group pricing as separate strategies for price differ-  
entiation. In reality, no clear line separates the two approaches, and many price differentia-  
tion strategies contain elements of both. For example, consider the classic airline example  
\(which we explore in detail in Chapter 8\) of a round-trip ticket from San Francisco to Chi-  
cago costing \$250 if purchased a week in advance and including a Saturday stay-over versus  
\$750 if purchased at the last minute without restrictions. Is this group pricing or product  
versioning? Disgruntled customers might argue that it is simply group pricing, since differ-  
ent customers are paying different amounts for exactly the same service—namely, a round-  
trip coach seat from San Francisco to Chicago. The airline would reply that the two types of  
tickets are distinct products and that the added cost of the full-fare ticket is fully justified by  
the flexibility of being able to purchase late and return without staying over a Saturday night.  
The reality is, of course, that airline pricing — like many successful examples of price  
differentiation — includes elements of both group pricing and product versioning. The price differentiation 133  
airlines consciously created restricted discount fares as an inferior product. They did so,  
however, as a way to enable them to offer different fares to different customer groups\: lower  
fares to leisure travelers, who are more price sensitive but more flexible; and higher fares  
to business travelers, who are less price sensitive but also less flexible. Viewed one way, we  
could say that the airlines created an inferior product as the most efficient and least contro-  
versial way to institute group pricing.  
The airline example illustrates an important point. Pure group pricing is difficult to pull  
off in most consumer markets. There are few cases in which consumers can unambiguously  
be identified as belonging to a particular group and prices can be targeted accordingly with  
no fear of arbitrage or customer backlash. Airlines have no reliable objective marker to tell  
them whether a particular customer is flying for business or for pleasure. In the absence  
of such a marker, they rely on \(among other factors\) the imperfect criterion of whether a  
customer can book early. This works well enough, but it is imperfect. For example, plenty  
of highly price-sensitive leisure customers would be happy to book late. And some busi-  
ness customers are able to book early and take advantage of lower fares. Furthermore, the  
airlines have lots of empty seats they would like to fill with these customers, even at a very  
low price. But allowing customers to book at the last minute at a low price would damage  
the ability of the airlines to segment customers between leisure and business.  
6.4 CALCULATING DIFFERENTIATED PRICES  
If market segments are completely independent \(i.e., there is no cannibalization\) and the  
seller faces no capacity constraints, then calculating differentiated prices is quite simple —  
the seller simply finds the contribution-optimizing price for each segment. This is the right  
approach whether the underlying differentiation is based on channel, geography, or pure  
group pricing.  
Example 6.2  
An electronics distributor sells portable MP3 players through its exclusive retail  
outlets and on its website. The unit cost for each MP3 player is \$200. The ad-  
ditional cost per sale through the internet is \$35, including shipping, but \$70  
through the retail stores. Through price testing, the distributor has discovered  
that price elasticity is 2.5 for internet customers versus 2.2 for retail custom-  
ers. Using Equation 5.8, the distributor calculates the contribution-maximizing  
price as \(2.5/1.5\) × \(\$200 + \$35\) = \$392 for internet sales and \(2.2/1.2\) × \(\$200  
+ \$70\) = \$495 for retail sales.  
6.4.1 Optimal Pricing with Arbitrage  
Unfortunately for sellers, perfect price differentiation is usually impossible. Cannibaliza-  
tion is likely whenever customers cannot be perfectly segmented according to willingness  
to pay. Arbitrage is likely whenever a third party can purchase the product at a low price  
and resell it at a high price. Regional pricing is subject to arbitrage whenever a product can  
be purchased in a low-price region and transported cheaply to be resold at a higher price 134  
price differentiation  
­ elsewhere. For this reason, global companies often set price bands for various markets to  
avoid resales from low-price countries that would cannibalize sales in higher-price coun-  
tries.  
Example 6.3  
A computer chip manufacturer finds that the contribution-maximizing prices  
for his chips are \$2.54 in the United States and \$2.43 in Brazil. However, if it  
costs \$0.08 per unit to ship chips from Brazil to the United States, the potential  
for arbitrage between the two countries means he will not be able to charge  
those prices. He needs to set prices for the two countries that do not vary by  
more than \$0.08.  
Regional pricing with arbitrage can be formulated as a constrained optimization prob-  
lem. Assume that a manufacturer is selling a common product to n different locations.  
These could be cities or regions, but for purposes of discussion we will consider them to  
be countries. The delivered cost \(including transportation\) in country i is ci. The cost to an  
arbitrageur to transport the product from country i to country j is aij.  
7 To avoid arbitrage,  
the supplier needs to set prices such that pj ≤ pi + aij for each i and j. Otherwise, the supplier  
faces the possibility that an arbitrageur will purchase the product in country i, transport it  
ˆ  
to country j, and sell it for a price p  
ˆ  
j. If p  
j \> pi + aij, then the arbitrageur can undercut the  
supplier in country j while still turning a profit. It is clear that a contribution-maximizing  
supplier would usually like to avoid this situation.  
Let pi be the price in country i and di\(pi\) be the price-response function faced by the sup-  
plier in country i. Then the problem of optimizing international prices under the possibility  
of arbitrage can be formulated as  
n  
max \( – \) \( \),  
# ∑  
p p c d p  
i  
i i i  
i  
=  
1  
subject to  
pj ≤ pi + aij pi ≥ 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , n; j = 1, 2, . . . , n; i  j,  
for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.  
This problem will not, in general, be a linear program. However, if the price-response func-  
tion for each country is continuous and downward sloping, it will have a single optimum  
and will be easy to solve using standard optimization approaches. In many cases, global  
companies do not solve the full optimization problem but rather determine prices for ma-  
jor markets \(e.g., North America, Western Europe, Japan\) and then use price bands to  
determine prices for smaller markets that are close enough to major market prices to elimi-  
nate the potential for arbitrage through transshipment.  
6.4.2 Optimal Pricing with Cannibalization  
Cannibalization presents a somewhat different problem than arbitrage. To analyze differen-  
tiated pricing with cannibalization, let us return to the case in which we divided widget cus- price differentiation 135  
tomers into those with willingness to pay more than \$7.00 and those with willingness to pay  
less than \$7.00. The corresponding price-response functions, shown in Figure 6.2, assume  
perfect differentiation — the company can perfectly distinguish between those customers  
willing to pay more than \$7.00 and those willing to pay less than \$7.00 and can charge  
the optimal price to each group. What if some of the higher-willingness-to-pay customers  
find a way to buy at the lower price? Let α be the cannibalization fraction— the fraction of  
higher-willingness-to-pay customers who find a way to buy at the lower price. α = 0 cor-  
responds to the case of perfect differentiation, in which none of the high-willingness-to-pay  
customers buy at the lower price, while α = 1 corresponds to no differentiation, in which  
all of the customers buy at the lower price. Values of α between 0 and 1 represent different  
segmentation efficiencies. Given a value of α, the price-response functions for each of the  
two segments are given by  
d1\(p1\) = \(1 – α\) min\[4,400; \(10,000 – 800p1\)+\]  
d2\(p2\) = \(5,600 – 800p2\)+ + 4,400α  
The second term in the equation for d2\(p2\) reflects the fact that 4,400 total customers have  
a willingness to pay greater than \$7.00 and that a fraction α of them will find a way to buy  
at the lower price, p2.  
To find the values of p1 and p2 that maximize total contribution, we need to solve the  
optimization problem  
1  
max \( – \)\( – \) –  
1 α min\[4,400; \(10,000 800 1 1  
, p p p c p

1 2  
+ + \( – \)\[ –  
p c p  
+ α  
2 \(5,600 800 \) 4,400 \],  
2  
subject to p2 ≤ \$7.00. The prices that maximize total contribution in this case are  
p1  
\* = \$8.75,  
p2  
\* = min \(\$6.00 + \$2.75α, \$7.00\).  
When α = 0 \(no cannibalization\), p2  
\* = \$8.75. As α increases, cannibalization increases,  
and p2  
\* increases as well. This corresponds to intuition — the more our low-price product  
is cannibalizing a high-price product, the higher we need to price the low-price product  
to maximize total contribution. When α = 0.36 \(i.e., 36% of the high-willingness-to-pay  
customers find a way to pay the lower price\), the optimal low price has risen to \$7.00. At  
this point, none of the low-willingness-to-pay customers are buying any more \(since their  
willingness to pay is less than \$7.00\) and the only low-price customers are cannibalized  
high-willingness-to-pay customers.  
Figure 6.3 shows optimal total contribution as a function of α. As α increases, total con-  
tribution decreases as more and more high-willingness-to-pay customers are cannibalized  
by the lower price. At a value of α of about 13%, total contribution is \$11,250, the same  
total contribution that could be achieved with no segmentation. In this simple example, if  
more than 13% of our high-willingness-to-pay customers will be cannibalized, we are bet-  
ter off offering only a single price than trying to differentiate and offer different prices to  
the different segments. 136

While the threshold of 13% is specific to this example, the lesson is general\: Even fairly  
low rates of cannibalization can destroy the benefits of price differentiation. This means  
that when establishing customer segments and determining the optimal prices, it is critical  
that we understand the potential for cannibalization and price accordingly within each seg-  
ment. Otherwise, we can end up in a situation where we are worse off than if we had simply  
established a single price to the entire market.  
6.5 PRICE DIFFERENTIATION AND CONSUMER WELFARE  
We have seen that, correctly executed, price differentiation can be good for sellers. But  
is it good for customers? This is not merely an academic question. Some forms of price  
differentiation can be unpopular among customers — particularly group pricing, which,  
as we see in Chapter 14, is often viewed by customers as unfair. This can lead to loss of  
customers as well as regulatory scrutiny. If a seller can show that a particular differential  
pricing approach actually makes consumers better off as a whole \(or at least not worse  
off \) in comparison with a single price, the seller will at least have an argument to use with  
regulators.  
To look at who gains and who loses from price differentiation, we draw on some con-  
cepts from social welfare theory, as illustrated in Figure 6.4. The left-hand diagram in this  
figure illustrates the case of a seller with unit cost c who is facing a linear price-response  
function and can set only a single price. We assume that he sets the optimal price p\* with  
corresponding sales of d\(p\*\). The seller is not capacity constrained, and so sales equal de-  
mand. The shaded area in the figure corresponds to the seller’s profit, which is given by \(p\*  
– c\)d\(p\*\). In consumer welfare theory, this amount is called producers surplus. price differentiation 137

Figure 6.4 Elements of social surplus for a profit-maximizing seller setting a single price \(left\)  
and two prices with perfect differentiation \(right\).  
On the customer side, the analog of producers surplus is consumers surplus. For an indi-  
vidual customer who purchases the product, her resulting surplus is equal to the difference  
between her willingness to pay and the price. The idea is that a consumer who was willing  
to pay up to \$54 for an item but purchased it at \$45 has enjoyed a surplus of \$9 — money  
she would have been willing to pay for this item but now has available to purchase some-  
thing else \(or to save\). The consumers surplus associated with a particular pricing scheme  
is the sum of the individual surpluses of consumers who purchase the item. The surplus  
associated with a customer who does not purchase is zero. In the left-hand graph in Figure  
6.4, the consumers surplus associated with a single price is equal to the area of the triangle  
labeled B and the producers surplus \(profit\) is equal to the area of square A.  
The social surplus associated with the pricing scheme is the consumers surplus plus the  
producers surplus — that is, the area of triangle B plus square A. Social welfare theory in  
its simplest form posits that total economic welfare is maximized when social surplus is  
maximized.8  
There is one other area of interest, represented by the triangle labeled C in the left-hand  
graph in Figure 6.4. A customer whose willingness to pay is between c and p\* will not pur-  
chase at the price of p\* and hence realizes a consumers surplus of zero. However, this cus-  
tomer would be willing to purchase at some price greater than c, and a profit-maximizing  
seller would be willing to sell to them, but because the seller is restricted to a single price,  
these transactions do not take place. The area of triangle C represents surplus lost because  
the seller can only charge the single price p\*— it is called deadweight loss.  
It is instructive to consider what happens to social surplus if the seller decided to sell  
at a price different from p\*. If he raises his price above p\*, then producers surplus will be  
reduced, consumers surplus will be reduced, and the deadweight loss will increase, which  
means that overall social welfare is decreased. On the other hand, if he reduces his price  
below p\*, producers surplus will be reduced, but consumers surplus will increase and dead-  
weight loss will decrease. Since deadweight loss decreases, social welfare is increased. In the 138  
price differentiation  
extreme case, if he sets p = c, consumers surplus and social welfare would be maximized,  
but producers surplus \(and deadweight loss\) would both be zero. Other than regulation,  
the most likely motivation for a producer to price at cost would be competition — and, in  
fact, perfect competition maximizes consumers surplus and social welfare by eliminating  
producers surplus.  
What happens if the seller is able to offer two prices? The situation is shown in the right-  
hand graph in Figure 6.4. Here, we assume that the seller is able to perfectly segment the  
market according to willingness to pay and there is no cannibalization or arbitrage. Dead-  
weight loss in this case is the area of triangle C and consumers surplus is the sum of the  
areas of triangles B1 and B2. Producers surplus is the area of the shaded region \(not labeled  
in the figure\). We know that producers surplus \(profit\) increases with two prices, and it is  
clear from the figure that deadweight loss has decreased. It can be shown in this case that  
consumers surplus has decreased and that overall social surplus has increased. Thus, in this  
case, price differentiation has increased social surplus but at the cost of converting some  
consumers surplus to producers surplus. The ideal for the profit-maximizing producer  
would be to charge each customer a price exactly equal to her willingness to pay \(first-degree  
price discrimination\), in which the producer would capture all of the available surplus —A +  
B + C in the left-hand figure. Perfect competition and first-degree price discrimination by  
a monopolist both maximize social surplus, although in the first case the surplus is entirely  
captured by customers and in the second it is entirely captured by the seller as profit.  
Does this mean that price differentiation always reduces consumers surplus? The answer  
is no\: it turns out that price differentiation can make consumers better off. Consider the  
case where the widget maker is able to divide his market into two segments, with the two  
price-response curves shown in Figure 6.2. As shown in Table 6.1, the seller’s optimal policy  
in this case is to charge \$8.75 to the high-willingness-to-pay segment and \$6.00 to the low-  
willingness-to-pay segment, with a concurrent increase in contribution of \$800 relative to  
the best he can do when charging a single price. The total consumers surplus under this  
new policy is the old surplus, denoted by region C1 in Figure 6.5, plus the new surplus, C2,  
enjoyed by the customers paying \$7.00. The seller’s profit is the sum of regions A1 and A2.  
Comparison with Figure 6.1 shows that this two-price policy has resulted in both more  
profit for the seller and higher total consumers surplus than the single-price policy. In other  
words, in this case price differentiation is a win-win for customers and sellers.  
The case in Figure 6.5 is notable because some customers are better off and no customer  
is worse off than with a single price. The customers who paid \$8.75 with the single price still  
pay \$8.75, so they are unaffected. Customers who pay \$7.00 under the two-price policy are  
better off since they would not have purchased with a single price. And the seller is better  
off since he makes more money.  
So depending on how it is applied, price differentiation can either increase or decrease  
consumers surplus. There is one general rule\: If a price differentiation scheme increases profits  
for a seller but does not result in additional production, it must reduce total consumers surplus.  
This rule is most relevant when capacity is constrained — if a theater is already selling out  
at a single price and it goes to a two-price system that increases revenue, then it has done so  
by making customers, on the average, worse off. Again, this does not mean that no custom-  
ers are better off under the new scheme\: it simply means that the total consumers surplus price differentiation 139

is less under the new scheme than under the old. If, on the other hand, a theater that is not  
full finds that it can increase total revenue by a price differentiation tactic, then the effect of  
the differentiation on total consumers surplus will depend on the situation. A study of the  
effects of pricing and consumer behavior for an actual Broadway show concluded that price  
differentiation increased both attendance and profit by about 5% while having a negligible  
effect on consumers surplus \(Leslie 2004\).  
Note that social surplus is maximized in two extreme cases. If the producer could use a  
Vulcan mind meld to determine the exact willingness to pay of every customer and he was  
able to charge every customer exactly her willingness to pay, he would sell his product to  
every customer with willingness to pay greater than unit cost at that customer’s willingness  
to pay. In this case, the seller would grab every penny of potential surplus. There would be  
no deadweight loss, but there would be no consumers surplus either. At the other extreme,  
the seller would sell the product at unit cost. In this case, every customer with willingness  
to pay greater than cost would purchase. There would be no profit and no deadweight loss,  
but each consumer would enjoy a high level of consumers surplus. Of course, in the static  
world represented by a single price-response curve, there is no motivation for the seller to  
engage in this largesse. In the real world, sellers are pushed toward selling at \(or near\) cost  
by the presence or the threat of competition or, possibly, regulation.  
6.6 NONLINEAR PRICING  
All of the approaches to pricing discussed so far can be characterized as linear. This means  
that the price of a bundle including multiple items is equal to a fixed price per item times  
the number of items purchased. Thus, if a gallon of milk costs \$3.50 and a loaf of bread costs  
\$2.50, under linear pricing the cost to purchase two gallons of milk and four loaves of bread  
would be 2  \$3.50 + 4  \$2.50 = \$17.00. Under linear pricing, the cost to the ­ consumer of  
buying twice as much of an item is simply double the cost of buying a single item, and the  
cost of buying two different bundles of items is the sum of the prices of each bundle. 140  
price differentiation  
While linear pricing is simple and intuitive, a seller can often generate additional reve-  
nue or profit through nonlinear pricing— that is, charging a price for a bundle of goods that  
is different \(usually lower\) than the sum of the prices of the individual items in the bundle.  
Familiar examples include volume discounts, “10% off if you purchase at least five rolls of  
toilet paper”; BoGos \(“buy one, get one”\) such as “buy two books and get the third one for  
50%”; and bundling discounts, “buy a grill for full price and get 1/2 off a bag of charcoal.”  
Note that nonlinear pricing schemes are a form of price differentiation\: under a nonlin-  
ear pricing scheme, customers who purchase more of an item or purchase an item in com-  
bination with other items will typically pay less per unit than other customers who purchase  
a single unit of the item in question. Yet, unlike group pricing, nonlinear pricing is generally  
noncontroversial since the same pricing is typically available to all customers. In this sense,  
it is similar to product differentiation because each customer is typically offered the option  
to buy a single item at full price or multiple items with a discount.  
In this section we consider two of the most common approaches to nonlinear pricing\:  
volume discounts and bundling.  
6.6.1 Volume Discounts  
Volume discounting —buy more to save more — is a time-honored form of nonlinear pric-  
ing. Some examples follow.  
•  
•  
•  
A six-pack of beer purchased from the supermarket costs less than six times the cost  
of a single bottle, and a case \(12 bottles\) usually costs less than two six-packs.  
Larger boxes of laundry detergent cost less per ounce than smaller boxes.  
Verizon offers shared data plans for households, including “small” \(2 GB\) at \$35 per  
month, “medium” \(4 GB\) at \$50 per month, and “large” \(8 GB\) at \$70 per month  
\(Verizon, n.d.\).  
Volume discounting is as prevalent, if not more prevalent, in wholesale and business-to-  
business selling. Table 6.4 shows three typical price schedules including volume discounts

for three different products offered online\: Duracell batteries on Walmart.com, Holiday  
Signs, and Pines wheatgrass products. Each seller offers significantly lower unit prices to  
customers who are buying more units. And the price per unit decreases as the number of  
units in the order increases.  
There are at least three reasons why companies offer volume discounts\:  
•  
Transaction or order costs. If some costs associated with fulfilling an order are inde-  
pendent of size, then the order cost per unit will decrease as the size of the order  
increases. In this case, it makes sense for the seller to charge a lower price per unit for  
large orders.  
Example 6.4  
A software seller has a fixed cost of \$1,000 per installation and a variable cost of  
\$40 per user. Customer 1 has 10 users and customer 2 has 100 users. The total  
cost for him to serve customer 1 is \$1,400, or \$140/user, compared with a total  
cost of \$5,000, or only \$50/user, for customer 2. Assume that both customers  
have a valuation of \$120/user. Then, if the seller can only charge a single price,  
he will charge \$120 per copy. At this rate, both customers will buy, but he will  
lose \$200 on the first customer. If he offers a volume discount such that the  
price is greater than \$140/user for 10 users or fewer and \$120/user for more  
than 10 users, the first customer will not purchase and he will make an addi-  
tional \$200 in profit.  
•  
•  
Decreasing marginal utility. In many cases, the marginal utility to a customer de-  
creases as the number of units purchased increases. A hot and thirsty customer walk-  
ing into a convenience store places more value on the first can of cold soft drink than  
she does on the second. Decreasing marginal utility is also often seen in business-to-  
business sales because the incremental value of additional units of office equipment  
or supplies tends to decline past some point.  
Price sensitivity increases with volume. Customers purchasing larger amounts are  
often more price sensitive than customers purchasing smaller amounts. This is  
particularly true in business-to-business settings\: corporate purchasers who buy  
large volumes are likely to be following a formal procurement process in which they  
carefully compare alternatives and will negotiate intensely to gain a lower price. A  
plumbing contractor who spends millions of dollars on galvanized pipe annually is  
much more likely to spend time and effort finding a good deal than a homeowner  
who is buying a single length of pipe at the hardware store. Volume discounting is  
one way that a seller can differentiate among large-volume, highly price-sensitive  
customers and smaller-volume, less price-sensitive customers. In this case, volume  
discounting is a form of product-based customer segmentation.  
The discounts shown in Table 6.4 are non-incremental because the discount applies to  
the entire order. This can lead to negative incremental prices. For example, according to  
the second column in Table 6.4, a customer ordering 50 signs would pay \$1.25 per unit for 142  
price differentiation  
a total cost of \$62.50, whereas if he ordered 51 signs, he would pay \$1.20 per unit for a total  
cost of \$61.20. The incremental price of the 51st sign is − \$1.30. Negative incremental prices  
are arguably bad things in that they can encourage overconsumption and lost potential  
revenue. In incremental discounting, additional discounts are applied only to additional  
units — not to the entire order. A common example of incremental pricing in consumer  
markets is “Buy one, get the second at half price.”  
Volume discounts are often applied based on total volume of business over some period,  
rather than on size of a single order. This is often accomplished in consumer markets by  
frequent-buyer schemes such as the airlines’ frequent-flyer programs. My local coffee shop  
keeps track of my purchases and gives me every 10th cup free. The stated purpose of such  
programs is to reward loyal customers, but they also serve the purpose of lowering the real  
price seen by frequent purchasers, who are likely to be more price sensitive. This practice is  
extremely common in business-to-business settings, in which discounts are often applied  
based on sales volume in a quarter or other period. Electronics distributors resell electron-  
ics goods to retailers, government, and educational institutions. A manufacturer \(such as  
Hewlett-Packard\) selling through the distributor will offer a progressive end-of-quarter  
rebate based on how much of its product the distributor has sold during the quarter. For  
example, Acme Electronics might offer a 0.5% rebate if the distributor sells between \$1 mil-  
lion and \$1.499 million worth of Acme products during the quarter, a 0.75% rebate if the  
distributor sells between \$1.5 million and \$1.999 million, and a 1% rebate if the distributor  
sells over \$2 million. In freight transportation, a carrier will often offer a higher discount if  
a shipper commits to a higher volume of business over some future period.  
Combining different terms and discount structures can lead to an extremely wide vari-  
ety of volume discount schemes. All of these schemes are designed to exploit the decreas-  
ing marginal value of purchasers and /or the higher price sensitivity of large purchasers.  
In the case of decreasing marginal values, a seller could, in theory, capture the maximum  
contribution by pricing each additional unit at the willingness to pay of the customer for  
that unit. Of course, this is impossible because the seller is selling to a mixture of customers  
with different willingness-to-pay values and the exact willingness to pay of each customer  
is unknown. However, given overall demand curves for purchases of different sizes, a seller  
can derive a volume discounting scheme that will increase contribution relative to charging  
a single price.  
How should we think about setting volume discounts? Here we consider a simple case of  
a single customer \(or a population of identical customers\) with decreasing marginal utility  
for an item and show how volume discounting can be used to extract additional revenue  
and profitability. \(Warning\: While the example is conceptually simple, the algebra can be  
a bit tedious.\)  
Consider a single customer \(or a population of identical customers\) with utility given by  
u x A x  
\( \)= , where x is the number of units purchased and A \> 0 is a parameter. This utility  
function is shown in Figure 6.6. We assume for convenience that the customer can purchase  
fractional units. Note that the customer’s marginal utility is given by ′  
u x A / x  
\( \) \)  
=  
\(2 , so  
her marginal utility is decreasing for all x \> 0, which implies that her price sensitivity in-  
creases with the number of units she purchases. price differentiation 143

Now, assume that the product is offered at a single price p \> 0. Then, for any purchase  
amount d, the total utility to the customer after the purchase is u\(d\) – pd. We can deter-  
mine the purchase volume that will maximize her utility by solving the first-order condi-  
tion u'\(d\) = p. In this case, p A / x \)= \(2 , which after rearranging gives

p  
Equation 6.1 is the customer’s individual price-response function; that is, for any price p that  
the seller offers, it shows how many units she will purchase. Note that d\(p\) is continuous and  
decreasing in price, consistent with the general requirement for price-response functions.  
Assume that the seller has a constant unit cost c \> 0. With a single price, a profit-max-  
imizing seller will seek to set the price that maximizes π\(p\) = \(p – c\)d\(p\). The profit-max-  
imizing price can be found from the standard first-order condition π'\(p\) = 0. In this case,  
π\(p\) = \(p – c\)A2/4p2, which means that the first-order condition is

. \(6.2\)  
Equation 6.2 has a single finite root at p\* = 2c, which means that the profit-maximizing  
seller will set a price equal to two times his cost. His corresponding sales and profit can be  
computed by substituting p\* into Equation 6.1\: the resulting sales are d\(p\*\) = A2/16c2, and  
the corresponding profit is π\(p\*\) = A2/16c.  
We now consider the case in which the seller offers two prices with a single volume  
discount tier. In this case, the seller sets a triplet x1, p1, p2, with p1 \> p2 \> c. If the customer  
purchases x  x1 units, she will be charged p1x. If she purchases x \> x1 units, she will be  
charged p1x1 + p2\(x – x1\). The question facing the seller is what values of x1, p1, and p2 to set  
to maximize profit.  
At first it would seem that the seller has three variables to compute. However, a little  
reflection should convince you that, for optimality, it must be the case that x1  
\*  
= x\(p1  
\*\)— that 144  
price differentiation  
is, the sales threshold for the discount must be equal to the demand at the undiscounted  
price. If x1  
\* \< x\(p1  
\*\), then the seller could increase revenue by increasing x1  
\* and selling the  
additional units at p1 rather than p2. If x1  
\* \> x\(p1  
\*\), the seller is not selling anything at the  
discount price and he can decrease x1  
\* without decreasing sales or revenue. Thus, we can  
formulate the seller’s problem in terms of just p1 and p2. The corresponding optimization  
problem faced by the seller is

That is, the optimal profit from the volume discount is 56.25% greater than with the single  
price. This represents a substantial increase, which suggests why volume discounts — often  
with many discount points — are popular, especially in business-to-business settings.  
Results from both the single-price and the volume discount case are shown in Table 6.5.  
Two things are notable in the volume discount case. First, the first price is higher and the  
second price is lower than the optimal single price. This is typical. However, it means that, price differentiation 145

to be effective, volume discounting requires that a large fraction of the customers want to  
purchase in volume — if only a small number of customers are volume purchasers, the loss  
from increasing the initial price to enable the volume discount may outweigh the benefits.  
Second, total sales are significantly higher with two prices than with a single price.  
Finally, it is important to remember that, like any market segmentation scheme, volume  
discounts provide opportunities for arbitrage. Referring to the price schedules in Table  
6.4, a 4-pack of Duracell batteries costs 4 × \$1.49 = \$5.96. An enterprising entrepreneur  
could purchase a 24-pack of Duracell batteries for 24 × \$0.68 = \$16.32, repackage them as  
six 4-packs, and sell them for \$5.00 apiece, realizing a profit of \$30.00 − \$16.32 = \$13.68,  
minus any repackaging costs. Many internet resellers make a living by finding and exploit-  
ing such opportunities for arbitrage. To avoid such arbitrage \(not to mention out-and-out  
piracy\), software companies often require users to register to receive future support and  
maintenance. In other cases, bulk and volume purchasers are required to sign a contract  
that prohibits them from reselling for profit. However, in many cases, the potential for  
arbitrage limits the potential for volume discounting.  
6.6.2 Bundling  
A bundle is a collection of products, services, or attributes sold as a package in which the  
price of a bundle is less than the sum of the individual parts. This means that bundling is a  
form of nonlinear pricing. Bundling may be motivated by the fact that the cost of providing  
a bundle is less than the cost of delivering the individual components — for example, the  
shipping cost of 20 items delivered together may be less than 20 times the shipping costs of  
the individual items. However, as we see in this section, it is also a way to extract additional  
sales by pricing in a way that increases sales in different market segments.  
Bundling can be used in a simple way for complementary products — say, hot dogs and  
hot-dog buns. Consumers may be divided into three groups — those who have hot dogs at  
home and need buns, those who have buns at home and need hot dogs, and those who have  
neither and need both to enjoy the full hot-dog experience. If the seller prices buns at \$6  
per pack and hot dogs at \$10 per pack, it may be worthwhile for him to offer a bundle of hot  
dogs and buns at \$15 per pack to sell more hot dogs and buns to the third group without  
cannibalizing sales to the first two. The reasoning and analysis in this case is similar to those  
of volume discounts.  
A more interesting use of bundling is with noncomplementary products. Assume that  
Microsoft is offering Excel and Word in a business marketplace that consists of four 146

Word 200 50 450 400  
Bundle 600 500 500 600  
­ segments\: bankers, traders, lawyers, and consultants. The willingness to pay of each of  
these segments for each of the two products is shown in Table 6.6. For simplicity, we as-  
sume that the size of each market segment is equal to 20,000. What is the optimal price if  
Microsoft offers each product separately? With some calculation, it is easy to see that the  
optimal prices are \$400 for Excel and \$400 for Word. At these prices, the bankers and the  
traders will buy Excel with revenue of \$400  40,000 = \$16MM \(million\), and the lawyers  
and consultants will buy Word with revenue of \$400  40,000 = \$16MM for a total of  
\$32MM.  
Now, what if Microsoft bundled Excel and Word together? The willingness to pay of  
each segment for the bundle is shown in the last row of Table 6.6. One option is for Micro-  
soft to only offer the bundle. In this case, the revenue-maximizing price would be \$500, and  
all of the segments would purchase for a total revenue of \$500  80,000 = \$40MM. This  
represents a 25% increase over the unbundled pricing. However, Microsoft could also offer  
the products individually in addition to the bundle. In this case, the optimal policy would  
be to price the bundle at \$600 and both Word and Excel at \$450. Bankers and consultants  
would purchase the bundle, traders would purchase Excel, and lawyers would purchase  
Word. The total revenue would be \$600  40,000 + \$450  40,000 = \$42MM, a 31.25%  
increase over the best unbundled pricing.  
When does bundling of noncomplementary products work? The most important condi-  
tion is that customer segments differ in their valuation of the individual items — if each seg-  
ment valued Excel the same, there would be no opportunity to gain revenue by bundling.  
In addition, there must be segments who have flipped preferences. That is, there must be  
one segment whose preference among products \(as measured by willingness to pay\) is dif-  
ferent than at least one other segment. In the example, bankers and traders have a higher  
willingness to pay for Excel than Word, while the opposite is true for lawyers and consult-  
ants. The fact that there are segments whose preferences are anti-correlated in this fashion is  
a precondition for bundling of noncomplementary products to be effective.  
Example 6.5  
A company offering two products to three customer segments is considering  
whether to offer a bundled product. Each segment consists of 10,000 custom-  
ers. Using consumer research, the company establishes that the willingness to  
pay for each product in each segment is as shown in Table 6.7. Looking at the  
results, the company can see that the preference order of each segment is the  
same and can conclude immediately that there will be no gain from offering a  
bundle. This can be verified by noting that the optimal individual prices for the price differentiation 147  
T A B L E 6 . 7  
Willingness to pay for different segments in Example 6.5  
Product Segment A \(\$\) Segment B \(\$\) Segment C \(\$\)  
1 50 85 30  
2 10 80 20  
Bundle 60 165 50  
two products are p1 = \$50 and p2 = \$80, generating revenue of \$180,000. If the  
company offered a bundle, the optimal bundle price would be \$165, generating  
revenue of \$165,000. This supports the conclusion that there is not an oppor-  
tunity to increase revenue by bundling in this case.  
It should be noted that the problem of optimal bundling — that is, determining the bun-  
dle or set of bundles to offer that maximizes revenue \(or profit\)—becomes extremely dif-  
ficult when the number of products becomes large. In the case of two products, there are  
three options — no bundle, bundle only, or bundle plus individual sales. In the case of  
three products, there are six options\: no bundle; three two-product bundles \(A,B\), \(B,C\),  
and \(A,C\); and a three-product bundle \(A,B,C\), which could be offered with or without  
individual sales options. In fact, the number of possible bundles of n items is given by 2n +  
1 – n, which grows quite quickly — for 20 items, there are 1,048,557 possible bundles that  
would need to be evaluated.9  
Optimal bundling of multiple products is a topic of continuing research. However,  
for practical purposes, the most important insight is that bundling of noncomplementary  
products is most effective when there are segments whose preferences are anti-correlated —  
that is, some segments prefer one product while others prefer a different product. In this  
case, a bundling strategy can often be used to increase sales and profitability. It should also  
be noted that, like volume discounts, bundles can be subject to arbitrage — if a seller is  
pricing a bundle below the sum of its constituent prices, an enterprising arbitrageur could  
purchase a bundle and sell the individual components below their individual prices. For  
this reason, bundling is often used for items for which arbitrage is difficult, like software  
or services.  
6.7 SUMMARY  
•  
•  
•  
Price differentiation is the tactic of charging different customer segments different  
prices for the same \(or nearly the same\) product or service. It can be a powerful way  
for a seller to increase contribution.  
The effectiveness of price differentiation can be limited by imperfect segmentation,  
cannibalization, or arbitrage. A poorly conceived or executed price differentiation  
scheme can result in lower contribution than a single-price scheme.  
There are a wide variety of price discrimination schemes, ranging from group pricing  
through channel and regional pricing to volume discounting and product versioning.  
The best approach or combination of approaches depends on the market. 148

•  
Product-versioning tactics are better accepted by customers and less susceptible to  
cannibalization and arbitrage than group pricing. Both inferior and superior prod-  
ucts can be used to segment customers.  
The methods for calculating differentiated prices when the supplier does not face  
capacity or supply restrictions are extensions of the methods introduced in Chapter  
5 for a supplier pricing a single product. The possibilities of cannibalization and  
arbitrage need to be specifically incorporated in order for the prices to be correct.  
The effects of price differentiation on consumer welfare \(as measured by consum-  
ers surplus\) can be either positive or negative, depending on the market and on the  
differentiation scheme. If a price differentiation scheme does not increase supply, it  
cannot increase total consumers surplus.  
Nonlinear pricing refers to a wide variety of pricing schemes in which the price for a  
number of goods is not equal to the sum of the prices of the individual goods. Com-  
mon examples include volume discounts, “buy one and get one free,” and bundling  
discounts. Applied correctly, nonlinear pricing can lead to increased sales and profit-  
ability, although arbitrage and cannibalization can limit the benefits.  
We return to the theme of price differentiation again and again. In particular, price  
differentiation is the basis of revenue management \(Chapter 8\), markdown management  
\(Chapter 12\), and customized pricing \(Chapter 13\).

1\. Arbitrage. A supplier is selling hammers in two cities, Pleasantville and Happy  
Valley. It costs him \$5.00 per hammer delivered in each city. Let p1 be the price  
of hammers in Pleasantville and p2 be the price of hammers in Happy Valley. The  
price-response curves in each city are  
Pleasantville\: d1\(p1\) = 10,000 – 800p1  
Happy Valley\: d2\(p2\) = 8,000 – 500p2  
a. Assuming the supplier can charge any prices he likes, what prices should he  
charge for hammers in Pleasantville and Happy Valley to maximize total contri-  
bution? What are the corresponding demands and total contributions? 2\. 3. price differentiation 149  
b. An enterprising arbitrageur discovers a way to transport hammers from Pleas-  
antville to Happy Valley for \$0.50 each. He begins buying hammers in Pleasant-  
ville and shipping them to Happy Valley to sell. Assuming the supplier does not  
change his prices from those given in part a, what will be the optimal price for  
the arbitrageur to sell hammers in Happy Valley? How many will he sell? What  
will his total contribution be? \(Assume that Happy Valley customers will buy  
hammers from the cheapest vendor.\) What will happen to the total sales and  
contribution for the supplier? \(Remember that he is now selling to the arbitra-  
geur too.\)  
c. The supplier decides to eliminate the arbitrage opportunity by ensuring that his  
selling price in Happy Valley is no more than \$0.50 above the selling price in  
Pleasantville \(and vice versa\). What is his new selling price in each city? What  
are his corresponding sales and total contribution?  
d. From among the Pleasantville customers, the Happy Valley customers, and the  
seller, who wins and who loses from the threat of arbitrage?  
Assume that it costs Budget \$20 per day for every car it rents out, regardless of  
model. What is the implied price elasticity of customers for each of the first five car  
types listed in Table 6.3?  
For the single-customer demand function specified by Equation 6.1, what is the  
corresponding hazard rate and price elasticity? What do they imply about the price  
calculated in Equation 6.2?notes  
1\. Definitions of first-, second-, and third-degree price discrimination were established  
by the economist Arthur Pigou in 1920, and the terms are still widely used although they  
are not exhaustive. First-degree price-discrimination refers to the case in which the seller  
charges each customer exactly her willingness to pay. Second-degree price discrimination  
refers to volume discounting. Third-degree price discrimination corresponds to what we  
call group pricing— charging different prices to different customers based on their mem-  
bership in a group \(e.g., senior citizen discounts\).  
2\. I use the term group pricing in the sense of Shapiro and Varian 1992. This should be  
distinguished from use of the term to offer lower rates to groups of customers in indus-  
tries such as the passenger airlines, hotels, and cruise lines, which is a form of volume  
discounting.

minority communities is The Color of Credit, by Stephen Ross and John Yinger \(2002\).

6\. This does not, of course, mean that Budget and Intuit are not also offering even  
deeper hidden discounts to favored customers.  
7\. In many cases, this cost will be symmetrical— that is, aij = aji. However, this is  
not always the case. For example, one country may charge a higher import duty on the  
product.  
8\. This simple calculation of social surplus is based on the assumption that society val-  
ues a dollar of producers surplus \(e.g., operating profit\) the same as a dollar of consumers  
surplus. There are at least two rationales for this assumption. The first is that corporate  
profits ultimately flow back to consumers in the form of bonuses or stock dividends. The  
second rationale is that if people wanted a different distributional outcome — say, more  
consumers surplus and less producers surplus — the tax rates could be adjusted to tax  
business more and consumers less. Under this view, producers plus consumers surplus  
establishes the size of the pie, and the first goal of economic policy should be to make  
the pie as big as possible. Needless to say, this view has been heavily criticized for, among  
other things, neglecting the extent to which businesses can influence the political process  
in their favor.  
9\. The situation is even more complex if the seller is able to offer multiple bundles; for  
example, a seller with products A, B, and C could offer \(A,B\), \(A,C\), and \(A,B,C\) as well  
as only B in isolation. In this case, the number of possible combinations of bundles is truly  
astronomical— on the order of 22n, which becomes unmanageably large for even relatively  
small values of n. In practice, sellers do not combine bundles because of the added com-  
plexity of communication to customers. 7 Pricing with Constrained SuPPly  
Chapter 5 shows how a seller can calculate the optimal single-period price when he has the  
freedom to produce \(or order\) as much of a good as he wants and he knows with certainty  
the price-response function he faces. In this case, the seller can maximize expected profit by  
charging the price at which his marginal cost equals his marginal revenue or, equivalently,  
the price at which his contribution margin ratio equals one over the elasticity. Things are  
a bit more complicated in the real world\: sellers have the freedom to adjust prices over  
many periods, they are unsure how customers will respond to different prices, and they face  
constraints on their ability to satisfy demand. In this chapter, we focus on the influence of  
constrained supply on optimal prices.  
When the supply of a good is constrained, the conditions for optimal prices presented  
in Chapter 5 do not necessarily give the price that maximizes net contribution or profit.  
Return for a moment to the example of the widget maker. With only a single period to con-  
sider and with perfect knowledge of his market, the optimal actions for him were to set his  
price at \$8.75 and produce 3,000 units. In this case, he sells all 3,000 units and makes a total  
contribution of \$11,250. This solution assumes that supply is totally flexible and demands  
are deterministic and he is only going to operate during a single period. What should he do  
if he can only manufacture 2,800 widgets? What price should he set? How does his optimal  
price change with the supply constraint? These are the sort of questions we address in this  
chapter.  
We start by looking at the nature of supply constraints and the situations in which they  
occur. We then examine how a seller can determine the optimal price to charge when faced  
by a supply constraint, and I introduce and describe the important concept of opportunity  
cost. We extend the calculation of optimal prices to the case when a supplier has a seg-  
mented market and faces supply constraints. This leads to the tactic of variable pricing,  
which is used when a supplier has multiple units of constrained capacity and can change  
prices to balance supply and demand. 152  
pricing with constrained supply  
7.1 THE NATURE OF SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS  
Most sellers face supply constraints at least some of the time. For example, most retailers re-  
plenish their stock of inventory at fixed intervals — often weekly. In between replenishment  
times, they are limited to selling their current inventory — in other words, their supply is  
fixed. In most cases, retailers stock enough inventory that a stockout is unlikely. A drugstore  
will typically have enough toothpaste, shaving cream, and aspirin in stock that it will not  
sell out, except in cases of an extraordinary run on a particular item —bottled water prior  
to a hurricane, for example. In this case, the seller may technically have a limited amount  
of inventory on hand, but he does not need to consider a supply constraint when setting  
price. There are, however, many cases in which a seller needs to consider supply constraints  
when setting a price.  
•  
•  
Service providers almost always face capacity constraints. A hotel is constrained by the  
number of rooms, a gas pipeline by the capacity of its pipes, and a barbershop by the  
number of seats \(and barbers\) it has available.  
Manufacturers face physical constraints on the amount they can produce during a  
particular period. For example, in 2018, the Mack Trucks company supplied all of  
Australia and New Zealand from a manufacturing facility west of Brisbane, Aus-  
tralia, with a capacity of 250 trucks per month. In any particular month, Mack could  
only deliver 250 new trucks plus whatever inventory it had at the beginning of the  
month.  
•  
•  
Retailers and wholesalers often sell goods that are not replenishable. These include  
fashion goods that are typically ordered once or electronic goods that are near the  
end of their life cycle.  
Intrinsically scarce or unique items, such as beachfront property, flawless blue dia-  
monds, van Gogh paintings, and Stradivarius violins, command premium prices be-  
cause of their scarcity. In these cases, marginal cost is not an important determinant  
of price because it is meaningless \(as in the case of a van Gogh painting\) or extremely  
low relative to the price that the item can command in the market \(as in the case of  
diamonds\).  
The treatment of a supply constraint depends on its nature. A hard constraint is one that  
cannot be violated at any price. Typically, hotels and gas pipelines face hard constraints.  
On the other hand, air freight carriers may have the option to lease space on other carriers  
to carry cargo in excess of their capacity. In other industries, a seller can delay delivery. A  
freight carrier that can lease additional space or can delay delivery faces a soft constraint.  
Mack Trucks’ Australian production limit is also a soft constraint because it can \(and does\)  
ask customers to wait for delivery when demand exceeds supply. Whether a supply con-  
straint is hard or soft will, in part, depend on timing. An airline that learns two months in  
advance that it will be facing very high demand for a particular flight may be able to assign  
a larger aircraft. However, it will probably not have any option to increase capacity if it only  
learns about the high demand a week before departure. pricing with constrained supply 153  
7.2 OPTIMAL PRICING WITH A SUPPLY CONSTRAINT  
In Example 5.3, the optimal unconstrained price of widgets is \$8.75, with corresponding  
demand of 3,000 units and a total contribution of \$11,250. This is optimal if the seller is  
able to manufacture all 3,000 units — or order them from a third party. But what if he can-  
not supply the 3,000 units demanded? Perhaps he has a supply chain bottleneck that limits  
his production. Perhaps he is a reseller with a fixed monthly quota he cannot exceed. In  
either case, the widget maker faces a rationing problem —he needs to determine which cus-  
tomers will be served and which will not. He has three basic options for rationing supply\:  
1\. 2. 3. Do nothing —keep the price at \$8.75 and let customers buy on a first-come, first-  
served basis until supply is exhausted.  
Allocate the limited supply to favored customers or allocate to customers using  
some other mechanism such as a lottery.  
Raise the price until demand falls to meet supply. He could do this directly by in-  
creasing the price or via an auction.  
Alternatives two and three are not mutually exclusive — the seller could use a combination  
of allocations and higher prices to manage a shortage. If he has segmented his market effec-  
tively, he could raise his average selling price by allocating most or all of the limited supply  
to higher-paying customers — this is the basic idea behind revenue management, which we  
discuss in Chapter 8.  
Note that the issue faced by the seller with constrained supply is in part an allocation  
problem— that is, determining which consumers get to possess the desired product or ser-  
vice that he is selling. Options such as first come, first served and lotteries allocate the  
product to the early or the lucky, respectively. Other options are to choose recipients based  
on characteristics such as loyalty or volume of business. When the 2011 floods in Thailand  
drastically cut the global supply of DRAM chips, many sellers chose not to raise prices to  
the market-clearing level and allocated the limited supply to their most valued customers.  
Many sold-out concerts use first come, first served as an allocation rule. Both of these ap-  
proaches appear to be broadly considered fair by customers — although both are also sub-  
ject to the possibility of arbitrage in which customers who purchase at the lower price may  
resell at the higher price — a practice known as scalping in the case of concert or sporting  
tickets. The approach discussed in this chapter uses price as the allocation method — goods  
are sold to those who have the highest willingness to pay.1 Economists would argue that this  
is the most efficient approach to allocating scarce goods and, if arbitrage would otherwise  
occur, it results in exactly the same allocation at exactly the same prices, except that all of  
the economic rent accrues to the seller rather than scalpers or other middlemen.  
Even in the absence of arbitrage, raising the price of a scarce good generally increases  
expected social welfare. Consider the case of a concert with a uniform general admission  
price of \$25. There is only one seat remaining for sale, but there are two customers who  
would like tickets. One has willingness to pay of \$30, and one has willingness to pay of \$75.  
If the concert promoter holds the ticket price at \$25 and uses first come, first served or a 154  
pricing with constrained supply  
lottery to allocate the ticket, then there is an equal chance that either customer will get the  
ticket for \$25, resulting in expected consumers surplus of 0.5  \(\$30 – \$25\) + 0.5  \(\$70 –  
\$25\) = \$25, which, added to the producers surplus of \$25, gives a total social surplus of \$50.  
If the concert promoter raises the price of the last ticket to \$40, then consumers surplus is  
\$70 – \$40 = \$30, which, added to the producers surplus of \$40, gives a total surplus of \$70.  
Note that, in this case, both expected consumers surplus and producers surplus \(profit\)  
increased when the price of the ticket was raised. In many cases, however, using price as the  
sole mechanism to allocate a scarce good is frowned on by consumers and needs to be used  
with care. Chapter 14 discusses some of the issues with consumer acceptance of the practice  
of pricing to allocate scarce supply.  
Let us return to the case of the widget maker and assume that he has decided to use price  
as the mechanism to allocate scarce widgets. Then he can find the price that maximizes his  
contribution margin by solving the constrained-optimization problem  
max d\(p\)\(p – c\),  
subject to  
d\(p\) ≤ b,  
where b is the maximum supply available. Let p\* be the optimal unconstrained price. If d\(p\*\)  
≤ b, the supplier does not need to do any further calculations\: p\* is also the optimal con-  
strained price. If, on the other hand, he finds that d\(p\*\) \> b, then he needs to charge a higher  
price than p\* in order to maximize contribution. This situation is illustrated in Figure 7.1.  
Here, the capacity constraint is a horizontal line—the supplier can only produce quantities  
below that line. At the optimal unconstrained price, p\*, demand d\(p\*\) exceeds capacity.  
When the optimal unconstrained price generates demand that exceeds capacity, the sup-  
plier needs to calculate the runout price—that is, the price at which demand would exactly  
equal the supply constraint. In Figure 7.1, the runout price is the price p¯ at which the price-  
response function intersects the capacity constraint. In other words, p¯ is the price at which  
d\(p¯\) = b.  
Example 7.1  
Assume the widget seller faces the price-response function d\(p\) = 10,000 –  
800p but can only supply a maximum of 2,000 widgets during the upcoming  
week. Demand at the optimal unconstrained price of \$8.75 is 3,000 widgets.  
Therefore, the runout price can be determined by finding p¯ such that 10,000 –  
800p¯ = 2,000 or p¯ = \$10.00.  
The general principle behind calculating the optimal price with a supply constraint is  
the following.  
The profit-maximizing price under a supply constraint is equal to the maximum of the runout  
price and the unconstrained profit-maximizing price. As a consequence, the profit-maximizing  
price under a supply constraint is always greater than or equal to the unconstrained profit-  
maximizing price. pricing with constrained supply 155

This principle is the same for the revenue-maximizing price, which is simply the profit-  
maximizing price with associated cost of 0.  
The effects of different levels of capacity constraint on price and total revenue are shown  
in Table 7.1. For a binding capacity constraint, b \< 3,000, the runout price can be found by  
inverting the price-response function\:

Table 7.1 shows the results of reducing capacity incrementally from 3,000 units per month  
to 1,000 units per month. The optimal price increases steadily as the capacity decreases. As  
capacity becomes increasingly constrained, there is more and more pressure on the seller  
to increase the price.  
7.3 OPPORTUNITY COST  
Everything else being equal, imposing a supply constraint can only reduce contribution. An  
auto manufacturer experiencing a strike that takes 25% of capacity out of production for a  
month will likely see lower profits for that month than if all of the capacity were available.

pricing with constrained supply  
A 200-room hotel that takes 50 rooms out of service for two months to be refurbished is  
likely to give up some potential revenue. As shown in Table 7.1, the deeper or more binding  
a supply constraint cuts, the greater the hit the seller is likely to take on his contribution.  
Taking 75 rooms out of service for two months will lead to less overall contribution than  
taking 50 rooms out of service for the same period of time.  
The reduction in contribution resulting from a supply constraint is called the opportunity  
cost associated with that constraint. It is the difference between the maximum contribution  
the supplier could realize without the constraint and the maximum contribution with the  
constraint. Since the constrained contribution can never be greater than the unconstrained  
contribution, total opportunity cost will always be greater than or equal to zero.  
Example 7.2  
In Example 7.1, the optimal price for widgets with a supply constraint of 2,000  
widgets per week is \$10.00 per widget, with a total contribution of \(\$10.00 –  
\$5.00\)  2,000 = \$10,000. The optimal unconstrained price of widgets is  
\$8.75, with demand of 3,000 and corresponding total contribution of \(\$8.75 –  
\$5.00\)  3,000 = \$11,250. The total opportunity cost of the supply constraint  
is \$11,250 – \$10,000 = \$1,250.  
Total opportunity cost is the maximum amount the seller would be willing to pay to  
eliminate his supply constraint entirely. In many cases, the more interesting question is how  
much the supplier would be willing to pay for one additional unit of supply or capacity.  
This is the marginal opportunity cost.  
Example 7.3  
The marginal opportunity cost for the widget seller facing a constraint of 2,000  
widgets per week can be found by solving the constrained-optimization prob-  
lem with a supply constraint of 2,001 and subtracting the optimal contribution  
with a supply constraint of 2,000. When the supply constraint is 2,001, the  
optimal contribution is \$10,002.50. Thus, the marginal opportunity cost of the  
supply constraint is equal to \$10,002.50 – \$10,000.00 = \$2.50.  
Optimal contributions, prices, and marginal opportunity costs for the widget example  
are shown in Table 7.1. Note that as the amount of available capacity decreases \(i.e., the  
supply constraint becomes more binding\), the optimal price and the marginal opportunity  
cost both increase. The marginal opportunity cost is zero when the capacity constraint is  
not binding —which is the case for any constraint above 3,000 units. This illustrates the  
following general principle.  
Total and marginal opportunity costs are nonzero only when there is a supply or capacity con-  
straint that is binding at the optimal unconstrained price. Otherwise they are zero.  
The opportunity cost can be an important input to other corporate decisions. From  
Table 7.1 we can see that the marginal opportunity cost faced by the supplier is \$2.50 per pricing with constrained supply 157  
widget when supply is limited to 2,000 units. This means that the widget maker would be  
willing to pay up to \$2.50 in rent for an additional unit of capacity that allowed him to make  
one more widget at a cost of \$5.00. Alternatively, he would be willing to pay up to \$2.50 +  
\$5.00 to buy another widget from a wholesaler. Fundamentally, the opportunity cost asso-  
ciated with constrained capacity is an economic measure of how much the company would  
be willing to pay for additional capacity. By calculating and utilizing this information in  
its supply decisions, companies can drive higher returns than they could from optimizing  
their pricing and their supply decisions in isolation.  
7.4 MARKET SEGMENTATION AND SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS  
Market segmentation can be a powerful tool for increasing profitability when supply is  
constrained. To see how, let us look at an example.2  
Example 7.4  
The football game between Stanford and the University of California at Berke-  
ley \(a.k.a. the Big Game\) is going to be held at Stanford Stadium, which has  
60,000 seats. Customers can be segmented into students \(those carrying a stu-  
dent ID card\) and the general public. We assume that the price-response func-  
tions for each of these segments is  
General public\: d  
g\(pg\) = \(120,000 – 3,000pg  
\)+  
\(7.1\)  
Students\: d  
s\(ps\) = \(20,000 – 1,250ps  
\)+  
, \(7.2\)  
where pg is the price charged to the general public and ps is the student price.  
What if Stanford can only charge a single price to all? In this case, the aggre-  
gate price-response function is d\(p\) = \(120,000 – 3,000p\)+ + \(20,000 – 1,250p\)+  
and the optimal price will be \$20.00. At this price, Stanford would sell exactly  
60,000 tickets, grossing \$1,200,000. Note that all ticket sales would be to the  
general public. The students are priced out of the market, since the highest  
willingness to pay of any student is 20,000/1,250 = \$16.00.  
Now, what if Stanford could charge different ticket prices to students versus the general  
public? Then finding the optimal price requires solving the constrained-optimization prob-  
lem  
maximize pg \(120,000 – 3,000pg  
\)+ + ps \(20,000 – 1,250ps  
\)+  
, \(7.3\)  
subject to  
\(120,000 – 3,000pg  
\)+ + \(20,000 – 1,250ps  
\)+  60,000.  
We could, of course, solve this problem directly. However, we gain more insight by using  
the principle established in Chapter 6\: Prices should be set for the two different segments so  
that the marginal revenues from both segments are equal. When supply is unconstrained, 158  
pricing with constrained supply  
marginal revenues should all be set to the marginal cost. When supply is constrained, mar-  
ginal revenues should still be equated, but they need to be set so the supply constraint is  
satisfied.  
Example 7.5  
We want to find the revenue-maximizing prices for students and the general  
public. The marginal opportunity cost is 2pg – 40 for the general public and  
2ps – 16 for students. Equating the two marginal revenues and simplifying gives  
pg  
= ps + 12\. In other words, the ticket price for the general public will be \$12.00  
higher than the ticket price for students. The other condition that must be sat-  
isfied is that the total demand from both students and the general public be  
equal to the capacity of the stadium; that is, \(120,000 – 3,000pg\)+ + \(20,000 –  
1,250ps\)+ = 60,000, which, when simplified, gives 3pg  
+ 1.25ps = 80\. Solving  
both conditions simultaneously gives ps = \$10.35 and pg = \$22.35. At these  
prices, Stanford will sell 52,941 tickets to the general public and 7,059 seats to  
students, generating revenue of \$1,256,471, a 4.7% increase over the best that  
could be achieved with a single ticket price.  
Note that the profit-maximizing price for the general public is more than double the stu-  
dent price. The stadium is sold out and there are thousands of people who would be willing  
to pay much more than the student price. Yet the profit-maximizing decision for Stanford  
is to sell more seats to students at a deep discount. In this case, the effect of market segmen-  
tation is that students win while the general public loses. Market segmentation reduces the  
price of tickets for the more price-sensitive students while increasing the price for the less  
price-sensitive general public.  
The optimal prices assumed that the marginal costs — and ancillary revenues — of serv-  
ing both students and the general public were the same. Differences in either marginal costs  
or ancillary revenues between the two market segments would lead to different optimal  
prices \(see Exercise 3\). The results also relied on a perfect fence between the student and  
the general public segments. The optimal prices and revenues would change if student sales  
cannibalized sales to the general public \(see Exercise 1\).  
7.5 VARIABLE PRICING  
Consider the following pricing tactics.  
•  
•  
Disney World charges a different price for its general admission by day and length of  
ticket. The average cost of a ticket per day for each starting day in January 2020 and  
length-of-ticket from one to seven days is shown in Table 7.2. Average daily prices  
range from \$139 for a one-day ticket on January 1 to \$62 for a seven-day ticket start-  
ing January 19.  
The San Francisco Opera charges a lower price for weeknight performances than for  
weekend performances. The most expensive box seats cost \$175 for a Wednesday  
performance and \$195 for a Saturday performance, while the least expensive balcony pricing with constrained supply 159

Major League Baseball teams in the United States set different prices for different  
games, depending on factors such as weekday versus weekend, time of year, oppo-  
nent, and special events. The pricing schedule for the Colorado Rockies in 2004 is  
shown in Table 7.3.  
The Gulf Power Company is an electric utility serving more than 428,000 residen-  
tial customers in northwestern Florida. The majority of these residential customers  
pay a flat rate of \$0.114 per kilowatt hour for electricity. However, Gulf Power offers  
residential customers the alternative of purchasing their electricity under its Resi-  
dential Select Variable Pricing \(RSVP\) program. Under the RSVP program, each  
weekday is divided into an off-peak, a shoulder, and an on-peak period. Electricity  
costs \$0.083 per kilowatt hour \(kWh\) during the off-peak period, \$0.1046 during the  
shoulder period, and \$0.189 during the on-peak period. In the summer the week-  
day on-peak period is from 1\:00 p.m. to 6\:00 p.m., while in the winter the weekday  
on-peak period is from 6\:00 a.m. to 10\:00 a.m. The summer off-peak period is from 160

What do these four pricing tactics have in common? They are all cases in which a seller  
with constrained capacity adjusts prices in response to anticipated demand in order to  
maximize return from fixed capacity. We call this tactic variable pricing. Industries where  
variable pricing is employed share four characteristics\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Demand is variable but follows a predictable pattern.  
The capacity of a seller is fixed in the short run \(or is expensive to change\).  
Inventory is perishable or expensive to store — otherwise buyers would learn to pre-  
dict the variation in prices and stockpile when the price is low.  
The seller has the ability to set prices in response to anticipated supply and demand  
imbalances.  
Under these conditions, sellers can use variable prices to shape demand to meet fixed ca-  
pacity \(or supply\) by exploiting differences in customer preference. More people want to  
visit Disney World during the first week in January than during the third week in February.  
Weekday opera performances are less popular than weekend performances. The Rockies  
know that a game against the Yankees will generate more demand than a game against the  
Cincinnati Reds. The highest electricity prices correspond to the periods of highest use  
and the lowest prices to the periods of lowest use. Variable pricing does not qualify as pure  
group pricing; rather, it is a form of product differentiation because it allows customers to  
choose among different products based on price.  
Note that variable pricing can either be static or dynamic. Under static variable pric-  
ing, prices are set once in advance and do not change as new information is obtained. The  
Colorado Rockies’ ticket pricing scheme shown in Table 7.3 and the Gulf Power Company  
RSVP rate plan are both examples of static variable pricing. Under dynamic variable pric-  
ing, prices can be changed as new information is received. For example, many sporting  
teams now change prices as the season advances and tickets become either more or less in  
demand as a result of team performance. pricing with constrained supply 161

7.5.1 The Basics of Variable Pricing  
Consider a hypothetical theme park that can serve up to 1,000 customers per day. The  
theme park charges a single admission price, and all rides are free after admission. Dur-  
ing the summer, demand follows a stable and predictable pattern, with higher demand on  
weekends than during weekdays. We assume that demands for different days of the week  
are independent; that the price-response functions are linear, with intercepts and slopes,  
as shown in Table 7.4; and that the theme park has a marginal cost of zero per customer.  
What price should the theme park charge without variable pricing? Since its marginal  
cost is zero, it maximizes contribution by maximizing revenue. The revenue-maximizing  
single price can be found by solving the nonlinear optimization problem

subject to  
xi ≤ Di + mi p xi ≤ C p ≥ 0,  
for i = 1, 2, . . . , 7,  
for i = 1, 2, . . . , 7,  
where p is the optimal single price, xi is attendance on each day, Di and mi are, respectively,  
the intercept and slope of the price-response function for day i, and C is total daily capacity  
\(in this case 1,000\). The optimal single price is \$25.00 per ticket. The corresponding attend-  
ance and revenue for each day are shown in the columns labeled “Single price” in Table  
7.5\. With a single price, the theme park serves a total of 4,795 customers during the week,  
with total revenue of \$119,900. What is striking in Table 7.5 is the wide variation in attend-  
ance across the week. The park is full on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, but it operates at  
only 25% of capacity on Monday and 40% of capacity on Tuesday. Furthermore, potential  
customers are being turned away on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday —500 on Saturday alone.  
These two conditions —wide variation in utilization and a large number of turndowns —  
are indications that contribution could be improved through variable pricing. In the case  
of the theme park, this means charging a different price for each day. When demands are  
independent — as we have assumed — the optimal daily prices can be calculated by solving 162  
pricing with constrained supply

independent optimization problems for each day. The resulting daily prices, attendance, and  
revenues are shown in the columns labeled “Variable pricing” in Table 7.5. With variable  
pricing, daily prices range from a low of \$15.00 on Monday to a high of \$38.33 on Saturday.  
The total number of customers served during the week rises 29% from 4,795 to 6,205, and  
total revenue rises 30% to \$155,294. Note that variable pricing evens out utilization across  
days of the week and increases overall utilization. Attendance on the low days of Monday  
and Tuesday increases from 250 and 400 to 750 and 700, respectively. The weekly utilization  
of the park—its load factor—increases from 4,795/7,000 = 68.5% to 6,205/7,000 = 88.6%.  
The average price paid by all customers increases only slightly under variable pricing —  
from \$25.00 to \$25.03. This is typical—variable pricing can often lead to a major increase  
in total revenue with only a small increase in the average price paid by customers.  
7.5.2 Variable Pricing with Diversion  
We have seen that variable pricing can increase operating contribution when demands are  
independent among periods. However, variable pricing can also shift demand from peak  
periods to off-peak periods — a phenomenon called diversion or demand shifting. Diversion  
occurs when at least some customers are flexible and will shift their consumption among  
periods if they can save money by doing so. Diversion can be illustrated by an example from  
Robert Cross \(1997\). His local barbershop was overcrowded and turning customers away  
on Saturdays, while Tuesdays were very slow. Some of the Saturday customers were work-  
ing people who could only come on Saturday; others were retirees and schoolchildren, who  
could get their hair cut any day of the week. By raising prices 20% on Saturday and reduc-  
ing them by 20% on Tuesday, the shop induced some of the Saturday customers to shift  
to Tuesday. As a result of this simple peak-pricing action, turnaways decreased, Saturday  
service improved, and total revenue increased by almost 20%.  
Variable pricing segments the market for a generic product \(a haircut\) between those  
with strong preferences for a particular date and those who are relatively indifferent. Since  
customer preferences are not evenly distributed — more people want to see an opera, at-  
tend a theme park, or get their hair cut on a weekend — and capacity is fixed, using price to  
shift indifferent customers to less popular dates can increase both revenue and utilization  
and reduce turnaways. In the case of the Colorado Rockies, the four-tiered pricing system pricing with constrained supply 163  
segments the market between customers who badly want to see a popular game \(such as  
one against the Yankees\) from those who just want a night out at the ballpark. Furthermore,  
variable pricing is generally well accepted because it segments via self-selection\: customers  
choose the product and price combination they prefer.  
While diversion is an important element of variable pricing, it can be a two-edged sword.  
Raising the price for peak capacity and lowering it for off-peak capacity will shift custom-  
ers from the peak to the off-peak period. This is good \(at least in moderation\) because the  
overall gain from extracting higher prices from the remaining peak customers outweighs  
the lower price received for off-peak customers. However, if the price differential becomes  
too great, we would expect more and more peak customers to defect to the off-peak period.  
If the barbershop drops Tuesday prices too low and raises Saturday prices too high, it might  
end up with a Tuesday peak and very slow Saturdays. Ultimately the loss from peak custom-  
ers who shift to the cheaper off-peak period \(cannibalization\) can outweigh the benefits of  
off-peak demand induction and higher peak rates.  
While diversion is easy to describe, it is difficult to model. In effect, the different alter-  
natives are substitute products, and each pair could have a different cross-price elasticity.  
One approach is to presume that every customer has a separate willingness to pay for each  
alternative. Each customer would compare his willingness to pay for each alternative with  
the price and purchase the alternative that provided the highest positive surplus — assum-  
ing that such an alternative exists.  
Example 7.6  
Under the separate-willingness-to-pay model, each customer would have  
a separate willingness to pay for attendance on each day at the theme park.  
The willingness to pay of each customer can be represented as a vector, so a  
customer with willingness-to-pay vector of \(\$30, \$18, \$22, \$19, \$14, \$18, \$32\)  
would have a \$30 willingness to pay for Sunday attendance, an \$18 willingness  
to pay for Monday attendance, and so on. We can represent the vector of prices  
in the same fashion\: \(\$33.87, \$15.00, \$17.50, \$18.01, \$19.00, \$27.00, \$38.33\).  
The consumers surplus vector for this customer is the difference between her  
willingness to pay and the price for each day, here \(− \$3.87, \$3.00, \$4.50, \$0.99,  
− \$5.00, − \$9.00, − \$6.33\). In this case, the customer would attend on Tuesday  
because that provides her with the highest surplus \(\$4.50\). For comparison, the  
consumers surplus for this customer under a constant price of \$25.00 would  
be \(\$5.00, − \$7.00, − \$3.00, − \$6.00, − \$11.00, − \$7.00, \$7.00\), which means she  
would attend on Saturday. The effect of variable pricing on this customer is to  
shift her attendance from Saturday to Tuesday.  
While the willingness-to-pay point of view helps us understand how an individual con-  
sumer might act, it is difficult to extend to a useful model of total market price responsive-  
ness. If we knew the distribution of all customer willingness to pay across the population,  
we could, in theory, use that information to derive a multidimensional demand function.  
One problem is that this model would require 7 own-price elasticities \(1 for each day of 164  
pricing with constrained supply  
the week\) and 42 cross-price elasticities \(1 for each combination of days of the week\). It is  
unlikely that the theme park \(or most other companies\) would have the data available to  
estimate a credible model with this many parameters.  
We can use a much simpler approach to incorporating diversion in the theme park  
­ example —we assume that eight customers will shift from one day to another for every  
\$1 difference in price. Thus, if the base prices for Monday and Tuesday were \$20 and \$22,  
respectively, we would first calculate a base demand for each day using its individual lin-  
ear price-response function and then shift 16 people from Tuesday to Monday. When  
applied across the whole week, this means that demand will shift from days with higher-  
than-­ average prices to those with lower-than-average prices. Under this model, the uncon-  
strained demand the theme park will see on day i is given by

where di is the unconstrained demand, pi is the price, Di is the demand at zero price, and  
mi is the slope of the linear price-response function for day i. Demand for each day now  
depends not only on the price for that day but on the price for all the other days of the week.  
We can now formulate the optimal pricing problem as a nonlinear optimization problem\:

The optimal prices, attendance, and revenue under this model are shown in Table 7.6. Base  
demand is the number of customers calculated using the price-response functions for each  
day, and net diversion is the net number of customers induced to shift to or from each day  
by differential pricing. A positive net diversion means that more customers shifted to that  
day than shifted away; a negative net diversion means the opposite. Variable pricing shifted

a total of 838 customers from the peak days of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to the off-peak  
days of Monday through Thursday. Furthermore, the theme park served 6,609 total cus-  
tomers during the week, resulting in a 94% utilization and total revenue of \$156,536 — a  
dramatic improvement over charging a single price.  
Of course, the theme park operator might not want to set prices exactly as shown in  
Table 7.6. For simplicity, he may want to reduce the total number of prices and only offer  
prices in increments of \$5. In this case, it is easy to see that he would still gain significant  
revenue from a three-tier pricing policy of \$30 on weekends, \$25 on Friday, and \$20 on  
Monday through Thursday, as opposed to setting a constant price of \$25.  
Variable pricing does not need to be implemented within list prices. The theme park  
could implement two-tier pricing by establishing a \$30 list price but distributing \$10-off  
coupons redeemable only on weekdays. Even more effectively, the theme park might estab-  
lish a \$35 price for weekends and Friday, a \$20 price for Monday through Thursday, and  
distribute \$5-off coupons redeemable only for Monday admissions. In this case, variable  
pricing has been implemented through a combination of variable list pricing and coupon-  
ing.  
7.6 VARIABLE PRICING IN ACTION  
We now consider how variable pricing is used in four different industries — sporting events,  
airlines, electric power, and ride-sharing. We also look at two industries — movie theaters  
and restaurants — that meet all the criteria for variable pricing but in which variable pricing  
is little used.  
7.6.1 Sporting Events and Entertainment  
Some of the most obvious candidates for variable pricing are sporting events and other  
forms of entertainment such as concerts and theater. In most cases, sporting arenas, con-  
cert venues, and theaters have fixed capacity but demands that vary depending on the offer-  
ing. A further sign of the potential for variable pricing in these industries is the prevalence  
of a robust secondary market for tickets. For much of history, this secondary market was  
driven by scalpers \(called ticket touts in the UK\) who would purchase tickets at list price  
with the expectation of selling at a premium. More recently, companies such as StubHub  
and RazorGator have enabled online resale of tickets. The existence of this secondary mar-  
ketplace was driven in large part by the fact that concert promoters and sporting teams were  
unable or unwilling to adjust prices to balance supply and demand.  
Around the beginning of this century, sporting teams began to experiment with variable  
pricing. Variable pricing is particularly attractive in baseball since each team has 81 home  
games each season that vary widely in terms of fan appeal. The Colorado Rockies were  
among the earliest adopters, instituting the variable-pricing scheme shown in Table 7.3 in  
2004\. Over the next 15 years or so, every team in Major League Baseball followed suit, with  
the New York Yankees being the last to adopt variable pricing in 2017 \(Best 2017\). While  
there was some resistance from fans, variable pricing was generally viewed as ­ successful,  
which has spurred uptake in other leagues including the National Football League, the Na- 166  
pricing with constrained supply  
tional Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, and the Premier League \(soc-  
cer\) in England, among others.  
Many sporting teams employ dynamic variable pricing, establishing an initial set of  
prices according to a scheme such as that shown in Table 7.3. However, prices can also be  
updated over time based on information gained as the season progresses —broadly speak-  
ing, if the team is doing well, prices will increase; if they are doing poorly, prices will drop.  
Prices may also be adjusted based on weather, the record of the opposing team, or the  
emergence of a popular player \(for example, it was estimated that, in the 1991–1992 NBA  
season, Michael Jordan generated over \$50 million in revenue for opposing teams through  
increased attendance and ancillary revenue\).4  
Sporting teams like variable pricing because it increases total revenue without increasing  
ticket prices. This is attractive in an environment where ticket price increases are likely to  
be condemned by fans and sportswriters as evidence of greedy owners and players gouging  
loyal fans. In 2003, the New York Mets adopted a variable-pricing plan under which the  
price was increased \$10 for the 17 most popular games while lowering or holding prices un-  
changed for 43 games. “That allowed the Mets, who finished last in their division in 2002, to  
trumpet the plan as holding ticket price increases to only 4% on average” \(Fatsis 2003, 82\).  
Broadway and other long-run theaters are also an ideal candidate for variable pricing —  
demand varies in predictable ways across seasons and by the day of the week, and custom-  
ers purchase advance tickets. Nonetheless, theaters were relatively slow to adopt variable  
pricing beyond charging more for weekend night shows than matinees and weekday nights.  
One of the pioneers in dynamic pricing in Broadway theater was Disney’s The Lion King. As  
Disney vice president David Schrader described pricing for The Lion King, “First the range  
of prices across the theater is set according to an estimate of the demand for a particular  
performance, based on the 15 years of past B.O. \[box office\] from which to extrapolate an-  
nual trends. Second, after tickets go on sale, Disney re-examines each perf \[performance\] to  
see how demand is shaping up in reality, and then tweaks pricing accordingly” \(Cox 2013,  
1\). Dynamic pricing was widely touted as one of the reasons that The Lion King generated  
the most revenue of any Broadway show in the least amount of time despite being in one  
of the smaller Broadway theaters.5 With the success of variable pricing at The Lion King,  
many other Broadway theaters, as well as performing arts groups such as the San Francisco  
Symphony and attractions such as the Indianapolis Zoo, have adopted more dynamic pric-  
ing. Ticketmaster, by far the largest distributor of event and sporting tickets in the United  
States, has adopted dynamic pricing to adjust prices based on expected supply and demand.  
7.6.2 Passenger Airlines  
Passenger airlines certainly meet the criteria for variable pricing — constrained capacity  
with demand that fluctuates over time. Southwest Airlines implements variable pricing  
directly by changing fares for its departures to match demand with the restricted capac-  
ity. However, the major nondiscount airlines also practice variable pricing. They do so by  
opening and closing the availability of various fare classes on different flights. Figure 7.2  
shows average fares and load factors on a flight of a major airline from the Midwest to Flor-  
ida during the winter. For operational reasons, the airline has scheduled the same aircraft pricing with constrained supply 167

for the flight each day. The airline is charging a higher average price on high-demand days  
\(Saturday and Sunday\) and lower prices on low-demand days \(Tuesday, Wednesday, and  
Thursday\). In this case, the airline is adjusting the average fare not by changing the list price  
but by opening and closing fare classes. When total demand is anticipated to be high, the  
airline will restrict availability of discount fares, causing the average fare to increase. When  
total demand is anticipated to be low, the airline will open availability of deep discounts,  
causing the average fare to drop. It is continually monitoring demand using its revenue  
management system to determine which classes to open and close on each flight. Chapters  
8 and 9 describe in detail how this is done.  
Discount airlines use variable pricing even more directly. If demand at Southwest Air-  
lines begins to rise more quickly or more slowly than anticipated, Southwest may change  
the price. Southwest is not doing this to segment customers between high-elasticity and  
low-elasticity segments — rather, it is using variable pricing without segmentation to maxi-  
mize the return from each flight and, to some extent, to smooth demand through demand  
diversion from high-fare, high-utilization flights to low-fare, low-utilization flights.  
7.6.3 Electric Power  
Electric power is another obvious candidate for variable pricing. Suppliers have constrained  
capacity, and electricity is difficult and expensive to store. Demand follows reasonably pre- 168  
pricing with constrained supply  
dictable patterns, and many customers have the flexibility and willingness to adjust their  
usage in response to prices. In fact, electric utilities have a further motivation to vary prices\:  
There are tremendous cost differences between generation during peak and off-peak peri-  
ods. For many utilities, it can be 10 times more expensive to generate power during a peak  
period than during an off-peak period. Adopting dynamic pricing could reduce generation  
costs by 8% to 20%, leading to price reductions for all customers, not just those shifting  
their consumption.6  
Despite the obvious benefits that electric suppliers and consumers could realize from  
time-of-day pricing, utilities in the United States have been slow to adopt programs that  
would adjust the price of electricity in response to changes in demand. Some of the rea-  
sons are technical, relating to the unique characteristics of electric power transmission and  
distribution. However, the most powerful reasons are political and historical. Historically,  
electric utilities were granted service monopolies over a certain territory and guaranteed  
a reasonable return on their investments in generation capacity and transmission. In re-  
turn, they submitted to government regulation of their prices to avoid abuses of monopoly  
power in pricing. While some jurisdictions are moving to less regulated regimes and seek-  
ing to encourage competition, the transition from fully regulated to a more competitive  
market for electric power has proven to be difficult and in some cases a political disaster.  
The attempt by California to deregulate its electricity market was a debacle that was one of  
the drivers behind the California governor recall and election of 2003.  
Despite the political barriers, many electric power utilities have instituted some form of  
variable-pricing program. Most of these programs are aimed at industrial customers, who  
often have the flexibility to schedule their operations to take advantage of variable prices.  
In a typical program, the electricity supplier charges the customer for electricity on an  
hour-by-hour basis, with expected prices for the next day announced 24 hours in advance.  
This enables industrial customers to reschedule their operations to minimize consumption  
costs. Programs to charge variable prices to residential customers are much rarer — the  
Gulf Power RSVP program described earlier is a typical example. It is likely that, despite set-  
backs, the trend toward more competitive power markets in the United States will continue  
and that the need for variable-pricing methods will only increase.  
7.6.4 Ride-Sharing  
Major players in the ride-share industry, such as Lyft, Uber, and Didi Chuxing, have all  
adopted dynamic pricing. These ride-share operators connect prospective riders with in-  
dependent drivers who are willing to provide transportation. When a prospective rider  
opens the app and specifies her destination, the ride-share company quotes a price that can  
depend on both the origin and the destination. The price for a particular origin and desti-  
nation combination will change over the course of time in response to current demand and  
supply conditions, as we shall see.  
While business models vary, the ride-share operator typically determines both the rider  
price, or what the rider pays, and the driver price, or what the driver will be paid for the trip.  
The ride-share operator keeps the difference between the rider price and the driver price —  
the trip margin. In most cases, the trip margin is a fixed percentage of the rider price\: as of pricing with constrained supply 169  
2019, Uber was advertising that its trip margin percentage was 25%, and Lyft was advertis-  
ing 20%. This means that, on an Uber trip costing the rider \$20, the driver would get \$15  
and Uber \$5.7 Ride-share operators typically set a time- and distance-based base rate for  
each trip. These base rates, which may vary by city, establish a minimum rider price and  
hence a minimum driver payment. However, most ride-sharing operators soon established  
dynamic pricing in which the rider price and driver price varied by time and by location.  
For the ride-sharing operators, the need to balance supply and demand motivated the  
adoption of peak-load pricing. In particular, in certain times and locations, the demand  
for rides at the base price exceeds the supply of available drivers — sometimes by a large  
margin. Demand for rides can vastly outstrip available supply at the end of the workday in  
business districts in London, Manhattan, and San Francisco; at peak airport arrival times;  
and when sporting events or concerts let out. When demand exceeds supply, a ride-sharing  
operator faces the problem of allocating constrained supply. If the operator does not raise  
the price, many customers would see long arrival times or that no cars are available. As a  
result, some customers would drop out and supply would be allocated to the customers  
who were most willing to wait. Alternatively, the ride-share operators could raise the price  
and allocate the scarce supply using prices. This is the approach that ride-share operators  
generally adopted.  
Of the dynamic pricing schemes in use by ride-sharing companies, Uber’s has been the  
most widely studied. Uber divided each city it serves into hexagons about 0.2 mile on a side,  
with each hexagon covering an area of about 0.1 square mile. In the initial application of  
“surge pricing,” the rider fare for every trip originating in a hexagon was subject to a mul-  
tiplier greater than or equal to 1. If the trip multiplier was greater than 1, then the hexagon  
was “surging” and the rider fare would be set to the trip multiplier times the base price. So,  
for example, if the base fare is equal to \$12 for a trip and the surge multiplier were 2.5, the  
rider price would be 2.5 × \$12 = \$30 plus any fees and tolls. If the trip multiplier were 1,  
then the hexagon was not surging and the rider would pay the base price plus fees and tolls.  
Under this scheme, the problem for Uber is what multiplier to apply at each time at  
each geographical location and how to update it as conditions change. The multiplier can  
be changed at relatively short intervals — typically every one to three minutes. We assume  
for the moment that the same multiplier will be applied to every ride originating in the  
same region during a time interval. The ride-sharing service typically knows the number  
of people in the area who have the app open —we denote that potential demand by D. Not  
everyone who opens the app will book a ride, and we can expect that the fraction of open  
apps that will book will depend on the multiplier applied, with a higher multiplier leading  
to a smaller fraction of potential demand booking.  
The service also knows the number of open cars in the area, S. The ride-sharing ser-  
vice needs to determine the multiplier p \(S, D\) to set as a function of the current supply  
and ­ demand situation. If D ≤ S, then p \(S, D\) = 1. In this case, there is sufficient supply to  
serve demand even if every open app converted to a booking, so there is no need to raise  
prices. Because the base price is a minimum, we cannot set p \(S, D\) \< 1. If D \> S, then we  
are in a situation of excess demand and we want to tamp down demand, so we need to set  
p \(S, D\) \> 1. 170  
pricing with constrained supply  
The multiplier function p \(S, D\) needs to satisfy three conditions.  
•  
D ≤ S → p \(S, D\) = 1. If supply is more than adequate to meet demand, the multiplier  
•  
•  
is equal to one.  
∂p \(S, D\) /∂D ≥ 0. The multiplier is increasing in demand.  
∂p \(S, D\) /∂S ≤ 0. The multiplier is decreasing in supply.  
Let’s dig a little deeper into the calculation of the multiplier. First, we assume that de-  
mand responds instantly to the multiplier. This is realistic; riders tend to respond to fares at  
the moment they open the app, and if they see a fare that is too high, they may decide to use  
another mode of transportation or postpone their trip. This will be reflected immediately in  
the booking conversion rate —the fraction of people who book after viewing a fare on their  
app will decrease as the multiplier increases. We can model this situation as  
d\(p\) = Dρ\(p\), \(7.4\)  
where D is the number of people who open the app, 0 ≤ ρ\(p\) ≤ 1 is the fraction of people  
who open the app who will book a ride given multiplier p, and d\(p\) is the number of rides  
that will be booked. We assume that ρ'\(p\) \< 0 so that the number of bookings will decrease  
as the multiplier increases.  
This representation is identical to the formulation in Equation 3.1 with the difference  
that p represents the multiplier instead of the price. This reflects the fact that, from a cus-  
tomer’s point of view, the buying experience is much the same\: with the ride-hailing app,  
the customer signals potential interest in purchasing by opening the app. The customer  
does not decide whether to book until seeing the price, and a higher fraction of custom-  
ers will book if the price \(multiplier\) is low than if it is high. It also means that any of the  
functional forms listed for ρ\(p\) in Table 3.3, such as linear, logit, and probit, can be used  
in Equation 7.4 depending on the assumption about the underlying distribution of willing-  
ness to pay among riders.  
When demand exceeds supply \(D \> S\) and supply is fixed, then the ride-sharing opera-  
tor faces a variable-pricing problem and the optimal \(profit-maximizing\) multiplier p\* is  
the one that balances supply and demand. This means that p\* must be such that Dρ\(p\*\) =  
S, or, equivalently,  
ρ \( \) =  
p\* S  
D. \(7.5\)  
We can solve for p\* by substituting the appropriate function ρ\(p\) into Equation 7.5 and  
solving.  
Example 7.7  
There are 100 empty cars available in a region at a time when D = 300. As-  
sume that the price-response function is linear with ρ\(p\) = \(1 – .33p\)+. From  
­ Equation 7.5, the multiplier that balances supply and demand is given by  
\(1 – .33p\*\) = 100  
300 , which gives p\* = 2. pricing with constrained supply 171  
For each city, the multipliers for a ride-sharing service like Uber or DiDi are updated for  
all of the regions within a city every few minutes based on changing supply and demand  
conditions.  
One question about dynamic pricing of this sort is whether it is good for customers.  
Note that, if a region is in a state of excess demand and prices are not increased, service  
quality will decrease\: riders will see increased time to arrival for their ride or, in the ex-  
treme, that no cars are available. While an excess of demand may seem like a good situ-  
ation for drivers, in actuality it is not. The increased arrival times mean that drivers are  
being sent from distant regions to satisfy the demand and are thus spending excessive  
time driving to pickups — time for which they do not get paid. Furthermore, the price  
has been kept low, so the result is lower driver payments per hour. Riders get good prices,  
but they need to accept long arrival times, and many will drop out because of excessive  
arrival times or unavailability of cars. Juan Castillo, Dan Knoepfle, and Glen Weyl \(2017\)  
call this a wild-goose chase equilibrium, in which drivers spend their time chasing riders.  
They show that balancing supply and demand using price can lead to an equilibrium that  
provides more social welfare \(as measured by producers plus consumers surplus\) than the  
wild-goose chase equilibrium. Effective variable pricing can make both riders and drivers  
better off.  
This discussion has assumed that supply is fixed — that is, while riders respond to chang-  
ing prices, drivers do not. This is not entirely true in the short run\: drivers do tend to move  
toward areas of higher surge. It is also likely that, in the longer run, drivers anticipate the  
time and locations of likely surge \(e.g., downtown rush hour\) and plan their driving accord-  
ingly. However, in the short-run time frame in which drivers make decisions \(minutes\),  
supply in a region is largely fixed, meaning that the effect of changing price on immediate  
supply is relatively small. The impact of incorporating the supply-induction effects of prices  
into ride-sharing pricing would be to reduce the multipliers somewhat.8  
7.6.5 Movie Theaters and Restaurants  
It is interesting to examine two industries in which the variable-pricing dog has not  
barked — that is, variable and dynamic pricing has not been widely adopted despite an  
apparent ideal fit. The first is movie theaters. While movie theaters employ many standard  
promotional approaches such as senior and student discounts and matinee discounts, they  
generally do not vary pricing according to the popularity or anticipated popularity of a  
movie; nor do they change it over time as demand begins to dwindle. The reason they do  
not is a bit of a mystery. Movie demand has a predictable element to it — demand is higher  
in the summer and on holidays than other times of the year, and demand is higher on the  
weekends than on weekday nights. Furthermore, demand tends to decline following the  
release of a new movie in a fairly consistent and predictable fashion. While there can be  
unexpected hits and duds, relative demand for different movies is reasonably predictable\:  
the next James Bond movie will certainly outdraw even the most popular documentary  
released in the same year. Finally, movie theaters meet one of the most fundamental criteria  
for variable pricing\: capacity is fixed and immediately perishable. 172

There has been some movement toward variable pricing at movie theaters in the US  
industry — most cinemas across the country slash prices on Tuesday nights. As a result,  
Tuesday has gone from being the lowest-grossing weeknight to the highest grossing \(except  
for Friday\). While this would indicate that there is an opportunity to increase revenue and  
fill theaters using variable pricing, in fact, “no U.S. chain has tested variable pricing in a  
serious way,” notes one industry observer \(McClintock 2019\). There has been some debate  
about why the industry has been so reluctant when the gains are potentially enormous.  
The leading theory is that independent theaters and theater chains feel implicitly pressured  
by distributors who want to keep in-theater prices high for their movies so that the value  
perception of the movie is not degraded by a low price. It is difficult to confirm or disprove  
this theory, but, despite the apparent fit, adoption of variable pricing is very limited in US  
theaters, and there are few indications that the situation is likely to change soon.  
Restaurants and bars would seem to be another candidate for variable dynamic pricing.  
Demand varies rather predictably by time of day, day of week, and season. For example,  
Figure 7.3 shows Google Maps’ hourly forecast for demand at the New York City restaurant  
Gramercy Tavern for Wednesday, December 18, and Saturday, December 22, 2019. These  
forecasts, which were derived entirely from history, show predictable differences in seating  
demand by both day and hour. The restaurant itself has access to reservations data, which  
it could use to generate even more accurate forecasts. Finally, of course, restaurants have  
fixed and perishable capacity.  
Despite checking all of the boxes for variable pricing, restaurants and bars do very lit-  
tle of it aside from happy hours, the usual student and senior citizen discounts, and in  
some cases Groupons. Even extremely popular restaurants typically allocate capacity using  
scarcity — reservations need to be made well in advance and /or people need to wait in line  
at popular times — rather than adjusting price over time to balance supply and demand.  
However, restaurants may present less of a mystery than movie theaters with regard to their  
reluctance to adjust prices\: the use of printed menus makes real-time price adjustment dif-  
ficult, as does the nature of the dining experience — it would be disconcerting to have prices  
change between the time you decided on your order and the time you actually ordered.  
That said, a development that may lead to higher penetration of variable and dynamic  
pricing in the restaurant industry is the rise of delivery services such as Uber Eats and Grub-  
hub in the United States and Deliveroo in Europe, which provide apps that allow diners to pricing with constrained supply 173  
order food to be delivered. The popularity of these delivery services has led to the develop-  
ment of so-called virtual restaurants and ghost kitchens that exist solely to serve the delivery  
market.9 It is likely that such establishments selling primarily \(or only\) through online de-  
livery apps will adopt variable and dynamic pricing — after all, the delivery services already  
use dynamic pricing for their fees.  
7.7 SUMMARY

Supply constraints are commonplace in many industries. They can arise as a result  
of limited inventory or because capacity itself is physically constrained. Whenever  
there is a significant chance that demand might exceed available supply, the supply  
constraint needs to be explicitly incorporated in determining the optimal price.  
With a single market segment, the optimal constrained price is the maximum of the  
runout price and the optimal unconstrained price. The optimal price with a supply  
constraint is always at least as high as the optimal unconstrained price.  
With multiple market segments, the optimal price can be found by solving a  
­ constrained-optimization problem. At the optimal price, the marginal revenue will  
be the same for all segments, but it will not be equal to marginal cost if the constraint  
is binding.  
A supply constraint has an associated total opportunity cost, defined as the additional  
operating profit the business could achieve if the supply constraint were eliminated.  
The marginal opportunity cost associated with a supply constraint is defined as the ad-  
ditional operating profit the seller would realize if one additional unit of supply were  
available. Both the total and the marginal opportunity costs associated with a supply  
constraint are zero if the constraint is not binding.  
Variable prices can be used when capacity is constrained and demand changes over  
time in a predictable fashion. Variable pricing can increase profitability when de-  
mands are independent by adjusting demand to meet supply. It is even more effective  
when some customers are flexible, because it can shift demand from peak to off-peak  
periods.  
Optimal variable prices can be found by solving a constrained-optimization prob-  
lem. The marginal values associated with the supply constraints are the opportunity  
costs of additional capacity.  
Some industries in which variable pricing is used are sporting events, concerts,  
passenger airlines, electric power, and ride-sharing. In some of these cases, the  
variable prices are set once in advance. Other industries, notably ride-sharing plat-  
forms and electric power, use dynamic variable pricing in which prices are updated  
as more recent information about supply and demand is received. This comes  
close to revenue management, the topic of the next few chapters. Currently, movie  
theaters and restaurants do not extensively use variable pricing despite apparent  
suitability. 174  
pricing with constrained supply  
The pricing and revenue optimization problems addressed in later chapters build on  
the basic techniques of pricing with constrained supply. Capacity allocation \(Chapter 9\) is  
based on opening and closing availabilities to different market segments in order to maxi-  
mize return from fixed and perishable capacity when willingness to pay increases over time.  
Network management \(Chapter 10\) extends this concept to the case when customers are  
buying multiple resources. Overbooking \(Chapter 11\) deals with the question of how many  
total units to offer for sale when capacity is fixed. Markdown management \(Chapter 12\)  
addresses the case of setting and updating prices for a fixed stock of perishable goods over  
time. In each of these problems, much of the complexity of the pricing problem comes  
from a constraint on supply.  
7.8 FURTHER READING  
A seminal paper on dynamic pricing with a capacity constraint is Gallego and van Ryzin  
1994, which shows that, under very weak conditions, a seller with constrained perishable  
capacity who is pricing dynamically should set his price to either the profit-maximizing  
price or the runout price — the price at which he would exactly sell all of his inventory.  
Regarding specific industries, variable pricing for baseball is discussed in Rascher et al.  
2007, which estimates the potential value for every major league team. The San Francisco  
Giants were apparently the first to apply dynamic pricing in 2009; see Shapiro and Drayer  
2012\. For a specific application to the Los Angeles Dodgers, see Parris, Drayer, and Shapiro  
2012\. An early examination of the potential for dynamic pricing for theater can be found  
in Leslie 2004. There is a vast literature on dynamic pricing for retail electric power\: a brief  
overview of the issues involved in implementing dynamic pricing in the United States —  
particularly the barriers that have hindered adoption and the prospects for the future — can  
be found in Wilson 2012. A more extensive discussion can be found in the papers in Ren-  
eses, Rodriguez, and Perez-Arriaga 2013. The reasons why dynamic pricing has not been  
widely adopted by movie theaters are discussed at length in Orbach 2004, Orbach and Einav  
2007, and Phillips 2012c.  
While restaurants do not widely use variable pricing \(with exceptionally rare excep-  
tions\), many have adopted various other revenue management – like techniques to maxi-  
mize revenue per available seat hour \(RevPASH\). For an overview of these techniques, see  
Kimes 2004.

1\. Let us return to the Stanford Stadium pricing problem in Section 7.4, assuming a  
capacity of 60,000 seats and the price-response functions for students and for the  
general public as given in Equations 7.1 and 7.2. Assume that 5% of the general  
public will masquerade as students \(perhaps using borrowed ID cards\) to save  
money. Assuming Stanford knows that, what are the optimal prices for student  
tickets and general public tickets it should set in this case? What is the total revenue, pricing with constrained supply 175  
2\. 3. 4. 5. 6. and how does it compare to the case without cannibalization? What does this say  
about the amount that Stanford would be willing to pay for such devices as photo  
ID cards in order to eliminate cannibalization?  
An earthquake damages Stanford Stadium so that only 53,000 seats are available  
for the Big Game. What is the optimal single price and the total revenue? What are  
the optimal separate prices to charge for students and the general public, and the  
corresponding total revenue? What is the opportunity cost per seat for the 7,000  
unavailable seats in both cases?  
Ancillary Revenue. Stanford Stadium has been repaired so that it again seats 60,000  
people. Now assume that, on average, each member of the general public will  
consume \$20 worth of concessions, resulting in a \$10 contribution margin, while  
each student only consumes \$10, resulting in a \$5 contribution margin. Assum-  
ing no cannibalization, what are the prices for students and the general public that  
maximize total contribution margin \(including, of course, ticket revenue\)?  
A barber charges \$12 per haircut and works Saturday through Thursday. He can  
perform up to 20 haircuts a day. He currently performs an average of 12 haircuts per  
day during the weekdays \(Monday through Thursday\). On Saturdays and Sundays,  
he does 20 haircuts per day and turns 10 potential customers away each day. These  
customers all go to the competition. The barber is considering raising his prices on  
weekends. He estimates that for every \$1 he raises his price, he will lose an addi-  
tional 10% of his customer base \(including his turnaways\). He estimates that 20% of  
his remaining weekend customers would move to a weekday to save \$1, 40% would  
move to a weekday to save \$2, and 60% would move to a weekday to save \$3. As-  
suming he needs to price in increments of \$1, should he charge a differential week-  
end price? If so, what should the weekend price be? \(Assume he continues to charge  
\$12 on weekdays.\) How much revenue \(if any\) would he gain from his policy?  
The optimal variable prices for theme park admission in Table 7.5 are based on the  
assumption that admission fees are the only source of revenue for the park. How-  
ever, the owner determines that visitors to the theme park spend an average of \$12  
per person on concessions, generating an average concession margin of \$5 per per-  
son. Under the same assumptions about capacity and demand, what is the single-  
admission price the theme park should charge to maximize total weekly margin  
\(admission price plus concession margin\)? What are the individual daily prices he  
should charge under a variable-pricing policy, assuming independent daily de-  
mands? What is the impact on total weekly admissions? What is the impact on total  
weekly margin from explicitly including concessions in the optimization relative to  
optimizing prices on the basis of admission revenue alone?  
Assume that the theme park owner invested in expanding his park so that he could  
accommodate up to 1,500 customers each day.  
a. What single price would maximize his total revenue, assuming he faces inde-  
pendent demands for each day and that the price-response functions per day 176

per day?  
b. Under the same assumptions, what variable prices should he charge for each day  
to maximize expected revenue, and what are the corresponding attendance and  
revenue per day?  
The theme park owner performs some market research and determines that his  
customers can best be represented by the following model.  
i. Base customer demand for each day of the week is linear and is specified by the  
parameters in Table 7.4.  
ii. Weekend \(Saturday and Sunday\) customers will switch to the other weekend day  
at the rate of 10 customers for every \$1 difference in price. They will not switch  
to weekdays at any price.  
iii. Weekday customers will switch to any other day \(including a weekend day\) at  
the rate of 8 customers for every \$1 difference in price.  
What are the optimal daily prices the theme park should charge?  
The popular a cappella choral group Here Comes Treble is coming to Columbia  
University for a concert. The concert will be in Lerner Auditorium, which has C

3,000 seats. What are the revenue-maximizing prices for students and the gen-

1\. Note that a seller does not need to be a purist in allocating scarce supply. He can, for  
example, raise price to less than the market-clearing price and combine that with one of  
the other allocation approaches. This would allow him to realize some additional profit  
while still favoring preferred customers.

4\. The impact of Michael Jordan on revenues is from Fortune magazine, based on  
work originally by Jerry Hausman and Gregory Leonard, who concluded that “superstars  
are more important than league balance for revenues” \(1997, 586\). Overall, Fortune esti-  
mated that Jordan’s impact on home gate receipts was \$165.5 million and on road games,  
\$30.5 million. This was an era before dynamic pricing — it is likely that the impact would  
have been substantially greater with optimal dynamic pricing in which games featuring  
Jordan would have been priced higher than other games \(Johnson 1998\).  
5\. Through the 2017–2018 Broadway season, The Lion King had grossed \$1.54 billion  
over its run, compared to \$1.25 billion for second-place Wicked. Of course, The Lion  
King’s record-setting financial performance is due to more than just variable pricing; it  
also benefits from an excellent product that appeals to all ages, association with the Disney  
brand, strong marketing support, and a great location close to Times Square.  
6\. For the potential benefits of dynamic pricing for electric power, see Imelda et al.  
2018.  
7\. Ride-share pricing is somewhat more complicated because of various fees and  
incentives. For example, as of 2018 in the United States, both Lyft and Uber charge a \$1  
booking fee for each trip, which is not shared with the driver. Various services — including  
both Lyft and Uber — enable riders to tip their drivers. In addition, many operators pro-  
vide various driver subsidies that can increase driver earnings — for example, an operator  
may pay a driver an extra \$50 for completing at least 20 trips in a week. For this reason,  
the total compensation for a driver over a period will not necessarily be equal to a fixed  
fraction of the prices paid by the riders she carried. For base rider pricing, see O’Connell  
2018.  
8\. Ride-sharing is a relatively new industry, and the ride-sharing companies continue  
to explore new pricing models. For example, in early 2019 Uber began to experiment with  
“additive surge,” in which prices are modified not by using multiplicative factors but by  
using “adders.” Under a multiplicative surge of 2.0, a ride with a base fare of \$5.00 would  
have a fare of \$10.00 and a ride with a base fare of \$15.00 would have a dynamic fare of  
\$30.00. With a \$6.00 additive surge, the ride with a base fare of \$5.00 would have a fare  
of \$11.00 and the \$15.00 base fare ride would have a dynamic fare of \$21.00. Garg and pricing with constrained supply 179

9\. A virtual restaurant is one whose brand appears only online, although it may be tied  
to a differently named physical restaurant. A ghost kitchen is an establishment that exists  
only to serve the delivery market — there is no associated dining establishment. Confus-  
ingly, ghost kitchens are sometimes referred to as virtual restaurants. 8 Revenue Management  
Revenue management \(RM\) \(once called yield management\) refers to the strategy and tactics  
used by a number of industries — notably the passenger airlines but also including hotels,  
rental cars, cruise lines, and others — to manage the allocation of their capacity to different  
fare classes over time in order to maximize revenue. Revenue management is applicable  
when all of the following conditions hold.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
The seller is selling a fixed stock of perishable capacity.  
Customers book capacity prior to departure.  
The seller manages a set of fare classes \(also called booking classes\), each of which has  
a fixed price \(at least in the short run\).  
The seller can change the availability of fare classes over time.  
Revenue management can be considered a special case of variable and dynamic pric-  
ing with constrained supply. However, the final two conditions give revenue management  
its special flavor. Revenue management is based not on setting and updating prices but  
directly on setting and updating the availability of fare classes, where each fare class has an  
associated fare \(price\) that remains constant through the booking period. This distinctive  
feature is a legacy from revenue management’s origin. The passenger airlines that pioneered  
revenue management in the 1980s needed to utilize the capabilities they had at hand. This  
meant using the booking controls embedded in their reservation systems as the primary  
mechanism for controlling the fares displayed to customers at any time. Following success  
at the airlines, revenue management has been adopted by a number of other industries,  
including hotels, rental cars, freight transportation, and cruise lines — many of whom use  
the same \(or similar\) reservation systems as the passenger airlines.  
We use revenue management industries as a generic term for industries meeting the con-  
ditions listed above and revenue management companies to refer to companies that make  
use of booking controls and fare classes. While these companies apply revenue manage-  
ment in its purest fashion, the techniques of revenue management can be applied to any revenue management 181  
situation in which a seller needs to determine how to allocate a fixed supply among differ-  
ent channels or customer segments paying different prices.  
This chapter serves as an introduction to revenue management. It is a prelude to the  
next three chapters, which address specific aspects of revenue management in more detail.  
We start by surveying some of the history of revenue management and then look at rev-  
enue management strategy as an application of some of the price differentiation techniques  
introduced in Chapter 6. In Section 8.2, we discuss how revenue management operates at  
three different levels\: the strategic, the tactical, and that of moment-to-moment booking  
control. Section 8.3 describes the customer segmentation strategy underlying revenue man-  
agement. Section 8.4 describes the interactions between the reservation and distribution  
systems in the travel industry, and Section 8.5 describes how bookings and cancellations  
are managed within those systems. Understanding this material is a prerequisite for under-  
standing the ideas behind tactical revenue management. Section 8.6 introduces the three  
elements of tactical revenue management\: capacity control, network management, and  
overbooking, which are described in detail in Chapters 9, 10, and 11, respectively. Section  
8.7 describes various metrics that are used to measure the effectiveness of revenue man-  
agement. Section 8.8 discusses the role of incremental cost and ancillary profit in revenue  
in various industries, and Section 8.9 reviews the current status of revenue management  
adoption in various industries.  
Since this chapter is introductory, it may feel a bit lacking in algorithms and computa-  
tions. This is made up for in the following chapters, each of which addresses a specific  
aspect of tactical revenue management in detail.  
8.1 HISTORY  
Prior to 1978, the airline industry in the United States was heavily regulated. Both schedules  
and fares were tightly controlled by the Civil Aeronautics Board \(CAB\). Fares were held  
sufficiently high to guarantee airlines a reasonable return on their extensive capital invest-  
ments in airplanes. In 1978, Congress passed the Airline Deregulation Act. The act speci-  
fied that the industry would be deregulated over four years, with complete elimination of  
restrictions on domestic routes and new service by December 31, 1981, and the removal of  
all fare regulation by January 1, 1983. The result was a shock from which it took many years  
for the airlines to recover.1  
One of the reasons Congress passed the Airline Deregulation Act was to inspire and  
encourage creative new entrants into the passenger airline business. One of the first new  
airlines to arise after deregulation was PeopleExpress. PeopleExpress was not unionized,  
and it offered a bare-bones service, with passengers paying extra for baggage handling and  
onboard meals. As a result, its cost structure was significantly lower than those of American  
and the other major airlines, such as United and Delta. By offering fares up to 70% be-  
low the majors, PeopleExpress filled its planes with passengers from a previously untapped  
market segment\: price-sensitive students and middle-class leisure travelers who were in-  
duced to travel by the existence of fares far lower than anything the industry had seen 182  
revenue management  
before. PeopleExpress built its business initially by entering underserved markets, where its  
competition was primarily bus or car travel. PeopleExpress experienced four years of phe-  
nomenal growth and, in 1984, began service on Newark– Chicago and New Orleans –Los  
Angeles routes —key markets for American Airlines.  
The choice American Airlines faced was stark. If it matched People’s low fares, it might  
retain its customer base but would not be able to cover its costs. If it did not match People’s  
fares, most of its customer base would be siphoned off by the low-price competitors. And  
in the newly deregulated environment, nothing could keep a successful PeopleExpress from  
moving in on all of American’s core markets. American Airlines seemed doomed — its only  
choice appeared to be between a slow death and a rapid one. However, Robert Crandall,  
CEO of American Airlines, formulated a counterattack\: American would compete with  
PeopleExpress on low fares and simultaneously sell some of its seats at a higher fare as well.  
In January 1985, American Airlines announced its Ultimate Super Saver Fares program.  
Ultimate Super Saver Fares matched PeopleExpress prices, with two key differences\:  
•  
•  
For a passenger to qualify for an Ultimate Super Saver discount fare on American,  
she would need to book at least two weeks before departure and stay at her destina-  
tion over a Saturday night. Passengers not meeting this restriction would be charged  
a higher fare. In contrast, PeopleExpress put no restrictions on its discount fares —  
every passenger paid a low fare.  
American restricted the number of discount seats sold on each flight to save seats for  
full-fare passengers who would be booking within the last two weeks prior to depar-  
ture. PeopleExpress allowed every seat to be sold at a low fare.  
American’s two-pronged approach was carefully thought out and turned out to be the  
perfect counter to People’s challenge. The booking restrictions ensured that the vast major-  
ity of the discount passengers buying American were leisure passengers who were able to  
book early and who were more price sensitive. The later-booking passengers who paid full  
fare were primarily business travelers who were less price sensitive but needed seat availabil-  
ity at the last minute. Both groups of passengers preferred American’s superior service to  
People’s bare-bones approach. In effect, American Airlines had segmented the market be-  
tween leisure and business travelers and used differentiated pricing to attack a competitor.  
The impact of American’s actions was dramatic. American announced the new fares and  
new structure in January 1985. By March of that year, PeopleExpress was struggling, and by  
August it was on the verge of bankruptcy. In September, Texas Air bought PeopleExpress  
for less than 10% of the market value it had enjoyed a year earlier. PeopleExpress’s flamboy-  
ant CEO, Donald Burr, put the blame for his airline’s demise squarely on American’s supe-  
rior yield management capability\: “We had great people, tremendous value, terrific growth.  
We did a lot of things right. But we didn’t get our hands around the yield management and  
automation issues” \(Cross 1997, 129\).  
This was the origin of revenue management \(or yield management as it was called at  
the time\). American’s success prodded other major airlines in the United States to develop  
revenue management capabilities of their own. Throughout the remainder of the 1980s revenue management 183  
and well into the 1990s, carriers such as United, Delta, and Continental invested millions of  
dollars in implementing computerized revenue management systems and establishing rev-  
enue management organizations. As world aviation markets were increasingly deregulated,  
carriers in Europe and Asia also began to adopt revenue management. Hotels and rental car  
companies followed the airlines in adopting revenue management. Marriott was a pioneer  
in hotel revenue management, and Hertz and National were pioneers in rental car revenue  
management. Vendors such as PROS and Talus Solutions developed and sold commercial  
revenue management software packages. The next wave of adopters included cruise lines,  
passenger trains, and various modes of freight transportation. Development and invest-  
ment in revenue management continues in many of these and other industries today.  
8.2 LEVELS OF REVENUE MANAGEMENT  
Successful revenue management requires consistent execution at three levels, as shown in  
Table 8.1. Revenue management strategy is the identification of customer segments and the  
establishment of products and prices targeted at those segments. Once products and prices  
have been established, revenue management tactics require setting and updating limits on how  
much of a particular product can be sold at a particular fare to each segment for some period  
of time—say, a day or a week. Booking control is the moment-to-moment determination of  
which booking requests should be accepted, which should be rejected, and how capacity for  
different products should be updated in the face of bookings and cancellations. For airlines,  
hotels, rental car companies, and cruise lines, booking control is performed by the reserva-  
tion system. Tactical revenue management is the brains of the process. It is where future  
demand is forecast, optimization algorithms are run, and booking limits are set and updated.  
We first consider the strategy of revenue management and how it applies in different  
industries. We then turn to a somewhat detailed discussion of booking control— the real-  
time face of revenue management. With this background in place, the next three chapters  
deal with elements of tactical revenue management — capacity control, network manage-  
ment, and overbooking.  
8.3 REVENUE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY  
Revenue management strategy consists of the identification of customer segments and the  
establishment of products targeted at those segments. A fundamental element of revenue  
management strategy at many hotels, rental car companies, and airlines is the distinction  
between leisure customers and business customers first recognized by American Airlines.

The different characteristics of leisure and business customers are shown in Table 8.2. The  
airlines used these characteristics to segment their market and create virtual products ori-  
ented toward the different segments. A typical approach is shown in Table 8.3. Here, an  
airline has identified five customer segments, three business and two leisure, with at least  
one product targeted toward each segment. The leisure products have various restrictions  
\(early purchase, Saturday night stay\) that make them unattractive or unavailable to many  
business travelers. This is a classic application of the segmentation technique described in  
Section 6.3.5 by which a seller artificially creates an inferior product to sell at a lower price  
in order to segment the market.  
Product versioning is not the only price differentiation tactic used by the airlines. They  
also use most of the other tactics described in Section 6.3. Airlines sell products targeted  
to many segments such as government, senior citizens, groups, tour operators, and cruise  
lines. International airlines are great believers in regional pricing. They will sell the same  
tickets for different prices in different countries \(even after adjusting for exchange rates\) to  
exploit differences in price sensitivity. Airlines are also channel pricers; ticket prices may  
vary among online platforms and on their website.  
Other revenue management companies followed the airlines in segmenting their mar-  
ket, creating virtual products and establishing a wide range of prices. Hotels and rental car  
companies establish and manage products and different prices oriented toward various  
groups\: corporate, leisure, and business segments. As a simple example, many hotels in  
Hawaii maintain kama’aina rates for local residents.2 These rates are often far lower than  
the standard rates, and hotel revenue managers make them available during slack periods  
to fill their properties. Only customers who can prove Hawaiian residency qualify for a revenue management 185  
kama’aina rate. This is a classic example of group pricing. By confining availability to locals,  
hotels ensure that the low kama’aina rates do not cannibalize their high-paying business  
from the mainland United States and Asia.  
Cruise lines do not have late-booking business customers, but they do sell to the incen-  
tive segment —bulk purchases of cruise capacity by companies to be used as incentives for  
their employees. For example, a medical supply company might purchase 20 berths on a  
particular sailing to reward the 20 top North American sales managers. This incentive busi-  
ness is booked earlier and is sold at lower fares than individual cruise tickets. Cruise lines  
also charge different rates for customers from different cities. Managing availability by city  
is one way they can maximize contribution from each sailing.3  
8.4 THE SYSTEM CONTEXT  
American Airlines was able to outmaneuver PeopleExpress in part because it had devel-  
oped a computerized reservation system called SABRE that allowed it to save seats for later-  
booking business passengers — a capability PeopleExpress lacked. When it was turned on in  
1964, SABRE was a technological marvel. Not only did it replace the colored index cards in  
revolving trays that American and other airlines had used since the 1930s to manage their  
reservations; it gave American Airlines the ability to distribute its products and fares glob-  
ally and to receive bookings from anywhere in the world.  
Airline distribution has evolved considerably over the past few decades \(and continues  
to evolve\), but the distribution systems and reservation systems continue to play an im-  
portant role. A high-level schematic diagram of airline distribution is shown in Figure 8.1.

revenue management  
Consumers have a variety of channels for purchasing tickets ranging from online platforms  
such as Expedia and Orbitz, an airline’s own website, travel agencies, and in-house cor-  
porate travel management. The global distribution systems transmit price and availability  
information from the airline to each of these channels and send booking and cancellation  
information from the channels back to the airlines. Every airline has a reservation system  
that enables it to keep track of all of the current bookings that it has in the system and their  
status. As of 2019, four major global distribution systems are in use —Amadeus, World-  
span, Travelport, and China’s TravelSky. Most airlines distribute through all four systems  
because individual travel agencies \(including corporate travel\) are typically associated with  
only one of the systems. The same global distribution systems provide similar services for  
other travel-related industries such as hotels, cruise lines, and rental cars.  
This system background is important because airlines did not choose to pursue a rev-  
enue management strategy and then design reservation systems to support that strategy.  
Rather, reservation systems and global distribution systems were developed first and reve-  
nue management capabilities were added later. SABRE went operational in 1964 —14 years  
before the airlines were deregulated and 21 years before American first did battle with Peo-  
pleExpress. The computerized reservation systems were among the most sophisticated and  
complex transaction-processing systems of their day. But they were not very flexible. Since  
they were built on large mainframes using 1960s-vintage software, major modifications  
were \(and are\) expensive and time consuming. As a result, the way airlines and other travel  
companies manage their inventory is still dictated by the capabilities of these systems. And  
at the heart of these systems are the booking control mechanisms that determine moment  
by moment which fare classes are available for sale and which are not.  
8.5 BOOKING CONTROL  
Booking control is the real-time face of revenue management. The primary function of  
booking control is to determine whether each booking request received should be accepted  
or rejected.4 Secondary functions are to update availabilities for different products when  
bookings and cancellations occur. As shown in Figure 8.1, booking requests stream into the  
reservation system from many different channels. Within a very short time \(typically less  
than 200 milliseconds\), the reservation system needs to send a message saying whether or  
not that request can be accepted. Given the short time available, reservation systems rely on  
very simple, mechanical procedures for determining whether to accept a request.  
When a booking request is received — say, for a seat for a future flight or a hotel room  
for some future dates — the request is assigned to a fare class. This assignment may be based  
on the time and characteristics of the request \(e.g., whether it meets the qualifications for  
a deep discount\), the channel through which the request was received, the market seg-  
ment of the customer \(e.g., group versus individual\), or combinations of all of these. The  
fare classes are typically assigned letters, so we can speak of a B-Class or M-Class booking  
request.5  
The reservation system includes a booking limit for each fare class on each product.  
When a booking request is received, the reservation system checks the booking limit for the revenue management 187  
associated fare class. If there is sufficient availability, the request will be accepted; if not, the  
request will be rejected.  
Example 8.1  
An airline receives a B-Class request for three seats on Flight 137 from Houston  
to Miami, departing in two weeks. The current B-Class booking limit for this  
flight is two. Because there is insufficient availability, the request is rejected.  
At each time, the booking limits currently in place determine which booking requests  
will be accepted and which will be rejected. When a new booking is accepted or a previously  
accepted booking cancels, the reservation system automatically updates the booking limits  
for that product. This is all done in milliseconds, consistent with the need of the reservation  
systems to communicate availabilities to customers in real time.  
8.5.1 Allotments  
An obvious way to manage bookings would be to divide the available capacity into discrete  
chunks and to allocate each chunk to a fare class. This is known as the allotments approach,  
and the size of the chunk allocated to each fare class is called its allotment. Under this ap-  
proach, bookings are accepted in a class until the allotment for that class is exhausted.  
Example 8.2  
A 100-seat aircraft is being managed using allotments\: 30 seats have been allot-  
ted to deep-discount bookings \(B-Class\) with a \$125 fare, 45 seats to full-fare  
coach \(M-Class\) with a \$200 fare, and 25 seats to business class \(Y-Class\) with a  
\$560 fare. Two weeks before departure, 25 B-Class bookings, 45 M-Class book-  
ings, and 10 Y-Class bookings have been accepted. The remaining allotments  
are 5 seats for B-Class, no seats for M-Class, and 15 seats for Y-Class.  
While the allotments approach is easy to understand, it has a major drawback\: it does  
not work very well. In particular, it can result in high-fare customers being rejected while  
lower-fare customers are still being accepted. In Example 8.2, if the M-Class allotment  
closes before the B-Class allotment, the airline will be accepting customers paying \$125  
while rejecting \$200 bookings. This is a prime revenue management sin — an airline can-  
not maximize revenue by rejecting high-fare customers to save seats for low-fare custom-  
ers. For this reason, revenue management companies nest their inventory so that high-fare  
customers have access to all of the inventory available to lower-fare customers.  
8.5.2 Nesting  
Nesting was developed to avoid the situation in which high-fare bookings were rejected in  
favor of low-fare bookings. To describe nesting, we number fare classes so that 1 is the high-  
est \(most expensive\) fare class and n is the lowest. We define bi as the booking limit for class  
i. With nested booking controls, booking limits are always nondecreasing; that is,  
b1 ≥ b2 ≥ . . . ≥ b  
. \(8.1\)n 188  
revenue management  
Furthermore, at each time, every fare class has access to all of the inventory available to  
lower fare classes. This avoids the possibility of accepting low-fare bookings while rejecting  
high-fare bookings.6 The booking limit for the highest class, b1, is an upper bound on the  
total number of bookings that will be accepted. If the airline is not expecting any no-shows  
or cancellations, then b1 would equal the capacity of the flight. When there is a possibility  
that bookings will cancel or not show, then it is usually optimal to overbook— that is, to ac-  
cept more bookings than available capacity, in which b1, and possibly the booking limits for  
other classes, might be greater than the capacity of the flight. Chapter 11 addresses how to  
calculate overbooking limits.  
We can also describe nesting in terms of protection levels. The protection level for class i  
is the total number of seats available to class i and all higher classes. Let yj be the protection  
level for class j = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n – 1. The relationship among booking limits and protection  
levels with nested booking controls is illustrated in Figure 8.2. From this figure it should  
be evident that  
yj = b1 – bj + 1 for j = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n – 1 \(8.2\)  
and yn  
= b1; that is, the protection level for the lowest fare class is equal to the total booking  
limit for the flight. Combining Equation 8.2 with condition 8.1, we can see that protection  
levels decrease for higher fare classes; that is,  
0 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ . . . yn – 1,  
as can be seen in Figure 8.2.  
8.5.3 Dynamic Nested Booking Control  
What happens when we accept a booking when limits are nested? Define the availability  
of a fare class as the booking limit for that class minus the booking limit of the next lower  
class. The availability of the lowest fare class is its booking limit. Thus, if a flight has two  
fare classes with booking limits \(b1, b2\) = \(100, 30\), the availability for class 2 is 30 and for  
class 1 is 70. The standard practice in the airline industry is to decrement the availability of

Seats protected for class 1

b2 Booking limit for class 2  
Figure 8.2 Nested booking limits and protection levels. revenue management 189  
the booking class from which the booking occurred, from which the booking limits can be  
reconstructed. Thus, if the airline with booking limits \(100, 30\) accepted a five-seat book-  
ing in fare class 2, its new booking limits would be \(95, 25\). If it accepted a five-seat booking  
in fare class 1, its new booking limits would be \(95, 30\).  
This approach is called standard nesting and it is the most widely used among the air-  
lines. However, an alternative is to decrement the availability of lower fare classes as well  
when a higher-fare booking limit is accepted. In this case, accepting a five-seat booking in  
fare class 1 would result in new booking limits of \(95, 25\). This approach is called theft nest-  
ing and it is sometimes found in practice.  
Example 8.3  
A flight has a total booking limit of 100 and five fare classes with booking limits  
of \(b1, b2, b3, b4, b5\) = \(100, 73, 12, 4, 0\). Note that this flight is currently not  
accepting any bookings from class 5. Any booking class with a limit of 0 is said  
to be closed. We can derive the corresponding protection levels using Equation  
8.2\: \(y1, y2, y3, y4, y5\) = \(27, 88, 96, 100, 100\). The availabilities for the fare classes  
are \(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5\) = \(27, 61, 8, 4, 0\). Assume that a booking request arrives  
for 3 seats in class 3. Because the booking limit in class 3 is 12, this request  
will be accepted. Under standard nesting, only the availability in class 3 will  
be changed, so the new availabilities will be \(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5\) = \(27, 61, 5, 4, 0\),  
which corresponds to booking limits of \(b1, b2, b3, b4, b5\) = \(97, 70, 9, 4, 0\). Un-  
der theft nesting, the total seat capacity drops from 100 to 97, and the booking  
limits are adjusted to \(b1, b2, b3, b4, b5\) = \(97, 70, 9, 1, 0\), which corresponds to  
protection levels of \(y1, y2, y3, y4, y5\) = \(27, 88, 96, 97, 97\).  
Note that the protection levels for the higher classes are preserved when a booking is  
accepted for a lower class. Even after the request for three seats was accepted, 27 seats are  
still protected for class 1 demand under both theft nesting and standard nesting. Although  
both theft nesting and standard nesting are in use, most systems use standard nesting. If  
bookings strictly occur in fare class order — that is, booking class n books before booking  
class n – 1— then theft nesting and standard nesting will give the same results. Some evi-  
dence indicates that when bookings do not occur in strict fare order, standard nesting tends  
to perform better than theft nesting.  
7 Table 8.4 shows the dynamics of bookings accepted  
and rejected under standard nesting and theft nesting. Note that theft nesting rejects more  
lower-fare bookings than standard nesting in this case, meaning that more capacity remains  
for later, hopefully higher-fare bookings.  
8.5.4 Managing Cancellations\*  
Since almost 30% of airline bookings are canceled before departure, the booking manage-  
ment process at a passenger airline needs to update booking limits when cancellations oc-  
cur. The obvious way to do this would be to treat a cancellation as an increase in capacity;  
that is, when a single-seat booking cancels, increase all the positive booking limits by 1. This  
is, in fact, the way that many reservation systems treat cancellations. 190

There is a problem with this approach, however. Say we have a booking limit of three  
seats in the lowest booking class and we accept a booking for four seats in some higher class.  
Then, the lowest class would close. Now, assume that 10 seconds later the booking for four  
seats is canceled \(perhaps the original request was an error\). Under the approach described  
earlier, the four seats would be added back to the open booking classes and the lowest  
booking class would remain closed. This seems wrong. After all, we have the same available  
capacity and the same forecasts for future demand that we had 10 seconds before —why  
should our booking limits change?  
Another way of viewing the issue is that, under the process described so far, the clo-  
sure of a booking class is irreversible, at least until the revenue management calculates new  
booking limits.8 For this reason, this procedure is called an irreversible process. Recognizing  
the shortcomings of an irreversible process, some reservation systems enable a reversible  
process. The trick in creating a reversible process is to allow the booking limits to go be-  
low zero. In a reversible process, new bookings are subtracted from all booking limits and  
cancellations are added back to all booking limits. As before, a booking request is accepted  
only if the corresponding booking limit is greater than the number of seats requested. This  
means that a class with a negative booking limit is closed. With a reversible process, a can-  
cellation can result in availability going from zero \(or less than zero\) to positive, opening a  
previously closed class. revenue management 191

These two approaches to treating cancellations are illustrated in Table 8.5, which shows  
a sequence of booking requests and cancellations and the corresponding evolution of the  
booking limits for four booking classes under both approaches. The initial set of booking  
limits is \(73, 12, 4, 0\). The second entry in each row of Table 8.5 is either a booking request  
or a cancellation. The other entries in each row are the booking limits just prior to the event  
under both approaches and the action \(if any\) that the airline would take. Since an airline  
cannot reject a cancellation, no actions are associated with cancellations.  
From Table 8.5 we can see that the reversible approach sometimes opens previously  
closed booking classes. This means that it often accepts more low-fare bookings than the  
irreversible approach. While this may seem appealing, the other side of the coin is that the  
irreversible approach saves more seats for later high-fare bookings. Generally, it is felt that  
the reversible approach provides higher revenue, since a booking request that immediately  
cancels will not change the booking limits. \(For an example of this, see event numbers 2  
and 3 in Table 8.5 and the resulting changes in booking limits under the two approaches.\)  
However, which approach is used is often determined by the capabilities of its reservation  
system rather than by considerations of relative benefit.9  
8.6 TACTICAL REVENUE MANAGEMENT  
The job of tactical revenue management is to calculate and periodically update booking  
limits. These booking limits are transmitted to the reservation system, which then uses  
them to determine which booking requests to accept and which to reject based on the logic  
described in Section 8.5.  
To introduce the tactical revenue management problem in its most general form, it is  
useful to define resources, products, and fare classes.  
•  
Resources are units of capacity managed by a supplier. Examples of resources are a  
flight departure, a hotel room night, and a rental car day. Each resource is typically 192

constrained — the flight departure has a limited number of seats, the hotel only has a  
limited number of rooms it can sell, and a rental car company has only so many cars  
it can rent out.  
•  
Products are what customers seek to purchase. A product may require use of one or  
more resources. A seat on Flight 130 from St. Louis to Cleveland on Monday, June  
30, is a product that uses only a single resource. A two-night stay at the Sheraton  
Cleveland Airport for a customer arriving on March 19 and departing on March 21  
is a product that uses two resources\: a room night on March 19 and a room night on  
March 20.  
•  
One or more fare classes are associated with each product. Each fare class is a com-  
bination of a price and a set of restrictions on who can purchase the product and  
when. Different fare classes can be used to establish different virtual products, for  
group pricing, for regional pricing, or for combinations of all of these.  
Table 8.6 shows how the resource and product approach applies in four different reve-  
nue management industries. A resource unit is the smallest unit of capacity that can be sold\:  
a single seat for an airline, a room night for a hotel. A company may sell several different  
types of resource\: airlines sell coach, business, and first-class seats; rental car companies of-  
fer subcompact, compact, midsize, and luxury cars; and a hotel may sell five or six different  
room types. While resources are the assets a company needs to manage, products are what  
customers actually want to buy. An airline’s products are direct and connecting flight com-  
binations. A hotel’s products are combinations of arrival date and length of stay. A customer  
reserving a two-night stay starting next Wednesday is buying a different product than one  
reserving a two-night stay starting next Thursday.  
The resource, product, and fare class terminology enables us to formulate the tactical  
revenue management problem in a very general manner. A seller faces a tactical revenue  
management problem when he\:

•  
Manages a set of resources with fixed and perishable capacity  
Controls a portfolio of products consisting of combinations of one or more of the  
resources revenue management 193  
•  
Can set and update the price of each product. In classical revenue management,  
prices are set and updated by opening and closing discrete fare classes. In other ap-  
plications, prices can be set and updated directly.  
The tactical revenue management problem discussed in this and the next three chapters is  
how a seller should choose which fare classes should be open for sale and which should be  
closed for each product at each moment to maximize expected total net contribution.  
The fact that revenue management is based on opening and closing fare classes does  
not make a big difference from the customer’s point of view — customers just see the  
fare changing over time. The focus on opening and closing fare classes is partly due to  
the design of the reservation systems. It is also based on the competitive dynamics of the  
airline market. Specifically, most airlines believe they need to match the advertised, or  
headline, fares offered by their competition in key markets to drive demand for bookings.  
However, as bookings arrive, revenue management enables them to shape demand to the  
limited capacity of each flight. Revenue management supplements rather than replaces  
pricing.  
8.6.1 Components of Tactical Revenue Management  
As we have seen, the point of tactical revenue management is to determine which fare  
classes should be open and which should be closed for all products to maximize return  
from a fixed set of resources. Tactical revenue management can be decomposed into three  
constituent decisions.  
•  
Capacity allocation. How many customers from different fare classes should be al-  
lowed to book?  
•  
•  
Network management. How should bookings be managed across a network of re-  
sources, such as an airline hub-and-spoke system or multiple-night hotel stays?  
Overbooking. How many total bookings should be accepted for a product in the face  
of uncertain future no-shows and cancellations?  
A general view of the relative importance of each of these three decisions in different indus-  
tries is shown in Table 8.7.  
Capacity allocation is important whenever a company sells the same unit of constrained  
capacity or inventory at two or more different prices. In this case, the company needs to  
determine how many units to sell at the lower price\(s\) and how many to reserve for sale at  
a higher price. The major passenger airlines need to determine how many seats to sell to  
early-booking groups and discount customers and how many to reserve for later-booking  
business customers. Rental cars and hotels face similar challenges. Sporting teams need  
to determine how many tickets to sell as season tickets or on discounts or promotions  
and how many to hold to sell at full price. Air freight carriers have agreements with dif-  
ferent customers that specify different rates — the carriers want to make sure that high-  
paying customers do not find themselves shut out because capacity was entirely reserved  
by lower-paying customers. On the other hand, resort hotels, discount carriers such as 194

Southwest, and passenger trains may maintain only a small number of prices for the same  
inventory. For these companies, capacity allocation tends to be less important than other  
aspects of revenue management.  
Network management is important for companies that sell products consisting of com-  
binations of resources. It is the single most important component of revenue management  
for passenger railways and for rental cars and business hotels, where managing length of  
stay usually has more impact on total revenue than managing rate classes. It is important  
for airlines that operate hub-and-spoke systems but not as important as capacity allocation  
or overbooking. It is of little or no importance in industries in which each product sold  
uses only a single resource, such as cruise lines, point-to-point airlines, sporting events,  
and theater.  
Overbooking is important whenever bookings are allowed to cancel or not show with  
little or no penalty. Since airline tickets were historically sold in this way, overbooking has  
been a major component of airline systems. Overbooking has become somewhat less im-  
portant as the fraction of nonrefundable tickets has increased, but it is still an important  
component of revenue management at most airlines, as it is at business hotels and rental  
car companies. On the other hand, most resort hotels and cruise lines do not overbook  
because of the high perceived cost of denying service to a customer who may have planned  
her entire vacation \(or even honeymoon\) around staying at a particular resort or departing  
on a particular cruise. Sporting events and theaters generally have nonrefundable tickets  
and usually do not overbook.  
Over the course of the next three chapters, we examine each of these three constituent  
problems independently, but in fact they are closely entwined and, for maximum profit-  
ability, they need to be solved together.  
8.6.2 Revenue Management Systems  
The primary job of a revenue management system is to calculate and update the booking  
limits within the reservation system. Typically, a revenue management system is separate  
from the reservation system but linked to it, as shown in Figure 8.3. The revenue manage-  
ment system receives a feed of bookings and cancellations from the reservation system and, revenue management 195

in turn, calculates booking limits that are transmitted periodically to the reservation system.  
The revenue management system will then send messages to update the booking limits in  
the global distribution systems.  
The revenue management system includes a database with information on current  
bookings on all flights. It also includes a database incorporating fares for all product – fare  
class combinations, capacities on all flight legs, and passenger variable costs by product.  
This information is typically extracted from other computer systems, specifically the pric-  
ing system, the scheduling system, and various accounting systems.  
The forecasting module generates and updates forecasts for all product – fare class com-  
binations for all future dates. Generally, an initial forecast is generated about one year prior  
to departure — the time when most airlines first allow bookings for a future flight. This  
forecast is updated periodically as bookings and cancellations are received over time. Typi-  
cally, a forecast is updated monthly when a flight is six months or more from departure and  
more frequently as departure approaches. Forecasts are typically updated daily for flights  
that are within two weeks or so of departure.  
The forecasts generated by the revenue management system are probabilistic; that is, they  
predict both a mean and a standard deviation for future demand. Uncertainty plays a major  
role in the calculation of optimal booking limits.  
Example 8.4  
A typical forecast generated by a revenue management system would be that  
the number of expected future B-Class bookings on Flight 47 from Chicago  
to Grand Rapids, Michigan, departing at 9\:30 two weeks from today is 13 pas-  
sengers with a standard deviation of 9, while the number of expected M-Class  
bookings is 22 passengers with a standard deviation of 10.  
These forecasts are based on current and recent bookings for this flight, historic book-  
ing performance for this flight, and general demand trends for all flights. Most systems 196  
revenue management  
also forecast cancellations and no-shows to support overbooking calculations — a topic  
discussed in Chapter 11. Standard forecasting techniques are used to generate the initial  
forecast and to update the forecasts as bookings and cancellations are received over time.  
The probabilistic forecasts are key inputs used by the optimization module to generate  
the booking limits. As described in Chapter 9, booking limits are calculated by estimat-  
ing the economic trade-off between accepting more discount bookings now versus having  
more capacity available to serve future bookings. Typically, booking limits are automati-  
cally recalculated whenever the demand forecasts are updated.  
Revenue management systems recommend booking limits for each product – fare class  
combination. Effective revenue management requires that these recommendations be con-  
tinually monitored and reviewed. For example, Delta Airlines employs a group of more  
than 30 revenue management analysts who continually monitor the forecasts and booking  
limits generated by Delta’s revenue management system. Monitoring and adjusting fore-  
casts are particularly important parts of the process. For example, the revenue management  
system will not know that the Super Bowl will be held in New Orleans this year. It is the job  
of the revenue management analyst to adjust the forecasts for January flights in the New  
Orleans market to reflect the additional demand generated by the Super Bowl.  
8.6.3 Updating Booking Limits  
Most RM companies set initial booking limits based on resource capacities, the demand  
forecasts for each booking class, and the economic trade-offs among the classes. Most  
reservation systems begin to accept bookings about a year prior to a flight departure  
or room rental date. At this time an airline sets initial booking limits for fare classes on  
those departures. The initial booking limits are loaded into the reservation system and  
decremented as bookings are accepted. Periodically, demand is reforecast and new book-  
ing limits are calculated based on the new forecast of demand and remaining unbooked  
capacity. This is known as a reoptimization or an update. Updates can be triggered in three  
different ways.  
•  
•  
•  
Periodic updates occur at scheduled intervals. These intervals are typically long \(say,  
monthly\) when the flight is far from departure and booking requests are rare. As  
the flight approaches departure and the booking pace increases, periodic updates  
are scheduled more frequently — daily or even more often during the last two weeks  
prior to departure.  
Event-driven updates are triggered by events such as a booking class closing, a change  
in aircraft, and an unanticipated spike in demand.  
Requested updates may be launched at any time by a flight controller or revenue man-  
ager based on competitive actions, changes in fares, anticipated changes in future  
demand, or any other reason.  
Each time booking limits are updated for a flight, the new booking limits are loaded into  
the reservation system and the booking management process resumes immediately starting  
from the new limits. revenue management 197  
8.7 REVENUE MANAGEMENT METRICS  
Before deregulation in 1983, airlines could only change their fares after a lengthy regulatory  
review process. Without direct control over fares, the point of most airline marketing was  
to fill the planes. The Civil Aeronautics Board always set fares sufficiently high that more  
passengers meant more money and therefore more profit. Furthermore, little or no price  
differentiation was allowed, so there was no scope to perform revenue management. In  
this environment, the airlines used load factor as their primary performance measure. Load  
factor is defined as the number of seats sold on a flight divided by the number of available  
seats. A 150-seat flight that departs with 105 passengers on board has experienced a 105/150  
= 70% load factor. Load factor was a sensible performance measure in the regulated world.  
Prices were regulated at a level such that if an airline filled about 75% of its seats on each  
flight — the break-even load factor— it would meet its total costs. Each passenger above the  
break-even load factor represented additional profit. A marketing program was considered  
successful if it led to increased load factors.  
Following deregulation, finding appropriate performance metrics for a flight became  
more complicated. In a multifare world, load factor could no longer pass muster as the  
most important performance metric for a flight. The reason is easy to see — in response  
to the rise of discount carriers, the major airlines had introduced deep discounts that in-  
duced vast amounts of leisure demand on many flights. It would be easy to maximize load  
factor for these flights — simply allow deep-discount customers to book all the seats. But  
this would be counter to the entire purpose of tactical revenue management, which is to  
maximize revenue by reserving seats for late-booking business passengers. Since load factor  
ignores revenue, it is the wrong metric for a revenue management world. In fact, it is worse  
than that\: policies designed to maximize load factor would lead to planes filled with deep-discount  
passengers and massive denial of availability to business passengers — the airlines’  
highest-paying customers.  
To get a better view of the revenue picture, airlines began to look at yield in addi-  
tion to load factor. Yield is simply revenue per passenger mile. Like load factor, it can be  
measured at any level from flight to market to entire airline. It was sometimes stated that  
the goal of managing bookings should be to increase yield —hence the term yield man-  
agement, which was the original name for what is now more commonly called revenue  
management. Unfortunately, yield alone is a very imperfect metric since it ignores flight  
capacity. The strategy for increasing the yield from a flight is the exact opposite from that  
for increasing load factor — reject all early-booking demand and accept only late-booking,  
high-yield passengers. This policy would maximize yield but would be disastrous for the  
airline, since it would result in flights that were empty, except for a few high-paying busi-  
ness passengers.  
What the airlines really needed was a metric that combined the capacity focus of load  
factor with the revenue focus of yield and recognized that the goal of revenue management  
is to maximize the return from resources. For an airline, these resources are seats, and  
the airline needs to maximize revenue from available seats. Since prices \(and costs\) are at  
least somewhat proportional to distance, it helps to normalize by distance and to ­ measure 198  
revenue management  
­ revenue per available seat mile, or RASM. An airline that flies a 100-seat aircraft on an 1,800-  
mile flight \(about the distance from Chicago to San Francisco\) with a total revenue of  
\$50,000 achieved an RASM of \$50,000/\(100 × 1,800\) = \$0.28 for that flight. Note that  
RASM is indifferent to how the revenue is distributed among passengers. Fifty passengers  
paying \$1,000 each \(a 50% load factor\) would result in the same RASM as 100 passengers  
paying \$500 each \(a 100% load factor\). This is the right focus from the revenue manage-  
ment point of view — a policy that has resulted in \$51,000 from the flight is more successful  
than one that resulted in \$50,000, even if the first policy resulted in a lower load factor.10  
However, load factor can still be useful\: if a flight is achieving a high RASM with a low  
load factor, it would be good to look for ways to find more customers for the flight even at  
low fares, as long as existing sales are not cannibalized. And if the load factor is extremely  
high for a flight, the airline might experiment with raising some of the fares to see if it can  
continue to fill the flight at higher average fares. If successful, these tactics would lead to  
increased RASM.  
Revenue per available seat mile can also be expressed in terms of net yield and load ­ factor\:  
RASM = net yield × load factor  
Revenue per available seat mile is the leading metric currently used by airlines to measure  
effectiveness of pricing and revenue management. Similar approaches are also employed  
at other RM companies\: revenue per available room night \(often abbreviated REVPAR\) at  
hotels, revenue per available rental day at rental car companies, revenue per berth for cruise  
lines, and revenue per available seat hour \(RevPASH\) for restaurants. In each case, the metric  
emphasizes that the goal should be to maximize the revenue — or, more accurately, contri-  
bution — throughput per unit of capacity.  
The RASM metric enables comparison of revenue performance across markets and  
within a single market over time. Speaking broadly, flights that are achieving high RASM  
are generating a higher return on the company’s assets than those with low RASM. And  
RASM also provides a useful performance benchmark among different airlines. Those air-  
lines achieving high RASMs are generating more revenue from the utilization of their assets  
than those airlines with lower RASMs.  
While RASM is an important high-level metric for measuring the overall effectiveness  
of revenue management, it does not address the need to measure the individual effective-  
ness of the different components of revenue management, such as capacity allocation and  
overbooking. To do this, airlines typically use a portfolio of metrics in addition to RASM,  
which is likely to include the following.  
•  
•  
Voluntary and involuntary denied-boarding rates measure the fraction of passengers  
who show up for a flight but are denied boarding either by volunteering \(voluntary\)  
or by being chosen \(involuntary\). The calculation of these rates is described in Sec-  
tion 11.8.  
Spoilage rates measure the number of empty seats at a flight departure that could  
have been filled but, because some booking requests were denied, went empty. This is  
a measure of the effectiveness of overbooking and is described in Section 11.9. revenue management 199  
•  
•  
Dilution rates measure the extent to which early low-fare bookings take seats that  
could have been sold to future high-fare bookings — an example of cannibalization.  
Dilution rate is a measure of capacity control effectiveness, and it is described in Sec-  
tion 9.6.  
Revenue opportunity metrics measure the effectiveness of capacity control against a  
hypothetical “perfect seat allocation” alternative, as described in Section 9.6.  
In each case, tracking trends is usually more important than the absolute numbers. It is  
often difficult to say if the revenue opportunity metric or RASM achieved by a particu-  
lar flight departure is good or bad given the multitude of market and competitive factors  
that can influence it. But a consistent downward trend in revenue opportunity metrics or  
RASM usually signals a situation that requires attention.  
Revenue management metrics are still evolving. By using a portfolio of metrics, a rev-  
enue management company can get a good view of its overall performance in generating  
revenue from its markets relative to competition and how that performance is changing  
over time. It can evaluate the performance of its revenue management program and deter-  
mine areas for improvement. It can evaluate individual revenue managers by measuring  
the number of times their interventions improved overall performance versus the times  
when intervention degraded performance. However, a considerable amount of work re-  
mains to be done on developing improved revenue management metrics. Areas of current  
research include developing metrics to evaluate the performance of network management  
and developing metrics that separate the effects of pricing decisions from those of revenue  
management decisions.  
8.8 INCREMENTAL COSTS AND ANCILLARY REVENUE IN REVENUE  
MANAGEMENT  
Chapter 5 notes that the goal of pricing optimization is usually to maximize expected con-  
tribution, incorporating both the incremental cost and expected ancillary revenue associ-  
ated with a customer commitment. The same is true of revenue management — decisions  
on which bookings to accept and reject should be made on the basis of expected contribu-  
tion. Revenue management was developed in the passenger airlines industry at a time when  
the incremental cost of carrying a passenger was extremely low relative to the fares. The  
earliest generation of airline revenue management systems ignored incremental costs \(or  
assumed they were zero\) and focused on maximizing expected revenue —hence the name  
revenue management. As a result, much of the revenue management literature is couched  
in terms of maximizing revenue instead of maximizing contribution.  
For airlines, this can be a reasonable assumption —while it depends on the length of the  
flight and other factors, the incremental cost of an additional passenger is on the order of  
\$10 to \$20 in the United States, which is typically \(but not always\) much lower than the  
fare. Nonetheless, incremental costs can be an important consideration when fares are low,  
and they can be quite important in other revenue management industries. Table 8.8 shows  
some of the most important elements of incremental cost and a subjective estimate of the 200

importance of incremental cost in several revenue management industries. Incremental  
costs are relatively high — and thus important to consider — in cruise lines and container  
shipping. Food is a major expense for cruise lines, and the amount of food they purchase for  
a sailing depends on the number of passengers booked. At the other end of the spectrum,  
incremental costs are relatively low \(and therefore generally unimportant\) in theater and  
sporting events. It generally costs little more to stage a play in front of a full theater versus  
an empty one — not counting, of course, the psychic cost to the actors of playing before an  
empty house. In between these two extremes fall hotels, rental car companies, and passen-  
ger airlines. In all cases, it is most important to estimate and incorporate incremental costs  
into revenue management decisions when the incremental cost is high relative to the fare.  
Ancillary revenue can also be important in revenue management. Over the past decade  
or so, the airlines have unbundled and begun to charge separately for services that were  
previously provided for free, such as luggage and onboard meals. As a result, global airline  
ancillary revenue grew from \$32 billion to \$59 billion from 2010 to 2016, representing  
about 9% of airline revenue. Ancillary revenue has become an important part of the busi-  
ness model of some airlines — it generated 45% of the revenue for low-cost Spirit Airlines  
in 2018.11 In fact, ancillary revenue plays an important role in most revenue management  
industries\: Table 8.9 shows the major sources of ancillary revenue associated with differ-  
ent revenue management industries and their relative importance in profitability. Casino  
hotels are an interesting extreme case\: in many cases, the potential gambling revenue can  
substantially outweigh the room rate for a customer, which means that it can be profitable revenue management 201  
for the casino to offer rooms for very low rates \(or even free\), with the knowledge that they  
will make up any lost room revenue in gambling revenue \(Kuyumcu 2002\).  
In Chapters 9, 10, and 11, revenue management problems are often formulated in terms  
of maximizing revenue rather than maximizing contribution. This is a remnant of the ori-  
gin of revenue management in the airlines where incremental costs were historically much  
lower than fares and could be ignored in pricing and booking acceptance decisions. How-  
ever, for a company to maximize profit, it should adopt revenue management policies that  
maximize expected contribution defined as fare \(or price\) plus expected ancillary profit  
minus incremental cost.  
8.9 REVENUE MANAGEMENT IN ACTION  
By most measures, revenue management has been a great success. From its origins in the  
1980s, revenue management has advanced to the point that it is now de rigueur for all major  
passenger airlines as well as most major hotel chains, rental car companies, and cruise lines.  
For most major airlines, it makes no sense to ask, “What benefit are you realizing from your  
revenue management system?” because the alternative of returning to setting and updating  
booking limits manually is unthinkable. In the airlines, hotels, rental car companies, and  
a number of related industries, revenue management has gone from a strategic investment  
that provided a step change in capabilities and profitability to a fundamental capability  
necessary to compete — the table stakes.  
It is a sign of the effectiveness of revenue management that low-cost carriers such as  
Southwest and EasyJet have invested in developing \(or purchasing\) automated revenue  
management systems and have built substantial revenue management departments. While  
they continue to compete primarily on the basis of lower costs, they have learned that rev-  
enue needs to be maximized as well to survive in the fiercely competitive passenger airline  
industry.  
Furthermore, revenue management has expanded well beyond the airlines to other  
service industries that share the characteristics of constrained and immediately perish-  
able inventory. These industries include spas and health clubs, parking garages, toll roads,  
self-storage units, theme parks, trucking, air cargo, passenger and freight railways, parking  
lots, and multifamily rental units \(apartments\). In each of these industries, there has been  
academic research into the application of revenue management, one or more companies  
providing revenue management software, or both.  
In any case, the most important development in most revenue management industries  
has been the rapid growth and ultimate dominance of the internet as a channel for sales.  
The internet has influenced the development of revenue management and pricing optimi-  
zation in four important ways\:  
•  
The internet has provided unprecedented fare visibility to consumers. Instead of  
relying on travel agents or 800 numbers, price-conscious shoppers surf the net for  
bargains on their own time, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This increases the pressure  
for airlines and others to continually manage their prices and availabilities. 202  
revenue management  
•  
•  
•  
While the internet has been a disaster for the traditional travel agency distribu-  
tion channels, it has led to the rise of new online intermediaries, such as Expedia,  
Travelocity, and Priceline. These intermediaries and their various competitors are all  
striving to be the dominant retailer of travel products on the internet. Naturally, the  
airlines are leery of the prospect of any intermediary gaining a dominant position,  
so a consortium of US airlines created Orbitz to be their own online retailer. For the  
foreseeable future, airlines will need to manage pricing and availability through a  
variety of online retailers as well as through their own websites and the traditional  
channels.  
The internet has also created new opportunities for the airlines to create and sell  
more “inferior” products with fewer features included. For example, Priceline allows  
customers to bid for travel without knowing the exact departure time or airline they  
are purchasing. Priceline has explicitly marketed this as an inferior product that the  
airlines can safely sell at a high discount without cannibalizing their mainstream  
products. Other airlines and hotels are experimenting with selling distressed inven-  
tory \(i.e., empty capacity close to departure\) at deep discounts. The need to manage  
these additional discount products adds further complexity to revenue management.  
Revenue management was initially shaped by the design of the global distribution  
systems the airlines developed in the 1960s. These systems maintain a relatively small  
number of fare classes for each product, and the focus of revenue management has  
been on which of these classes to open and close at different times. Travel agents were  
trained in the parlance of booking classes and product restrictions that the airlines  
had established. But the internet is much more suited to real-time pricing than to  
availability management. Online shoppers do not care how many Y-Class or M-Class  
seats are available; they want to know how to get from point A to point B as cheaply  
and conveniently as possible. While many industries — notably online retail— are  
able to adjust prices in a fully dynamic fashion, many revenue management indus-  
tries \(hotels, airlines, rental cars\) are still stuck in a world where the need to manage  
booking classes limits their flexibility to perform fully dynamic pricing.  
In any case, revenue management is here to stay. Until the flexible airplane and hotel  
are invented, airlines and hotels will need to maximize net contribution from fixed and  
perishable capacity. The capability to determine who gets to purchase at what fares will be  
an important driver of market success for the foreseeable future.  
8.10 SUMMARY  
•  
Revenue management is the name given to the ways by which a number of industries  
maximize expected contribution from their constrained resources. It is applicable to  
a seller who meets the following conditions\:  
•  
The seller is selling a fixed stock of perishable capacity. •  
•  
•  
•  
•  
revenue management 203  
•  
The seller offers a set of fare classes, each of which has a fixed price \(at least in the  
short run\).  
•  
The seller can change the availability of fare classes over time.  
•  
Customers book capacity prior to usage.  
•  
High-fare customers book later than low-fare customers.  
Revenue management is used in its purest form by passenger airlines, hotels, rental  
car companies, cruise lines, passenger trains, apartment rental managers, and various  
forms of freight companies. Many of the core concepts also apply in other industries.  
Revenue management needs to be implemented at three levels. At the strategic level,  
it requires identifying customer segments and creating virtual products and other  
ways of differentiating prices. At the booking-control level, it requires determining in  
real time whether or not booking requests should be accepted or rejected. At an in-  
termediate level, tactical revenue management periodically recalculates and updates  
the booking limits used for booking controls.  
The primary revenue management segmentation at the passenger airlines is between  
early-booking, price-sensitive leisure travelers and later-booking, less price-sensitive  
business customers. The airlines, hotels, and rental car companies use time-based  
product differentiation to create products oriented toward each of these segments. In  
addition, revenue management companies typically have products tailored to other  
segments, such as groups and large corporations. Finally, they may also use channel  
pricing and regional pricing to further segment the market. This can lead to pricing  
structures of great complexity.  
In general, a revenue management company controls a set of constrained resources  
that can be combined to create products. Each product has a range of discrete fare  
classes with different associated fares. These fare classes reflect the price differentia-  
tion tactics being used by the seller and the set of products and fares the seller has  
established. Tactical revenue management requires updating booking limits on these  
fare classes over time.  
Tactical revenue management consists of three interrelated problems\:  
•  
Capacity allocation\: How should fare class booking limits be set for a single-  
resource product?  
•  
Network management\: How should bookings for multi-resource products be con-  
trolled?  
•  
Overbooking\: How many total bookings should be allowed for a resource?  
These three problems are not independent. However, they have different levels of  
importance within different revenue management industries.  
The main job of a revenue management system is to set initial booking limits and to  
perform the periodic reoptimization of the booking limits. A revenue management  
system includes a forecasting module that calculates probabilistic forecasts of future 204  
revenue management  
•  
•  
•  
demand and an optimization module that uses those forecasts along with other  
information to determine the optimal booking limits.  
Early programs for revenue management aimed to maximize expected revenue. In  
an environment where incremental costs are low relative to prices, this is a reason-  
able assumption. However, as prices have fallen and revenue management has been  
adopted by new industries, it has become increasingly important to estimate incre-  
mental costs and include them in the objective function. Further, ancillary products  
play an important role in many revenue management industries, and their expected  
contribution needs to be incorporated into revenue management decisions.  
The best measure of overall revenue management performance is contribution per  
available unit of resource. The metric most typically used at the airlines is RASM—  
revenue per available seat mile. Equivalent metrics exist in other revenue manage-  
ment industries. For example, REVPAR— revenue per available room — is the  
preferred metric for revenue management performance in the hotel industry.  
Revenue management has been a highly effective tactic at the major airlines since  
the mid-1980s. However, the major airlines are increasingly finding themselves  
challenged by low-cost carriers. While the major airlines have been able to main-  
tain higher revenues per available seat mile than the low-cost carriers, this revenue  
advantage has not been able to overcome the cost advantage of the low-cost carriers.  
It is likely that, at least in the airlines, revenue management will increasingly evolve  
toward dynamic pricing, with less emphasis on capacity allocation.  
The next three chapters address each of the three tactical revenue management prob-  
lems in more detail. Chapter 9 deals with capacity allocation, Chapter 10 with network  
management, and Chapter 11 with overbooking.

8.12 EXERCISE  
A restaurant has 25 tables, each of which can seat up to four people. Typically, it can do  
three seatings per table during the dinner period from 6\:00 to 10\:00 p.m. The restaurant  
has a fairly predictable demand pattern, with Fridays and Saturdays the busiest nights and  
Sundays and Mondays the least busy. The restaurant is always booked to capacity on Fri-  
days and Saturdays and sometimes on Wednesdays and Thursdays but virtually never on  
Sunday or Monday. It has implemented a revenue management program under which it  
will sometimes turn down booking requests for one or two people on Fridays and Satur-  
days if it believes it can fill the restaurant with bookings for larger parties of three and four  
people. What performance measure should it use to evaluate the effectiveness of its revenue  
management program?notes  
1\. Some would argue that the global airline industry has still not fully recovered from  
the shock of deregulation; see, for example, Berry and Jia 2010.  
2\. Kama’aina is the Hawaiian word for “native.” As another example of this type of  
segmentation, during the off-season, Disney World offers discounts to Florida residents  
who can produce a driver’s license as proof of residence.  
3\. Lieberman 2012 discusses the “air-sea cruise line management process” in detail.  
4\. Airlines, hotels, and rental cars need to deal with both booking requests and avail-  
ability requests. The booking request is a request for an actual booking. An availability  
request is a check on what fares are available for a particular product. Many availability  
requests are from customers who are just shopping. For simplicity, the book speaks of  
booking requests.  
5\. As a consequence of the fact that fare classes are typically labeled with a letter of the  
alphabet, some reservation systems limit the number of booking classes per product to a  
maximum of 26.  
6\. This is true at least when fare classes have independent demands. If a lower fare  
class can cannibalize demand from a higher fare class, then it may be optimal to close the  
higher fare class earlier than the lower one. Section 9.3 discusses this possibility.  
7\. Discussion of theft nesting and standard nesting can be found in Talluri and van  
Ryzin 2004b and Gallego and Topaloglu 2019.  
8\. There is one exception\: most reservation systems will reopen the highest class when  
cancellations occur on a totally booked flight.  
9\. Once again, different reservation systems use slightly different approaches to update  
booking limits and protection levels in the face of cancellations, and there is no consensus  
on the best approach.  
10\. From an overall pricing and revenue optimization \(PRO\) point of view, net contri-  
bution per available seat mile \(NCASM\) would be an even better metric. For the example  
flight, assume there is a per-passenger operating cost of \$50. Then, 100 passengers paying  
\$500 each would result in an operating margin of \$50,000 – 100 × \$50 = \$45,000, for an  
NCASM of \$0.25, while 50 passengers paying \$1,000 apiece would result in an operat-  
ing margin of \$50,000 – 50 × \$50, for an operating margin of \$47,500 and an NCASM of  
\$0.26. The higher operating margin per available seat mile \(OMASM\) accurately reflects  
the superior operating margin of the second case, which is not reflected in RASM. How-  
ever, for RM companies where the fares are much higher than the operating costs, RASM  
is close enough to NCASM to provide an effective metric.  
11\. Ancillary revenue plays a particularly important role for low-cost airlines and, in  
many cases, is a core element of their business model. 9 Capacity Allocation  
Capacity allocation is the problem of determining how many seats \(or hotel rooms or rental  
cars\) to allow low-fare customers to book when there is the possibility of future high-fare  
demand. Capacity allocation is particularly important to passenger airlines because many  
airlines have based their revenue management strategy on segmenting the market between  
early-booking, low-fare leisure customers and later-booking, higher-fare business custom-  
ers, as discussed in Chapter 8. Capacity allocation is also an issue for any revenue manage-  
ment company that has the opportunity to restrict early low-price bookings in order to  
reserve capacity for later higher-price bookings. The techniques described in this chapter  
are used mutatis mutandis in many industries, including rental car companies, hotels, cruise  
lines, freight transportation, and made-to-order manufacturing, among many ­ others.  
We begin by analyzing the two-class model in some detail. We then move on to the  
multiclass problem, with an emphasis on the widely used expected marginal seat revenue  
\(EMSR\) heuristics. Next we consider the dynamic multiclass problem when fare classes  
are nested. We then relax the independence assumption and examine how booking limits  
could be set when demand in different fare classes can depend on which classes are cur-  
rently open. We look at a data-driven approach that does not depend on estimating param-  
eters of a demand distribution. Finally, we see how the performance of a capacity allocation  
program can be measured and evaluated.  
9.1 THE TWO-CLASS PROBLEM  
In the two-class capacity allocation problem, a flight \(or other product, such as a hotel  
room night\) with fixed capacity serves two classes of customers\: discount customers who  
book early and full-fare customers who book later. Discount customers each pay a fare  
pd \> 0, and full-fare customers each pay a higher fare pf \> pd  
. In the basic two-class model,  
we assume that all discount booking requests occur before any full-fare passengers seek to  
book. We have a limited number of seats. The static two-class capacity allocation problem is  
to ­ determine how many discount customers \(if any\) we should allow to book. Or, equiva-  
lently, how many seats \(if any\) we should protect for full-fare customers. 208  
capacity allocation  
The standard approaches to the capacity allocation problem described in this section  
are formulated as if the goal were to maximize expected revenue — that is, incremental  
costs and ancillary contribution are zero. This streamlines the discussion and is consistent  
with the revenue management literature. But, in reality, companies will be \(or should be\)  
maximizing expected total contribution, including incremental cost and ancillary contri-  
bution, as discussed in Section 8.8. The approaches in this section can be made consistent  
with maximizing total contribution by substituting net contribution wherever price or fare  
appears in an algorithm or equation.  
The goal of two-class capacity allocation is to determine a discount booking limit— the  
maximum number of discount bookings that will be allowed. When there are only two  
classes, the protection level for full-fare bookings is equal to the capacity minus the book-  
ing limit\: y = C – b, where C is capacity as described in Section 8.5. It is straightforward to  
calculate the booking limit given the protection level and capacity, and vice versa.  
9.1.1 The Decision Tree Approach  
At the heart of the capacity allocation problem is the trade-off between setting the booking  
limit too high and setting it too low. If we set the discount booking limit too low, we will turn  
away discount customers but not see enough full-fare demand to fill the plane. The plane will  
depart with empty seats even though we turned away bookings. This is called spoilage, since  
the empty seats become spoiled inventory at the moment the flight departs. On the other  
hand, if we allow too many discount customers to book, we run the risk of turning away more  
profitable full-fare customers. This is called dilution, since we diluted the revenue we could  
have received from saving an additional seat for a high-fare booking. The challenge of capac-  
ity allocation is to balance the risks of spoilage and dilution to maximize expected revenue.  
The trade-offs in the two-class problem are shown as a decision tree in Figure 9.1 for  
a flight with total capacity C. Ff \(x\) is the probability that full-fare demand is less than or  
equal to x, and Fd \(x\) is the probability that discount demand is less than or equal to x.  
Assume we have currently set a booking limit of b with 0 ≤ b \< C. The decision we face is  
whether to increase the booking limit by one seat \(or, equivalently, to reduce the protection  
level by one seat\). What would be the change in expected revenue if we increase the booking  
limit from b to b + 1? If discount demand dd is less than or equal to b, there will be no effect  
on expected revenue. \(Recall that booking classes are nested, so all of the seats that are not  
sold to discount customers are available to full-fare customers.\) In this case, the net change  
in expected revenue of increasing the booking limit by one seat is 0, as shown on the top  
branch of the tree in Figure 9.1.  
¯  
Only when discount demand is greater than b—which occurs with probability F  
d \(b\) =  
1 – Fd \(b\)— do things get interesting.1 In that case, increasing the booking limit from b to  
b + 1 results in an additional discount booking. \(For simplicity, throughout the chapter, we  
assume no cancellations or no-shows so that the additional booking will result in a paying  
passenger.\) The net effect on revenue depends on full-fare demand. If full-fare demand  
¯  
is greater than C – b, which happens with probability F  
f \(C – b\) = 1 – Ff \(C – b\), the addi-  
tional discount booking will displace a full-fare passenger. This is dilution, and the resulting  
change in total revenue is pd – pf \< 0. The other possibility is that discount demand is greater capacity allocation 209

than b and full-fare demand is less than the protection level, C – b. In this case, we accept  
an additional discount passenger but do not displace a full-fare passenger. The gain is pd. In  
this case, increasing the discount booking limit has reduced spoilage.  
The expected change in revenue from changing the booking limit from b to b + 1 is the  
probability-weighted sum of the possible outcomes, or

\]  
If the term on the right-hand side of Equation 9.1 is greater than zero, then we can increase  
expected profitability by increasing the discount booking limit from b to b + 1. On the  
other hand, if the term is less than zero, increasing the discount booking limit will lead to  
decreased expected revenue.  
¯  
The key term in Equation 9.1 is pd – F  
f \(C – b\)pf . As long as this term is greater than zero,  
we should keep increasing the discount booking allocation until it becomes less than or  
equal to zero or b = C, whichever comes first. With a booking limit of b, there will always  
be at least C – b seats available for full-fare passengers. If discount demand turns out to be  
¯  
less than b, even more seats will be available for full-fare passengers. F  
f \(C – b\) is the prob-  
ability that full-fare demand will exceed the protection level. It is shown as a function of b  
¯  
in Figure 9.2. The term F  
f \(C – b\) is small when the discount booking limit is small \(that is,  
the protection level is large\) and gets larger as we increase the booking limit \(that is, as we  
¯  
decrease the protection level\). If pd \< F  
f \(C\)pf , then we should not allocate any seats for dis-  
¯  
count passengers —we are better off saving all seats for full-fare passengers. If pd \> F  
f \(C\)pf ,  
then we are better off allocating at least one seat for discount passengers.  
This marginal analysis suggests the following simple hill-climbing algorithm for calcu-  
lating the optimal booking limit b\*.

If E\[h\(b\)\] \> 0 and Fd \(b + 1\) \< 1, set b ← b + 1 and go to step 2.  
This algorithm involves adding one seat at a time to the discount booking limit \(or,  
equivalently, removing one seat at a time from the full-fare protection level\) and continu-  
ing as long as adding one more seat increases expected revenue. However, there is a simpler  
way to get to the same point.  
9.1.2 Littlewood’s Rule  
¯  
The sequential algorithm finds the largest integer value of b\* such that F  
f \(C – b\) \> pd /pf .  
The value of b\* that meets this condition can be approximated by solving the equation  
¯  
F  
f \(y\*\) = pd /pf , \(9.2\)  
or, equivalently, Ff \(y\*\) = 1 – pd /pf , where y\* = C – b\* is the optimal protection level for  
full-fare bookings. Equation 9.2 is an approximation because it is unlikely that the value  
¯  
for which y\* holds exactly will be an integer; however, if F  
f \(y\*\) is a continuous distribution  
\(say, the normal or log-normal\), then we can solve 9.2 exactly and round to find a reason-  
able integer solution. If we are using a discrete distribution, then we set y\* to the smallest  
¯  
value of y such that F  
f \(y\*\) ≤ pd /pf .  
Condition 9.2 for the optimal two-class discount booking limit was first described in  
1972 by Kenneth Littlewood, an analyst at British Overseas Airways Company \(BOAC,  
a predecessor to British Airways\), and is known as Littlewood’s rule. The quantity on the  
¯  
left-hand side of Equation 9.2, F  
f \(y\*\), is the probability that full-fare demand will ex-  
ceed the protection level. Littlewood’s rule states that, to maximize expected revenue, the  
­ probability that full-fare demand will exceed the protection level should equal the fare  
ratio pd /pf . If the discount fare is 0, Littlewood’s rule states that we should set the protec- capacity allocation 211  
tion so high that there is no chance that full-fare demand would exceed it. In other words,  
the optimal discount booking limit would be 0. This is intuitive — if discount passengers  
are not paying us, we should not give them any seats! As pd increases, the optimal number  
of seats to protect decreases until, when pd = pf , it is optimal to set the discount booking  
limit to C. This is also intuitive — if discount passengers are paying as much as full-fare  
passengers, there is nothing to be gained by turning away a discount booking when there  
are still empty seats.  
¯  
Almost always, the function F  
f \(y\) will be a strictly decreasing function of the protection  
¯  
level y. In this case, F  
f will be invertible and we can write Littlewood’s rule as  
¯  
y\* = min\[F  
f  
–1 \(pd /pf \), C \], \(9.3\)  
¯  
where F  
f  
–1 refers to the inverse complementary cumulative distribution function of full-fare  
¯  
demand. At the point where y\* = F  
f  
–1 \(pd /pf \), the risks of protecting too much capacity for  
full-fare demand and protecting too little are exactly balanced.  
Note that, according to Equation 9.3, the optimal protection level does not depend on  
the aircraft capacity except that it cannot be larger than the capacity. This means that we do  
not need to recalculate the protection level if we change capacity as long as the fares do not  
change. The idea is illustrated in Example 9.1.  
Example 9.1  
An airline has set a discount booking limit of 80 seats on a 150-seat aircraft for  
a certain flight departure. The corresponding protection level is 70 seats. If the  
airline substituted a 100-seat aircraft for that flight and neither the fares nor the  
full-fare demand forecast changed, then the optimal protection level would still  
be 70 seats. The optimal discount booking limit with the smaller aircraft would  
be 100 – 70 = 30 seats. If the airline decides to go even smaller and assign a 50-  
seat aircraft to the flight, the optimal decision would be to protect all 50 seats  
for full-fare passengers.  
One fact you may find surprising about Littlewood’s rule is that the optimal protection  
level— and, hence, the optimal discount booking limit — does not depend in any way on  
the forecast of discount demand. The distribution of discount demand Fd does not appear  
in Equation 9.2. Doubling \(or halving\) the discount demand forecast will not change the  
optimal protection level. The economic trade-offs embodied in Littlewood’s rule only de-  
pend on the two fares and the distribution of expected full-fare demand.  
Example 9.2  
The mean full-fare demand for a flight with a 100-seat aircraft is 50 with a  
standard deviation of 100. For any fare ratio, the corresponding optimal book-  
¯  
ing limit is the largest value of b for which F  
f \(C – b\) ≤ pd /pf . Table 9.1 illustrates  
the key calculation in the optimal two-class discount booking limit algorithm  
for a 100-seat flight. For a fare ratio of 0.4, the optimal booking limit is 25; for  
a ratio of 0.5, it is 50; and for a ratio of 0.6, it is 76. Since discount demand does 212

not enter into Littlewood’s rule, these limits are independent of the discount  
demand forecast.  
In Example 9.2 the booking limit increases with the fare ratio, as expected. Notice that if  
the fare ratio is less than 0.309, we would not allow any discount passengers to book—we  
would be better off protecting the entire plane for full-fare passengers. On the other hand,  
if the fare ratio is greater than 0.691, we would open the entire flight to discount passenger  
bookings. In either case, the airline might want to consider revisiting its fare structure — in  
the first case the discount fare is probably too low, and in the second case it is probably too  
high relative to the full fare.  
The trade-offs involved in setting the discount booking limit are shown in Figure 9.3 for  
a 100-seat flight with mean full-fare demand of 50 and standard deviation of 25 — the same  
values as in Table 9.1. The discount fare is \$100, and the full fare is \$200, so the fare ratio is  
0.5\. The top curve is total expected revenue — the sum of the expected revenue from full- capacity allocation 213  
fare passengers and discount passengers. The dotted curve is expected discount revenue,  
and the difference between expected total revenue and expected discount revenue is ex-  
pected full-fare revenue. As we increase the discount booking limit from zero, the expected  
revenue from discount passengers increases, with very little decrease in expected full-fare  
passenger revenue. As we continue to increase the discount booking limit, we begin to  
displace more and more full-fare passengers. The point at which the decrease in expected  
full-fare passengers exactly balances the gain from expected additional discount passengers  
is the optimal booking limit calculated by Littlewood’s rule.  
To summarize, Littlewood’s rule determines the optimal discount booking limit in the  
case when discount demand books before full-fare demand. The optimal booking limit  
depends only on the forecast of full-fare demand, the aircraft capacity, and the fare ratio.  
It is not affected by the forecast of discount demand. However, the forecast of discount  
demand has a big impact on the sensitivity of expected revenue to the booking limit. When  
the forecast of discount demand is low, expected revenue is usually not very sensitive to the  
booking limit, within reasonable ranges. But when the forecast of discount demand is high,  
expected revenue becomes very sensitive to the booking limit. The lesson is that it is most  
critical to calculate precise booking limits when we forecast high levels of discount demand.  
9.1.3 Littlewood’s Rule with Independent Normal Demands  
The two-class discount booking limit algorithm will find the optimal booking limit  
given any distribution of full-fare demand. But there is a particularly simple way to calcu-  
late the optimal discount booking limit when full-fare demand is normally distributed.2 In  
this case,

,  
where Φ\(x\) is the standard cumulative normal distribution and µf and δf are the mean and  
standard deviation, respectively, of full-fare demand. Littlewood’s rule implies that we want  
to find the value of b such that

which means that the optimal booking limits and protection levels must satisfy  
b\* = \[C –  f –1  
\(1 – pd /pf \) –  f \]+

and  
y\* = min\[ f +  f –1

where –1  
\(x\) is the inverse cumulative normal distribution.  
3 \(Note that the solutions to 9.4  
and 9.5 are unlikely to be integers, so rounding will usually be required.\)  
Figure 9.4 shows –1  
\(1 – pd /pf \) as a function of the fare ratio pd /pf . From this fig-

­ discount booking limit. First, –1  
\(1 – pd /pf \) is a decreasing function of the fare ratio. This  
means that b\* is an increasing function of the fare ratio. Note that when pd = pf /2, then  
–1  
\(1/2\)  
=  
0, which implies that y\* = min\( f ,C \); that is, it is optimal to set the protection  
level to expected full-fare demand when the fare ratio is 1/2. For pd /pf \< 1/2, it is optimal  
to protect more seats for full-fare demand than we expect to receive, and for pd /pf \> 1/2,  
it is optimal to protect fewer seats than expected full-fare demand. In other words, the fare  
ratio determines whether we should save more or fewer seats than expected demand for  
full-fare passengers.  
Example 9.3  
A flight has a capacity of 100 seats and two fare classes. The full fare is \$300,  
and full-fare demand is normally distributed with a mean of 70. If the discount  
fare is \$150, the airline should protect exactly 70 seats for full-fare customers  
and set a booking limit of 30 for discount-fare demand. If the discount fare is  
\$180, the airline should protect fewer than 70 seats for full-fare demand; if the  
discount fare is \$120, the airline should protect more than 70 seats for full-fare  
demand. The optimal protection levels for each case can be determined from  
Equation 9.5.  
Equation 9.5 specifies that the optimal protection level is equal to the expected full-fare  
demand µf  
plus the standard deviation of full-fare demand δf times a term. Recall that δ f \> 0  
is a measure of the uncertainty in our forecast of full-fare demand. A higher value of δf  
means a flatter distribution and more uncertainty. What impact does it have on the optimal  
booking limit? First, notice that δf = 0 implies that b\* = \[C – µf \]+.This means that if we knew  
full-fare demand with certainty, we would protect seats for full-fare demand unless µf \> C, in  
which case we would reserve the entire capacity of the plane for full-fare passengers and set  
b\* = 0. Because we know df = µf that when δ = 0, this policy will maximize expected revenue.  
Of course, things would be too easy \(and there would be no need for sophisticated rev-  
enue management\) if companies knew future full-fare demand with certainty, so we need  
to consider the case when the standard deviation is greater than zero.4 From Equation 9.5, capacity allocation 215

normally distributed and the fares are constant. The effect of the standard deviation on the  
optimal protection level when mean full-fare demand is 50 is shown in Figure 9.5 for dif-  
ferent values of the fare ratio, pd /pf .  
The dependence of the optimal protection level on full-fare demand standard devia-  
tion and the fare ratio is summarized in Table 9.2. When the fare ratio is exactly 1/2 or the  
standard deviation of full-fare demand is zero, then the optimal protection level for full-  
fare demand is equal to mean full-fare demand. If the fare ratio is less than 1/2, the optimal  
protection level will be greater than µf , and increasing the standard deviation will increase  
the protection level. If the fare ratio is greater than 1/2, the optimal protection level will be  
less than µf and will fall as the standard deviation increases.  
9.1.4 Relation to Newsvendor Problem  
Littlewood’s rule has a close relationship to the critical fractile \(or critical ratio\) solution  
to the optimal replenishment problem for perishable goods that is studied as part of op-  
erations management. Both capacity allocation and replenishment of perishable goods are  
themselves special cases of a classic problem known as the newsvendor problem. The news-  
vendor problem well predates revenue management; it was first identified and studied as  
early as 1888. 216  
capacity allocation  
The newsvendor problem considers the situation in which a purchaser needs to order  
a quantity of some good in the face of uncertain demand. The problem got its name from  
the example of a newspaper salesperson who needs to determine how many newspapers to  
purchase at the beginning of the day to satisfy the day’s uncertain demand. The key to this  
decision is that the newsvendor faces different costs if he purchases too much or too little. If  
he buys too many newspapers, then at the end of the day he will have unsold, worthless cop-  
ies that he discards. If he buys too few, he will sell out of papers and turn away potentially  
profitable customers. The purchaser might also be a retailer deciding how many units of a  
fashion good to order, or it might be a manufacturer ordering raw materials.  
The solution to the newsvendor problem can be expressed in terms of the overage cost  
and the underage cost of the decision. The overage cost is the cost per unit of purchasing  
too many items; the underage cost is the unit cost of purchasing too few. Assume that the  
newsvendor buys newspapers for 20 cents apiece and sells them at 25 cents. His overage  
cost is 20 cents per unsold paper; his underage cost is the 5-cent profit that he forgoes for  
each missed sale. \(Note that the overage cost is an actual monetary cost, while the underage  
cost is an opportunity cost.\) If U is the underage cost and O is the overage cost, the optimal  
order quantity for the newsvendor is the value of Y such that  
F U  
\( \) Y=  
U O  
+  
, \(9.6\)  
where F\(y\) is the cumulative distribution on demand.  
Example 9.4  
When newspapers cost 20 cents and are sold for 25 cents, Equation 9.6 im-  
plies that the number of newspapers the vendor should purchase would be the  
smallest value of Y such that F\(Y \) ≥ 5/\(20 + 5\) = 0.2.  
Finding the optimal discount booking limit in the two-class case is analogous to the  
newsvendor problem. The airline needs to determine how many seats to protect \(i.e., “or-  
der”\) to satisfy unknown full-fare demand. The airline’s unit overage cost from protecting  
too many seats is a displaced discount fare\: O = pd . The underage cost is the revenue from  
a lost full-fare booking minus the discount fare\: U = pf – pd . Substituting into Equation 9.6  
means that the airline should set the protection level such that

9.2 CAPACITY ALLOCATION WITH MULTIPLE FARE CLASSES  
Littlewood’s rule finds the optimal discount allocation in the case of two classes when the  
lower fare class books first and demands are independent. However, as discussed in Section  
8.3, airlines are prolific price differentiators, often offering tens if not hundreds of different capacity allocation 217  
fares on a flight, such as special discount fares, corporate fares, and group fares in addition  
to the standard discount fares and full fare. An airline needs to manage the availability of all  
of these fares to maximize total contribution. The same holds true for any revenue manage-  
ment company selling multiple fare classes. More specifically, they need to set the nested  
booking limits within a booking control structure, as described in Section 8.5.2. This is the  
multiclass capacity allocation problem, and, predictably, it is more difficult to solve than the  
two-class model.  
To analyze the multiclass model, we make the following assumptions.  
•  
A product has n fare classes, each with an associated fare. Fare classes are numbered  
in descending fare order — that is, p1 \> p2 \> ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ \> pn. A fare class is called higher than  
another if it has a higher fare — class 1 is the highest class, and class n is the lowest  
class.  
•  
•  
•  
Demand in each class is an independent random variable. We denote the demand in  
fare class i by di . Demand in class i can be described by a probability density function  
fi\(x\) defined on integer x ≥ 0, where fi\(x\) is the probability that demand for fare class  
¯  
i will be x. Fi \(x\) denotes the probability that di ≤ x, and F  
i \(x\) denotes the probability  
that di \> x.  
Demand books in increasing fare order. That is, the lowest-fare passengers \(those  
paying pn\) book first, followed by the second-lowest-fare passengers and so on, so  
that the highest-fare passengers \(those paying p1\) book last.  
There are no no-shows or cancellations.  
•  
The objective function is to maximize expected revenue. \(As noted before, the ap-  
proaches and algorithms in this section can be modified to maximize expected total  
contribution by replacing price with net contribution.\)  
The time convention for the multiclass model is shown in Figure 9.6. During the first pe-  
riod, the airline sees only booking requests from the lowest-fare passengers, those paying pn  
.  
At the end of this first booking period, the airline has accepted some number of bookings  
from these passengers, say, x  
n  
≥ 0\. During the second period, passengers paying the next  
highest fare start to book, and so on, until the last period, in which the highest-fare pas-  
sengers — those paying p1— seek to book. Note that the indices of the fare classes decrease

The airline’s decision at the start of each booking period j is how many bookings of type  
j it should accept. It knows how many bookings it has already accepted — namely, n

remaining at the beginning of period j. The airline also knows the demand distributions  
for future booking periods. Given this information, the airline needs to find the maximum  
number of bookings from class j to accept in order to maximize expected revenue. We call  
this quantity the class j booking limit and denote it by bj. In this model, the airline only needs  
to calculate one booking limit at the start of each period, since it will receive bookings from  
only one fare class during the coming period. The airline can wait until it sees how many  
bookings it accepts in this period before setting the booking limits for the next higher class.  
9.2.1 The Decision Tree Approach  
To solve the multiclass booking limit problem, we work backward. At the beginning of the  
final period, the airline has C1 seats remaining. Since there are no no-shows or cancellations,  
it is clearly optimal for the airline to allow all remaining seats to be booked. So b1 = C1. Next  
we consider period 2 — the penultimate period before departure. At the beginning of pe-  
riod 2, the airline has C2 seats remaining. The problem the airline faces at the beginning of  
the second period is exactly the two-fare-class problem we solve in Section 9.1. Therefore,  
the airline can maximize revenue by applying Littlewood’s rule \(Equation 9.2\)\: The optimal  
booking limit is the smallest value of 0 ≤ b2 ≤ C2 such that F1\(C2 – b2\) \< 1 – p2/p1.  
Things get more complicated when we move backwards one period to calculate b3. Con-  
ceptually, the trade-off is similar to the two-class case\: If we increase the booking limit in  
period 3, one of two things can happen. Either we receive an additional type 3 passenger  
booking or we do not. If we do not, the net impact on total revenue of increasing the book-  
ing limit will be zero. If we do book an additional customer in period 3, we will receive  
a fare of p3, but we run the risk of displacing a later-booking customer who would pay a  
higher fare — either p1 or p2. There is no easy way to calculate either the probability that we  
will displace a booking or the conditional probability of which type of booking will be dis-  
placed. However, the fundamental trade-off remains the same as in the two-class case —we  
want to set the booking limit that balances the risks of spoilage and dilution.  
The period 3 problem is illustrated in Figure 9.7, where q2 is the probability that increas-  
ing the class 3 booking limit will displace a class 2 passenger and q1 is the probability that it  
will displace a class 1 passenger. From this tree we can see that the optimal class 3 booking  
limit depends on the probability that an additional class 3 booking would displace a higher-  
fare booking and the fare of the booking that would be displaced. If we knew the displace-  
ment probabilities q1 and q2, it would be straightforward to roll back the decision tree to  
solve for the optimal b3 \(Exercise 1\). Unfortunately, there is no easy way to calculate the dis-  
placement probabilities for three or more fare classes, and there is no closed-form solution  
for the optimal booking limits. As a result, the solution techniques for finding the optimal  
booking limits for three or more fare classes require the use of dynamic ­ programming. capacity allocation 219

Dynamic programming approaches to optimal multiclass capacity control are outside the  
scope of this book; the reader who is interested in learning about such approaches will find  
useful references in Section 9.8.  
While the techniques for finding the optimal booking limits and protection levels in the  
multiclass problem are not mathematically difficult, they can be computationally intensive,  
particularly when they need to be applied to thousands of flights in a limited period of  
time. For this reason, airlines, hotels, rental car companies, and their revenue manage-  
ment brethren typically do not calculate the optimal multiclass booking limits. Rather, they  
utilize a heuristic to determine good but not necessarily optimal booking limits. The most  
popular of these heuristics are the expected marginal seat revenue \(EMSR\) approaches,  
especially EMSR-a and EMSR-b. These are very fast and almost always find booking limits  
that generate expected revenue very close to the theoretical optimum.  
9.2.2 Expected Marginal Seat Revenue \(EMSR\) Heuristics  
Expected marginal seat revenue \(EMSR\) comes in two flavors\: EMSR-a and EMSR-b. Both  
EMSR-a and EMSR-b were introduced by Peter Belobaba in his PhD dissertation and a  
series of subsequent papers \(Belobaba 1987, 1989\). Both are based on approximating the  
multiclass problem by a series of two-class problems and applying Littlewood’s rule to ob-  
tain a solution.  
EMSR-a. Expected marginal seat revenue —version a \(EMSR-a\) is the best-known heuris-  
tic for the capacity allocation problem. It is based on the idea of calculating protection levels  
for the current class relative to each of the higher classes using Littlewood’s rule. These  
protection levels are then summed to create the protection level for the current class. For  
example, if we are setting a protection level for class 3, EMSR-a would calculate a protection  
level for class 3 against class 1 \(which we denote by y31\) using the form of Littlewood’s rule  
in Equation 9.3\:  
¯  
y31 = F  
1  
–1 \(p3 /p1 \)  
and a protection level for class 3 against class 2, which we denote by y32 according to 220  
capacity allocation  
¯  
y32 = F  
2  
–1 \(p3 /p2 \)  
The EMSR-a protection level for class 3 is the sum of these two protection levels; that is,  
¯  
¯  
y3  
a = min\(y31 + y32, C\) or y3  
a = min\(F  
1  
–1 \(p3 /p1 \) + F  
2  
–1 \(p3 /p2, C \), where the superscript a in y3  
a  
denotes that it is a protection level calculated by EMSR-a. The booking limit for class 3 can  
¯  
¯

It is easy to confirm that EMSR-a reduces to Littlewood’s rule in the case of two fare  
classes.  
EMSR-b. Expected marginal seat revenue —version b \(EMSR-b\) assumes that a passenger  
displaced by an additional booking would be paying a fare equal to a weighted average of  
future fares. EMSR-b creates an artificial class with mean demand equal to the sum of the  
mean demands for all the future periods and a fare equal to the average expected fare from  
future bookings. It then uses Littlewood’s rule to calculate the booking limit of the current  
class j with respect to the artificial class. EMSR-b assumes that the expected fare of the dis-  
placed booking is equal to the expected fare of future demand. This is an approximation be-  
cause limits will also be set on higher-fare booking, so the mean of the demand accepted in a  
higher booking class will generally not be equal to the mean of the unconstrained demand.  
To formalize EMSR-b, we assume as before that demands in different classes are in-  
dependent, with the demand in class i having a mean of µi and a standard deviation of δi.  
Assume we are at the beginning of period j ≥ 2 and want to calculate the booking limit  
bj. EMSR-b then proceeds as if we were solving a two-class problem. If we assume that  
demands for the different classes are normally distributed, then EMSR-b assumes that de-  
mand for the artificial class is normally distributed with mean demand µ, average fare p,  
and standard deviation δ given by

are normally distributed. Again, it is easy to confirm that EMSR-b reduces to Littlewood’s  
rule in the case of two fare classes.  
Comparison of EMSR heuristics. It is difficult to make comprehensive statements about  
the relative merits of the two EMSR heuristics. There are cases when EMSR-a gives higher  
booking limits than EMSR-b and cases when the opposite is true. More pertinently, there  
are cases when EMSR-a results in higher revenue than EMSR-b, and vice versa. Both ap-  
pear to give solutions close to the optimal booking limits in most realistic cases, and both  
generally capture a high percentage of the optimal revenue. One set of studies has shown  
that EMSR-b was consistently within 0.5% of the optimal revenue, while EMSR-a led to  
revenues that were more than 1.5% lower than optimal in some cases \(Belobaba 1992\).  
Other studies \(and much practical experience\) has shown that both EMSR heuristics tend  
to perform well in almost all realistic cases and that neither strictly dominates the other,  
although EMSR-b seems to perform slightly better than EMSR-a in practice.  
Guillermo Gallego and Huseyin Topaloglu \(2019\) report on a series of simulations to  
compare the performance of the two EMSR heuristics on an aircraft with four booking  
classes. They assumed that demands for the four classes followed independent normal dis-  
tributions. The fares, mean, and standard deviations of demand along with the correspond-  
ing optimal protection levels \(yj

\), EMSR-a protection levels \(yj

levels \(yj

of the two EMSR heuristics against the optimal protection levels was tested for capacities  
ranging from 80 seats to 160 seats using 500,000 simulation runs for each capacity. Table 9.4

capacity allocation  
shows the results. The expected revenue using the optimal booking limit is shown along  
with the percentage of the expected optimal booking limit achieved by the two heuristics.  
The heuristics performed extremely well, capturing more than 99% of the optimal revenue  
in each case. This is consistent with previous studies of the same sort.  
It is widely felt that the additional revenues from solving the optimal booking control  
problem do not generally justify the extensive additional computations that would be re-  
quired relative to using an EMSR heuristic. As a result, EMSR-b has become the standard  
for calculating booking limits for a single resource.  
9.2.3 Bid Pricing  
We have seen that optimal nested booking limits have the property that if one fare class is  
open, then all higher fare classes will be open. This means that one of three conditions must  
hold when the allocations for a resource are optimized\:  
•  
•  
All fare classes are open.  
All fare classes are closed.  
•  
There is an open fare class such that all higher classes are open and all lower classes  
are closed.  
This suggests the following rule\:  
Accept a single-seat booking request if its associated fare is greater than or equal to the fare in  
the lowest open class. Otherwise reject it.  
Example 9.5  
A flight departure has six fare classes. Two weeks before departure, fare classes  
1, 2, and 3 are open, while classes 4, 5, and 6 are closed. The class 3 fare is \$250  
and the class 4 fare is \$210. If the next booking request has a fare greater than  
or equal to \$250, it will be accepted; otherwise it will be rejected.  
This simple rule to control bookings is called bid pricing, and the minimum acceptable  
fare is called the bid price.  
5 In bid pricing, the fare of a booking request is compared to a  
hurdle rate \(the bid price\) for a product and accepted if and only if the fare exceeds the bid  
price. When the bid price is zero, any booking request with positive net contribution will  
be accepted — this is equivalent to having all fare classes open. When the bid price is set  
to any amount higher than the highest fare, no booking requests will be accepted — this is  
equivalent to having all fare classes closed. The seller can use the bid price as an intensity  
control, raising the bid price when he wishes to reduce the rate of sales and increase aver-  
age price, and lowering the bid price when he wishes to increase the sales rate at a lower  
average price.  
Bid pricing has an appealing simplicity. It requires only calculating and updating a single  
number — the bid price. It avoids the complexity involved in recalculating multiple book-  
ing limits. If bid prices are continually updated and each request is for a single unit of  
resource \(e.g., a single airline seat or a single hotel room night\) and demand for different capacity allocation 223  
fare classes were independent, a system under which booking requests are evaluated only  
against a bid price could capture at least as much revenue as the standard booking limit  
approaches.  
The bid price criteria should remind you of the rule we established in Section 7.3 that a  
request for a constrained resource should be accepted only if the associated price exceeds  
the opportunity cost of the resource. There is a reason for this — the bid price for a resource  
is the opportunity cost for that resource. The decision tree approach described in Section  
9.1.1 makes this explicit\: we should accept a booking only if its fare exceeds the expected  
revenue we could realize from that unit of capacity in the future — that is, its opportunity  
cost. Bid pricing is based on the following equivalence.  
Bid price for a resource = fare in the lowest open fare class  
= opportunity cost for the resource  
= lowest fare we should accept for a booking request  
Bid pricing is simply an example of the rule that a unit of a constrained perishable resource  
should be sold only if the price received is greater than the opportunity cost.  
Despite the appealing simplicity of bid pricing, most revenue management companies  
do not use pure bid pricing systems. Rather, they rely on the booking limits and protection  
levels described in Section 8.5.2. If bid pricing is so good, why is it not used more often?  
There are three main reasons.  
•  
•  
Bid prices give only marginal guidance — that is, a bid price can only tell us whether  
we should accept a booking request for a single seat. The bid price does not give a  
definitive answer to the question of whether or not we should accept a booking re-  
quest for more than one seat. Booking limits enable more precise control of multiseat  
booking requests\: for example, an airline would be able to accept a booking request  
for three seats in a particular class while rejecting requests for four or more seats.  
The bid price for a resource jumps upward any time a booking is accepted and  
decreases any time an existing booking is canceled. For bid prices to provide optimal  
control, they would need to be calculated at least every time a booking or cancel-  
lation takes place. This would be computationally infeasible given the volume of  
bookings and cancellations that an airline, rental car company, or large hotel chain  
needs to process. Booking limits can remain in place for a longer period of time, with  
the limits updated as bookings and cancellations occur according to the mechanisms  
described in Section 8.5.  
•  
As described in Chapter 8, booking limits were built into the airline reservation  
systems from their inception. The nested booking controls described in Section 8.5  
were the only way available to airlines and other revenue management companies to  
implement capacity allocation.  
Despite these practical concerns, bid pricing is an important concept. Since the bid price  
on a leg approximates the opportunity cost for a resource, it is a good estimate of the ad-  
ditional revenue that could be achieved by acquiring an additional unit of resource. Bid 224  
capacity allocation  
prices also play an extremely important part in network revenue management, as we see in  
Chapter 10.  
9.3 CAPACITY ALLOCATION WITH DEPENDENT DEMANDS  
The models we have considered so far assume that demand in each fare class is independent  
of demand in the other fare classes. Perhaps even more surprisingly, they assume that de-  
mand in each fare class is independent of whether other classes are opened or closed. This  
is equivalent to assuming that the fare classes perfectly segment the market \(see Chapter  
6\). Standard capacity allocation models, such as Littlewood’s rule and the EMSR heuristics,  
assume no cannibalization — opening a discount class has no effect on full-fare demand.  
Full-fare passengers are either unwilling or unable to purchase at the discount fare, and  
none of the discount passengers would purchase the product at the full fare.  
The assumption of fare class independence does not reflect the real world. In reality,  
there are no such things as full-fare customers and discount customers; there are only  
potential buyers searching for the alternative that best meets their needs. In fact, the as-  
sumption of independence fails even at the most basic level of airline segmentation. Some  
business travelers book early to take advantage of discount fares, just as some leisure travel-  
ers would be willing to pay full fare for travel but are more than happy to purchase at a  
lower discount fare. This means that some fraction of the customers who are refused when  
we close the discount fare will go on to purchase at the full fare and that the two demands  
are not really independent. Rather, the full-fare demand will depend on whether the dis-  
count fare class is opened or closed. When we close discount fares, we would expect more  
full-fare demand because some of the discount-fare customers will go ahead to purchase at  
full fare when the discount fare is not available.  
As revenue management systems became more widely used, revenue managers — the  
airline personnel who monitor fare class allocations for a set of flights — noticed that clos-  
ing a discount fare class would often lead to increased demand in higher classes. This phe-  
nomenon was termed buy-up or sell-up. By the same token, opening a discount fare class  
would often lead to decreased demand in higher classes — cannibalization. Revenue man-  
agers would close discount classes earlier than recommended by the revenue management  
system because they knew that they would gain benefits from buy-up.  
Buy-up and cannibalization are not separate phenomena. As Bill Brunger, vice president  
of revenue management for Continental Airlines, put it in conversation with me, “Passen-  
gers do not come with Y-Class or M-Class stamped on their foreheads.” Rather, customers  
search for the best combination of fare and travel option that meets their needs. The inter-  
net has increased visibility of all airline fares and their accessibility to all customers. As a  
result, the difference between full fares and discount fares has grown tremendously — for  
some flights, the average full fare can be five times or more the average discount fare. This  
provides a tremendous incentive for customers to shop for lower fares.  
The assumption of fare class independence was built into revenue management from  
the beginning. The reasons for this were twofold. First, the most pressing need facing the  
airlines was to quickly develop systems that enabled them to respond to the challenge of  
low-cost competitors and to manage the exploding number of fares in the marketplace. capacity allocation 225  
Rapidly implementing relatively simple approaches was more important than waiting to  
develop a perfect solution. The second reason was that, in many cases, the assumption of  
perfect segmentation was not too bad. The booking fences between discount and full-fare  
segments were fairly effective. Furthermore, for international airlines, regional pricing was  
a major part of revenue management strategy. In the 1980s, the fare paid in Japan for a  
ticket would often be 50% more than the same ticket purchased in Europe or the United  
States, and in the 1990s, one European airline estimated that 100% of its profit was due to  
its ability to sell tickets in certain overseas markets at fares higher than in its own market.  
Before the rise of the internet, this geographical discrimination was quite powerful and not  
subject to high levels of cannibalization. However, the internet has eroded many of the bar-  
riers among booking classes, and the need to incorporate demand dependence into revenue  
management has become more pressing.  
9.3.1 Demand Dependence with Two Fare Classes  
We can modify the marginal analysis approach of Figure 9.1 to find the optimal booking  
limit under imperfect segmentation with two fare classes. We assume as before that the dis-  
count fare is pd and the full fare is pf , with pf \> pd  
. For this analysis, we use new definitions  
of demand\:  
dd = Total discount demand,  
df = Total full-fare demand assuming all discount bookings are accepted.  
In addition, we define α as the fraction of rejected discount demand that will seek to book  
a full fare, with 0 ≤ α ≤ 1. The actual full-fare demand the airline sees will be a function of  
the discount booking limit and can be written as  
ˆ  
d  
f = df + α\[dd – b\]+  
This means that increasing the booking limit b by one seat will decrease expected full-fare  
demand by α if discount demand exceeds the booking limit and will have no effect on full-  
fare demand otherwise.  
We can relate this model to the willingness-to-pay approach introduced in Chapter 3. Spe-  
cifically, this model is equivalent to assuming that there are dd customers with a willingness to  
pay for the discount product that is greater than pd and are able to book early. Of these, α dd  
also have a willingness to pay for the full-fare product that is greater than pf \: if the discount  
product is not available, they will buy the full-fare product. Finally, there are df customers  
who have a willingness to pay for the full-fare product that is greater than pf and who are un-  
willing or unable to book early, so their willingness to pay for the discount product is lower  
than pd  
. Of course, we would expect dd  
, df  
, and α to change if we changed the fares pd and pf .  
The decision tree for the two-class model with demand dependence is shown in Figure  
9.8\. The only difference from the basic two-class allocation model in Figure 9.1 occurs  
when discount demand is greater than the booking limit and full-fare demand is less than  
the protection level, C − b. In this case, increasing the booking limit by 1 leads to an additional  
discount booking, but there is a probability of α that this increased discount booking  
cannibalizes a future full-fare booking. The net impact on expected profitability is pd − αpf

The change in expected profit will be determined by the sign of the term pd – αpf – \(1 − α\)

increased expected revenue. If it is less than zero, increasing the booking limit will lead to  
decreased expected revenue. Note that if α ≥ pd /pf , the term on the right will be less than or  
equal to zero for all values of b. This corresponds to the case where cannibalization over-  
whelms demand induction. In this case, we know immediately that the optimal booking  
limit is b\* = 0.

9.3.2 Modified EMSR Heuristics  
Both EMSR-a and EMSR-b can be modified to incorporate imperfect segmentations. The  
modifications are based on the assumption that when a class closes, rejected demand for  
that class may buy up to the next highest class —but not to any higher classes. For example,  
if we close class 3, some class 3 demand may seek to buy in class 2 but not in class 1. We  
can easily derive modified versions of the EMSR heuristics under this simple assumption.  
Define αj for j = 2, 3, . . . , n as the fraction of class j customers who would purchase in  
the next higher class, j − 1, if class j is closed. Thus, α3 is the fraction of class 3 customers  
who would “buy up” to class 2 if they find class 3 closed when they request a booking. αj is  
referred to as the buy-up factor for class j. Note that there is no buy-up factor for the highest  
fare class. Then, for the case of normal demand distributions, EMSR-a and EMSR-b can be  
extended to incorporate buy-up factors as follows\:

   
where µ, p, and δ for the modified EMSR-b algorithm are as defined in Equation 9.7.  
Modified EMSR-a calculates the protection levels for class j against every higher class  
under the assumption that buy-up will only occur to the next highest class, j − 1, if we close  
j. It then subtracts the sum of all these protection levels from the remaining capacity to  
determine the booking limit for class j. EMSR-b assumes that buy-up will occur to the ag-  
gregate class consisting of all the higher classes.  
These two modifications to the EMSR heuristics have been studied by Peter Belobaba  
and Lawrence Weatherford \(1996\), who showed that the modified EMSR heuristics pro-  
vide additional revenue when buy-up is present. The modified EMSR heuristics are easy  
to implement, and versions of them have been used in practice. However, they have some  
disadvantages. They require buy-up factors to be estimated and stored for each flight. They  
also require redefining the demand for each fare class as the demand that would be received  
if the next higher class is open. In their simplest form, they do not incorporate the possibil-  
ity of buy-up from class j to classes higher than j − 1.  
9.3.3 Capacity Control with a Consumer Choice Model  
The EMSR heuristics modified to incorporate buy-up in the previous section are some-  
what unsatisfying. For one thing, they are a heuristic grafted onto another heuristic. They 228  
capacity allocation  
are not derived from a fundamental model of consumer choice. Rather, they assume that  
passengers do have M-Class and Y-Class stamped on their heads and that only some of the  
M-Class passengers will buy up to Y-Class if M-Class is closed. “Buy up” is not really a good  
description of the underlying phenomenon — at heart, what is happening is that consumers  
are faced with the decision of purchasing a ticket from among the options that they have  
available to them.  
This section presents a more general approach to incorporating consumer choice into  
capacity control models. There are challenges in implementing this approach fully into  
revenue management systems, which we consider. However, the approach provides in-  
sights into the underlying problem and, in particular, illustrates the important concept of  
inefficient sets.  
For this approach, we drop the assumption that bookings occur in fare order. Instead,  
we assume that, at any time, more than one fare class may be open. Fare classes are dis-  
tinguished by various restrictions, with low-price fare classes being more restricted than  
higher-price fare classes. The lower-fare classes are inferior products being sold at lower  
prices. The decision facing the airline at each time period is which set of fare classes to  
open. At each time period, customers arrive and observe which fare classes the airline has  
made available. Each customer either purchases from one of the open fare classes or does  
not purchase. The question facing the airline is which set of fare classes to open at which  
time.  
As before, we assume that time periods are indexed so that time runs from the current  
period t counting down to departure at time 0. There are n fare classes indexed so that the  
prices are ordered according to p1 \> p2 \> ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ \> pn \> 0. There is a fixed capacity of C, and  
bookings are firm — there are no cancellations or no-shows. For this model, we assume  
that there is at most one booking request in each period. For simplicity, we assume that the  
probability of a booking request is the same in each period and is equal to  with 1 ≥  \> 0.  
At each time period, the airline needs to determine what set, S\(t\), of booking classes to  
offer. There are 2n possible sets that can be offered corresponding to all possible combina-  
tions of individual booking classes being opened or closed. If all booking classes are closed,  
the flight is closed for booking. Let S\(t\) indicate the set that is open at time t, and define  
pj \(S\(t\)\) as the probability that a customer arriving at time t chooses class j given that S\(t\) is  
the set of open classes, with p0 \(S\(t\)\) representing the probability of no purchase. Obviously  
pj \(S\(t\)\) \> 0 only if class j is in set S\(t\); otherwise pj \(S\(t\)\) = 0.  
These concepts are best illustrated by an example. Assume that a flight has three booking  
classes, Y, M, and K, with fares \$800, \$500, and \$450, respectively. Y fare is unrestricted,  
while M and K have various restrictions — say, a 14-night stay and a Saturday-night stay,  
respectively. There are eight possible sets that the airline could offer on this flight. Assume  
that customers for this flight fall into five segments — two business and three leisure. One of  
the business segments can accept no restrictions; the other can purchase 14 days in advance  
but not stay over Saturday. All of the leisure segments can purchase 14 days in advance, but  
Leisure Segment 1 cannot accept a Saturday-night stay. Leisure Segments 2 and 3 can both  
accept both restrictions, but Leisure Segment 3 is not willing to pay more than \$470 for the  
flight. The situation is summarized in Table 9.5 along with the probability that a booking capacity allocation 229

request belongs to each of the five segments. Note that a customer segment will purchase a  
product only if they can accept the restrictions and they are willing to pay the associated fare.  
From the information in Table 9.5, we can define the following values\:  
n  
Q P i  
S = S P S  
\( \) \( \) =1 – \( \)

and  
n  
\( \) \( \) S . = S p  
R P i i  
# ∑

Here, Q\(S\) is the probability that a customer will purchase one of the products in S given  
that the set S is on offer, and R\(S\) is the average revenue from an arriving request given that  
set S is on offer. P0\(S\) is the probability of no purchase in the period. The values of Q\(S\)  
and R\(S\) for the example are shown in Table 9.6. We assume that each booking request  
purchases in the least-expensive fare class available that meets the customer’s requirements.  
We now establish the following definition. A set T is said to be inefficient if there exist  
probabilities α\(S\) such that  
T T ≥ \< α α ∑ ∑  
\( \) \( \) \( \) and R\( \) Q S Q S S R T  
\( \) \( \),  
where the summations are over all sets. Here, each α\(S\) is a probability, which means that  
each α\(S\) ≥ 0 and that ∑α\(S\) = 1. There is an important special case in which a set T is inef-  
ficient if there exists a set U such that Q\(T\) ≥ Q\(U\) and R\(T\) ≥ R\(U\).  
This has been a long setup, but the first payoff is the observation that inefficient sets can  
never be optimal. This means that they can be dropped from consideration. Table 9.7 illus-  
trates the calculation of Q\(S\) and R\(S\) for each of the sets in the example from Tables 9.5  
and 9.6. To clarify how these are calculated, consider the set \{M, K\}. If the airline offers this  
set, then every customer except those in the Business Segment 1 will purchase. Business 2  
and Leisure 1 will purchase from M-Class for a total probability of PM\(S\) = .4 of an M-Class  
purchase. Leisure 2 and Leisure 3 will both purchase from M-Class for a total probability of  
PK\(S\) = .5. The total probability of purchase is the sum of these, so Q\(S\) = .9. The expected  
revenue is thus .4 times the M-Class fare plus .5 times the K-Class fare\: R\(S\) = 4  \$500 +  
.5  \$450 = \$425.  
In Table 9.7, only Set 1, which includes only Y-Class; Set 5, which includes Y-Class and  
K-Class; and Set 7, which includes all three classes, are efficient. The remaining four sets are 230

inefficient and should never be offered — thus, the airline should never offer only M and K  
classes together without Y class.  
The intuition about efficiency is that, if a set is inefficient relative to another set — that  
is, Q\(T\) ≥ Q\(S\) and R\(T\) \< R\(S\) for some sets T and S— then S provides more expected  
revenue than T and has a lower expected opportunity cost because it has a lower probability  
of consuming a seat. If T is inefficient against a combination of sets, then the same holds  
true against the policy of choosing one of the sets in the combination with probability α\(S\).  
The second payoff is that, for two efficient sets, S1 and S2, Q\(S1\) ≥ Q\(S2\), implies that  
R\(S1\) ≥ R\(S2\) and vice versa. This means that the efficient sets can be ordered in terms of  
expected sale probability and expected revenue. This ordering is shown in Figure 9.9 for  
the extended example. The points corresponding to the three efficient sets are labeled. The  
lines connecting them represent an efficient frontier — combinations of expected sales and  
expected revenue that could be achieved by randomizing among the three efficient sets.  
The points for the inefficient sets fall below the efficient frontier — they are dominated by  
weighted combinations of the efficient sets.  
Figure 9.9 also provides a key as to how choice-based capacity control could be embed-  
ded in a dynamic booking control system. When a flight is not expected to book up, it is  
optimal to choose a set that provides a high probability of selling a seat — in Figure 9.9, that  
is the set \{Y, M, K\}. As capacity is expected to become scarcer, we would move down the capacity allocation 231

efficient frontier. Thus, the next action would be to close M-Class and offer only \{Y, K\}. If  
capacity becomes highly scarce, then we would close all of the booking classes except Y-  
Class. As in traditional capacity control, we are managing availability by opening and clos-  
ing booking classes; the difference is that we are not closing in order of fare class.  
Note that under this approach, the probability that a booking inquiry would purchase  
from booking class j if set S is offered —Pj\(S\)—will change over time as departure ap-  
proaches. For an obvious example, the probability that 10 days before departure a customer  
will book in a fare class that has a 14-day booking restriction is 0. However, as we have  
seen, the mix of business and leisure passengers also changes as departure approaches. This  
means that the airline needs to forecast and estimate values of Q\(S\) and R\(S\) that depend  
on time to departure.  
9.4 A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO CAPACITY CONTROL  
The methods for setting booking classes described in Section 9.3 assume that we have an  
estimate of the distribution of demand for each booking class. Assuming that demands  
for booking classes follow a normal distribution, these methods require an estimate of the  
mean and the standard deviation of demand for each booking class. They also assume that  
demands are independent — early demand for discount bookings does not give us any in-  
formation about later full-fare demand. In all cases, we need to choose distributions of  
demand with parameters derived by applying statistical estimation to historic observations.  
This section discusses a data-driven approach that does not make assumptions about the  
distributions or independence of demand and allows us to go directly from the data to  
booking limits without estimating the parameters of an underlying distribution.  
Let us assume that we have historic observations of demand by booking class for each  
of T preceding departures of a flight \(same flight number, same time, same day of week\). 232  
capacity allocation  
As usual, we assume n booking classes with fares p1 \> p2 \> ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ \> pn , and we assume no  
cancellations or no-shows. We seek to calculate the booking limits for future flight T + 1,  
which we denote as b1, b2, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , b  
n . Since there are no no-shows or cancellations, we know  
that b1 = C.  
The classical approach to calculating \(and the approach used by most airlines, hotels,  
etc.\) is to make a probabilistic forecast of demand based on historical demand and apply an  
algorithm similar to those described in Sections 9.1 through 9.3. However, the data-driven  
approach tackles the problem by asking\: What set of booking limits would have maximized  
revenue if we had applied them to flights 1, 2, . . . , T? Those would then be the booking limits  
that we would apply to flight T + 1. The logic is that if booking-class demands for flight  
T + 1 are being drawn from the same distributions as those for flights 1 through T, then the  
set of booking limits that maximizes total revenue across those flights would be good ones  
to apply to flight T + 1.  
To formalize our statement, let di  
t be the total demand for booking class i on flight t for  
1 ≤ t ≤ T with booking limits b1, b2, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , b  
n . Then, the bookings that would be realized in  
class i on flight t would be

In words, the number of bookings accepted in each booking class on each flight is the mini-  
mum of the demand for that booking class and the difference between the sum of the book-  
ing limits for all lower classes and the bookings accepted in those classes. Let us denote xi  
t =  
φ\(di  
t  
, b\), where b = \(b1, b2, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , b  
n\) is the vector of booking limits. The optimal data-driven  
booking limits can be found by solving the optimization problem

subject to b1 = C, b ≥ 0.  
In the case of two booking classes, the optimization problem in Equation 9.11 is linear  
and can be solved using standard linear programming approaches. In the case of multiple  
booking classes, the problem is not linear, but it is generally not difficult to solve given the  
simple constraint structure.  
Example 9.6  
A flight has a capacity of 100 seats and three booking classes\: B-Class with a fare  
of \$160, M-Class with a fare of \$240, and Y-Class with a fare of \$700. As usual, B-  
Class books before M-Class, which books before Y-Class. The flight has been in  
operation for the last 10 weeks, and the demands for each of the three fare classes  
for the last 10 Monday flights are shown in Table 9.8. To find the optimal book-  
ing limits for this flight, the airline solves the optimization problem in Equation  
9.11 using the demands shown in Table 9.8. The results are booking limits of 39  
for B, 69 for M, and 100 for Y. With these limits, the average loads per flight and  
revenue per flight are 39 and \$6,240 for B-Class, 28.4 and \$6,816 for M-Class, capacity allocation 233

and 25.6 and \$17,920 for Y-Class, with an average revenue of \$30,976 per flight.  
This could be considered a forecast of the performance of the next flight.  
In some ways, the data-driven approach to capacity allocation is quite appealing. It  
does not require arbitrary assumptions about the distribution of demand for a particular  
booking class –flight combination or about the independence \(or lack of it\) in demands for  
flight –booking class combinations. It collapses the two steps of “forecast” and “optimize”  
required by classical approaches into a single “optimize” step. Although it requires observa-  
tions of total demand by booking class and flight that are often not available, this is not a  
disadvantage relative to the forecast-and-optimize approach, because forecasting demand  
also typically requires estimates of historical demand \(not just loads\).  
Despite these apparent advantages, a pure data-driven approach has not \(to my knowl-  
edge\) been implemented at any revenue management company in 2019. There are several  
likely reasons for this. The first is that most revenue management companies have imple-  
mented some flavor of the classical “forecast, then optimize” systems, which are generally  
working well enough that there is no financial incentive to rip them out to implement an  
entirely new approach. Second, forecast-then-optimize approaches have the advantage that  
they allow revenue managers to update forecasts to account for anticipated changes in de-  
mand. For example, a hotel owner who knows that the Super Bowl will be held in his city  
next year would have his revenue manager increase the demand forecasts for those dates  
well before the date of the game. The revenue management system would then reoptimize  
capacity controls given the new forecasts. It is difficult \(but not impossible\) to incorporate  
such user knowledge as overrides in a data-driven system. It is also not clear how to in-  
corporate consumer choice into data-driven models. Addressing these issues is a topic of  
current research.  
9.5 CAPACITY ALLOCATION IN ACTION  
We have discussed several techniques for calculating booking limits. These techniques need  
to be used within the context of a booking control structure, as described in Section 8.5. In 234  
capacity allocation  
practice, booking limits are periodically calculated offline for a flight and transmitted to the  
reservation system, where they are used to control bookings. The combination of periodic  
recalculation of booking limits and the nested booking limits within the reservation system  
defines a dynamic booking control process.  
Dynamic Booking Control Process  
1\. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Calculate the initial booking limits for a flight.  
When a booking request for class j is received, compare the number of seats re-  
quested with the current booking limit for the class.  
If the number of seats requested exceeds the booking limit for class j, reject the  
request and go to step 6.  
If the number of seats requested is within the booking limit for class j, accept the  
request. Depending on the capabilities of the reservation system, update booking  
limits using either standard nesting or theft nesting.  
When a booking cancels, either \(a\) increment the booking limits for classes with  
positive availability by the number of seats canceled \(irreversible\) or \(b\) increment  
to booking limits for all classes by the number of seats canceled \(reversible\).  
Periodically recalculate all booking limits based on total bookings and demand  
expected in each class until departure. \(This recalculation is often called a reoptimi-  
zation.\)  
This dynamic booking control process makes no assumption about the nature of the  
reoptimization approach being used or the frequency with which reoptimizations occur. In  
fact, there is considerable variation among companies in the optimization approaches used  
and the frequency and situations under which they are applied. There is a general belief that  
frequent reoptimization is important — particularly when demand is changing rapidly or  
departure is approaching and bookings and cancellations are being received at a high rate.  
Often, the trade-off is between using a more complex algorithm and reoptimizing less often  
versus using a simpler algorithm and reoptimizing more often. These issues are the topics  
of ongoing research and are by no means settled.  
9.6 MEASURING CAPACITY ALLOCATION EFFECTIVENESS  
As noted in Chapter 8, revenue per available seat mile \(RASM\) is the metric most widely  
used to measure the overall effectiveness of revenue management at an airline. RASM is a  
good high-level measure, but it does not tell the entire story. It is often not immediately  
clear why RASM is high or low in a particular market. Are we achieving a high RASM in  
a particular market relative to the competition because we have superior service? Superior  
marketing? Better revenue management? All of these? Or have we simply assigned too few  
seats to the market? RASM by itself does not address the important need to isolate and  
measure the effects of revenue management separately from other influences in a market. capacity allocation 235  
The need to understand the effects of revenue management is important because revenue  
management software systems are expensive, usually requiring millions of dollars of in-  
vestment in software and hardware. Revenue management programs are also expensive  
to operate — a major airline may have a department of 50 or more people dedicated to  
running the revenue management system and reviewing and updating its forecasts and  
recommendations. How can management be convinced that this expensive and somewhat  
esoteric department is yielding results that justify this investment? A metric specifically  
targeted at measuring revenue management effectiveness is required.  
One popular approach to measuring revenue management effectiveness is the revenue  
opportunity model originally developed by American Airlines \(Smith, Leimkuhler, and Dar-  
row 1992\). The revenue opportunity model assumes we have a record of all the booking  
requests we received for a flight — those we accepted and those we rejected. We then meas-  
ure the revenue that could be achieved from a specific flight under two extreme cases. In the  
base case, bookings are accepted in the order in which they are received until the capacity  
constraint is reached or demand is exhausted, whichever comes first. The revenue achieved  
in the base case is the flight’s performance without any revenue management —we can  
call it the “No RM Revenue.” In the perfect revenue management case, bookings are ac-  
cepted in decreasing order of revenue until demand is exhausted or the capacity constraint  
is reached. In this case, no booking is accepted that would displace a higher-fare future  
booking. This represents a case in which we achieved as much revenue as possible given the  
demands for different fare classes. We call the revenue calculated this way the “Perfect RM  
Revenue.” Of course, this level of performance is not achievable because it would require  
perfect foresight on future demand.  
It should be clear that the revenue achieved under perfect revenue management will  
always be greater than or equal to the revenue achieved under no revenue management. If  
the flight is full, the revenue achieved under any actual revenue management program will  
generally lie between these extremes —better than no revenue management but never bet-  
ter than perfect revenue management.6 The total revenue opportunity on a flight is the dif-  
ference between the revenue achieved from perfect revenue management and the revenue  
achieved from no revenue management. Then the revenue opportunity metric \(ROM\) is the  
revenue actually achieved from that flight minus the revenue that would have been achieved  
under no revenue management expressed as a percentage of the total revenue opportunity.  
Example 9.7  
Senilria assigned a 100-seat aircraft to a particular route with four booking  
classes. The fares for the four booking classes were F = \$1,000, Y = \$800, M  
= \$600, and B = \$200. Using its sophisticated revenue management system,  
Senilria set booking limits of \(32, 45, 70, 100\) for the flight. Actual demand for  
this flight by booking class came in at F = 25, Y = 30, M = 20, and B = 50. To  
determine the ROM for the flight, calculate as follows\:  
Perfect RM revenue = 25  \$1,000 + 30  \$800 + 20  \$600 + 25  \$200  
= \$66,000 236  
capacity allocation  
No RM revenue = 30  \$800 + 20  \$600 + 50  \$200 = \$46,000  
Realized revenue  = 25  \$1,000 + 25  \$800 + 13  \$600 + 32  \$200  
=  
\$59,200  
Thus, Senilria realized a ROM of \(\$59,200 − on this flight departure.  
\$46,000\) /\(\$66,000 − \$46,000\) = 66%  
Example 9.7 illustrates the calculation of ROM using a single flight departure. In practice,  
ROM is only meaningful when applied to a large number of flights. And even then, changes  
in ROM are probably more meaningful than the absolute measure itself. For ­ example, for  
the case of the 90-seat flight with results shown in Table 9.4, the expected ­ revenue that was  
achieved using an optimal capacity allocation algorithm was \$74,003. For the 500,000 rep-  
lications of this flight, the first-come, first-served revenue was \$61,215 and the maximum  
possible revenue was \$79,458. This means that the ROM achieved from using an optimal  
algorithm was \(\$74,003 − \$61,215\) /\(\$79,458 − \$61,215\) = 70.1%. Since this result was  
achieved using an optimal algorithm with the same means and standard deviations that  
were used to generate the actual loads, it represents an upper bound to the average revenue  
that could be achieved in practice.  
ROM has been used by airlines, hotels, and other RM companies to measure the effec-  
tiveness of their revenue management programs. American Airlines claimed that its sys-  
temwide ROM increased from 30% in 1988 to 49% in 1990 as the result of better revenue  
management systems and processes \(Smith, Leimkuhler, and Darrow 1992\). ROM has also  
proven useful in evaluating the performance of different forecasting and optimization al-  
gorithms as well as in measuring the performance of revenue managers. However, it can  
be sensitive to changes in market conditions. For example, the ROM for a flight with very  
low demand will always be close to 100%, since every booking will be accepted. On the  
other hand, a flight with high uncertainty in high-fare demand \(a high standard deviation\)  
will tend to have a lower ROM than one with the same expected high-fare demand but less  
uncertainty \(a lower standard deviation\). This means that changes in ROM for a flight or  
group of flights may be due to changes in the underlying structure of demand rather than  
changes in revenue management effectiveness.  
9.7 SUMMARY  
•  
•  
The capacity allocation problem is how to regulate booking requests for a product  
consisting of a single resource over time in order to maximize revenue or contribu-  
tion. For most revenue management companies, this is solved by periodically setting  
and updating booking limits for a nested booking control structure. The problem is  
typically posed assuming that bookings occur in order of increasing fare.  
At the heart of the two-class problem is the trade-off between accepting too many  
discount bookings, which cannibalizes future full-fare demand, and accepting too  
few discount bookings, which means that the plane departs with empty seats. Lit-  
tlewood’s rule finds the booking limit that balances these two risks to maximize total  
expected contribution. capacity allocation 237

The underlying trade-off when there are more than two fare classes is the same as in  
the two-class problem\: accepting too many early discount bookings may cannibalize  
future full-fare bookings, whereas accepting too few may lead to empty seats. How-  
ever, when there are more than two fare classes, there is no easy closed-form solution  
for finding the optimal booking limits. Rather, airlines and other revenue manage-  
ment companies typically rely on various heuristic approaches, of which EMSR-a  
and EMSR-b are the best known.  
The basic EMSR approaches to multiple-fare class booking control do not incorporate  
the fact that opening or closing a fare class will change the anticipated demand in other  
fare classes for the same product. EMSR heuristics are often modified to incorporate  
the phenomenon of dependent demand, also known as buy-up and sell-down.  
Incorporating a fully flexible model of consumer choice is complex because the  
combinations of booking classes that could be offered is 2n, where n is the number of  
classes. However, the number of efficient sets, which are the only ones that need to  
be considered, may be much smaller than the number of possible sets. Furthermore,  
the efficient sets can be nested in order of increasing revenue and potential demand  
in a way that facilitates nesting.  
An alternative to explicit optimization or heuristics is a data-driven approach in  
which the booking limits that would have maximized expected revenues for past  
flights is calculated and applied to future flights.  
Typically, the decision of whether to accept a particular booking request is based on  
whether there is sufficient availability for that class in the booking system. The func-  
tion of the revenue management system is to periodically update the booking limits  
in the system based on current bookings and changes in the market.  
A common way for airlines and other revenue management companies to measure  
the effectiveness of their capacity allocation is by using the revenue opportunity  
metric, or ROM. ROM measures the revenue actually achieved as a percentage of the  
maximum revenue that could have been achieved if the supplier had perfect forecasts  
of future demand. ROM is not an absolute measure, because underlying uncertainty  
in demand ensures that 100% ROM can never be achieved. But it is a good relative  
measure of how well different flights are being managed.  
Capacity allocation is the first of the three constituents of revenue management that we  
study. Network management, which is treated in Chapter 10, extends the ideas from this  
chapter to the case in which a company is selling products that consist of more than one  
resource. Overbooking, treated in Chapter 11, extends the idea of capacity allocation still  
further, to the situation in which bookings can cancel or not show.

As noted in Section 9.2, there is no closed-form solution to the multiclass booking prob-  
lem. Curry 1990, Wollmer 1992, and Brumelle and McGill 1993 describe three different  
solution approaches utilizing dynamic programming. A comparison among these three 238  
capacity allocation  
approaches is given in Li and Oum 2002. The equivalence between Littlewood’s rule and the  
critical fractile approach is described in Netessine and Shumsky 2002.  
The seminal paper on incorporating choice in optimal capacity allocation is Talluri  
and van Ryzin 2004a. The example in Section 9.3.3 was adapted from Talluri and van  
Ryzin 2014. A good survey of research on incorporating choice into capacity allocation  
is Strauss, Klein, and Steinhardt 2017, which provides many additional references to re-

Granite State Airlines serves the route between New York and Portsmouth, New  
Hampshire, with a single-flight-daily 100-seat aircraft. The one-way fare for dis-  
count tickets is \$100, and the one-way fare for full-fare tickets is \$150. Discount  
tickets can be booked up until one week in advance, and all discount passengers  
book before all full-fare passengers. Over a long history of observation, the airline  
estimates that full-fare demand is normally distributed, with a mean of 56 pas-  
sengers and a standard deviation of 23, while discount-fare demand is normally  
distributed, with a mean of 88 passengers and a standard deviation of 44.  
a. A consultant tells the airline it can maximize expected revenue by optimizing  
the booking limit. What is the optimal booking limit?  
b. The airline has been setting a booking limit of 44 on discount demand, to pre-  
serve 56 seats for full-fare demand. What is its expected revenue per flight under  
this policy? \(Hint\: Use a spreadsheet.\)  
c. What is the expected gain from the optimal booking limit over the original  
booking limit?

Full-fare demand is unchanged. What is the new optimal booking limit?  
Granite State Airlines also serves the route between Washington, D.C. \(Reagan\),  
and Portsmouth, New Hampshire, with a single flight daily. The airline sells both  
discount-fare and full-fare tickets. The airline has assigned a 100-seat aircraft to the  
flight. Using Littlewood’s rule, the airline has determined that the optimal discount-  
fare booking limit for a flight departing in two weeks is 40.

Senilria Airlines has started a new flight from Rome to Palermo, Sicily, once a week  
on Monday mornings and has operated the flight for the last 12 weeks. Senilria  
offers three booking classes on the flight\: B-Class with a fare of €70, M-Class with  
a fare of €120, and Y-Class with a fare of €200. The demand for each fare class for  
each of the previous 12 flight departures is shown in Table 9.9.  
a. Assume that Senilria has assigned a 200-seat aircraft to this flight for the initial  
12 flights and for the next flight. Using the data-driven approach, what would  
be the recommended booking limits for each of the three classes for the 13th  
departure? What is the expected revenue?  
b. Assume that Senilria is considering assigning a 225-seat aircraft to the Rome-to-  
Palermo flight for the next departure. Given a capacity of 225 seats, what are the  
recommended booking limits for each of the three classes for the 13th depar-  
ture? What is the expected revenue? What is the additional revenue from the 25  
seats of extra capacity?notes

5\. The term “bid price” is unfortunate because it is easily confused with the idea of  
bidding in an auction. This is not the situation in revenue management usage — the bid  
price is the minimum price that a seller would accept for another unit of a resource \(such  
as a seat on a flight\). The closest concept in auction theory is the reserve price, which is the  
minimum amount a seller would accept for an item. However, the terminology is stand-  
ard, so we use it.  
6\. It is possible for achieved revenue to be lower than the no-revenue-management  
case if too many early-booking requests were rejected in anticipation of future bookings  
that did not materialize. 10 Network Management  
When every product offered by a supplier uses only a single resource, the supplier can max-  
imize total profitability by maximizing the profitability of each resource independently.  
For example, a Broadway show can maximize total revenue over a season by setting prices  
and availabilities that maximize revenue independently for each performance.1 However,  
a seller that sells products that use multiple resources — such as an airline selling tickets  
on connecting flights or a hotel selling multiple-night stays — faces a much more com-  
plex problem. The seller can no longer maximize total contribution by maximizing con-  
tribution from each resource independently. Rather, he needs to consider the interactions  
among the various products he sells and their effect on his ability to sell other products.  
This is the challenge of network management— the topic of this chapter.  
Chapter 9 describes the techniques used to maximize expected profitability for a single  
resource. This is all that is needed by airlines such as EasyJet that only allow single-leg  
bookings.2 These airlines — like the Broadway show — can maximize total profitability by  
maximizing the profitability of each resource independently. However, this approach will  
not maximize system profitability for airlines that offer passengers the opportunity to buy  
tickets for two or more connecting flight legs. Hotels and rental car companies also sell  
multiple-resource products, since hotel guests can stay for more than one night and rental  
car customers can rent for more than a day. Network management is applicable to any com-  
pany controlling a set of constrained and perishable resources and selling products that  
consist of combinations of those resources.  
Section 10.1 introduces the network management problem and the types of industries  
in which it applies. The section also demonstrates why the problem is complex and why a  
simple and intuitive greedy heuristic does not work. The subsequent sections present vari-  
ous solution approaches to the network management problem. One intuitive approach is  
linear programming. However, linear programming is a computationally intensive proce-  
dure that can only be run on a periodic basis. In the interim, most airlines use some version  
of virtual nesting to manage booking requests. We examine virtual nesting and the concept  
of net leg fare \(sometimes called net local fare\), which is a consistent way to rank \(and hence  
nest\) network booking requests. Section 10.4 shows how bid pricing can be used in network 242  
network management  
management, and Section 10.5 discusses some of the issues involved in implementing net-  
work management.  
10.1 WHEN IS NETWORK MANAGEMENT APPLICABLE?  
Network management is important in any revenue management industry that sells prod-  
ucts consisting of more than one resource. As shown in Table 8.7, there are some revenue  
management industries, such as cruise lines and event ticketing, in which network manage-  
ment does not play a major role.3 By contrast, in the industries shown in Table 10.1, man-  
aging products that consist of combinations of resources is a critically important aspect of  
revenue management.  
Network management is very important to business hotels, rental car companies, and  
multiunit housing — and indeed to any company that rents out capacity for periods of  
varying duration. Network management is also important to airlines that offer connecting  
service. This can be seen from Figure 10.1, which shows the distribution of passengers by

Fare \(\$\)  
Y M B  
Figure 10.1 Distribution of total fares by fare class on an example flight. network management 243  
fare class and total fare paid on a flight from San Francisco to Chicago. There are three fare  
classes on this flight\: full fare \(Y\), discount \(M\), and deep discount \(B\). In general, Y-Class  
passengers tend to pay more than M-Class passengers, who tend to pay more than B-Class  
passengers. However, fare class is not a perfect proxy for revenue. Some B-Class passengers  
pay more than \$400 and some Y-Class passengers pay less than \$250. Managing this flight  
based on fare class alone will not maximize revenue. If this airline closes B-Class, it will still  
be accepting Y-Class \(and M-Class\) passengers who are paying less than \$250 while reject-  
ing B-Class passengers willing to pay more than \$400 for a seat. Furthermore, managing by  
fare class does not allow the airline to take advantage of the spread of fares within each class.  
If capacity on this flight were constrained, the airline might want to accept only passengers  
paying more than, say, \$200.  
Consider an airline that has San Francisco and Chicago as hubs. This means that the  
San Francisco – to-Chicago flight carries passengers traveling from many origins to many  
destinations. Only a small fraction of the passengers are actually flying from San Francisco  
to Chicago; the majority are connecting in either San Francisco or Chicago \(or both\). For  
example, the highest fares on the flight \(those with total fare over \$3,000\) might be fly-  
ing from Tokyo to Chicago via San Francisco or from San Francisco to Paris via Chicago.  
Other passengers might be flying from San Francisco to Chicago to Grand Rapids or from  
Fresno to San Francisco to Chicago, and so on. Each origin-destination combination can be  
purchased in different fare classes, adding even more complexity. The fare for an M-Class  
Tokyo-to-Chicago passenger is likely to be higher than a Y-Class San Francisco – to-Chicago  
passenger. Yet leg-based capacity allocation would not allow the airline to accept the M-  
Class Tokyo-to-Chicago passenger while rejecting the Y-Class San Francisco – to-Chicago  
passenger. The goal of network management is to improve revenue by managing the mix of  
products as well as the mix of fare classes being sold for each product.  
Airlines have estimated that network management adds 0.5% to 1% of additional rev-  
enue on top of the revenue gains from optimal capacity allocation and overbooking. This  
may not sound like much, but for a carrier such as British Airways with revenue of about 13  
billion British pounds \(\$16 billion\) in 2018, it represents \$80 million to \$160 million in ad-  
ditional operating profit. Network management is even more critical for hotels and rental  
car companies. In these industries, managing the mix of bookings by length of stay \(or  
length of rental\) provides more leverage than managing by fare class alone. For a hotel, it is  
usually more important not to accept short-stay bookings that displace future longer-stay  
booking requests than it is to worry about the rate mix of any individual booking length.  
For this reason, unlike the airlines, the first successful hotel \(and rental car\) revenue man-  
agement systems included network management capabilities.  
10.1.1 Types of Network  
In the 1960s, major airlines in the United States began to establish hub-and-spoke networks  
as a way to better leverage their operations. Figure 10.2 shows a hub-and-spoke network  
with 2 hubs and 13 spoke cities. Each spoke city is connected to one or more of the hubs.  
Arrivals and departures at the hubs are timed so that passengers arriving from cities to  
the west of the hub can connect to cities to the east, and vice versa. The hub-and-spoke 244  
network management  
B  
A  
Figure 10.2 are spoke cities.  
Example of a hub-and-spoke network. Nodes A and B are hubs; the other nodes  
­ network allows an airline to offer a large number of products with a relatively small number  
of flights. With 20 eastbound flights into a hub connecting with 20 westbound flights, an  
airline can offer 440 products \(all possible connections plus the direct flights in and out of  
the hub\) with only 40 total flights. While hub-and-spoke airlines offer some direct flights  
between spoke cities, the vast majority of their traffic touches at least one hub — as either an  
origin, a destination, or a connecting point. Airlines operating hub-and-spoke networks in-  
clude the majority of global carriers including American, Delta, United, Air France, British  
Airways, and Singapore Airlines, among many others. During the 1980s, most large airlines  
organized their operations around the hub-and-spoke model and saw their connecting traf-  
fic soar. In the United States, about 35% of passengers travel on connecting flights \(Berry  
and Jia 2010\). While rushing to make a connection may not be popular with passengers, the  
efficiency of hub-and-spoke networks means that they are here to stay.  
The resources for a hotel are room nights, and its products are combinations of arrival  
date and length of stay. A hotel essentially runs a linear network in which each room night  
connects to the preceding night and to the following night. Such a network is shown in  
Figure 10.3. Passenger railway networks are also linear; for example, Amtrak’s California  
Zephyr starts at Emeryville, California, and terminates in Chicago, making 33 intermediate  
stops along the way. A passenger boarding the Zephyr at Emeryville can get off at any one  
of 34 stops \(the 33 intermediate stops plus Chicago\); a passenger boarding at the second  
stop \(Martinez, California\) can get off at any one of 33 stops; and so on. Each of the 34 legs  
is a resource, and each combination of origin and destination is a product. The typical pas-  
senger railroad has a linear network similar to the hotels and rental car companies, but with  
the length of the network equal to the number of legs being offered. network management 245

Figure 10.3 Wednesday 3-night stay  
A linear network, typical of hotels, passenger rail, and rental car companies.  
Each product in a network has one or more associated fare classes. The network manage-  
ment problem is to determine which booking requests to accept for every possible combi-  
nation of product and fare class at every time. We use the term origin-destination fare class  
\(or ODF\) for a product – fare class combination.4 While ODF is an airline term, we use it to  
refer to a combination of product and fare class in any industry. Thus, for a hotel, a four-  
night rack-rate 5 booking arriving June 13 is a different ODF than a three-night discount  
booking arriving on June 14. The goal of network management is to manage and update the  
availability of all ODFs over time to maximize expected contribution.  
The number of products being offered by a hotel or rental car company can be very  
large — much larger, in fact, than the number of rooms in the hotel. A hotel accepting  
reservations for customers arriving for the next 365 days with stays from 1 up to 15 days  
in length is offering 15 × 365 = 5,475 different products. In fact, the number of products  
can be even larger, since each room type corresponds to a different product dimension. A  
particular hotel might have four different types of room \(for example, standard, deluxe,  
deluxe view, and suite\), for which it can charge different rates. Since a customer can book  
any one of these room types for any arrival date and length of stay, the number of products  
being offered by the hotel is actually 4 × 15 × 365 = 21,900. In other words, a hotel may  
well be offering 100 times more products than it has rooms! On the other hand, cruise lines  
typically offer only one or two options for embarkation and disembarkation per sailing. The  
different products on a particular sailing are determined by the different cabin types, for  
example, upper-deck outside versus lower-deck inside.  
10.1.2 A Greedy Heuristic for Network Management — and Why It Fails  
Consider a 100-room hotel facing the unconstrained demand pattern for some future week  
shown in Figure 10.4. \(Unconstrained demand is the total number of room nights the hotel  
could sell if it accepted every booking request.\) The pattern shown in Figure 10.4 is typical  
of a midtown business hotel— demand is low on the weekend and peaks during the middle  
of the week. In this example, unconstrained demand exceeds capacity on Wednesday. This  
means that the hotel will need to reject some bookings or it will be oversold on Wednesday  
\(ignoring no-shows and cancellations\). The network management problem faced by the 246  
network management  
Capacity  
Unconstrained occupancy

Day of week  
Thursday Friday Saturday  
Typical unconstrained occupancy pattern for a midtown business hotel.  
hotel is to decide which bookings to accept and which to reject considering both room rate  
and length of stay in order to maximize expected contribution margin.  
Let us say that the hotel offers two rates\: a rack rate of \$200 per night and a discount rate  
of \$150 per night. The hotel manager might look at the demand pattern in Figure 10.4 and  
conclude \(correctly\) that the hotel’s constrained resource is Wednesday night capacity. The  
manager might reason that the best way to maximize operating profit is to limit the number  
of discount-rate customers booking any product that includes Wednesday night to protect  
availability for rack-rate customers. In other words, the hotel might manage bookings based  
strictly on fare class. This approach might improve revenue relative to a first-come, first-  
served policy, but it has an obvious drawback. Rack-rate customers arriving Wednesday for  
a one-night stay pay \$200. But discount-rate customers arriving Tuesday for a three-night  
stay pay \$450. If the hotel limits discount bookings to save room for full-fare bookings, it  
runs the risk of turning down a \$450 customer to save room for a \$200 customer — a prime  
revenue management sin. Clearly a more sophisticated approach is required if the hotel is  
to maximize expected revenue.  
When there is only a single constrained resource, the manager could arrange all of the  
ODFs that use the constrained resource by total rate paid and solve the multiclass problem  
using EMSR or a similar heuristic.6 This would mean that the lowest class on Wednesday  
would be one-night discount customers paying \$150, the next highest class would be one-  
night rack customers paying \$200, followed by two-night discount stays for either Tuesday –  
Wednesday or Wednesday –Thursday paying \$300, followed by two-night rack customers  
paying \$400, and so on. By establishing classes in this fashion and setting the appropriate  
booking limits, the hotel would maximize expected operating contribution as long as un-  
constrained demand exceeded capacity only on Wednesday night. network management 247  
Sorting all the ODFs on each leg in fare order and setting availabilities based on total fare  
is called the greedy heuristic for network revenue management. The greedy heuristic is opti-  
mal if there is only a single constrained resource \(that is, only a single bottleneck\). It works  
perfectly in the hotel example if unconstrained demand for hotel rooms exceeds capacity  
only on Wednesday night. However, the greedy heuristic breaks down quickly when more  
than one resource is constrained. This would be the case for the hotel if unconstrained de-  
mand exceeded 100 rooms on both Wednesday and Thursday nights. In this case, it is no  
longer optimal for the hotel to order fare classes strictly by total revenue. The hotel should  
accept a two-night Wednesday –Thursday discount booking paying \$300 if it believes that  
Thursday is not going to sell out. But if it believes that Thursday is going to sell out, it may  
be better off rejecting the \$300 two-night booking in favor of waiting for two \$200 one-  
night rack-rate bookings for Wednesday night and Thursday night.  
The implication is that when multiple resources are constrained, the right ordering of  
ODFs on a leg can depend on the fares and demands for all the other ODFs as well as the  
capacities of all the other resources in the network. In fact, as we accept bookings over time  
and update our forecasts of future demand, the ordering of ODFs on each leg may change  
as well\: there is no stable optimal ordering of ODFs when multiple resources in a network  
can be constrained.  
The failure of the greedy heuristic can be illustrated with the simple network shown  
in Figure 10.5, where an airline offers two flights —Flight 1 from San Francisco \(SFO\)  
to Denver \(DEN\) and Flight 2 from Denver \(DEN\) to St. Louis \(STL\)— that have been  
scheduled so that passengers can connect from Flight 1 to Flight 2 at Denver. For sim-  
plicity, let us assume that the airline offers a single fare for each product and that the  
San Francisco – to-Denver fare is \$200, the Denver-to – St. Louis fare is \$160, and the San  
Francisco – to – St. louis fare is \$300. The airline has exactly one seat left on each of the two  
flights and has a customer who is willing to pay \$300 for a ticket from San Francisco to  
St. Louis. Should the airline let her book? Or should the airline reject the booking in the  
hopes of booking local passengers on both legs? Let p1 be the probability that the airline  
will receive at least one future booking request for Flight 1 and p2 be the probability that  
the airline will receive at least one future request for Flight 2. Then the expected value of  
refusing the connecting customer and letting only the local customers book is \$200p1 +  
\$160p2. If this amount is greater than \$300, then the airline is better off refusing the con-  
necting customer and relying on local traffic to fill the last seats. If, on the other hand,  
\$200p1 + \$160p2 \< \$300, then the airline should go ahead and allow the connecting pas-  
senger to book.

network management  
The probabilities p1 and p2 are the airline’s forecasts of future local demand on the two  
flights. Whether or not the airline should accept the through passenger depends on these  
forecasts. This can be generalized to a full network\: There is no unambiguous answer to the  
question of whether an airline should prefer connecting traffic to local traffic on a given leg.  
The right answer depends on the forecasts of future demand for all ODFs. Ultimately, when  
many resources are constrained, we need to optimize over the entire network to determine  
which bookings we prefer on any leg in the network.  
10.2 A LINEAR PROGRAMMING APPROACH  
Linear programming \(LP\) is a natural approach to allocating scarce resources to compet-  
ing product demands. In fact, if we take the gigantic leap of assuming that future demands  
are known with certainty, linear programming provides an exact solution to the network  
management problem. Since uncertainty is a key element of revenue management decision  
making, a solution derived while ignoring uncertainty is not wholly satisfactory. However,  
the linear programming formulation of the network management problem is worth study-  
ing for three reasons. First, it solves the capacity allocation component of network manage-  
ment and provides insight into the nature of the optimal solution. Second, the solution to  
the network management linear program provides a good starting point for a fully optimal  
solution. In many hotels and airlines, linear programming is used to determine an initial  
solution, which is then adjusted to account for the uncertainty in future demand. Finally,  
the linear program generates marginal values of capacity as a by-product. These marginal  
values approximate the opportunity costs of the capacity and can serve as an estimate of  
network bid prices, which is discussed in Section 10.4.  
To formulate the network management problem as a linear program, assume we know  
the future demand for every ODF with certainty. Furthermore, assume that this demand  
will not be influenced by which ODFs we open and close \(in other words, we have inde-  
pendent demands on each flight and among flight legs\). We have m resources and n ODFs  
utilizing combinations of those resources with n ≥ m. We use the subscript i to index re-  
sources and the subscript j to index ODFs. Each resource i has a constrained capacity Ci \> 0.  
Each ODF has a known demand dj \> 0 and a net contribution margin pj \> 0. Let xj ≥ 0 be  
the amount of ODF j we will allow to book \(our allocation\). Then the deterministic network  
management problem is to find the values of xj for j = 1, 2, . . . , n that maximize total net  
contribution subject to the constrained capacities of the resources.  
To complete the formulation, we need to represent which resources are used to produce  
each ODF. To do this, we define the incidence variable aij as follows\:  
aij  
    
1  
if resource is used in ODF  
= i j  
\(10.1\)  
   
0  
otherw wise.  
To illustrate the use of the incidence variables, consider the simple flight network shown  
in Figure 10.5. There are two resources in this network\: \(1\) Flight 1 from San Francisco to  
Denver and \(2\) Flight 2 from Denver to St. Louis. With three products and two fare classes,  
the airline is offering six ODFs\: network management 249  
1\. San Francisco to Denver full fare  
2\. San Francisco to Denver discount  
3\. Denver to St. Louis full fare  
4\. Denver to St. Louis discount  
5\. San Francisco to St. Louis full fare  
6\. San Francisco to St. Louis discount  
Using this numbering, a11 = 1 because the San Francisco – to-Denver full-fare ODF uses  
flight 1, while a13 = 0 because the Denver-to – St. Louis full-fare ODF does not utilize Flight  
1\. The values of all the incidence variables for this simple example are shown in Table 10.2.  
It is instructive to compare the hub-and-spoke network in Table 10.2 with the pattern of  
incidence variables for a linear network. Consider a hotel that offers one-night, two-night,  
and three-night products only. The resources for the hotel are the room nights, and the  
products are combinations of arrival night and length of stay. Table 10.3 shows the values  
of the incidence variables \(aij\) for three different lengths of stay and a week of resources.  
In theory, the network management problem for a hotel stretches out indefinitely into the  
future. In practice, a hotel will only accept bookings for some limited period into the future  
\(often a year\), limiting the number of resources and products that need to be managed.  
Furthermore, in theory a hotel offers an infinite number of products, since customers can  
book any length of stay. In practice, lengths of stay longer than 14 nights are extremely rare  
at most hotels, and hotels usually manage them as a single product.

The variables x1, x2, . . . , x  
n are the total seats allocated to each ODF. The objective function  
10.2 stipulates that the goal is to accept the demand that maximizes total net contribution.  
There is one constraint of the form of \(10.3\) for each resource. These constraints ensure  
that the airline can physically accommodate all the demand that it accepts. The demand  
constraints in \(10.4\) stipulate that sales of each ODF are limited by demand for that ODF.  
Finally, \(10.5\) ensures that all allocations are greater than or equal to zero.  
Example 10.1  
An airline is operating the two-flight airline network in Figure 10.5 and offer-  
ing a full fare and a discount fare for each of the three itineraries. There are six  
ODFs using two resources, and the ODF-resource mapping is as shown in Ta-  
ble 10.2. The airline has assigned a 100-seat aircraft on Flight 1 from San Fran-  
cisco to Denver and a 120-seat aircraft on Flight 2 from Denver to St. Louis;  
demands and fares are as shown in Table 10.4. Notice that the unconstrained  
demand is 160 on the San Francisco – to-Denver flight and 170 on the Denver-  
to – St. Louis flight. Since these demands exceed the flight capacities for the two  
flights, we will need to turn some passengers away. The linear program for this  
example is

The optimal allocations for Example 10.1 and the total net contribution are shown in  
Table 10.5. Note that in this case, we took all of the full-fare passengers for each product.  
We also took some \(but not all\) of the local discount traffic in both markets and none of  
the San Francisco – to – St. Louis discount through traffic. At first glance, it might seem sur-  
prising that we did not take any of the San Francisco – to – St. Louis discount traffic, since  
those passengers were paying the second-highest fare in the system — more than any of the  
local full-fare passengers and much more than any of the local discount passengers. But the  
reason we rejected them is obvious when we look at the total network\: The sum of the fares  
paid by the local passengers was greater than the San Francisco – to – St. Louis discount fare.  
Given our demand forecasts, we gain more contribution for the system by rejecting the  
discount through passengers in favor of local demand.  
10.2.2 Structure of the Optimal Solution  
Notice that in the optimal solution shown in Table 10.5, ODFs fall into three categories\:  
1\. ODFs for which we did not accept any bookings \(San Francisco to St. Louis dis-  
2\. 3. count\)  
ODFs for which we accepted some but not all of the demand \(Denver to St. Louis  
discount and San Francisco to Denver discount\)  
ODFs for which we accepted all of the demand \(all of the full-fare ODFs\)  
In the optimal solution to the deterministic network management problem there will be,  
at most, one fare class for each product for which we accept some but not all demand.7 All  
of the other fare classes for that product will be all or nothing\: we will either accept all of  
their demand or none of it. Acceptance of fare classes for a product proceeds in fare order\: 252  
network management  
For each product there is a set of fare classes \(possibly empty\) for which we accept all of the  
demand and a set of fare classes \(possibly empty\) for which we accept none of the demand.  
The fares for the fully accepted classes are all higher than the fares for those classes for  
which we accept none of the demand. Finally, there may be one class for which we accept  
only some of the demand. This class will have a fare higher than the fares of the rejected  
classes but lower than the fully accepted classes.  
Example 10.2  
An airline operates on the flight network shown in Figure 10.5 with the same  
total demand by product as in Example 10.1, but with five classes per product,  
with the fares and ODF demands shown in the fourth and fifth columns of Ta-  
ble 10.6. This airline is offering 15 ODFs. The optimal allocations are shown in  
the corresponding column of Table 10.6. For the San Francisco – to – St. Louis  
product, it is optimal to accept all passengers who pay more than \$200 and  
reject those who pay less. The airline should accept exactly 7 of those paying ex-  
actly \$200, out of a total demand of 10. Similarly, for the Denver-to – St. louis  
product, the airline should accept everybody paying more than \$75 and reject  
everybody paying less than \$75 while accepting 13 out of 30 passengers will-  
ing to pay exactly \$75. For the San Francisco – to-Denver product, the airline  
should accept everyone paying more than \$130 and reject all requests whose  
associated fares are lower than \$100.  
Example 10.2 shows that we never want to be accepting bookings for a lower fare class  
when we are rejecting them for a higher fare class for the same product. For the example in  
Table 10.6, there is no combination of demands, capacities, or fares for which it would be  
optimal to accept San Francisco – to – St. Louis \$170 bookings while rejecting San Fran-  
cisco – to-Denver \$180 bookings. On the other hand, it is optimal in the example to reject  
\$190 San Francisco – to – St. Louis bookings that use the San Francisco – to-Denver leg while

10.2.3 Strengths and Weaknesses of the Linear Programming Approach  
Efficient linear programming solution packages, such as CPLEX, have made the linear pro-  
gramming formulation solvable, even for many large airlines. To account for uncertainty,  
expected demand is often used in the demand constraints \(10.4\), and various adjustments  
are made to account for overbooking and for the dynamic nature of bookings and cancel-  
lations. On the other hand, working with a large linear program is often cumbersome and  
produces a large number of outputs \(the ODF allocations\) that can be difficult to interpret  
and implement. A large hub-and-spoke airline may have many ODFs with very low levels  
of demand. For example, a major hub-and-spoke airline offers connecting service between  
many small cities that have very small demand — say, Portland, Maine, to Chicago and  
San Francisco to Santa Barbara, California. This may be a perfectly valid set of connec-  
tions and therefore a product that the airline wants to offer, but the expected demand for  
this product would likely be fewer than one passenger per day and the expected demand  
per fare class for this product would be even smaller. Many hub-and-spoke airlines offer  
thousands of such ODFs with very low levels of demand — less than one expected booking  
per month in many cases. But these ODFs still need to be managed, and linear program-  
ming would require calculating and maintaining a booking limit for each of them. This is  
a tremendous amount of computational and implementation overhead to manage a large  
number of ODFs that collectively may only represent a small fraction of total demand and  
revenue.  
There are other issues with linear programming as a network revenue management ap-  
proach. One is that it is not immediately clear how to incorporate demand uncertainty.  
One obvious approach is to replace the deterministic demands for each ODF, dj, with the  
mean demand for that ODF, µj. But analogy with the single-leg case will show that this will  
not provide an optimal solution\: maximizing revenue based on expected demand does not  
maximize expected revenue.  
Finally, the astute reader will notice that the network linear program has been formu-  
lated in terms of calculating allotments for different ODFs. As Section 9.4 shows, the allot-  
ment approach breaks down when bookings do not arrive in strict fare order. This is an  
even more pressing issue with network management than with leg-based management — it  
is extremely unrealistic to expect that passengers booking on different ODFs would oblige  
us by booking in strict order of value to the airline. In fact, passengers flying high-fare,  
multileg itineraries often book earlier than those flying lower-fare, single-leg itineraries. In  
theory at least, we could deal with the dynamics of network management by rerunning the  
linear program each time a booking is accepted or a cancellation takes place. However, the  
size and complexity of the corresponding linear program render this approach impracti-  
cal. What we really need is a way to extend the concept of nesting to booking requests that  
utilize multiple legs. The most common way to do this in many travel-related industries is  
by virtual nesting, which is discussed in the next section. 254  
network management  
10.3 VIRTUAL NESTING\*  
Virtual nesting is rather technical and specific to airlines and a number of other travel-  
related industries, and this section can be skipped by readers without a particular interest  
in travel-related industries.  
Virtual nesting was the earliest approach to network management. It was first applied  
by American Airlines \(Smith, Leimkuhler, and Darrow 1992\), and variations on the basic  
idea are in use at many airlines today. Virtual nesting was developed to allow an airline to  
apply the preexisting, leg-based control structures in its reservation system to the network  
management problem with minimal changes. As the name implies, it allows ODFs to be  
nested. Because it is extremely flexible and can be implemented relatively easily, some vari-  
ation of virtual nesting is used by practically every airline that has implemented network  
management.  
The first step in airline virtual nesting is to define a set of buckets on each flight leg. Each  
bucket represents a range of fare values. The second step is to map each ODF into a bucket  
on each of its legs based on an estimate of the ODF’s value to the airline. The process of  
mapping ODFs into buckets on legs is called indexing. At the end of the indexing process,  
each bucket contains ODFs of similar value. \(For the moment, we will defer the question of  
how we might calculate the value of an ODF.\) We will use the convention that the lowest-  
numbered bucket on each leg contains the highest-value ODFs. The buckets are nested  
so that bucket 1 has access to the entire capacity of the leg, bucket 2 has access to all the  
inventory except that protected for bucket 1, and the lowest-value bucket has access only  
to its own allocation. Each bucket has a booking limit and a protection level that is updated  
every time a booking is accepted or a cancellation occurs. This means we can apply all of the  
mechanics for leg-based revenue management to buckets.  
Example 10.3  
An airline operating the simple network shown in Figure 10.5 offers a Y-Class  
fare and an M-Class fare for each product. This is a total of six ODFs. The  
airline has established three buckets on each leg. Then one possible indexing is  
illustrated in Figure 10.6. In this case, the airline maps SFO-STL Y-Class pas-  
sengers into bucket 1 on Flight 1 but into bucket 2 on Flight 2. This means that  
the SFO-STL Y passengers will have access to the entire capacity of Flight 1,  
but they only have access to the bucket 2 allocation of Flight 2, which is less  
than the capacity of the plane.  
A schematic diagram of a virtual nesting system is shown in Figure 10.7. The reserva-  
tion system now has an additional function that maps booking requests to buckets as they  
arrive. Once a booking has been mapped to buckets on each leg, the reservation system  
checks availability of the appropriate bucket on each leg to determine whether the book-  
ing should be accepted. This function is closely analogous to the booking control function  
when booking requests are managed one leg at a time, as described in Section 8.5. In fact,  
most network management systems utilize the fare class booking structures within the res-  
ervation systems as their buckets. The function of the revenue management system in a network management 255

Schematic view of a virtual nesting architecture for network management.  
virtual nesting approach is both to maintain and communicate the latest indexing and to  
calculate and update booking limits for each bucket on each leg.  
10.3.1 Virtual Nesting Booking Control  
The management of bookings under virtual nesting proceeds in a fashion closely analogous  
to single-leg booking control.  
Virtual Nesting Booking Control  
1\. Initialization  
a. Establish an indexing that maps every ODF into a bucket on each leg in  
the ODF. 256  
network management  
b. For each leg bucket, estimate the mean and standard deviation of total fore-  
casted demand.  
c. Using the mean and standard deviation of demand by bucket, average contribu-  
tion by bucket, and leg capacity, use EMSR or a similar approach to determine  
booking limits and protection levels for each bucket on each leg.  
2\. Operation  
a. When a booking request for an ODF is received, check each leg in the ODF. If  
there is sufficient capacity in the corresponding bucket on each leg, accept the  
request. Otherwise reject it.  
b. If the booking is accepted, reduce bucket availabilities on all legs in the  
booked ODF.  
c. When cancellations occur, increase bucket availabilities for each leg in the  
canceled ODF.  
3\. Reoptimization  
a. Periodically reforecast demand for each ODF and update expected bucket de-  
mand by leg.  
b. Periodically rerun EMSR or other algorithm to recalculate nested booking limits  
for each bucket based on the new forecasts and capacity remaining on each leg.  
Note that virtual nesting could be described as leg-based revenue management plus in-  
dexing. The connection to leg-based revenue management is a strength — it allows airlines  
to use the well-established \(and hard-to-change\) nested fare class structures within their  
reservation systems.  
Another strength of virtual nesting is its flexibility. As an example, simply mapping all  
ODFs from the same fare class into the same bucket on each leg \(i.e., mapping all M-Class  
bookings into an M-Class bucket on each leg and all Y-Class bookings into a higher Y-  
Class bucket\) will give the same results as managing each leg independently. More usefully,  
an airline can use virtual nesting to provide preferential availability to an ODF simply by  
mapping it to higher buckets on its constituent legs. This can be useful, for example, if the  
airline is running a marketing campaign and wants to ensure that sufficient availability will  
be maintained for certain discount fares — even if it may not be optimal to do so from a  
revenue maximization point of view.  
10.3.2 Indexing  
Virtual nesting can be described as booking control plus indexing. We have seen how book-  
ing control works within virtual nesting. This leaves the question of how ODFs should be  
mapped to their constituent legs — in other words, how they should be indexed. Both the  
indexing scheme chosen and the frequency with which it is updated strongly influence not  
only the additional revenue that will be achieved but also the complexity of the revenue  
management system. The remainder of this chapter is devoted primarily to describing dif-  
ferent indexing approaches and discussing the implications of each. network management 257  
One immediate thought might be to map an ODF into buckets on each leg based on  
its total fares; that is, we would map the ODFs with the highest total fare into the highest  
bucket, those with slightly lower total fare into the second bucket, and so on for every leg.  
This is equivalent to the greedy heuristic for network management, and, as discussed in Sec-  
tion 10.1.2, the greedy heuristic fails when multiple resources in a network are constrained  
because it ignores opportunity cost in determining how an ODF should be bucketed on one  
of its legs. Specifically, an ODF with a high total fare but a high opportunity cost on its other  
legs should potentially be bucketed below an ODF with lower total fare but no opportunity  
cost on its other legs. This type of bucketing can never be achieved by the greedy heuristic.  
The failure of the greedy heuristic suggests that we need a way of indexing ODFs that  
includes their opportunity costs. As it turns out, the best way to value an ODF for bucket-  
ing on a resource is on the basis of its total fare minus the opportunity cost \(if any\) on other  
resources it uses. This quantity, known as the net leg fare, is defined as follows\:  
The net leg fare for ODF i on leg k is equal to the total fare for ODF i minus the sum of oppor-  
tunity costs on all resources other than k \(if any\) in ODF i.  
The term net leg fare \(also called net local fare\) is a bit unfortunate because of its airline  
connotation. The same calculation holds for hotels, where the resources are room nights,  
and for rental car companies, where the resources are rental days.  
Example 10.4  
A hotel has estimated that the opportunity cost for a room on Tuesday night,  
January 23, is \$80 and the opportunity cost for Wednesday night, January 24,  
is \$105. The hotel receives a booking request for two nights, arriving January  
23 and departing January 25, with an associated total rate of \$220. The net leg  
fare associated with that booking request is \$220 − \$105 = \$115 for the night of  
January 23 and \$220 − \$80 = \$140 for the night of January 24.  
Note that the net leg fare is calculated by subtracting the opportunity cost on other re-  
sources from the total fare. It is a local measure of the incremental contribution of one more  
booking in the ODF to system profitability, including the opportunity that would be for-  
gone from other legs \(if any\) in the ODF. Only if the fare associated with the ODF exceeds  
the opportunity cost for all of the resources it uses should it be accepted. For this reason, it  
is the right value to use to map products into buckets on each leg.  
Example 10.5  
Consider the three-city network shown in Figure 10.5. Assume that the oppor-  
tunity cost on Flight 1 \(SFO-DEN\) is \$250 and on the Flight 2 \(DEN-STL\) leg  
is \$800. Each leg has three buckets, defined as follows\:9  
•  
•  
•  
Bucket 1\: Net leg fares \$1,000  
Bucket 2\: \$600 ≤ Net leg fares \< \$1,000  
Bucket 3\: Net leg fares \< \$600 258

n o t e \: The opportunity cost on Flight 1 is \$250, and the opportunity cost on Flight 2 is \$800.  
Table 10.7 shows how six different ODFs would be mapped into buckets in  
this case. Note that SFO-STL M-Class passengers are mapped into the high-  
est bucket on Flight 2 but the lowest bucket on Flight 1. This means that on  
Flight 1 we will be protecting seats for local M-Class passengers from the SFO-  
STL M-Class passengers; but on Flight 2 the situation is reversed.  
10.3.3 Static Virtual Nesting  
We are most of the way to a practical approach for network management. We can calculate  
the net leg fare for each ODF on each of its legs based on its total fare minus the opportu-  
nity cost on other legs. This provides an indexing scheme that allows us to map the ODF  
into a bucket on each leg. If each of the buckets has sufficient availability, we accept the  
booking; otherwise we reject it. The remaining piece of the puzzle is how to calculate and  
update the opportunity cost for each leg. It is this calculation that differentiates virtual nest-  
ing approaches.  
One obvious way to estimate the future opportunity cost for a product is to base it on  
past experience. This is, in essence, equivalent to forecasting opportunity cost.  
Example 10.6  
A Tuesday 2\:00 flight from San Francisco to Dallas had opportunity costs of  
\$180, \$130, \$190, \$205, and \$95 at departure. One way to estimate the opportu-  
nity cost for next Tuesday’s flight would be to average the past five opportunity  
costs; that is, the estimate of next Tuesday’s opportunity cost would be \(\$180 +  
\$130 + \$190 + \$205 + \$95\) /5 = \$160.  
The method of using historic opportunity costs to map ODFs into buckets is called  
static virtual nesting. With static virtual nesting, an airline \(or other revenue management  
company\) estimates an opportunity cost for each resource based on the sales history of that  
resource.10 If the resource rarely sells out \(e.g., a Tuesday night in a midtown hotel in De-  
troit\), the opportunity cost will be small. If, on the other hand, the resource sells out with  
regularity, its opportunity cost will be much higher. network management 259  
Example 10.7  
Flight leg 135 has historically sold out 30% of the time, and its average oppor-  
tunity cost when it sold out is \$750. An estimate of the expected future oppor-  
tunity cost for this leg would be 0.3 × \$750 = \$225.  
There are other approaches to static virtual nesting, but they all have one thing in com-  
mon\: indexing is based entirely on past experience. This means that the indexing for a par-  
ticular leg will not change during the booking period for a flight. In static virtual nesting, an  
airline might recalculate its indexing on a monthly or quarterly basis. In the interim, ODFs  
would always be mapped into the same buckets on each leg.11 For our two-leg airline, the  
mapping in Table 10.7 would be used for all departures of Flights 1 and 2 within this period.  
However, this mapping is based on the expectation that Flight 2 is likely to sell out and  
therefore is assigned a high displacement cost. While this may be true on average, it is un-  
likely to be true for every departure. For example, we may be almost certain that a particular  
departure of Flight 2 will not sell out. This means that the expected opportunity cost for  
this departure of Flight 2 would be close to 0. But by using the mapping in Table 10.7, the  
airline is mapping connecting passengers into buckets that are too low for this departure.  
Another shortcoming of static virtual nesting is implicit in the name\: since it is static, it  
does not respond to changes in the course of the booking process. An airline’s initial fore-  
cast of the opportunity cost for a leg might change considerably between first booking and  
departure. \(As we have seen, there is a correspondence between opportunity cost and the  
boundary between open and closed classes. The assumption that a leg’s opportunity cost  
does not change between first booking and departure is equivalent to assuming that no  
buckets will open or close during the time that the flight is open for booking.\) For the two-  
flight example, we could certainly have the situation where an unanticipated surge in book-  
ings \(possibly a large group\) resulted in Flight 1’s actually closing to future bookings while  
Flight 2 remained open in bucket 1 but closed in buckets 2 and 3. Using the mapping in  
Table 10.7, the only ODFs that fall in bucket 1 on Flight 2 are SFO-STL through passengers.  
But under static virtual nesting, these booking requests will be rejected on Flight 1—which  
is closed in all buckets. So the system is effectively closed to all bookings, even though there  
are seats available on Flight 2 that could be profitably filled with local passengers.  
It seems apparent that virtual nesting could be improved if we could update opportunity  
costs more often based on bookings and cancellations as they occur as well as on changing  
expectations of total demand for a flight. It turns out that, if we update opportunity costs  
often enough, they can almost serve as the only controls we need for network management.  
This is the idea behind bid pricing. Section 9.2.3 shows how bid pricing applies to a single  
leg. We see next how it can be applied to a network.  
10.4 NETWORK BID PRICING  
Section 9.2.3 describes how we should accept a booking request for a single resource only  
if the fare associated with the request exceeds the bid price for that resource. Perhaps not 260  
network management  
surprisingly, there is an equivalent condition for products consisting of multiple resources\:  
we should only accept a multiple-resource booking if the fare exceeds the sum of the bid  
prices for the constituent resources. This condition can be written as follows\:  
Accept a booking for a product \(ODF\) only if the product’s price is greater than the sum of the  
bid prices on the constituent resources.  
The idea behind network bid pricing is to use this condition as the basis of the revenue  
management system. In an airline bid-pricing system, the revenue management system cal-  
culates a bid price for each leg \(we see later how this is done\) at each time before departure.  
When a booking request is received, its fare is compared to the sum of the bid prices for  
its constituent legs. If the fare for the request is greater than or equal to the sum of the bid  
prices, the request is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected. That is all there is to bid pricing, at  
least from a booking control point of view.  
In the extreme, this approach would allow us to dispense with the need for any sophis-  
ticated booking control structures and to manage bookings on bid price alone. However,  
we also need to allow for the fact that not all booking requests will be for a single seat. The  
easiest way to manage multiseat bookings is to keep track of the remaining unbooked seats  
on each leg and to use that number as a total booking limit.12 Without no-shows and can-  
cellations, the total booking limit would be equal to the unbooked capacity. If we anticipate  
no-shows and cancellations, the total booking limit could be calculated using one of the  
overbooking techniques described in Chapter 11. Managing bookings in this fashion is  
called network bid price control.  
Network Bid Price Control  
1\. 2. 3. 4. 5. Calculate an initial bid price and a total booking limit for each leg.  
When a booking request is received, calculate the product bid price as the sum of the  
bid prices for all the legs in the product and the product availability as the minimum  
of the total booking limits on all the legs used by the product.  
If the fare for the booking exceeds the product bid price and the number of seats  
requested is less than the product availability, accept the request and go to step 4.  
Otherwise reject the request and go to step 2.  
Decrease the total booking limit on each resource within the product by the num-  
ber of seats in the booking and go to step 2.  
When a booking cancels, increment the total booking limits for all flights in the  
booking.  
6\. Periodically reoptimize all flight booking limits and all bid prices.  
Example 10.8  
Consider the solution to Example 10.2 shown in Table 10.6. If we define \$75 as  
the bid price for the Denver-to – St. Louis leg and \$125 as the bid price for the  
San Francisco – to-Denver leg, we will see that we have established a set of bid network management 261  
prices consistent with the optimal solution to the network management prob-  
lem. The bid prices provide the optimal thresholds between the fare classes we  
want to accept for each product and those we want to reject. For the example,  
these thresholds are \$75 and \$125 for the two single-leg products, plus \$75 +  
\$125 = \$200 for the San Francisco – to – St. Louis through product. By using the  
bid prices for the two legs plus a total booking limit for each leg in the dynamic  
bid price control structure, we could achieve a result very close to the optimal  
network solution in Table 10.6. And we have done so much more economically,  
by using just four total controls — two bid prices plus two booking limits — in-  
stead of the 15 allocations in Table 10.6.  
Network bid price control is a remarkably simple approach to revenue management. It  
requires only two controls per leg — a bid price and a total booking limit. However, real-  
world considerations complicate the picture substantially. First, we have not yet considered  
how bid prices can be calculated. Furthermore, bid prices need to be updated continuously  
over time. If calculating optimal network bid prices is time consuming or complex \(as it is\),  
the airline will require an interim control scheme to handle bookings between reoptimiza-  
tions. In addition, network bid price controls require additional controls if multiple-seat  
booking requests are to be handled correctly. Finally, any network management approach  
for airlines needs to be implemented in conjunction with the existing reservation system  
and distribution system infrastructure, and most existing reservation and distribution sys-  
tems are not designed to easily enable pure bid price management.  
The system shown in Figure 10.8 is known as an availability processor architecture. It  
is an implementation of a pure bid-pricing approach to network management. Booking  
requests arrive at an online processor known as the availability processor. The availability

10.4.1 Bid Prices and Opportunity Costs  
Section 9.2.3 notes that the bid price for a resource was equal to the opportunity cost for  
that resource and could be calculated as the fare of the lowest open fare class. Not surpris-  
ingly, network bid prices are also related to the opportunity costs of the resources in the  
network. We can extend this observation to a network by noting that the following six  
quantities are \(approximately\) equivalent.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Bid price\: the minimum price we should accept for a customer on a leg  
Opportunity cost\: the revenue we would gain from an additional seat on a leg  
Displacement cost\: the revenue we would lose if we had one seat less on a leg  
Marginal value of the capacity constraint in the network linear program  
Boundary between the highest closed and lowest open fare classes in a single-leg  
problem  
Closed bucket boundary\: boundary between the highest closed and lowest open buck-  
ets on a leg in a virtual nest  
To be sure, these six quantities will not always be exactly equal. For example, the rev-  
enue gained from an additional seat on a leg will not necessarily be exactly the same as  
the revenue lost from removing a seat. The marginal value of the capacity constraint in  
the deterministic network linear program will not generally equal the values obtained by  
approaches that explicitly incorporate uncertainty. However, the near equivalence among  
these quantities supplies ideas for how bid prices can be calculated as well as providing  
insights into why bid pricing works.  
10.4.2 Calculating Bid Prices\*  
So far, we have not considered how bid prices might be calculated for a large network. You  
may not be surprised to find out that calculating bid prices can be quite complex — so much  
so that developing faster and more accurate bid-pricing algorithms is a very active area of  
research. While understanding the details of bid price calculation is not critical, we will  
briefly look at two commonly used approaches. This section is somewhat technical and can  
be skimmed or skipped.  
Calculating bid prices by linear programming. Section 10.2 shows how the deterministic  
network management problem can be formulated as a linear program, where the outputs of  
the linear program are allotments for all the ODFs in the network. The value of the objec-  
tive function at the optimal solution is the maximum revenue the company could achieve  
from its fixed stock of capacity. One way to calculate the bid price on a leg is to solve the  
network linear program twice\: the first time with the actual capacities and the second time network management 263  
with the capacity of the leg reduced by one seat. The difference in the total contribution  
between the two runs would be the displacement cost on the leg, which, as we have seen, is  
an estimate of the bid price on the leg.  
Of course, this would be a cumbersome way to estimate bid prices, since it requires solv-  
ing a large linear program twice for each leg in the network. Fortunately, this is not neces-  
sary. Deterministic displacement costs for all the legs in the network can be more practically  
estimated using linear programming in two different ways by using the marginal values  
associated with the capacity constraints as bid prices.  
A key to calculating bid prices is to understand their relationship to the dual variables  
of the underlying optimization problem. Consider the linear program specified in Equa-  
tions 10.2 –10.5. Associated with each constraint is a dual variable that corresponds to the  
improvement in the objective function associated with an incremental relaxation of the  
corresponding constraint. Thus, for the linear program in Equations 10.2 –10.5, there are  
two sets of dual variables\:  
•  
•  
 i is the dual variable associated with the constraints in Equation 10.3\: ∑n  
j = 1 aij xj ≤ ci.  
This constraint guarantees that the number of accepted bookings for products that  
use a resource do not exceed the capacity of that resource.  
j is the dual variable associated with the constraints in Equation 10.4\: xj ≤ dj. These  
constraints guarantee that the number of accepted bookings for a product do not  
exceed the demand for that product.  
These values can be computed directly by solving the dual of the deterministic linear pro-  
gram, which is

This problem can be solved directly using a standard linear programming approach, in  
which case  i is the bid price associated with resource i.  
Calculating bid prices by sequential estimation. The method of sequential estimation  
is based on the observation that the bid price on a leg should be equal to its closed bucket  
boundary in a virtual nest, where the closed bucket boundary is defined as the boundary  
between the lowest open bucket and the highest closed bucket on the leg. It should be clear  
that the closed bucket boundary should approximate the bid price on a leg. After all, we will  
accept a local booking for a single seat only if its fare exceeds the closed bucket boundary,  
which is the definition of bid price. Furthermore, we will accept a multileg booking request  
for a single seat only if its net leg fare is greater than the closed bucket boundary on each leg  
in the ODF. You can confirm that this is the same as ensuring that its total net fare exceeds  
the sum of the closed bucket boundaries. 264  
network management  
This means we can calculate bid prices for a network by finding a set of closed bucket  
boundaries that is consistent across the network. The challenge arises because the closed  
bucket boundary \(bid price\) on any leg depends on the closed bucket boundaries on all  
other legs via the net leg fares of multileg ODFs. If we change the bid price on a leg, we will  
change the net leg fares for multileg ODFs on all connecting legs. This will in turn change  
the buckets into which those ODFs are mapped on the other legs. When we reoptimize  
availabilities on those legs, the new mapping may well change the bid prices on those legs,  
which will change the ODF mappings on the original leg. A consistent set of bid prices is  
one in which the closed bucket boundaries on all legs are locally optimal given the closed  
bucket boundaries on all other legs.  
Sequential estimation calculates bid prices by starting with an initial estimate of all bid  
prices and then updating the bid price on each leg until the bucket boundaries are consist-  
ent across the entire network. To see how this works, assume we have a network consisting  
of two legs. We initially map all the ODFs into buckets by assuming that each leg has a bid  
price of 0 \(recall that this is equivalent to the greedy heuristic\). Given this indexing, we  
can estimate the total demand by bucket on each leg. Then, for leg 1, we can use EMSR to  
calculate the bucket allocations on leg 1 given the current indexing. Once we have calcu-  
lated the allocations on leg 1, we can reestimate the bid price on leg 1 as its closed bucket  
boundary. Given this new estimate of the leg 1 bid price, we can recalculate the net leg fares  
on leg 2 and rebucket all of the ODFs on leg 2 accordingly. We can then apply EMSR on leg  
2, determine its closed bucket boundary, and use that as the new bid price for leg 2. Given  
this new leg 2 bid price, we can rebucket the ODFs on leg 1 and continue. Under the right  
conditions, this procedure will converge to a situation where the mappings and allocations  
on each leg are consistent with each other.  
We can extend this approach to a full network as follows.  
Sequential Estimation Algorithm to Calculate Bid Prices  
1\. 2. 3. Establish a set of buckets on all legs, and calculate probabilistic demand forecasts  
for all buckets. Set all leg bid prices to 0.  
loop over all legs, k = 1, 2, . . . , N.  
For the current leg k and every ODF i that includes leg k, calculate the net leg fare  
as the fare for ODF i minus the sum of the current bid prices for all other legs in  
the ODF.  
4\. 5. Map all the ODFs on the current leg into buckets based on their net leg fares for the  
ODFs. Once this is complete, use EMSR to determine allocations by bucket.  
If all buckets are open, set the new bid price for leg k to 0. If all buckets are closed,  
set the new bid price for leg k to the highest bucket boundary. Otherwise, set the  
new bid price to the boundary between the lowest open bucket and the highest  
closed bucket.  
6\. Continue to the next leg until all legs have had new bid prices calculated. network management 265  
7\. 8. When all leg bid prices have been recalculated, check the change between the new  
bid price and the old bid price on each leg. If the two bid prices are sufficiently close  
for all legs, stop — the current set of bid prices is optimal.  
Otherwise go to step 2.  
This sequential estimation algorithm generally converges to a set of consistent bucket  
boundaries across a network. When bookings are accepted or forecasts change, the sequen-  
tial estimation algorithm can be restarted using the previous set of bid prices.  
10.4.3 Dynamic Virtual Nesting\*  
Dynamic virtual nesting is the marriage of bid pricing and virtual nesting. It combines the  
conceptual elegance and intuitiveness of bid pricing with the practical orientation of vir-  
tual nesting. Under dynamic virtual nesting, new bid prices are frequently recalculated for  
all legs in the network based on current bookings and forecasts of future demands. The  
recalculation of bid prices could be purely periodic \(e.g., nightly or weekly\), it could be  
event driven \(e.g., recalculated whenever a flight closes\), or it could be ordered by a rev-  
enue analyst. In most cases, all of these can trigger a recalculation. Every time new resource  
bid prices are calculated, new net leg fares are calculated for each leg in the network. These  
net leg fares are used to define a new indexing. This indexing is put in place until the next  
recalculation of bid prices.  
The strength of dynamic virtual nesting is that it updates bid prices to reflect the cur-  
rent situation on each leg —both current bookings and expected future demand —while  
utilizing virtual nesting to take advantage of leg-based control structures. Of course, an  
important determinant of the effectiveness of the approach is how often bid prices are  
recalculated. If bid prices are not recalculated very often, then dynamic virtual nesting may  
not be much of an improvement over static virtual nesting. If bid prices are continually up-  
dated \(say, every second\), then dynamic virtual nesting will approximate real-time network  
bid price control for single-seat bookings.  
The first dynamic virtual nesting revenue management system was implemented in 1989  
by Hertz rental car company and Decision Focus Incorporated \(Carroll and Grimes 1996\).  
The first airline dynamic virtual nesting system was developed jointly by Decision Focus  
Incorporated and the Scandinavian Airlines System in 1992. Since then, the approach has  
been widely applied across many revenue management industries.  
10.4.4 Strengths and Weaknesses of Bid Pricing  
Bid prices are more than tools to manage bookings. They are also useful pieces of informa-  
tion in themselves. As opportunity costs, they specify the value of an additional unit for  
each resource in the network. If a flight leg has a bid price of \$250, this indicates that the  
airline could realize \(approximately\) \$250 in additional revenue from adding another seat  
to that flight. Since the bid prices are marginal signals, this logic cannot be extended to  
determine the effect of adding more than one seat\: A bid price of \$250 on a flight leg does 266  
network management  
not mean that an airline could expect to gain \$2,500 from adding 10 seats.13 However, even  
with this limitation, the bid prices can provide useful input into capacity decisions. A flight  
leg that consistently has a high opportunity cost at departure would be an excellent candi-  
date to be considered for assignment to a larger aircraft, while a flight leg that consistently  
departs with a bid price of 0 is an excellent candidate to be considered for downsizing. A  
rental car company with the option to move its cars around should consider moving cars  
from locations with consistently low bid prices to those with consistently high bid prices.  
Example 10.9  
The Rent-a-Lemon rental car company rents cars at both the San Francisco air-  
port and the San Jose airport. The two airports are 40 miles apart, and it costs  
\$10 per car to “hike” cars from one airport to the other. For a date two weeks in  
the future, the bid price at the San Francisco airport is \$73 and the bid price at  
the San Jose airport is \$22. The expected net gain from moving a car from San  
Jose to San Francisco would be \$73 − \$22 − \$10 = \$41.  
Bid pricing is particularly well suited to hotel applications where there is one bid price  
for each room type for each future night. The product bid price is the sum of the bid prices  
for the nights stayed. Hotel and rental car bid prices can be conveniently displayed using  
a calendar, as shown in Figure 10.9. The calendar shows the bid prices \(labeled b\) and the  
forecast unconstrained occupancies \(labeled d\) for a hotel as they might be displayed by  
a revenue management system for a future month. A customer who wants to rent a room  
for the nights of March 23, 24, and 25 would need to pay at least the sum of the bid prices  
for these nights \(\$199.93 + \$178.25 + \$122.20 = \$500.38\) to be allowed to book. On the  
other hand, a customer who wants to rent for March 12, 13, and 14 would be allowed to  
book if he were paying more than \$42.34 + \$32.34 + \$54.37 = \$129.05. The lower product  
bid price reflects lower anticipated demand during the second period than the first. The  
dark-shaded dates are those with a bid price greater than \$150, those with medium shad-  
ing have a bid price between \$100 and \$150, and those with no shading have a bid price  
less than \$100. The pattern shown in Figure 10.9 is typical of a metropolitan business hotel  
with a midweek peak.  
Bid pricing is an appealing and intuitive approach to network revenue management.  
However, a word of caution is in order. The product bid price is the minimum price we  
should accept for a product given remaining capacity and anticipated future demand by  
fare class. It does not tell us how we should actually be pricing the product. A hotel manager  
looking at the bid price calendar in Figure 10.9 should not make the mistake of thinking  
that he should set the rack rate on Wednesday, March 16, to \$122.47. In this sense, the term  
bid price is unfortunate since, as we have seen, the bid price is better regarded as an oppor-  
tunity cost. In the extreme case, a bid price of zero for a product tells us nothing about how  
we should price the product. Bid price control is a mechanism for ensuring that we do not  
accept any business whose margin does not exceed its opportunity cost — it does not tell us  
whether we are priced correctly in the market. network management 267

10.5 NETWORK MANAGEMENT IN ACTION  
The first step taken by most airlines in revenue management was to use the approaches  
described in Chapter 9 to maximize expected revenue on each flight leg independently. In  
most cases, this approach provided tremendous benefits from not managing bookings at  
all— that is, allowing customers to book on a first-come, first-served basis. However, hub-  
and-spoke airlines quickly realized that this approach was not capturing the full potential  
revenue from their systems.  
Because of the need to work within existing reservation systems, the airlines generally  
adopted network management by instituting increasingly sophisticated forms of virtual  
nesting, often following the progression implied in Table 10.8. The first step was usually  
some form of ad hoc virtual nesting, under which a few high-value ODFs were mapped into  
higher buckets than their fare classes would imply. At some point, most hub-and-spoke air-  
lines instituted some form of static virtual nesting, under which all ODFs would be mapped  
into buckets on each leg. These mappings would be updated quarterly or monthly based  
on forecasts of future demand and opportunity cost. Finally, many airlines worked to make  
these mappings dynamic — that is, updated frequently for each flight based on bookings  
and cancellations. 268

The transition from leg-based revenue management to network management at the air-  
lines involved more than just new software; the focus of revenue managers also needed to  
change. Under leg-based capacity control, flight controllers were responsible for monitoring  
forecasts and fare class allocations for some set of flights. For example, a flight controller  
for Delta Airlines might be responsible for all flights between the Atlanta hub and cities  
in Florida. As the name implies, flight controllers by and large took a flight-centric view  
of the world, looking to maximize return from their portfolio of flights. When there was  
a significant amount of connecting traffic, this flight-based approach could not maximize

Network management required a realignment of responsibilities. Now, there is no indi-  
vidual forecast for, say, M-Class bookings on a particular Atlanta-to-Orlando flight. Rather,  
the Atlanta-to-Orlando flight has 20 or so buckets. Each of those buckets can contain de-  
mand from hundreds of different ODFs. Thus, one bucket might include Detroit-Atlanta-  
Orlando Y-Class demand, Atlanta-Orlando B-Class demand, Denver-Atlanta-Orlando  
Y-Class demand, and so on. Furthermore, depending on demand dynamics, the mapping  
of ODFs to buckets might change weekly or even daily on the same flight. In essence, it  
is virtually impossible for a controller to manage forecasts and bucket availabilities on a  
flight basis. Instead, under network management the focus of the revenue management  
organization needs to shift from flights \(or resources\) to products. Instead of a flight con-  
troller focused on Atlanta-to-Florida flights, there might be a market manager focused on  
destination-Florida markets. The focus of this market manager would be on understanding  
the market from all domestic origins to Florida. She would be expected to ensure that all  
inbound forecasts to Florida incorporate the latest market intelligence. For example, each  
year she would be expected to know the academic schedule for colleges in the Northeast to  
ensure that the Fort Lauderdale destination forecasts included spring break demand.  
Unlike the airlines, hotels and rental car companies incorporated network management  
into their revenue management systems right from the start. This was not due to superior  
technical sophistication on their part but simply to the fact that capacity allocation on a  
single-resource basis did not work. In fact, early experiments adapting existing leg-based  
airline revenue management systems to work for hotels were disastrous. The first success-  
ful hotel revenue management systems, such as those for Marriott and Hyatt, and the first  
successful rental car systems, such as those built for Hertz and National, all incorporate  
length-of-stay or length-of-rental control.  
Network management is on the cutting edge of pricing and revenue optimization prac-  
tice. Existing systems and approaches are a compromise between what is theoretically network management 269  
correct and what is practical. The need to work with preexisting reservation systems and  
to respond quickly to market changes means that the use of heuristics, ad hoc solutions,  
and good-enough algorithms are commonplace. Research into better algorithms and ap-  
proaches to network revenue management continues. A topic of particular research interest  
is incorporating consumer choice into network management.  
Finally, it should be noted that the success of discount airlines means that the traditional  
hub-and-spoke airlines are being forced to move from a capacity control environment to  
a dynamic pricing environment. In this environment, the key decision is not which fare  
classes should be open or closed at any time, but what prices should be on offer for each  
product. This requires somewhat new approaches, but the basic idea that capacity should  
never be sold for a fare lower than its opportunity cost is still valid.  
10.6 SUMMARY

Network management is an issue for any revenue management company that sells  
products consisting of a combination of two or more of the resources it controls.  
Examples include airlines that offer connecting services, hotels renting rooms for  
multiple nights, and passenger trains offering tickets that include multiple legs. Net-  
work revenue management is important for hub-and-spoke airlines, hotels, rental  
car companies, passenger trains, and freight transportation providers. It is generally  
not important for cruise lines, event ticketing, and point-to-point airlines.  
A key challenge in network management is the size and complexity of the problem. A  
large hub-and-spoke network may have millions of product – fare class combinations  
it needs to manage for future departures. The size and complexity of the problem is a  
major consideration in implementing solutions.  
Ordering all ODFs by total fare and setting capacity limits on that basis is called the  
greedy heuristic for network management. It does not work well when more than one  
resource is constrained and is not used in practice.  
• linear programming can be used to determine the optimal allocation of products to  
buckets when demand is deterministic. In real-world applications, linear program-  
ming formulations need to be modified to account for demand uncertainty.  
Most real-world network management systems use some form of virtual nesting.  
Under virtual nesting, a set of buckets \(analogous to fare classes\) is established for  
each resource. When a request for an ODF is received, it is mapped into buckets on  
each constituent resource using a predetermined indexing scheme. If each of these  
buckets has sufficient availability, the request is accepted; otherwise it is rejected.  
Different ways of defining and updating the indexing will lead to different virtual  
nesting approaches.  
Pure bid price control is based on establishing and updating a bid price for each re-  
source. The bid price for a resource is the minimum fare that would be accepted for  
selling a unit of that resource. It is equivalent to the opportunity cost for a resource. 270

•  
A booking request for an ODF is accepted only if its associated fare is greater than  
the sum of the bid prices on all constituent resources and there is sufficient remain-  
ing capacity in each resource to accommodate the request.  
While pure bid price control is conceptually appealing, it is not widely used in prac-  
tice since it would require very frequent reoptimization to be robust. Furthermore, it  
requires extensive \(and expensive\) modification of the reservation systems on which  
most revenue management companies rely.  
Dynamic virtual nesting is a combination of bid pricing with virtual nesting. Bid  
prices are recalculated frequently during the booking period for a product. The new  
bid prices are then used to define a new indexing, at which point bucket availabilities  
also need to be updated.  
Network management was incorporated into the revenue management programs  
for hotels and rental car companies from the beginning. Most airlines, on the other  
hand, initially managed capacity on a leg-by-leg basis and then introduced network  
management, often by way of increasingly sophisticated and dynamic virtual nesting  
approaches. The transition from leg-based management to network management  
required organizational and business process changes as well as software system  
changes.

is noted in Simpson 1989 and Phillips 1994. The relationship between the dual variables of  
a linear program and the opportunity costs of the associated constraints and the derivation  
of the dual linear program are discussed in most textbooks on linear programming, such as  
Luenberger and Ye 2008.  
Regarding individual companies that implemented network revenue management  
systems, Marriott’s experience is discussed in Robert Cross’s book Revenue Management

fare class? \(Remember that every combination of possible boarding and deboarding  
stations defines a different product.\)  
Consider an airline with a single hub in the Midwest. Ten flights arrive from cities

3\. 4. 5. The airline offering the flights and fares shown in Table 10.4 decides to raise the  
San Francisco – to – St. Louis discount fare from \$170 to \$225. It estimates that  
discount demand at this new fare will be 20. Given that all other fares and demands  
remain the same, what is the new optimal set of allocations and total revenue for  
the network?  
In Example 10.1, determine which bookings would be accepted using the greedy  
heuristic and the corresponding system revenue. What was the percentage improve-  
ment in revenue from optimizing the network?  
CU Airlines operates two flights, one from New York to Phoenix and another one  
from Phoenix to San Francisco. It sells a full fare and a discount fare for each leg,  
and a single fare for the combined leg from New York to San Francisco. The airline  
has assigned a 120-seat aircraft for the first flight and a 100-seat aircraft for the  
second flight. The demand for each fare is assumed to be random and normally dis-  
tributed. The fares and demands for these flights are shown in the following table.  
Number ODF Fare Demand mean Demand std. dev.  
1 NYC-PHX full fare \$300 30 6  
2 NYC-PHX discount fare \$200 70 20  
3 PHX-SFO full fare \$250 20 5  
4 PHX-SFO discount fare \$150 50 15  
5 NYC-SFO fare \$300 40 15  
a. b. Formulate the problem as a deterministic network linear program using the  
means. What is the optimal allocation and revenue?  
To incorporate the uncertainty of demands, the chief science officer wants you to  
use virtual nests for each leg. For each flight, you will have three buckets — one  
for each ODF. The average contribution to each flight from the NYC-SFO fare is  
distributed proportionally according to the discount fares for each flight. How  
would you set the buckets for each flight? Use EMSR-b to calculate the protec-  
tion levels for each bucket on each flight. How do the protection levels compare  
to the allocation you obtained in part a?notes  
1\. This is not strictly true. The theater might still be able to gain additional revenue by  
considering the possibility of diversion from, say, weekend performances to weeknights in  
its pricing, as described in Section 7.6.4.  
2\. Customers can book individual flight legs on EasyJet that they can treat as connect-  
ing flights \(e.g., they can book a flight from London to Rome and a flight three hours after  
the Rome arrival to Athens if they wish\), but this is different from booking a connecting  
flight from London to Athens via Rome, since EasyJet cannot manage availability for such  
customers based on true origin and destination. As discussed in this chapter, the eco-  
nomics of offering connecting flights are so compelling that a number of airlines such as  
Southwest and Ryanair that initially allowed only single-flight bookings have since begun  
to offer connecting services.  
3\. This does not mean that network revenue management never plays a role in these  
industries. For example, cruises may have multiple stops that allow passengers to board  
and depart at different ports. And baseball teams may offer package deals for groups of  
games. In both cases, the seller is offering a product using different resources, and net-  
work management may come into play.  
4\. This is standard terminology. However, it can be misleading, since the real unit be-  
ing managed is itinerary fare class, not origin-destination fare class. An M-Class passenger  
traveling from San Francisco to Denver on Flight 18 at 8 a.m. is in a different ODF than  
an M-Class passenger traveling from San Francisco to Denver on Flight 21 at 9 a.m., even  
though they share the same origin, destination, and fare class.  
5\. The highest nightly rate offered by a hotel is called the rack rate.  
6\. Recall that heuristic refers to an approach to an optimization problem that generates  
a solution that is not guaranteed to be optimal.  
7\. This requires that all of the fare classes for a product have different fares.  
8\. As with single-leg capacity allocation, this property holds true when demands are  
uncertain and independent but may not hold with dependent demands.  
9\. In Example 10.5, we assume for simplicity that the buckets on each leg are the same,  
but this does not need to be true in general.  
10\. Static virtual nesting is sometimes called displacement-adjusted virtual nesting, or  
DAVN.  
11\. The exception is when an ODF fare changes\: in this case, the airline would recalcu-  
late the net leg fares for that ODF based on the new fare and update the indexing scheme  
accordingly.  
12\. Note that multiunit bookings are much more of an issue for airlines than for many  
other revenue management companies. The vast majority of car rental bookings and hotel  
bookings are for a single car and a single room, respectively, and the issue of managing  
multiunit bookings is accordingly much less important in these industries.  
13\. In general, additional revenue is a concave function of additional capacity—that is,  
the additional revenue from adding n seats will be less than n times the bid price for n \> 1. 11 OverbOOking  
Overbooking occurs whenever a seller with constrained capacity sells more units than he  
has available \(or believes he will have available\). The reason that sellers engage in such a  
seemingly nefarious practice is to protect themselves against no-shows and cancellations.  
A cancellation is defined as a booking that a customer terminates by notifying the seller at  
some point prior to the service date. A no-show occurs when a buyer with a booking does  
not cancel but simply fails to show up.  
American Airlines estimated that about 50% of its reservations resulted in either a can-  
cellation or a no-show \(Smith, Leimkuhler, and Darrow 1992\). Without overbooking,  
many of these cancellations and all of the no-shows would result in an empty seat — even  
when there are other customers willing to fly. In this situation, overbooking becomes criti-  
cal. Consider a flight with 100 seats that consistently faces demand much higher than 100.  
Assume that customers have a 13% no-show rate. If the airline never overbooks, it will, on  
average, leave with 13 empty seats on every flight while denying reservations to customers  
who want to fly. This would be an enormous waste. The airline would be in the same situa-  
tion as a manufacturer who had a plant that could only run at 87% of capacity. Without the  
ability to overbook, not only would the airline lose potential revenue; it would be paying to  
purchase, maintain, and support huge amounts of useless capacity.  
No-shows and cancellations are not only an airline issue; they are a feature of any service  
industry in which bookings can be canceled \(or not honored\) without penalty or where  
the penalty is small relative to the opportunity cost of the resource booked. Primary care  
medical appointments, for example, typically have a no-show rate of 15 –20% in the United  
States, and accordingly, most clinics overbook. And, of course, many of the usual revenue  
management industries such as hotels, rental cars, and freight transportation face similar  
issues. In all of these industries, overbooking is used as a way to improve capacity utilization  
in the face of cancellations and no-shows.  
The literal-minded might argue that overbooking is not really part of pricing and rev-  
enue optimization because it does not directly affect price. However, overbooking is in-  
extricably intertwined with capacity allocation\: to determine how many seats to offer to  
different booking classes on a flight, we certainly need to know how many seats we will be 274  
overbooking  
offering in total. For that reason, it is generally considered to be an integral part of revenue  
management, and we treat it as such.  
This chapter starts by giving a short history of overbooking. It then characterizes indus-  
tries in which overbooking is used and introduces four different approaches to overbook-  
ing\: a deterministic heuristic, risk-based policies, service-level policies, and hybrid policies.  
We see how booking limits can be determined under each policy in the case of a single price  
and an uncertain level of no-shows. We then examine a data-driven approach to overbook-  
ing similar to the data-driven approach to capacity allocation in Section 9.4. We consider  
dynamic overbooking in the face of cancellations and multiple fare classes. Finally, we look  
at some extensions to the basic problem and some alternatives to overbooking for manag-  
ing cancellations and no-shows.  
11.1 BACKGROUND  
11.1.1 History of Overbooking  
Overbooking is closely identified with the passenger airline industry \(particularly by any-  
one who has had the experience of being denied a seat on an overbooked flight\). From the  
earliest days of commercial aviation in the United States, airlines adopted the policy that  
a customer with a reservation could cancel at any time before departure without paying a  
penalty and that a customer who had purchased a ticket for a flight would not be penalized  
if she did not show up for that flight. As a result, an airline ticket was like money in that it  
could be used at full face value for a future flight or redeemed for cash. \(This policy should  
be contrasted with Broadway shows, opera, and rock concerts, where unused tickets are  
generally not refundable.\) This raised a problem for the airlines —how many passengers  
should they allow to book on each flight? If they limited bookings to the capacity of a flight,  
many fully booked flights would leave with empty seats. As mentioned, American Airlines  
estimated in 1990 that about 15% of the seats on sold-out flights would be empty because  
of no-shows and cancellations if they only booked up to capacity \(Smith, Leimkuhler, and  
Darrow 1992\).  
By the 1960s, no-shows were becoming a major problem. According to Kalyan Talluri  
and Garrett van Ryzin, “In 1961, the Civil Aeronautics Board \(CAB\) reported a no-show  
rate of 1 out of every 10 passengers booked among the 12 leading carriers. . . . The CAB  
acknowledged that this situation created real economic problems for the airlines” \(2004b,  
131\). As a result, the airlines were allowed to overbook. This was effective in increasing  
loads but, predictably, meant some passengers were refused boarding on a flight for which  
they held a ticket — so-called denied boardings \(DBs\). When a flight was oversold — that is,  
the number of passengers showing up exceeded the seats on the flight — the airline would  
pick customers to bump, that is, rebook on a later flight. If the flight was much later, the  
bumped passengers were provided with a meal; if it was the next day, they were provided  
with overnight accommodation. In addition, the airline paid a penalty to each bumped  
passenger. At one point this penalty was equal to 100% of ticket value. When a passenger  
is bumped against her will, it is known as an involuntary denied boarding. In 1966, the Civil overbooking 275  
Aeronautics Board estimated that the involuntary denied-boarding rate was about 7.7 per  
10,000 boarded passengers.1  
Because airlines needed to overbook to remain financially viable, the practice became  
universal. The risk of being bumped from an oversold flight was seen by consumers as yet  
one more irritating aspect of flying, along with delayed flights and lost luggage. However,  
the airlines were reluctant to own up to overbooking. In the 1960s, flight controllers at  
American Airlines recognized that overbooking was critical to financial performance. They  
continued to overbook despite periodically reassuring senior management that they were  
not doing so. When denied boardings occurred, the flight controllers blamed them on “sys-  
tem error.”2 Airline overbooking continued largely without constraints until 1972, when  
Ralph Nader was denied a boarding on an Allegheny Airlines flight. Nader sued and won a  
judgment of \$25,000 based on the fact that Allegheny did not inform customers that they  
might be bumped against their will. Following this judgment, the Civil Aeronautics Board  
ruled that airlines must inform their customers that they engage in overbooking.  
In the late 1970s, following a suggestion by economist Julian Simon \(1968\), the airlines  
began to experiment with a voluntary denied-boarding policy. In Simon’s vision, the airlines  
would conduct a sealed-bid reverse auction to find enough passengers willing to be bumped  
at different levels of compensation. While the airlines initially objected that such an auction  
would be impractical, ultimately, they adopted a variant of Simon’s scheme, in which an  
overbooked airline asks for volunteers to be bumped in return for compensation \(usually a  
voucher for future travel\). If enough volunteers are not found, the compensation level may  
be increased once or twice. If enough volunteers are still not found, the airline will choose  
which additional passengers to bump. The volunteers are termed voluntary denied board-  
ings and those chosen by the airline involuntary denied boardings. This approach to over-  
booking has been successful, both from the point of view of the customers and from the  
point of view of airlines. Airline research shows that voluntary denied boardings are often  
happy to get bumped in return for compensation. Not only has it made customers happier;  
the volunteer policy has resulted in a drastic drop in the involuntary denied-boarding rate  
for major US airlines — from 7.7 in 10,000 passengers in 1985 to 0.13 per 10,000 in the  
third quarter of 2018. In fact, involuntary denied boardings have become almost extinct at  
some airlines —Delta managed to board over 37 million passengers in the third quarter of  
2018 without a single involuntary denied boarding. On the other hand, voluntary denied  
boardings have increased substantially from a rate of about 20 per 10,000 in 1995 to 43.5  
per 10,000 in the third quarter of 2018.  
Overbooking is also practiced by hotels and rental car companies, although statistics  
on its prevalence are hard to come by, since, unlike the airlines, other industries are not  
required to report statistics on denied service. The typical hotel practice is to find accom-  
modations for a bumped guest at a nearby property — preferably one in the same chain.  
Compensation such as a discount coupon for a future stay is sometimes \(but not always\)  
offered. In many cases, there is no consistent policy across a chain or group of hotels, and  
reimbursement policies are determined by each property manager. A rental car overbook-  
ing is usually experienced by the customer as a wait — a customer who arrives to find no  
car available needs to wait until a car is returned, cleaned, and refueled. In rare situations, 276  
overbooking  
a location may be so overbooked that there is no prospect of a car for every customer. In  
this case, the manager will either send booked customers to competitors or move cars from  
another location if possible to satisfy the additional demand. Again, compensation in the  
form of a discount coupon may or may not be offered, depending on the situation and  
company policy.  
11.1.2 When Is Overbooking Applicable?  
Overbooking is applicable in industries with all the following three characteristics.  
•  
•  
Capacity \(or supply\) is constrained and perishable, and bookings are accepted for  
use of future capacity.  
Customers are allowed to cancel or not show.  
•  
The cost of denying service to a customer with a booking is relatively low.  
It should be understood that the cost of denied service includes intangible elements, such as  
customer ill will and future lost business, as well as any direct compensation, as discussed  
in Section 11.1.3. If the total denied-service cost is sufficiently high, it is not in the seller’s  
interest to overbook, since the cost of denying service will overwhelm any potential revenue  
gain. For example, airlines would be unlikely to overbook at all if they had to pay a million  
dollars to every denied boarding.  
The three characteristics just listed are the classic requirements for overbooking. Un-  
der these circumstances, companies overbook to hedge against the possibility of excessive  
cancellations or no-shows. However, there is another situation in which overbooking may  
come into play —when the amount of capacity that will be available is uncertain. Both ho-  
tels and rental car companies face this issue because of the risk of overstays and understays\:  
Customers may stay longer or depart earlier than their reservations specify. If 10 customers  
depart early, then a hotel will have 10 additional empty rooms the next night. If it booked  
only to expected capacity, these rooms would go empty, even in the absence of no-shows  
or cancellations.  
Television broadcasters also face a problem of uncertain capacity. Broadcasters in the  
United States sell the vast majority of their capacity for the season starting in September  
during the upfront market during the previous May. Each buyer is sold a schedule of slots  
and guaranteed a certain number of impressions \(“eyeballs”\) by the broadcaster. If the  
schedule sold delivers the guaranteed number of impressions \(or more\), then that is the  
end of the matter. But if the schedule does not deliver the guaranteed number of impres-  
sions, the broadcaster needs to supply the advertiser with additional slots until the guar-  
antee is met — a practice known as gapping. But the broadcaster does not know in advance  
how many people will actually watch a particular show. A new show may be an unexpected  
dud or an unexpected hit. This is similar to the airline overbooking problem, with the dif-  
ference that the broadcaster knows the demand he must meet but is unsure what the supply  
\(impressions\) will be.3  
Cruise lines and resort hotels generally avoid overbooking. In these industries, the cost  
of denied service is simply too high. A couple who arrives at the dock with all their luggage overbooking 277

Overbooking in different industries

­ additional compensation  
Rental cars High Wait or reaccommodation at other companies  
Air freight High Reaccommodation on a later flight

Medium Back-order or delay delivery

Cruise lines Low Typically do not overbook  
Resort hotels Low Typically do not overbook  
Sporting events,  
Low Nonrefundable tickets with very little overbooking  
­ concerts, and shows  
for a two-week cruise is unlikely to be easily mollified when they find out they will not be  
able to board because the cruise is overbooked. Instead of overbooking, cruise lines and  
resort hotels manage the risks of cancellations and no-shows by a combination of nonre-  
fundable deposits and higher prices.4 Most industries that sell nonrefundable bookings \(or  
tickets\) do not overbook. Theater tickets and tickets to sporting events are examples. In this  
case, the risk to the customer of purchasing a ticket is mitigated by the fact that bookings in  
these industries are transferable to others —unlike airline tickets.  
Table 11.1 shows the relative importance of overbooking in various revenue manage-  
ment industries. It can be argued that overbooking has had the greatest financial impact  
of any aspect of passenger airline revenue management. For example, American Airlines  
estimated that it achieved benefits of \$225 million in 1990 from overbooking \(Smith, Leim-  
kuhler, and Darrow 1992\)— more than from any other element of its revenue manage-  
ment program, including capacity allocation and network management. Overbooking is  
important for hotels and rental car companies, both of which face uncertain supply \(due to  
overstays and understays\) as well as no-shows and cancellations. It is also quite important  
for air freight, where no-shows and cancellations are commonplace.  
11.1.3 The Cost of Denied Service  
A key consideration in setting an overbooking limit — and indeed in whether to overbook  
at all— is the cost of denied service. This cost varies from industry to industry and depends  
on how customers who are denied service are treated. This varies from industry to industry  
and from company to company within an industry. A broadcaster that cannot meet the  
number of impressions he has guaranteed to an advertiser needs to provide additional ad-  
vertising spots until he has fulfilled the guarantee. A rental car outlet that does not have a  
car available when a booked customer arrives must either ask the customer to wait until a  
car is available or provide a vehicle from a competing company.  
In the passenger airline industry, the cost of denied service is called denied-boarding cost.  
In the United States, the treatment of overbooked passengers is regulated by the Department  
of Transportation. As of July 2004, the DOT requires that an airline with an ­ overbooked 278  
overbooking  
flight first seek customers willing to take a later flight in return for compensation. As noted  
previously, airlines will typically increase the compensation level one or two times if they  
cannot find enough volunteers at the initial level. For these volunteers, the denied-boarding  
cost is simply the amount of compensation that the airline provides. If the airline cannot  
find enough volunteers, it will need to bump one or more passengers \(i.e., take some invol-  
untary denied boardings\). In the United States, the Department of Transportation has speci-  
fied minimum compensation that must be provided to each passenger who is involuntarily  
denied a boarding. As of July 2020, each person involuntarily denied boarding must be  
provided an alternative ticket to the destination plus additional compensation as follows\:5  
•  
•  
•  
If the arrival delay is less than one hour\: no compensation  
If the arrival delay is between one and two hours\: 200% of one-way fare, with maxi-  
mum of \$675  
If the arrival delay is more than two hours\: 400% of one-way fare, with maximum of  
\$1,350  
These rules do not apply to charter flights, scheduled flights with planes that hold 30 or  
fewer passengers, when an airline has substituted a smaller plane for the one it originally  
planned to use, or when an aircraft needs to shed weight to meet weight and balance con-  
straints. The rules are also minimum guidelines — the airlines are free to pay additional  
compensation if they so choose. Usually, the only additional compensation the airlines pro-  
vide is meal vouchers if the delay is more than two hours, and a hotel voucher if the bumped  
passenger is accommodated on a flight that leaves the next day.  
The airlines are unusual in that several governments have mandated a procedure and  
compensation level for bumping passengers. Companies in other industries are generally  
free to deal with denied-service situations as they see fit. However, denied-service cost in all  
cases includes one or more of four components\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
The direct cost of the compensation to the bumped passenger — this could be a cer-  
tificate for future travel or a future hotel room night.  
The provision cost of meals and /or lodging provided to a bumped passenger.  
The reaccommodation cost of a customer who is denied service. For an airline, this  
is the cost of putting the customer on another flight to the same destination; for a  
hotel, it is the cost of alternative accommodation for the night.  
The ill-will cost from denying service. This may be hard to calculate but is usually an  
estimate of the expected lost future business from the bumped customer.6  
Denied-service cost will vary depending on the situation. For a passenger airline, bump-  
ing a passenger from the last flight of the day will usually incur the additional cost of lodg-  
ing her overnight. Reaccommodation cost for an airline depends on whether the bumped  
passenger is rebooked on one of its own flights or on a competing airline’s flight. Of course,  
the ill-will cost for a voluntary denied boarding is much less than for an involuntary denied  
boarding — in fact, in many cases, a volunteer has been happy to have the opportunity to overbooking 279  
take a later flight in return for a flight voucher — perhaps resulting in a goodwill benefit  
\(although airlines do not consider such benefits in their overbooking calculations.\) The  
relatively low cost of voluntary denied boardings has led to their proliferation — as noted  
above, the voluntary denied-boarding rate among US major carriers was 43.5 per 10,000  
customers in the third quarter of 2018 as opposed to a total denied-boarding \(all involun-  
tary\) rate of 7.7 per 10,000 customers in 1985.  
11.1.4 A Model of Customer Booking  
To describe and compare different approaches to overbooking, we initially use the follow-  
ing simple model of booking dynamics.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
A supplier plans to accept bookings for a fixed capacity, C.  
The supplier sets a booking limit b before any bookings arrive.  
The supplier continues to accept bookings as long as total bookings are less than the  
limit b. Once the limit is reached \(if it ever is\), the supplier stops accepting bookings.  
At the time of service \(e.g., the departure time for a flight\), customers arrive. Booked  
customers who arrive are called shows; those who fail to show are called no-shows.  
Each show pays a price of p.  
The supplier can accommodate up to C of the shows. If the number of shows is less  
than or equal to C, they are all accommodated. If the number of shows exceeds C,  
exactly C of the shows will be served, and the rest will be denied service. Shows that  
are denied service are each paid denied-service compensation of D \> p.  
7  
The supplier’s problem is to determine the total number of bookings to accept. We call this  
number the booking limit and denote it by b.  
This model is rich enough to illustrate the fundamental trade-offs and algorithms used  
to determine the total booking limit. However, it makes three heroic assumptions that are  
relaxed in later sections.  
•  
•  
•  
The model ignores cancellations by calculating the booking limit based entirely on  
no-shows. This makes the booking limit easier to calculate. Furthermore, it means  
that the booking limit b can be static — that is, it does not need to change over the  
booking period. If bookings can cancel prior to departure, then the optimal booking  
limit is likely to change over time as departure approaches. Section 11.7.1 addresses  
the calculation of dynamic booking limits.  
The model assumes that each customer will pay the same price p. However, as  
described in Chapter 9, airlines, hotels, and rental car companies all offer different  
prices for the same unit of capacity. This can significantly complicate the calculation  
of the optimal total booking limit. Section 11.7.2 addresses overbooking with multi-  
ple fare classes.  
The model assumes that only those customers who arrive \(i.e., the shows\) pay. Book-  
ings themselves are costless. This is the historic airline, hotel, air freight, and rental 280  
overbooking  
car situation, in which bookings could be canceled without penalty and tickets were  
fully refundable. However, many of these industries are moving all or partway to-  
ward nonrefundable or partially refundable prices. Section 11.7.3 addresses the effect  
of nonrefundable or partially refundable prices.  
11.2 APPROACHES TO OVERBOOKING  
Once a company decides it is going to overbook, it needs to decide what it wants to achieve  
with its overbooking policy and how it is going to achieve it. Most companies follow one  
of four approaches\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
A simple deterministic heuristic that calculates a booking limit based only on capacity  
and expected no-show rate  
A risk-based policy that involves estimating the costs of denied service and weigh-  
ing those costs against the potential revenue to determine the booking levels that  
maximize expected total revenue minus expected overbooking costs. A risk-based  
booking limit can either be calculated by explicit optimization or using a data-driven  
approach. We look at both approaches.  
A service-level policy that involves managing to a specific target — for example, tar-  
geting no more than one instance of denied service for every 5,000 shows  
A hybrid policy in which risk-based limits are calculated but constrained by service-  
level limits  
The different policies are closely analogous to the different replenishment policies fol-  
lowed by different retailers. Some stores set their replenishment levels so as to ensure that  
stockouts do not exceed a certain frequency\: a service-level policy. Others specifically trade  
off the cost of a potential stockout with the cost of holding more inventory to determine  
the replenishment level that maximizes expected profit\: a risk-based policy. Just as retail-  
ers differ in their stocking policy, so do companies differ in their overbooking policies. For  
example, at one point, the Hertz rental car company used a risk-based policy to set total  
booking limits \(Carroll and Grimes 1996\), while National Car Rental used a service-level  
policy \(Geraghty and Johnson 1997\). Sections 11.3 –11.6 describe each of these four ways  
to calculate a total booking limit using the model of customer booking described in Sec-  
tion 11.1.4.  
11.3 A DETERMINISTIC HEURISTIC  
A hotel has observed that its historic show rate has averaged 85%. Furthermore, this rate has  
been consistent over time. A reasonable policy might be for the hotel to set its total booking  
limit b so that if it sells b rooms and experiences the average show rate, it will fill exactly C  
rooms. That is, it would set b such that C = 0.85b, or b = C/0.85.  
This approach to calculating a total booking limit can be written as b = C/ρ, where C is  
capacity and ρ is the show rate. Despite its simplicity, the deterministic heuristic turns out overbooking 281  
to be a reasonable approximation to the optimal booking limit in many cases. It is still used  
to calculate overbooking limits by many companies in cases in which the cost of denied \(or  
delayed\) service is unclear \(for example, medical clinics\).  
Example 11.1  
For a hotel with 250 rooms and an expected show rate of 85%, the determinis-  
tic heuristic gives a booking limit of 250/0.85 = 294 rooms.  
Note that applying this approach does not mean that the hotel will be overbooked 15% of  
the time or that 15% of bookings will experience an overbooking.  
11.4 RISK-BASED POLICIES  
The deterministic heuristic described in the previous section is certainly simple to calculate,  
but it obviously does not consider the relative costs of an additional customer versus denied  
service. Under a risk-based policy, the booking limit is set by balancing the expected cost of  
denied service with the potential additional contribution from more sales. The first step in  
calculating a risk-based booking limit is to specify the objective function.  
11.4.1 The Risk-Based Objective Function  
Denote the number of passengers who show up at departure by s. The number of shows is  
a random variable that depends on both the booking limit and the total demand for book-  
ings. Since each show pays price p, total revenue is p  s. If shows exceed capacity, then the  
supplier must deny service to s – C customers. Each customer denied service results in a  
denied-boarding cost of D. For the moment, we assume that this denied-boarding cost is  
the same for each passenger, which means that denied boardings are either all voluntary or  
all involuntary. The total denied-boarding cost is 0 if s ≤ C and is D\(s – C\) if s \> C. The net  
revenue is then  
R = ps – D\(s – C\)+  
. \(11.1\)  
\(Recall that \(s – C\)+ denotes the maximum of s – C and 0.\) A company pursuing a risk-  
based policy wants to set its booking limit so as to maximize the expected value of net  
revenue as defined in Equation 11.1, where the number of shows is a random variable that  
depends on the booking limit, which the company can choose.  
Total revenue as a function of the number of shows is plotted in Figure 11.1. Revenue  
increases linearly until the capacity limit is reached, at which point it begins to decrease.  
Two things are apparent immediately from Figure 11.1. First, the number of shows will  
always be less than or equal to the booking limit, so it is never optimal to set the booking  
limit less than the capacity. Thus, we know that the optimal booking limit b\* must satisfy  
b\* ≥ C. Second, if the price is higher than the denied-boarding cost \(that is, p \> D\), net rev-  
enue would continue to increase even when shows exceed the booking limit. In this case,  
the seller should accept every booking and set b\* =   
. Since this case is not very realistic,  
we assume that D \> p. 282

Figure 11.1 Net revenue as a function of shows.  
Calculating the optimal risk-based booking limit is complicated by the fact that the  
number of shows is a function of three different factors\:  
•  
•  
•  
The booking limit b  
The total demand for bookings, d  
The number of bookings that ultimately show, s  
We are interested in the number of bookings at departure, which we denote by bD. Bookings  
at departure is the minimum of the booking limit and the demand for bookings — that is,  
bD = min\(d, b\). The total number of shows is the number of bookings at departure minus  
no-shows — that is, s = bD – x, where x denotes the number of no-shows. We denote the  
show rate, ρ, as the fraction of bookings at departure we anticipate will show — that is,  
ρ = E\[s/bD\]—while the no-show rate is the fraction of bookings at departure we antici-  
pate will not show — that is, 1 – ρ. Airline no-show rates typically range between 10% and  
20% for major airlines; however, there is significant variation. In general, international and  
transcontinental flights have much lower no-show rates than do shorter domestic flights.  
Bad weather can cause no-show rates to soar to 30% or more. Resort hotels tend to experi-  
ence lower no-show rates than business hotels, and cruise lines have very low no-show rates.  
11.4.2 Modeling Shows  
Risk-based models of overbooking all require a probabilistic representation of no-show be-  
havior. The simplest assumption is that each booking has an identical probability, 0 \< ρ ≤ 1,  
of showing and that show decisions are independent. Then the number of shows given n  
bookings follows a binomial distribution.  
8 Let g\(s|b\) be the probability of s shows given a  
booking limit of b —which also means b bookings at departure. Then  
g\(s|b\) = \(b  
s \) ρs\(1 – ρ\)b – s  
for s = 0, 1, . . . , n. \(11.2\) overbooking 283

with mean E\[\(s|b\)\] = ρb and variance var\[\(s|b\)\] = ρ\(1 – ρ\)b. Under these assumptions, the  
number of no-shows x will also follow a binomial distribution with parameters 1 – ρ and b.  
More information on the binomial distribution can be found in Appendix B.  
The density function of shows is given in panel A of Figure 11.2 for n = 120 bookings  
and show rates of 80%, 90%, and 95%. Panel B of Figure 11.2 gives the corresponding  
cumulative distributions. Each cumulative distribution shows the probability that shows  
will be less than x, given 120 total bookings. This can be interpreted as the probability that  
a flight with x seats will be overbooked if it has 120 bookings at departure, given differ-  
ent no-show rates. Panel A shows that both the mean and the standard deviation of the  
number of shows depend on the show rate. The mean number of shows is the show rate  
times the number of bookings\: 96, 108, and 114 for show rates of 80%, 90%, and 95%,  
respectively.  
Notice that the bulk of the probability on shows for any show rate between 80% and  
95% lies between 80 and 110 when there are 120 bookings at departure. Thus, for a show  
rate of 80%, it is almost certain \(a 99.97% chance, to be exact\) that the number of shows  
will be between 80 and 110. We can use panel B of Figure 11.2 to estimate the probability  
that we will not have an oversold flight if we have 120 bookings at departure for aircraft with  
different seating capacities. As shown, if we have 120 bookings for a flight with 100 seats, we  
will almost certainly have at least 1 denied boarding if our show rate is 90% or 95%. On the  
other hand, we will only have about an 8% chance of being oversold if the show rate is 80%.  
These types of relationships are critical in determining the optimal booking limit.  
11.4.3 A Simple Risk-Based Booking Limit  
The decision tree approach can be used to derive the conditions for an optimal total book-  
ing limit in a fashion similar to the way it is used to derive the condition for an optimal pro-  
tection level in Section 9.1.1. Recall that capacity is C, the price is p, and the denied-service 284

cost is D, with D \> p. We define F \(b\) as the probability that bookings will be less than or  
equal to b, and \(s|b\) as the number of shows given that bookings are b.  
Figure 11.3 illustrates how the overbooking decision in this case can be illustrated as  
a decision tree in a format similar to the capacity allocation decision tree in Figure 9.1.  
Here, the decision is whether to increase the booking limit from b to b + 1. If the book-  
ing limit is increased but there is no additional booking, then there is no change in total  
revenue — this is the lowest branch on the tree. If there is an additional booking that no-  
shows, then there is also no change in total revenue — this is the top branch on the tree.  
If the booking shows, there are two possibilities\: if shows given b are less than C, then the  
additional booking will result in an additional fare p, and if shows given b are greater than  
or equal to C, then the additional booking will result in a fare minus the denied-boarding  
cost, or p − D. Rolling back the decision tree and setting the marginal cost to zero gives the  
optimality condition  
p  
s b C  
Pr\{\( | \*\) \} =  
≥ ,  
D \(11.3\)  
where b\* is the optimal risk-based booking limit.  
The condition in Equation 11.3 is formulated as an equality, but because the booking  
limit is discrete, it is unlikely that there is a value of b for which Equation 11.3 holds exactly.  
A way to account for the discrete nature of the booking limit is to start with the case when  
the booking limit is set to capacity — that is, b = C— and then sequentially increase the  
booking limit by increments of one seat. Assume that we increase the booking limit by one  
seat so that b = C + 1. Let us assume that demand is very high relative to capacity, so that  
we will always receive another booking when we increase the booking limit by one. If this  
booking does not show —which will happen with probability 1 – ρ— there is no impact on  
revenue at all. If the booking does show —which happens with probability ρ— there are  
two possibilities. The first possibility is that all C of the other bookings show, in which case  
we have a denied boarding with associated cost p – D. The second possibility is that at least  
one of the C bookings does not show, in which case we can accommodate the new book-  
ing and gain a payment of p. Note that the probability that all C of the initial bookings will overbooking 285  
show is equal to ρC, and thus the expected change in revenue from increasing the booking  
limit from C to C + 1 is  
R\(C, C + 1\) = ρ\[\(1 – ρC\)p – ρC \(p – D\)\] = ρ\(p – ρC D\)  
Here, R\(C, C + 1\) denotes the expected total revenue change from changing the booking  
limit from C to C + 1. Overbooking by at least one seat will increase expected revenue if the  
term on the right side is greater than 0 or, equivalently, if  
p  
C  
\> ρ \(11.4\)  
.  
D  
Example 11.2  
An airplane has 100 seats and a historical show rate of 90% and faces very high  
demand for the flight. The fare is \$250 and the denied-boarding cost is \$500.  
In this case, p  
. = 5 .5 and ρC = .9100 = 0.000027\. Given that condition 11.4 is  
D  
satisfied, it is profitable for the airline to overbook by at least one seat. The in-  
crease in expected revenue from increasing the booking limit from C to C + 1  
is R\(C, C + 1\) = .9  \[\$250 – .000027  \$500\] = \$224.99.  
Example 11.2 illustrates the strong economic incentive for airlines and other sellers with  
constrained capacity to overbook. With a 90% show rate, the probability that a departure  
with 100 seats that is booked to capacity will leave with at least 1 empty seat is 99.997%.  
In this case, the denied-boarding penalty that would be required to make it unprofitable  
for the airline in Example 11.2 to overbook is much larger than the likely actual denied-  
boarding cost \(see Exercise 7\).  
We have seen how to determine if it is profitable to overbook by at least one seat, but the  
question remains of how to find the optimal booking limit — the one that will maximize  
expected revenue. By extending the logic from before, we can write  
R\(b, b + 1\) = ρ\[p – Pr\{\(s|b\) ≥ C\}D\], \(11.5\)  
where R\(b, b + 1\) is the change in expected revenue from increasing the booking limit  
from b to b + 1, Pr\{\(s|b\)  C \} is the probability that the shows given the booking limit b are  
less than the capacity C, and Pr\{\(s|b\) ≥ C \} = Pr\{\(s|b\)  C \} is the probability that the shows  
given the booking limit b are greater than or equal to C.  
We can rearrange Equation 11.5 to derive the relationship  
∆ ⇔ ≥  
R p  
\( 1\) \> 0 Pr\{\( | \) \} \<  
b,b + s b C . \(11.6\)  
D  
That is, expected revenue will always increase as long as the probability that shows are less  
than capacity is less than the ratio of the price to the denied-boarding cost, which means  
that we can start by setting the booking limit equal to capacity and then sequentially in-  
crease the booking limit by one and test against condition 11.6. We stop when increasing  
the booking limit by another seat would lead to a booking limit that violated 11.6. This sug-  
gests the following algorithm for computing the optimal booking limit\: 286  
overbooking

1\. Set b = C.  
2\. 4. Compute Pr\{\(s|b\) ≥ C \}.  
3\. If Pr\{\( | \) \}  
s b C ≥ ≥ p  
, set b\* = b and STOP.  
D  
Otherwise set b ← b + 1 and go to step 2.  
This algorithm will find the booking limit b\* that maximizes expected revenue. It starts by  
setting b = C . For the current value of b, it determines the change in revenue that would  
occur by increasing b by 1. The optimal booking limit is the minimum value of b for which  
increasing it by 1 would lead to a decrease in revenue.  
The results so far can be summarized as follows\: The optimal booking limit when demand  
is much higher than capacity is the smallest value of b for which Pr\{\( | \) \}  
s b C ≥ ≥ p  
, .  
D  
Example 11.3  
Consider a flight with 100 seats, a fare of \$120, and a denied-boarding cost of  
\$300. Then, p/D = 0.4. Assume that the probability that each booking will show  
is .92. Then, Table 11.2 shows the values of Pr\{s|b\}, passenger revenue, expected  
denied boardings, expected denied-boarding costs, and expected net revenue  
for values of the booking limit b from 100 to 109. The optimal booking limit is  
b = 108, which satisfies the condition for an optimal booking limit.  
The only part of the algorithm not yet discussed is the calculation of the probability  
Pr\{\(s|b\) ≥ C\}. For a given value of b, this is the complementary cumulative binomial func-  
tion. Given a booking limit of b, Equation 11.2 gives the probability of s shows for any value  
of s  b. The probability that s is greater than or equal to C for some value of b ≥ C can be  
found by summing the individual probabilities — that is,

for sufficiently large values of b, the cumulative binomial distribution can be approximated  
by the cumulative normal distribution. Specifically, the binomial distribution in Equation  
11.7 has mean ρb and standard deviation ρ ρ \(1 – \)b . Under appropriate conditions, we  
can use the normal approximation\:

   
 

  
ρ ρ \(11.8\)  
\(1 – \)  
b  
  
This is quite convenient since it allows us to use standard normal distribution tables to es-  
timate the probability. However, the approximation is only valid within certain bounds. A  
common rule of thumb is that the approximation in \(11.8\) is only valid if \(1 – ρ\)C \> 9; that  
is, the no-show rate times the capacity is greater than 9. For a departure with 150 seats and  
a typical no-show rate of .1 or so, we would have \(1 – ρ\)C = 15, which meets the criterion.  
For much smaller flights \(or hotels\) or much higher no-show rates, the normal approxima-  
tion may not be valid and tables of the binomial distribution may be needed to calculate  
the overbooking limit.  
Like the two-class booking limit problem discussed in Section 9.1.4, the problem of  
setting a risk-based overbooking limit has a close relationship to the newsvendor problem.  
Recall that the solution to the newsvendor problem requires ordering an amount of inven-  
tory Y so that  
Pr\{demand is greater than or equal to Y\} = U  
,  
U O +  
where U is the underage cost, O is the overage cost, and U/\(U + O\) is the critical fractile or  
critical ratio. In setting a risk-based booking limit b, we are determining how many book-  
ings to order — that is, the total number of bookings to allow. The underage cost is the op-  
portunity cost of an empty seat — that is, p— and the overage cost is the denied-boarding  
fee for a show — that is, D – p. Therefore, the critical ratio is p/D. The event that triggers an  
overage cost is “shows exceeding capacity,” which in our simplified model is Pr\{\(s|b\) ≥ C \}.  
Thus, Equation 11.3 is equivalent to the risk-based model.  
11.4.4 A Risk-Based Model with Demand Uncertainty\*  
To make the approach to overbooking more realistic, we need to consider the fact that the  
demand for a flight is not infinite. In this case, increasing the booking limit from b to b + 1  
will only result in an additional booking if demand is greater than b and the additional book-  
ing shows. Let f \(d \) be the probability that booking demand is exactly equal to d. The cumu-  
lative distribution F\(d \) = f \(1\) + f \(2\) + . . . + f \(d \) is the probability that demand is less than  
¯  
or equal to d, and the complementary cumulative distribution function, F  
\(d \) = 1 – F\(d \) is  
the probability that the demand for bookings is greater than d. If we increase the booking  
¯  
limit from b to b + 1, the probability that we will experience an additional booking is F  
\(b \).  
For a given booking limit, the expected number of denied boardings will be given by  
E\[\(s|b\)  
–  
C\]+, where \(s|b\) is the number of shows given booking limit b. Thus, the change in  
total expected revenue from increasing the booking limit from b to b + 1 is  
¯  
R\(b, b + 1\) = pF  
\(b \) – D\{E \[\(s|b + 1\) – C\]+

\(C \)\(p – DρC + 1\). This will be greater than zero if F  
\(C \) \> 0 and  
if condition 11.6 holds. This means that, even when demand is uncertain, there is still a  
strong motivation to set a booking limit higher than capacity — that is, to overbook.  
The optimal booking limit with demand uncertainty is the smallest value of b for which  
R\(b, b + 1\) defined in Equation 11.9 is less than zero. This can be computed iteratively  
starting from b = C + 1 as in the previous model, and it can also be approximated numeri-  
cally.  
11.4.5 A Data-Driven Approach  
The approaches explained in Sections 11.4.3 and 11.4.4 can be described as forecast and  
optimize because they both start with probabilistic forecasts of demand and shows given  
demand and then optimize to find the booking limit that maximizes total expected revenue  
from a flight, including denied-boarding costs. In the spirit of the approach to capacity al-  
location described in Section 9.4, we can consider a data-driven approach to overbooking.  
Assume that we are trying to determine the booking limit to apply to a particular flight.  
We assume \(not unreasonably\) that the same flight has been operated at the same time to  
the same destination with the same equipment for some time in the past. We also assume,  
somewhat less reasonably, the total booking demand for every historical departure of the  
flight — that is, how many bookings would occur if no booking limit had been applied.  
Finally, we assume, very unrealistically, that we know how many of the bookings would  
show for every possible booking limit. This is not unreasonable for booking limits less than  
those applied historically because the airline can observe which passengers showed and  
which did not. But it is unrealistic to assume that an airline would know who would show  
and who would not for bookings it did not accept. In short, for any booking limit b that  
could have been applied to flight t, we know the number of bookings that would show at  
departure t— denote this by st\(b\). Note that st\(b\) is a nondecreasing function of b. Assume  
that the airline has observations for historical departures operated on day t = 1, 2, . . . , T  
and it is looking to determine the booking limit for the departure scheduled for day T + 1.  
As before, we assume that the price for a ticket on this departure is p, the capacity is C, and  
the denied-boarding cost is D.  
We can compute the net revenue that we would have achieved from departure t if it had  
capacity C and we had applied booking limit b with b ≥ C as  
Rt\(b\) = min\[st\(b\), C\]p + max\[st\(b\) – C, 0\]D.  
If we applied the same booking limit to all of the historic departures, the average net rev-  
enue would have been

Example 11.4  
Senilria Airlines runs a 20-seat flight from San Francisco to San Bernardino,  
California, every Monday morning at 10\:00 a.m. It has operated this flight for  
the last 10 weeks and did not apply any booking limits, which allowed it to ob-  
serve the show/no-show behavior of every booking. Table 11.3 shows the order  
of bookings for each departure of the flight and whether each booking showed;  
a value of 1 indicates that the booking showed, a value of 0 indicates that the  
booking did not show, and a dash indicates no booking. Thus, departure 1 had  
30 bookings of which 26 showed and departure 3 had 16 bookings of which 14

showed. On the basis of this history, Senilria wants to determine the booking  
limit that would maximize expected revenue from the next departure given a  
fare of \$200 and a denied-boarding cost of \$300.  
Table 11.4 shows the number of shows that each departure would have expe-  
rienced given levels of the booking limit b from 20 to 26. Booking limits above  
26 do not need to be considered because at a limit of 26, every departure with  
at least 20 shows is full. Finally, Table 11.5 shows the net revenue that would be  
achieved for each flight. Based on this history, the value of b that would maxi-  
mize expected revenue is b\* = 23 with a corresponding expected revenue of  
\$3,580. This can be compared with the expected revenue from not overbook-  
ing of \$3,340, a gain of \$240 or a 7.2% increase.  
While more than 10 historical observations would typically be required, Example 11.4  
illustrates the strength of the data-driven approach\: it enables us to go directly from the  
underlying data to the decision without the need to make assumptions about underlying  
distributions or estimating coefficients. The approach does not require independence of  
shows and could easily be adapted to the case of multiple-person bookings. Furthermore, it  
will adapt over time to changes in the marketplace.  
The shortcomings of the approach are also evident. In particular, it requires information  
on all bookings and shows that is generally not available. An airline can fully observe which  
of its bookings show, but it cannot observe whether bookings it did not accept would have  
shown. In fact, once a departure has reached its booking limit, it is not usually possible to overbooking 291  
determine how many additional customers would have booked, much less which of those  
would have shown.  
One way to overcome the information shortage is through experimentation. Senilria  
could set the booking limit to 26 for several departures to observe the corresponding pat-  
tern of shows. This has a cost —based on the information in Table 11.5, overbooking at 26  
costs an average of \$80 per flight relative to not overbooking at all, and it costs \$320 relative  
to the optimal overbooking limit of 23. This is a classic trade-off between exploration and  
exploitation; the challenge in using a data-driven approach in this setting is to experiment  
periodically by setting the booking limit artificially high for some departures to observe the  
pattern of shows and then use that information to set the optimal booking limits for future  
departures. Periodic experimentation is required to ensure that the underlying pattern of  
demand has not changed in a way that would imply a different limit.  
11.5 SERVICE-LEVEL POLICIES  
In the absence of any other considerations, properly calculated risk-based booking limits  
maximize expected short-run profitability. From this, it would seem to follow that risk-  
based booking limits would be universally used. However, this is not the case. Many air-  
lines and other overbookers do not explicitly trade off denied-boarding costs and customer  
revenue to set booking limits. Rather, they try to determine the highest overbooking limit  
that keeps denied-service incidents within management-specified levels. Reasons that a  
company might prefer a service-level policy over a risk-based policy include the following.  
•  
•  
•  
Some components of denied-service cost, such as ill will, might be viewed as difficult  
or impossible to quantify. In view of this, management might consider a service-level  
policy to be safer than a risk-based policy.  
Risk-based booking limits can lead to wide variation in booking limits — and poten-  
tial numbers of denied boardings — from flight to flight. Under a risk-based policy,  
an airline might set overbooking levels ranging from 10% to more than 50% of  
capacity for different flights departing from the same airport during the day. Instead  
of accepting this wide variation, the airline might be comfortable with simply setting  
a constant overbooking limit over all flights to smooth staffing needs and to ensure  
that no single flight ever experiences a massive overbooking situation.  
Corporate management may feel that a risk-based booking limit calculation is a  
mathematical black box that they cannot understand and do not have confidence in.  
On the other hand, service-level limits are easy to understand, the results are easy to  
measure, and they give comfort that denied-service levels will not be out of line with  
those experienced by competitors.  
Whatever the reason \(or combination of reasons\), service-level policies are common-  
place. Examples of companies that use \(or have used\) service-level policies include airlines  
such as American \(Rothstein and Stone 1967\), rental car companies such as National \(Ger-  
aghty and Johnson 1997\), and many hotels and resorts. 292  
overbooking  
A typical service-level policy is to limit the fraction of booked customers who are denied  
service. For example, an airline might set a policy that the fraction of bookings that result in  
a denied boarding should be approximately 1 in 10,000. Recalling that \(s|b\) refers to shows  
given booking limit b and that C refers to capacity, this policy would be equivalent to set-  
ting b such that

,

10 000  
,  
or, equivalently, E \[\(\(s|b\) – C\)+\] = 0.0001  E \[\(s|b\)\].  
An alternative service-level policy would be to specify that the number of denied-service  
incidents should be some specified fraction of customers served rather than of total book-  
ings. This is the way in which airlines report denied boardings to the Department of Trans-  
portation. Under this policy, the company would set b so that  
E \[\(\(s|b\) – C\)+\] = q E \[min\(\(s|b\),C\)\] \(11.11\)  
where q is the target denied-service fraction and E \[min\(\(s|b\),C\)\]is expected boardings \(ac-  
commodated customers\) given a booking limit of b.  
It should be noted that applying the policies implied by Equations 11.10 and 11.11 on a  
flight-by-flight basis \(or a rental-day-by-rental-day basis\) will result in conservative book-  
ing limits. That is, the fraction of denied-service incidents that will actually occur will al-  
most certainly be less than q. This is because the booking limits calculated by Equations  
11.10 and 11.11 will result in an average denied-service rate of q on flights with demand  
sufficiently high that the booking limit is relevant. Some flights will have such low demand  
that they will never sell out. Including bookings on these flights will improve the denied-  
service statistics at a system level.  
11.6 HYBRID POLICIES  
Many airlines, hotels, and rental car companies are not purists when it comes to overbook-  
ing. In many cases, they use a hybrid policy under which they calculate booking limits using  
both risk-based and service-level policies and use the minimum of the two limits. This al-  
lows them to gain some of the economic advantage from trading off the costs and benefits  
of overbooking while still ensuring that metrics such as “involuntary denied boardings per  
10,000 passengers” remain within acceptable bounds —however these bounds are set.  
11.7 EXTENSIONS  
11.7.1 Dynamic Booking Limits  
Suppliers overbook to compensate for both cancellations and no-shows. However, so far  
we have only considered no-shows in our calculation of booking limits. Without cancel-  
lations, a supplier can simply calculate an optimal booking limit at the beginning of the  
booking period and hold it constant until departure. The supplier does not need to update overbooking 293  
the booking limit or change it over time. When cancellations are factored in, the situation  
becomes more complex. Specifically, the optimal booking limit for a supplier who allows  
bookings to cancel prior to departure will change over time. In this case, the supplier needs  
to calculate a dynamic booking limit.  
In the most general case, a supplier will face both cancellations and no-shows. This is  
certainly the case for airlines, hotels, and rental car companies. American Airlines has es-  
timated that about 35% of all bookings will cancel before departure, compared to 15% of  
bookings at departure that will not show. While cancellation rates are typically higher than  
no-show rates, cancellations are less costly than no-shows since they allow the opportunity  
to accept a booking to fill the space freed up by the cancellation.  
A common model of cancellations is to estimate a dynamic cancellation fraction r \(t\),  
where t is the number of days until departure. Assume an airline has accepted b\(t\) book-  
ings at time t. Then it would expect that, on average, r \(t\)b\(t\) of those bookings will cancel,  
while \[1 – r \(t\)\]b\(t\) of them will convert to bookings at departure. With a show rate of ρ,  
the airline would expect that an average of ρ\[1 – r \(t\)\]b\(t\) of the current bookings will show.  
One tempting \(and common\) approach is to use ρ\[1 – r \(t\)\] as a dynamic show rate and to  
apply standard risk-based or service-based models to determine the current booking limit.  
Example 11.5  
An airline is using a dynamic version of the deterministic booking heuristic  
in Equation 11.1, in which the booking limit is set to the capacity divided by  
the show rate — that is, b = C /ρ, where C is the capacity and ρ is the expected  
show rate. The airline has an average no-show rate of 13% for a flight assigned  
an aircraft with 120 seats. Twenty days before departure, the expected cancella-  
tion rate for this flight is 60%. The airline therefore sets a booking limit of b =  
120/\[\(1 – 0.6\) × 0.87\] = 345. Five days before departure, the expected cancel-  
lation rate is 20%, and the corresponding booking limit is b = 120/\[\(1 – 0.2\) ×  
0.87\] = 172.  
Bookings tend to firm toward departure — the fraction of current bookings that will  
cancel decreases as t approaches 0. This means that r \(t\), the expected cancellation rate, is  
typically an increasing function of t. It may not, however, be a continuous function. For  
example, many airlines specify that certain discount tour and group bookings cannot be  
canceled later than 14 days prior to departure without penalty. This often leads to a booking  
cliff, with the number of bookings crashing dramatically on the same day as all the tours  
and groups simultaneously cancel their unsold allocations. The booking limit needs to ad-  
just accordingly to reflect the fact that reservations on the books within 14 days of departure  
are far more likely to convert to shows than those on the books prior to that period.  
A typical dynamic booking limit is shown in Figure 11.4. Here, the heavy curve shows  
the total booking limit at each time before departure, while the lighter line shows actual  
bookings. The booking limit starts out high to allow for the possibility of a high proportion  
of future cancellations. As the departure date of the flight approaches, the booking limit de-  
creases as bookings become more firm. Bookings initially start out low and increase toward 294  
overbooking

departure. In Figure 11.4, total bookings hit the booking limit at time A. At that point, the  
airline stops accepting bookings. Note that for some period, accepted bookings can actu-  
ally exceed the booking limit. In Figure 11.4, a sufficient number of cancellations occur so  
that bookings fall below the limit at time B. At time B, the airline starts accepting bookings  
again, until the booking limit is reached again, at which time the flight would again be  
closed. In the figure, the flight closes three times and reopens twice.  
The difference between the booking limit at departure and the capacity of the aircraft is  
the amount the airline has overbooked specifically to accommodate no-shows. It is where  
the airline would like bookings to be, considering future cancellations and no-shows \(as-  
suming the airline is following a risk-based overbooking policy\). If the airline has done a  
good job managing bookings over time and gotten a bit lucky, it will reach this point. Of  
course, demand may be so low that bookings never reach the limit. Or they may reach the  
limit at some point, but a higher or lower cancellation rate than expected may result in  
bookings at departure being higher or lower than the ideal. Cancellations add yet another  
complication to the already dicey game of managing bookings to maximize profitability.  
Figure 11.4 illustrates an important aspect of dynamic booking limits\: the booking limit  
tends to be high early on, just when actual bookings are likely to be low. Except for flights  
that have extraordinary levels of early-booking demand, the total booking level is not likely  
to be binding when there is still a long time until departure. This means that using com-  
putational resources to calculate exact total booking limits that have little chance of being  
binding and to update them frequently months before departure is not necessary. However,  
as departure approaches, the optimal booking limit decreases and the number of book-  
ings generally increases. This means it becomes more and more worthwhile to compute  
an exact booking limit as departure approaches. Typically, an airline may only update the  
total booking limit for a flight monthly when it is six months or more until departure. As  
departure approaches, the airline will increase the frequency of recalculation. Most airlines overbooking 295  
will be recalculating the total booking limit every day during the last week before departure.  
Similar approaches are used by hotels, rental car companies, freight carriers, and other sup-  
pliers that practice overbooking.  
11.7.2 Overbooking and Capacity Allocation  
The models we have studied so far have been based on the assumption of a single fare class.  
However, as Chapter 9 shows, the same unit of capacity can often be sold to customers  
from many different fare classes at different prices. If customers are booking in reverse fare  
order and bookings can cancel or not show, then the airline faces a combined overbooking  
and capacity control problem. Say we have n fare classes, with p1 \> p2 \> ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ \> pn  
with class  
n booking first, followed by class n – 1, and class 1 booking last. The problem faced by the  
airline is the same in spirit as the capacity allocation problem treated in Chapter 9 — that  
is, the airline needs to set booking limits \(or, equivalently, protection levels\) for each fare  
class. The difference now is that these booking limits need to incorporate the fact that some  
of the bookings from each class are likely to cancel or not show.  
The problem of finding optimal booking limits for multiple fare classes — the combined  
overbooking and capacity allocation problem— is extremely difficult to solve in general. It  
is complicated by the fact that not only are different booking classes likely to have differ-  
ent fares, but they are also likely to have different cancellation and no-show rates. In fact,  
the general problem of combining overbooking with capacity allocation is so difficult that  
many companies use some variant of the following heuristic.  
Combined Overbooking and Capacity Allocation Heuristic  
1\. 2. 3. 4. Compute a total booking limit for the entire plane using either the deterministic  
heuristic, a risk-based approach, or a service-level approach. Call this limit B. No  
matter what approach is used, B will be greater than or equal to capacity.  
Use a capacity allocation approach such as EMSR-a or EMSR-b to determine pro-  
tection levels. \(Recall that optimal protection levels are not based on capacity.\)  
From the protection levels calculated in step 2, determine booking limits for each  
fare class as if the capacity were equal to B.  
Update B and the protection levels as bookings and cancellations occur.  
Example 11.6  
An airline is selling three fare classes — full fare, standard coach, and dis-  
count — on a flight with 100 seats. Three weeks before departure, the airline  
sets a total booking limit of 115. Using EMSR-b, the airline calculates protec-  
tion levels of 35 for full fare and 60 for full fare and standard coach. The airline  
then sets booking limits of 115 – 60 = 55 for discount bookings, 115 – 35 = 80  
for standard coach, and 115 for full fare.  
A question not yet addressed is how the total booking limit B should be calculated. The  
risk-based approaches discussed in Section 11.4 assume that the same fare will be received 296  
overbooking  
for each additional seat that is filled. This is the right assumption when there is a single fare.  
When there are multiple fares, it is not so clear what the increased revenue would be from  
filling an additional seat. A common heuristic is to use an estimated fare that is a weighted  
average of the fares, where the weights are proportional to the mean demands in each fare  
class. In other words, the average fare is  
n  
n  
=  
p pi i  
∑ ∑ µ µ  
i  
,  
i  
= =  
1 1  
i  
where µi is the mean demand in fare class i. Substituting p into the risk-based algorithms  
will enable the calculation of a booking limit.  
This approach — sometimes called the pseudocapacity approach — is widely used. It has  
the distinct advantage of allowing the supplier to mix and match overbooking and capac-  
ity management approaches; any approach to calculating the total booking limit \(e.g., risk  
based or service level\) can be combined with any approach to calculating the booking limits  
for different fare classes. Research has shown that it generally provides a good solution as  
long as no-show rates do not vary widely among classes —however, it is by no means op-  
timal.  
An alternative to the pseudocapacity approach would be to use a data-driven approach  
such as that described in Section 11.4.5. In theory, this would allow us to determine a book-  
ing limit that maximizes expected revenue without making assumptions about the mix of  
customers that would be accepted or rejected. Note, however, that the number of decisions  
that need to be considered is much greater because we need to update the dynamic book-  
ing limit over time, which implies that much more experimentation would be required to  
understand the implications of different limits at different times. Developing hybrid ap-  
proaches that enable taking advantage of experimentation but use realistic structural as-  
sumptions is a promising area of research.  
11.7.3 Other Extensions  
We have assumed that the denied-boarding cost is a constant. In reality, the denied-­ boarding  
cost per passenger is likely to be an increasing function of the number of oversales. Con-  
sider a flight that is oversold by 15 passengers. The airline might be able to persuade five  
people to volunteer to take another flight for \$200 apiece. It might convince another seven  
volunteers for \$600 apiece. It then may have to choose three more involuntary denied  
boardings, with an associated cost of \$850 apiece \(including ill-will cost\). In this case, total  
denied-boarding cost is the piecewise linear function of the number of oversales shown in  
Figure 11.5.  
An airline cannot know in advance exactly how many volunteers it will induce at each  
level of compensation for a particular flight departure. This means not only that the denied-  
boarding cost is not constant but also that it is a random variable. Increasing the booking  
limit b leads to an increase in the expected number of denied boardings E \[\(\(s|b\) – C\)+\],  
which in turn leads to an increased expected denied-boarding cost per passenger. Instead  
of a constant value of denied-boarding cost D, the airline needs to calculate an expected overbooking 297

denied-boarding cost as a function of the booking limit. Increasing denied-boarding costs  
tend to reduce the optimal booking limit relative to constant denied-boarding costs.  
We have also assumed that tickets are totally refundable and that no-show customers  
do not pay any penalty. This was standard practice in the airline industry for many years.  
However, airlines, hotels, and rental car companies are increasingly selling partially refund-  
able bookings and charging penalties for no-shows and cancellations. A partially refund-  
able ticket or no-show penalty changes the underlying economic trade-offs and therefore  
also changes the optimal booking limit. Assume the airline charges a penalty of α times the  
price for each no-show, where α \< 1. Thus, if α = 0.25, the airline would collect \$25 for a  
passenger who purchased a \$100 ticket but did not show. The marginal impact of changing  
the booking limit in the case when the airline collects αp from each no-show is shown in  
Figure 11.6. This tree is identical to the tree in Figure 11.3, with the exception that the top  
branch, which represents an additional no-show from increasing the booking limit by 1, 298  
overbooking  
now has a payoff of αp. We can use this tree to calculate the booking limit that maximizes  
expected net revenue using the same approach as before \(see Exercise 1\).  
Finally, in many industries the risk of no-shows and cancellations is counterbalanced to  
some extent by the possibility of walk-ups\: customers without a reservation who show up  
just prior to departure wanting to buy a ticket.9 Companies sell capacity to walk-ups only  
if it is available after all shows are accommodated. Since walk-up customers have not made  
bookings, they are not entitled to payment if they are not served. Walk-ups are highly desir-  
able customers\: not only can they be used to fill seats that would otherwise go empty, but  
they can usually be charged high prices. Thus, hotels will often charge walk-ups the rack  
rate — even if the hotel is not close to being full—under the belief that a walk-up customer  
has a high willingness to pay since the cost of finding an alternative is relatively high.  
It is easy to see that the possibility of walk-ups reduces the optimal total booking limit.  
If a hotel knew that it would have 10 high-paying walk-up customers arriving every day,  
it would set its booking limits as if it had 10 fewer rooms. Of course, like all elements of  
future customer demand, the number of walk-ups is uncertain at the point when the book-  
ing limit needs to be set. However, in cases where walk-ups are important, companies will  
forecast expected walk-up demand and incorporate its effect explicitly in calculating book-  
ing limits \(see Exercise 3\).  
Each of these complications adds to the complexity of calculating the total booking  
limit. However, in any circumstances, the basic idea is the same. We want to find the book-  
ing limit such that the additional revenue we would expect from increasing the booking  
limit balances the additional expected denied-boarding cost we would incur.  
11.8 MEASURING AND MANAGING OVERBOOKING  
Prior to the deregulation of the airlines, airline management focused on load factor as the  
key performance indicator, both for individual flights and on a system level. The load fac-  
tor of a flight is the ratio of the number of passengers on a flight \(its load\) to its capacity.  
A flight departing with 100 seats and 86 passengers has an 86% load factor. Load factor  
can be measured at any level, from a single flight to a market served by many flights to an  
entire airline. Up into the 1970s and even beyond, load factor was the main metric that  
airlines tracked. Marketing programs were evaluated based on changes in load factor — a  
program that increased load factors was successful, one that did not increase them was  
ineffective. Persistently low load factors on a flight were considered a signal that a smaller  
aircraft should be assigned to the route or that the flight should be rescheduled to a differ-  
ent time or even be dropped.  
Unfortunately, load factor fails as a measure of overbooking policy. The booking policy  
that maximizes load factor is simple — accept every booking request. This may result in  
hundreds or thousands of denied boardings, but the planes will be full and load factors will  
be sky-high.  
To avoid the hordes of denied boardings that would result from an unconstrained book-  
ing policy, airline management often instructed booking controllers to minimize denied  
boardings. This created a basic conflict\: Any booking policy that increases load factor is overbooking 299  
likely to result in an increase in denied boardings, and policies that decrease denied board-  
ings are likely to reduce load factors. As we have seen, an optimal risk-based booking policy  
neither maximizes load factors nor minimizes denied boardings. Rather, it finds the book-  
ing limit that best balances the risks of spoilage with the risk of denied boardings, to maxi-  
mize expected net revenue. Therefore, airline overbooking policies are often evaluated on  
two metrics\:  
•  
•  
Spoilage rate\: the number of empty seats at departure for which a booking was de-  
nied, expressed as a fraction of total seats on the departure10  
Denied-boarding rate\: the number of denied boardings, expressed as a fraction of  
total shows for a departure \(involuntary and voluntary denied boardings are usually  
tracked separately\)  
Both the spoilage rate and the denied-boarding rate need to be measured against targets.  
These targets can be calculated with the same forecasts used to calculate the booking limit  
in the first place.  
Example 11.7  
An airline sets a total booking limit for a flight with a 100-seat aircraft, expected  
demand of 110 passengers with a standard deviation of 55, a no-show rate of  
10%, and a discount fare of \$200 and a full fare of \$350. If we are using the op-  
timal risk-based booking limit calculated in Section 11.4.4, we would expect a  
spoilage rate of about 0.06 and a denied-boarding rate of about 0.02. Of course,  
the spoilage and denied-boarding rates for a specific flight departure will most  
likely be different, but the average overall flight departures with the same char-  
acteristics should be close to 0.06 and 0.02. If the rates are significantly differ-  
ent, we should seek the reasons why. Are our demand or no-show forecasts  
consistently in error? Are booking controllers intervening too often to raise or  
lower the booking limits?  
It should be stressed that performance needs to be evaluated against targets in both  
directions. For example, it might seem that a denied-boarding rate of 1% would indicate  
better performance than 2%. But if the lower denied-boarding rate was achieved at the  
cost of a higher spoilage rate, it may mean that our overbooking policy was not sufficiently  
aggressive and we lost profitable opportunities to fill additional seats. If the lower denied-  
boarding rate did not coincide with a higher spoilage rate, we still need to understand the  
reason why it differed from our target. It may mean that our demand and no-show fore-  
casts need to be adjusted for future flights.  
11.9 ALTERNATIVES TO OVERBOOKING  
Needless to say, involuntary denied service is not popular with customers. Customers hate  
arriving weary at their hotel at midnight only to be told that the hotel is overbooked and  
they will be bused to another hotel 10 miles away. Overbooking is also unpopular with sup- 300  
overbooking  
pliers. Not only does it create unhappy customers; it is a continual source of stress for gate  
agents, desk clerks, or whoever needs to deliver the bad news to the customer that she is  
going to be denied service. Airline gate agents often feel as if the sole purpose of overbook-  
ing is to make their lives more difficult, and airline revenue managers spend a considerable  
amount of time explaining to them the need for overbooking and the financial benefits it  
brings. Furthermore, overbooking as a policy is inefficient — an airline can only find out  
how many of its customers are sufficiently flexible to take an alternative flight just prior to  
departure. If an airline knew earlier that a high fraction of its bookings were flexible, they  
would be more willing to overbook than if all of their bookings were inflexible.  
In this environment, it is not surprising that airlines and other overbookers have actively  
searched for alternative ways to manage the uncertainty intrinsic in allowing customers to  
cancel and not show other than waiting until the last few minutes before departure. The  
following are some of the approaches that have been utilized or proposed\:  
•  
•  
•  
Standbys. A standby booking is one that is sold at a discount and gives the customer  
access to capacity only on a space-available basis. Customers with standby tickets  
arrive at the airport and are told at the gate whether they will be accommodated on  
their flight. If they cannot be accommodated on their flight, the airline books them at  
no charge on some future flight \(usually also on a standby basis\).  
Bumping strategy. If the fares for late-booking passengers are sufficiently high, an air-  
line could pursue a bumping strategy—that is, if unexpected high-fare demand mate-  
rializes, the airline would overbook with the idea that it can deny boardings to low-fare  
bookings in order to accommodate the high-fare passengers. For a bumping strategy to  
make sense, the revenue gain from boarding the full-fare passenger must outweigh the  
loss from bumping the low-fare booking, including all penalties and ill-will cost that  
might be incurred. Historically, airlines were reluctant to overbook with the conscious  
intent of bumping low-fare passengers to accommodate high-fare passengers. How-  
ever, with the average full fare now equal to seven or more times the lowest discount  
fare on many routes, the bumping strategy may make more economic sense.  
Flexible products. A flexible product guarantees that the buyer will receive one out of  
a set of closely substitutable services. The seller decides the exact service close to \(or  
at\) the time of fulfillment on the basis of demand information acquired during the  
booking period \(Gallego and Phillips 2004\). An example would be purchasing a non-  
stop coach ticket from London to New York City on a date three weeks from today  
from an airline that has nonstop departures at 9\:00 a.m., noon, and 5\:00 p.m. The  
night prior to departure, the airline would contact the customer to inform her which  
flight she has been assigned to. Similarly, a traveler could book a room in Chicago  
from a large hotel chain \(such as Marriott\) that has multiple properties in Chicago.  
The night before arrival, the traveler would receive a text informing her which prop-  
erty she will be staying at. Typically, the flexible product would be sold at a discount  
to the fixed product in which the exact flight or exact property is specified.  
One advantage of the flexible product is that it allows the seller to identify flexible  
customers prior to the date of service delivery. This enables them to better match overbooking 301  
•  
•  
•  
demand to limited supply. For an airline, under standard overbooking, a customer  
who arrives for the noon flight cannot be offered the option of the 9\:00 a.m. flight,  
but flexible customers on the overbooked noon flight can be shifted to the 9\:00 a.m.  
flight. This is an advantage for both the seller and the customer over standard over-  
booking.  
Flexible products have not been widely adopted in the airline or hotel industries.  
However, they are used in air freight and ocean shipping where many shippers only  
care about departure time and delivery time and not the itinerary taken by the cargo.  
They are also used by internet advertisers. The German tour operator Germanwings  
starts with a large set of alternatives and allows customers to pay to remove specific  
alternatives from the set \(Gallego and Stefanescu 2012\).  
Opaque products are similar to flexible products in that sellers offer customers a  
bundle of substitutable products \(often from different sellers\). Which product the  
customer is assigned is revealed only when she has made her purchase. Opaque sell-  
ing is used in the travel industry by Hotwire and Priceline; for example, a customer  
can reserve a rental car from a major provider and will only learn if it is Hertz, Avis,  
or National after making the reservation. One rationale for companies to participate  
in opaque products is the desire to offer discounted products while maintaining their  
brand image.  
Options. A logical approach to managing the adverse effects of uncertain future  
events is through the use of options. It is not surprising that options have been pro-  
posed as an alternative to overbooking, although they are not widely used. Callable  
options for airline seats were proposed in Gallego, Phillips, and Sahin 2008. A callable  
option includes the option for the seller to recall the capacity at a prespecified price  
before the service is delivered. The callable services could either be sold at a discount  
or with a recall price premium to compensate the customer for the potential incon-  
venience of having the service recalled. For example, a customer could purchase a  
discount ticket for \$200 with a recall option of \$50. If the airline found that it had  
excess full-fare demand for \$500 for that flight, it could call the option, in which case  
the customer holding the option would pay nothing but would receive a payment of  
\$50. The benefit for the airline is that it receives a payment of \$500 minus the \$50 call  
payment, or \$450 for a seat that would otherwise be sold for \$200. By offering both  
callable options and regular seats, a seller can segment the market between flexible  
and inflexible customers and thereby provide a source of additional riskless revenue.  
Last-minute discounts. Historically, the price of airline bookings has tended to in-  
crease as departure approaches, as airlines seek to exploit the fact that later-booking  
customers tend to be less price sensitive than early-booking customers. However,  
increasingly airlines have been using last-minute deep discounts to sell capacity that  
would otherwise go unused. For example, the company Last-Minute Travel \(https\://  
www.lastminutetravel.com\) specializes in selling deeply discounted capacity for  
flights that are nearing departure and hotel check-in dates that are only a few days in  
the future. To limit cannibalization, many airlines, hotels, and rental car companies 302  
overbooking  
only offer last-minute discounts through opaque channels. In a similar vein, classical  
concerts and operas often sell standing-room-only tickets at a deep discount once all  
seats have been sold.  
•  
Cancellation and no-show penalties. Many airlines, hotels, and rental car companies  
have instituted penalties for customers who cancel or do not show. These penalties  
can range from 10% or less of the price all the way to 100% for a nonrefundable  
ticket. These penalties can significantly change the economics of overbooking. \(See  
Exercise 1.\)  
Each of these approaches has drawbacks. Standby tickets usually need to be priced at  
extreme discounts in order to sell. Furthermore, while standbys may help reduce spoilage,  
they do nothing to help the situation in which the airline has accepted too many bookings  
and needs to deny some boardings. In fact, they make the situation worse, since both the  
passengers denied boarding and the standbys will be demanding seats on some future flight  
to the same destination.  
Cancellation and no-show penalties might seem to be an obvious answer to the over-  
booking problem, since such penalties should decrease the number of cancellations and  
no-shows as well as reduce the revenue risk to airlines. However, two points need to be  
made. First, an airline with a cancellation penalty will still have a motivation to overbook  
as long as it faces a significant number of cancellations and no-shows. An airline with non-  
refundable tickets may still face a combined late cancellation and no-show rate of 10% or  
more. In this case, the airline can still increase revenue by overbooking. Second, it is not  
always easy for an airline to institute cancellation or no-show penalties. Customers whose  
travel plans are somewhat unsure will value the ability to cancel or change their flights  
without penalty. Instituting a cancellation penalty may induce these customers to purchase  
from a competitor who does not penalize cancellations.  
Flexible products, opaque products, and options appear to be attractive alternatives for  
managing demand to better accord with supply constraints; however, their use is currently  
somewhat limited save for the distribution of opaque products through suppliers such as  
Hotwire and Priceline.  
11.10 SUMMARY  
•  
•  
Overbooking is the policy of selling more units of a resource than are expected to be  
available. It is employed as a tactic by industries in which bookings can be canceled  
and /or some customers book but do not show up \(are no-shows\), and in which the  
cost of denying service is not too high relative to the fare. Industries in which over-  
booking is common including airlines, nonresort hotels, rental cars, freight, medical  
clinics, and universities. It is less common or nonexistent in resort hotels and cruise  
lines.  
The cost of denied service consists of four elements\:  
•  
•  
The direct cost of compensation to the customer  
The provision cost of meals or other extras overbooking 303  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
The reaccommodation cost of providing an alternative service  
•  
The ill-will cost from denying service  
Four general approaches to overbooking are common\:  
•  
A simple heuristic in which the capacity is adjusted by the show rate  
•  
Risk-based approaches in which a supplier trades off the cost of additional denied-  
service costs with the potential of additional booking revenue to find the booking  
limit that maximizes expected total revenue \(including expected denied-service  
costs\). The optimal risk-based booking limit can be calculated in two ways\:  
•  
Forecast and optimize\: Probabilistic forecasts of demand and shows are used  
within an optimization framework to determine the optimal booking limit.  
•  
Data-driven\: The optimal booking limit is based on the net revenue minus  
denied-service costs that would have been achieved had the booking limit been  
applied to similar flights in the past.  
•  
Service-level policies in which the booking limit is set to meet a goal on the rate of  
denied service  
•  
Hybrid policies in which an optimal risk-based booking limit is calculated subject  
to service-based limits  
The overbooking problem is further complicated by the fact that booking limits will  
change during the time between when a flight opens to first booking and when it de-  
parts. In general, the booking limit decreases as the flight departure date approaches  
because there will be fewer cancellations.  
To achieve maximum contribution, overbooking needs to be solved simultaneously  
with capacity allocation. One heuristic is to determine a total booking limit, includ-  
ing overbooking, for a flight and then use that pseudocapacity as an input to the  
capacity allocation approaches discussed in Chapter 9.  
Two metrics that are used to measure the effectiveness of overbooking are the spoil-  
age rate and the denied-service \(or denied-boarding\) rate. Spoilage measures the seats  
that could have been filled but were left empty as a result of a booking limit that was  
too low, and denied service measures the number of passengers who showed but  
were denied boarding on a flight because shows exceeded available capacity.  
Because overbooking \(or at least involuntary denied service\) is unpopular with  
customers, airlines and other travel providers have experimented with alternative ap-  
proaches including standbys, bumping, flexible products, opaque products, options,  
last-minute discounts, and penalties. Each of these has its benefits and costs relative  
to traditional overbooking.

The history of overbooking at American Airlines is told in Rothstein 1985. A review of the  
literature is given in McGill and van Ryzin 1999. Key early research papers in airline over-  
booking include Robinson 1995 and Chatwin 1998. Papers that discuss integrating capacity 304  
overbooking  
control and overbooking include Subramanian, Stidham, and Lautenbacher 1999; Feng  
and Xiao 2001; and Karaesmen and van Ryzin 2004. Models for overbooking in medi-  
cal clinics can be found in Muthuraman and Lawley 2008 and Zacharias and Pinedo 2014.  
A good overview and discussion of alternatives to overbooking, such as flexible prod-  
ucts, opaque products, standby, and so on, can be found in Gallego and Stefanescu 2012  
and the references therein.  
11.12 EXERCISES  
1\. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Solve the decision tree in Figure 11.6 to determine a formula for the total booking  
limit that maximizes expected net revenue when there is a no-show penalty of αp.  
Does the no-show penalty generally result in higher or lower booking limits than  
the case when tickets are entirely refundable?  
A flight has 100 seats and a passenger fare of \$130. The number of no-shows is  
independent of total bookings and is given by a normal distribution with a mean  
of 22 and a standard deviation of 15. The denied-boarding cost is \$260 per denied  
boarding. Use a table of cumulative normal distribution values or the NORMINV  
function of Excel to determine the optimal booking limit in this case. Recall that the  
booking limit needs to be an integer.  
Capacity, fare, denied-boarding cost, and the no-show distribution are the same as  
in Exercise 2. However, there is now a 0.6 probability that there will be a walk-up  
customer for the flight. Assuming there is a seat available on the flight after shows  
are accommodated, the airline will charge the walk-up customer \$200. What is the  
optimal booking limit for this flight?  
A flight has 100 seats and a passenger fare of \$130. The denied-boarding cost is  
\$390 per denied boarding, and the no-show rate is 0.16. Demand for this flight is  
extremely high; in fact, for any booking limit b \< 200, bookings will always hit the  
booking limit. What is the optimal total booking limit in this case? What is the cor-  
responding expected net revenue? How much does the airline gain from overbook-  
ing in this case?  
A low-cost airline sells only nonrefundable tickets. Customers pay in full at the time  
of booking. If they cancel or miss their flight for any reason, no portion of the price  
is refunded, and they cannot board another flight without buying a new ticket.  
Despite this policy, the airline still experiences a no-show rate of 5%. That is, if it  
sells 100 tickets on a 100-seat aircraft, it will, on average, depart with 5 empty seats.  
Should this airline overbook? If so, what kind of policy should it adopt? If it should  
not overbook, why?  
A rental car company will have 100 cars available for rent on a particular day. It ex-  
pects that demand for that day will be very high, so demand is certain to be higher  
than 300 bookings. If it expects a 15% no-show rate, what booking level should it  
set if it wants to ensure that the probability that a booking will be denied service is 7. overbooking 305  
0.0002? \(You can use the normal approximation to the binomial described in Ap-  
pendix B to estimate your answer.\)  
In Example 11.2, what is the minimum value of the overbooking penalty D that  
would be required for the expected revenue change from overbooking by one seat  
to be less than 0?notes

2\. The story of “system error” is from Rothstein 1985, which provides a history of  
overbooking at American Airlines.  
3\. For more background on the television advertising market, see Phillips and Young  
2012.

cruise to the buyer in case she needs to cancel.  
5\. For the latest DOT rules on treatment of involuntary denied boardings, see US

6\. In certain circumstances, the ill-will cost can be much higher. In April 2017, when  
United Airlines could not find enough volunteers on an oversold flight from Chicago to  
Louisville, Kentucky, security personnel forcibly removed a struggling passenger, Dr. Da-  
vid Dao, who hit his head on an armrest while he was being removed and was bleeding  
profusely as he was dragged out of the plane. The event was filmed by other passengers  
on their cell phones and immediately went viral, creating an enormous backlash toward  
United. United Airlines later settled with Dao for a reported \$140 million \(Economy  
2019\).  
7\. This booking model assumes that all shows buy a ticket. Those who are denied ser-  
vice pay the price p but receive denied-service compensation of D. The net denied-service  
cost to the supplier for each denied service is then p – D. The case in which those who are  
denied service do not buy a ticket but pay a fee of f can be represented in this model by  
setting D = p + f.  
8\. The assumption that no-shows are independent is often unrealistic — many book-  
ings are for multiple individuals \(e.g., a family traveling together\), who tend to show or  
no-show together. Also, events like bad weather or extremely heavy traffic may drive large  
numbers of no-shows. However, a number of studies \(starting with Thompson 1961\)  
have shown that a binomial distribution is reasonable, assuming that very large groups are  
treated separately. Background on the binomial distribution is given in Appendix B.  
9\. Walk-ups are also known as go-shows in the passenger airlines and as walk-ins in the  
rental car and hotel industries.  
10\. It is important to note that only the seats on a flight for which a booking was  
denied were spoiled. Seats for which there was no booking request are not considered  
spoiled. A flight with five denied booking requests that left with seven empty seats had five  
spoiled seats. On the other hand, a flight with three denied booking requests that left with  
one empty seat had one spoiled seat. 12 Markdown Management

would ever pay list price for anything.  
—Dave Barry, Dave Barry’s Money Secrets  
“Waiting for the sale” is a time-honored strategy for savvy shoppers. The fashion-­ conscious  
may splurge on clothes shortly after the spring fashions arrive at Macy’s, Nordstrom,  
Bloomingdale’s, or Saks, but the budget-minded know they can save by waiting. And the  
longer they wait, the more they save; many items will be marked down by 70% or more by  
the end of the season. Waiting for the sale is not without risk. There is always the chance  
that the store will sell out of a desired item before it is marked down. Nonetheless, an in-  
creasing number of customers are willing to take the risk in order to realize the savings.  
Dave Barry may be overstating the case, but in many categories retail list price is becoming  
a ceiling, with most sales taking place at a discount. More and more customers refuse to buy  
at full price if they feel that a sale will be coming.  
Retailers use a wide variety of mechanisms to discount their merchandise. Broadly  
speaking, these can be classified into promotions and markdowns. A promotion is a tem-  
porary reduction in price. Examples of promotions include a Memorial Day sale, Amazon’s  
Prime Day, a temporary two-for-one sale, an introductory low price, and a limited-time  
coupon for a 10% discount. The common link among these is that they are all tempo-  
rary. In contrast, a markdown is a permanent reduction, usually to clear inventory before  
it becomes obsolete or needs to be removed to make way for new stock. When an item is  
marked down, both the seller and the buyer know that the price for that particular item will  
never go back up.  
The difference between markdowns and sales promotions is illustrated in Figure 12.1,  
which shows the price over four months of a woman’s sweater \(panel A\) and a television  
set \(panel B\), both expressed as a percentage of list price. The television set was promoted  
three times, with its price returning to list following each promotion. On the other hand,  
once the price of the sweater was reduced, it never returned to earlier levels. After about  
three weeks at list price, it was marked down 20%, followed by three further markdowns.  
At the end of the four-month period, the sweater was selling for about 20% of its list price,  
while the television was priced at list.1 Note that markdowns and promotions are not mutu-  
ally exclusive; a temporary promotion can be applied to an item that is also marked down. 308

This chapter discusses the tactics behind markdown management. The point of mark-  
down management is to determine the timing and magnitude of markdowns that move the  
inventory while maximizing revenue. For many years, retailers relied on their judgment  
or simple rules of thumb to determine when and how much to mark down their goods.  
However, over the past 20 years, an increasing number of retailers have begun to use more  
sophisticated analytic tools to help guide this process, and companies such as SAS and Ora-  
cle offer commercial markdown optimization software.2  
We begin with at some background and how, for certain goods and services, markdowns  
segment the market and provide a simple method by which retailers can profit from inter-  
temporal price differentiation. The markdown management process that retailers follow  
and some of the business issues that can constrain them are outlined. We formulate the  
markdown problem as a constrained optimization problem and consider the most com-  
mon approaches to solving the problem. We examine the implications of strategic custom-  
ers — those who anticipate future prices — on markdown policies. Finally, we look at the  
use of markdown management systems and the experiences of companies using markdown  
optimization.  
12.1 BACKGROUND  
The practice of marking down distressed inventory is probably as old as commerce itself.  
Nonetheless, in the United States, markdowns and promotions were relatively rare prior  
to 1950. Sales were associated with holidays such as Christmas and Thanksgiving, or they  
occurred as periodic price wars between rivals such as Macy’s and Gimbels in Manhattan.  
In fact, most retailers tried hard to avoid markdowns. In the 1950s, managers at the Empo-  
rium, a leading San Francisco department store, were told\: markdown management 309  
High markdowns benefit no one. Not the store. Not the manufacturer. Not the customer.  
The store loses in value of assets or inventory. The manufacturer loses in future sales and by  
loss of prestige of his product. The customer is getting merchandise that is not up to stand-  
ard, at a low price it is true, but, remember — she would rather have fresh, new merchandise  
that she can be proud of and with real value at regular price than pay less for questionable  
merchandise. \(Emporium 1952, 3\)  
Many retailers considered markdowns to be prima facie evidence of mistakes in pur-  
chasing, pricing, or marketing. The official line at the Emporium was “Like accidents, most  
markdowns are a direct result of carelessness” \(Emporium 1952, 4\). On the other hand, a  
few retailers have always recognized that markdowns are more than just a way to clean up  
after mistakes. As early as 1915, one of the leading textbooks on retailing noted\:  
This method of marking up goods and making reductions as necessary seems to be the  
most effective way to sell some goods, especially those that are subject to changes in style.  
Besides bringing handsome profits to the concern directly, the spectacular cuts in prices . . .  
furnish excitement for readers of the store’s advertising, and help to draw crowds who may  
buy other goods as well as those advertised. \(Nystrom 1915, 242\)  
Since the 1960s, there has been a steady increase in both the size and the frequency of  
retail discounts. Figure 12.2 shows the growth in average discount from list price paid for  
items purchased at both department stores and specialty stores from 1967 through 1997.  
In 1967, the average price paid for all items purchased at department stores was at a 6%  
discount from list; by 1997, the average discount was 20%. The comparable figures for  
specialty stores were 10% and 28%. Both the fraction of goods sold at a discount and the

markdown management  
average discount inexorably increased from 1967 through 1997. Sometime in the 1970s,  
purchasing goods at a discount went from being an exception to being the rule. Markdowns  
as a percentage of retail sales were 8% in 1971, rising to 35% in 1996. By 2006, 78% of all  
apparel sold by major chains in the United States was marked down \(Levy et al. 2007\).  
The reasons for the steady rise in the average discount illustrated in Figure 12.2 have  
been much discussed. Here are some of the reasons that have been proposed.  
•  
•  
•  
Increased customer mobility, leading to more intense competition among retailers.  
The rise of discount chains and outlets, many with “everyday low pricing” strategies.  
A “vicious,” or self-reinforcing, cycle under which customers expect discounts and  
will not purchase unless retailers provide them, thereby creating an expectation of  
future discounts.  
•  
•  
An increasing interest by consumers in variety rather than standard items. The  
market share of colored and patterned sheets relative to white sheets increased from  
12% in 1970 to 60% in 1988. Sales of patterned men’s shirts also increased relative  
to standard white and blue \(Pashigian 1988\). Since nonstandard items have shorter  
shelf lives than standard items, merchants have to discount more often and more  
deeply to move old inventory and make room for new inventory.  
The increased use of markdown money, by which manufacturers reimburse retail-  
ers for some portion of the discounts provided to move slow-selling items. This  
has made it easier and more economical for retailers to resort to more aggressive  
discounting. Markdown money shifts some of the risk of unsold inventory from  
retailers to manufacturers.  
It is worth noting that a few sectors have resisted the trend toward pervasive discounting.  
Discounting is still relatively rare in prescription drugs, movie tickets, and various staple  
food and home items. As a result, for these items, even relatively small promotions can  
often drive dramatic sales increases. Furthermore, over the last 25 years there have been a  
rising number of everyday-low-price retailers, such as Walmart and Dollar General, who  
discount rarely, if at all. Nonetheless, the consensus is that no matter the cause, the increase  
in retail discounting is likely to continue, and, for the majority of retailers, planning and  
executing discount programs will consume an increasing portion of their time and energy.  
Since retail is a notoriously thin-margin business, properly planned markdowns can play a  
make-or-break role in determining profitability.  
12.1.1 Reasons for Markdowns  
Let us return to the price histories for the sweater and the television set shown in Figure  
12.1\. Why was the sweater marked down but not the television set? If you asked the retailer,  
he would probably mention two reasons. First, the sweater is a fashion good — its perceived  
value decreases over time, and it needs to be marked down to reflect this declining value.  
On the other hand, the value of the television does not decline over time. The second rea-  
son is that the sweater needs to be sold to make room for next season’s line of clothes. If it is markdown management 311  
not sold by a certain date \(called the out date\), it will be removed from the store and sent to  
an outlet store or sold for 20% or less of its original price to a jobber — someone who will  
try to sell it for more. Markdowns are necessary to move the goods and clear the space for  
next season’s clothes. On the other hand, there is no pressing need to clear the televisions —  
that is, unless the current model is being discontinued or made obsolete by the imminent  
arrival of a new model.  
As these examples show, from the seller’s point of view, markdown products typically  
share two characteristics\:  
1\. 2. Inventory \(or capacity\) is fixed.  
The inventory must be sold by a certain out date or its value drops precipitously.  
These two reasons provide the seller with motivation to mark down. However, there are ad-  
ditional reasons why the value of an item to buyers might decrease over time\:  
1\. 2. 3. 4. Time of use. An overcoat purchased in September can be worn during the upcoming  
winter months, unlike the same overcoat purchased in April. Many consumers as-  
sign value to wearing the coat during the upcoming winter, with that value declin-  
ing as winter progresses.  
Fashionability. Some consumers place a high value on getting a fashionable item  
early in the season, while others may care much more about buying at the lowest  
price. This applies not only to clothing but also to short-life-cycle goods such as  
consumer electronics and video games, where some buyers value being among the  
first to own the latest gadget or game.  
Deterioration. The quality of a good may deteriorate over time. Day-old bread does  
not taste as good as fresh bread. Clothes that have been on display for months can  
get a pawed-over look that makes them less appealing.  
Obsolescence. Consumers may believe that a better-quality version of a product  
will be available at some future date. As time passes, it increasingly makes sense to  
wait for the new product rather than buy the current version. To induce customers  
to buy now rather than wait may require deeper and deeper discounts. This is an  
especially important effect in consumer electronic goods, computer equipment, and  
automobiles.  
Note that the first three reasons involve customer segmentation and price discrimination.  
Time of use segments the market between those customers who need an overcoat now \(and  
are willing to pay more for it\) and those who can wait. Fashionability segments the market  
into fashionistas, who place a high value on being au courant, and value-conscious custom-  
ers, who are willing to wait. And deterioration allows the seller to offer an inferior prod-  
uct at a lower price. As we have seen, customer segmentation and price differentiation are  
powerful ways for a seller to increase revenue, especially when his inventory is constrained.  
Thus, it should be no surprise that they play a major role in the use of markdowns as a sell-  
ing strategy. It seems reasonable that prices would drop for items whose quality deteriorates  
over time — everyone’s willingness to pay for day-old bread is less than that for fresh bread. 312

Figure 12.3 Optimal prices, sales, and total revenue in \(A\) the single-period case and \(B\) the  
two-period case. In the two-period case, the optimal first-period price is \$6.67, and the optimal  
second-period price is \$3.33.  
While deteriorating quality is often found in markdown products, we can use a simple  
model to show how markdowns can segment a market even when quality does not deterio-  
rate.3 Consider a seller facing the linear price-response function d\(p\) = 1,000 – 100p, shown  
in Figure 12.3. Recall that this linear price-response function is equivalent to a population  
of 1,000 potential buyers whose willingness to pay is uniformly distributed between \$0 and  
\$10. Assume that the good being sold has a marginal cost of zero. \(As we shall see, this is  
often a reasonable assumption in markdown optimization.\) Section 5.3 shows that, given  
a single period, the price that maximizes the seller’s revenue is p\* = \$5, with corresponding  
sales of 500 units and total revenue of \$2,500, which is equal to the shaded area in panel A  
of Figure 12.3. At this price, everyone in the population with a willingness to pay greater  
than or equal to \$5 purchases the product, and those with a willingness to pay less than \$5  
either do not purchase or purchase from a competitor.  
So far, so simple. But what happens if, after all the buyers with a willingness to pay higher  
than \$5 had purchased the product, the seller had the opportunity to change the price? In  
this case, it should be apparent that the seller can gain additional revenue by charging a  
lower price in the second period. If the seller charges a second-period price higher than \$5,  
he will not sell anything in the second period, since all customers with a willingness to pay  
higher than \$5 have already purchased. But if he charges a lower price — say, \$2.50 —he  
can realize some additional revenue. In addition to the 500 units he sold at the first-period  
price of \$5, he would sell an additional 250 units in the second period at a price of \$2.50.  
His second-period buyers are those whose willingness to pay is between \$2.50 and \$5. By  
charging a lower price in the second period, the seller can increase his total revenue by 24%,  
from \$2,500 to \$3,125. markdown management 313  
In fact, the seller can do even better. If he sets his first-period price at \$6.67 and his  
­ second-period price at \$3.33, he can achieve total revenue of \$3,333.33. This solution is  
shown in panel B of Figure 12.3. He sells 333 units in the first period and 333 units in the  
second period, for a total contribution of 333 × \$6.67 + 333 × \$3.33 = \$3,330 — an in-  
crease of 33% over the single-price case! If he had more periods with more opportunities  
to change the price, he could make even more revenue by selling at progressively greater  
discounts in each period \(see Exercise 1\).  
If the price-response function is linear, the optimal price in the second period of the  
two-period model will always be one-half of the optimal price in the first period. This result  
depends on a number of assumptions that are unlikely to be true in practice — particularly  
the global linearity of the price-response function and that customers do not anticipate  
the markdown. However, it is interesting that there are at least two cases of products that  
undergo a single markdown and the discount is 50% of the full price\: baked goods and  
Broadway tickets. Day-old bread is often sold at half off the full price. And Broadway theat-  
ers have the option to sell tickets that otherwise would not be sold through a TKTS outlet  
in Times Square.4 Perhaps coincidentally, the price of a ticket purchased at TKTS is often  
one-half the full price.  
How does a second-period markdown result in additional revenue? There was no change  
in market conditions between the two periods, and the pool of customers did not change.  
The additional revenue came entirely from customer segmentation. The seller has used time  
of purchase and decreasing prices as a way of segmenting customers between those with a  
high willingness to pay and those with a lower willingness to pay. In this case, the mark-  
down is an example of time-based segmentation introduced in Chapter 6.  
However, the simple model is based on several questionable assumptions. As previously  
noted, it assumes a single pool of customers who are all indifferent between buying in the  
first period and buying in the second period. In most retail situations, we would expect that  
at least some buyers would have a lower willingness to pay for the item in the second period,  
because they benefit from having the item sooner \(as with a coat at the beginning of winter  
rather than at the end of winter\), or because the item deteriorates \(as with day-old bread\),  
or because it becomes obsolete \(as with a laptop computer\). Of course, the presence of  
customers with decreasing willingness to pay will only increase the incentives for the seller  
to decrease price in the second period \(see Exercise 2\).  
The second assumption underlying the two-period model is that customers do not  
anticipate the second-period markdown. If customers knew \(or even suspected\) that the  
­ second-period price would be lower, we would expect at least some of them to wait for the  
sale. This is cannibalization, and cannibalization reduces and can even eliminate the ben-  
efits of segmentation. One way to incorporate cannibalization in the two-period model is to  
specify a fraction of customers who will wait to buy in the second period even though their  
willingness to pay exceeds the first-period price. In other words, these customers would be  
willing to pay the first-period price, but they wait for the second period because they an-  
ticipate the markdown. A cannibalization fraction of 10% means that 10% of the customers  
who would be willing to pay at the first-period price wait to purchase in the second period  
at a lower price instead. 314

80 7.37 4.74 2,632  
Table 12.1 shows how optimal first- and second-period prices and total revenue change  
as the cannibalization fraction increases from 0 to 100%. As you might expect, increas-  
ing cannibalization results in decreased revenue. Furthermore, as cannibalization in-  
creases, both the first-period price and the second-period price increase. However, as long  
as the cannibalization fraction is less than 100%, the retailer still gains revenue relative  
to the single-period revenue of \$2,500 by marking down in the second period. In this  
model, the retailer can improve revenue from following a markdown policy even if a ma-  
jority of customers are willing to wait for the sale.  
12.1.2 Markdown Management and Demand Uncertainty  
The previous section shows how markdown management could improve profitability when  
demand is deterministic and the seller knows both the size of the total market and the dis-  
tribution of customer willingness to pay. Of course, this assumption of perfect knowledge  
is highly unrealistic. It is easy to see that the seller’s uncertainty about demand provides an  
additional motivation for pursuing a markdown policy. Consider a merchant with an in-  
ventory of a particular style of sweater who is unsure if the sweater will be a top seller during  
the upcoming season. If the sweater is a top seller, he will be able to sell his entire inventory  
at \$79; if it is not a top seller, then the market price will only be \$59. If he has two periods in  
which to sell the sweaters and offers them at \$59 during the first period, he will sell them all  
during the first period. But if he offers them at \$79 during the first period, he may sell them  
all at the high price; if not, he can lower the price to \$59 in the second period and sell the  
remaining stock. In this case, a markdown policy enables the seller to maximize revenue in  
the face of demand uncertainty.  
The use of markdowns to resolve demand uncertainty is exemplified in dramatic fashion  
by the Dutch auction, a term that derives from the use of this mechanism in Dutch flower  
markets. The most famous of these markets is in the town of Aalsmeer, where more than  
4 billion flowers are sold every year. In a Dutch auction, the seller sets a maximum and a  
minimum price for the product he is seeking to sell.5 During the period of the auction \(5  
minutes in the case of the Aalsmeer flower auction\), the price drops steadily from the maxi-  
mum price to the minimum price. Each potential buyer has a button that she can press at  
any time during the auction. When the first buyer pushes her button, she has bought the  
lot at the current price and the auction is over. If the price drops to the seller’s specified  
minimum without any takers, the lot goes unsold.  
In some ways, the Dutch flower auction is like a fashion season in fast-forward. The two  
markets share important similarities\: Both flowers and fashion goods are perishable. In markdown management 315  
both cases, the seller is often uncertain about the value that buyers will place on his good.  
For fashion goods, the uncertainty arises from the fickle tastes of customers and the in-  
ability of the seller to know whether any specific product will be considered hot during the  
current season. In the flower market, the uncertainty is due to the daily changing supply  
and demand for each type of flower. In both markets, the pattern of lowering prices over  
time can be seen as a way for sellers to extract the highest price for their constrained and  
perishable supply in the face of demand uncertainty.  
12.1.3 Markdown Management Businesses  
Three criteria are all required for a markdown opportunity to be present.  
•  
•  
•  
The item for sale must be perishable.  
The supply must be limited.  
The desirability of the item must hold constant or decrease as it approaches its per-  
ishability date.  
As we have seen, fashion goods, baked goods, Broadway theater tickets, and wholesale  
flower sales meet these criteria and commonly employ markdowns. Here are some other  
businesses in which markdowns are common.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Holiday items. These include Halloween candy; Christmas trees, decorations, and  
cards; and fireworks for the Fourth of July. Such items usually begin to be marked  
down just before the holiday, with much deeper discounts once the holiday is over.  
Tours. A tour package typically includes both airline transportation and lodging.  
Although tours constitute less than 10% of leisure travel in North America, they  
represent a major portion of vacation travel in Europe and Asia. A typical tour package  
might be six days on the Costa del Sol \(in Spain\), in which the tour price covers both  
round-trip air transportation and hotel accommodations. Bus travel to and from the  
airport in Spain and meals might also be included. Tour operators start selling tours a  
year or so ahead. As time passes, the tour operator continually monitors the bookings  
for different tours. If a tour is performing worse than expected \(i.e., bookings are low\),  
the tour operator may lower the price. This is a markdown management problem be-  
cause the price is always lowered \(never raised\) and the stock of inventory is perishable.  
Automobiles. Like fashion goods, most automobile manufacturers operate on an annual  
selling season. New models arrive every September and must be sold within a year to  
make room for next year’s model. Although some models may be considered hot and  
not require discounting, other models will not sell quickly enough at the list price to  
clear the lot. The manufacturer and the dealer will use a mixture of promotions and  
markdowns to move the inventory. In general, the average selling price of an automo-  
bile tends to decline fairly steadily over the season. This gives automobile pricing the  
flavor of a markdown management problem, although the markdowns are typically re-  
alized through various promotional vehicles rather than as a reduction in the list price.  
Clearances and discontinuations. Almost any seller can be in a situation where he has  
inventory he needs to clear by a certain date. When Maytag announces that it will be 316  
markdown management  
shipping a new and improved model of washing machine in three months, retail-  
ers have three months to sell their existing inventory before it becomes obsolete.  
Sequential markdowns are used to maximize revenue from this existing stock. The  
problem occurs at least occasionally for almost all retailers \(and many wholesalers\)  
but most frequently for those selling short-life-cycle goods such as computers and  
home electronics. In many cases, sellers of short-life-cycle goods mark down some  
portion of their total inventory every day.  
Note that revenue management industries meet the first two criteria, but not the third.  
That is, while seats on a flight are limited and perishable, their desirability typically increases  
for most customers as departure approaches.  
12.1.4 Constraints on Markdown Policies  
While markdowns are frequently very profitable, business are often constrained in the  
markdowns that they can take, either by business rules or technical constraints. Some of  
the most common constraints are listed below.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Price ladders. Discounted prices may need to be at discrete points \(“rungs”\) on a  
ladder either as discount percentages \(for example, a five-rung discount ladder  
with 10%, 25%, 50%, 60%, and 80% as possible discounts from the list price\) or as  
discrete price points \(for example, a four-rung price ladder with potential prices of  
\$29.99, \$24.99, \$19.99, and \$10.99\). In either case, markdowns need to be at one of  
the rungs on the ladder. Ladders keep pricing simple for both the retailer and the  
customer. In addition, they enable the retailer to take advantage of various penny-  
ending effects as discussed in Chapter 14.  
List price period. The list price may need to be in effect for some minimum period —  
typically several weeks — at the start of the season. The primary motivation for this  
rule is to maintain the value of the item in the minds of customers and to provide  
some integrity and rationale for the list price.  
Maximum and minimum price reductions. Since changing the price of an item in a  
brick-and-mortar store has some cost, minimum price reductions are used to avoid  
many small markdowns. Online retailers also use minimum price reductions to  
avoid incremental discounts of a few cents, which could confuse or annoy custom-  
ers. On the other hand, most retailers want to avoid extremely large markdowns. An  
enormous initial markdown may suggest to customers that an item is inferior and  
may actually harm sales. Maximum reduction restrictions are often imposed on the  
first markdown taken.  
Collections price together. All items in a given line \(e.g., Liz Claiborne sweaters\) might  
need to have the same markdown cadence in a given store; that is, they must all be  
marked down the same percentage at the same time.  
Maximum number of markdowns. Often the total number of markdowns during a  
season is limited in a retail store to minimize the workload created by the need for  
re-tagging merchandise. markdown management 317  
•  
•  
•  
Minimum final price. Typically, the final “fully marked down” price must exceed a  
certain percentage of the list price \(say, 25%\). This is to prevent extreme markdowns  
that devalue the merchandise. Instead of taking an extreme markdown, many retail-  
ers will send items to an outlet store or sell them to jobbers.  
Regional markdown coordination. In many cases, retail chain executives require that all  
stores in a specified region \(e.g., Manhattan, London, Southern California\) must have  
the same markdown cadence. The reason is to prevent customers from being moti-  
vated to shop at different locations in the same region to realize the best discount.  
Residual inventory. Sometimes, sufficient inventory must remain unsold to provide  
minimal stocking levels for outlet stores. This may seem a bit odd, since the ration-  
ale behind establishing outlet stores is to dispose of unsold merchandise from retail  
stores. But for some retailers, outlet stores have become significant profit centers  
in their own right, and these retailers want to ensure that there is sufficient unsold  
inventory from their retail stores to fully stock the outlet stores.  
These restrictions can significantly reduce the benefits that a retailer might receive from  
markdowns on his inventory. Furthermore, they can complicate the computation of the  
optimal markdown policy by requiring the addition of constraints.  
12.2 MARKDOWN OPTIMIZATION  
We have seen why sellers might use a markdown policy. We now look at some approaches to  
determine how they should mark their inventory down over time. These models are based  
on the following assumptions.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
A seller has a fixed inventory \(or capacity\) without the opportunity to reorder.  
The inventory has a fixed expiration date \(the out date\), at which point unsold inven-  
tory either perishes or is sold at a small salvage value.  
Initially, the price of the good is set at list price. The seller can reduce the list price  
one or more times before the expiration date.  
Only price reductions are allowed. Once the price has been reduced, it cannot be  
increased again.  
The seller wants to maximize total revenue — including salvage value — from his  
fixed inventory.  
Markdown optimization typically assumes that marginal costs are zero and that the goal  
of the seller is to maximize total revenue. This may seem surprising since the seller paid for  
the goods. However, at the point a seller is considering markdowns, his costs are sunk—his  
inventory has already been bought and paid for. Furthermore, since the seller cannot re-  
order, increased sales do not result in additional future orders. Therefore, the incremental  
cost of an additional sale is zero, and we can state the objective function in terms of maxi-  
mizing revenue from a fixed inventory. This is an example of the principle articulated in 318  
markdown management  
Section 5.1.1\: because the markdown prices do not change the costs paid by the seller, the  
costs should not influence the markdown prices.  
Let p1 denote the initial \(list\) price, and assume that we have T markdown opportunities  
before the out date. For example, a typical season for a fashion item might be 15 weeks. As-  
suming that the item might be marked down at most once per week, we would have p1 as the  
price during the first week, p2 as the price during the second week, and so on through the  
final price of p15.  
6 We assume a salvage value of r that is received for all unsold items follow-  
ing the last markdown. This would be the price a retailer would receive from a jobber for  
unsold clothes or the price he would expect to sell them for at an outlet store. If inventory  
entirely perishes at the end of period T— as in the case of a tour operator or a Broadway  
show — then r = 0. It should be obvious that we would never set the price during any mark-  
down week to be less than r.  
Let xi be the unsold inventory at the beginning of period t. Then x1 is the initial inven-  
tory, which is given. We assume that demand in any period is a function of the price in that  
period, and we let dt\(pt\) denote the price-response function in period t. The price-response  
functions dt\(pt\) satisfy all the standard properties listed in Chapter 3 — that is, they are  
downward sloping, continuous, and so on. Sales in period t are denoted by qt. Since sales  
in any period cannot be more than inventory, we have qt = min\[dt\(pt\), xt\]. We initially con-  
sider deterministic models, in which xi will uniquely determine dt\(pt\) and hence qt. We then  
turn our attention to \(more realistic\) probabilistic models, in which both dt\(pt\) and qt are  
random variables.  
The starting inventory in each period is equal to the starting inventory from the prior  
period minus prior-period sales; that is, xt+1 = xt  
– qt for t = 1, 2, . . . , T – 1. This process is  
illustrated in Figure 12.4. The retailer starts with an inventory x1 and chooses a price p1. He  
realizes sales of q1 = min\[d1\(p1\), x1\], and his inventory at the start of the second period is

x2 = x1 – q1. He chooses his second-period price p2 and the process continues. At the end of  
the season, he has unsold inventory y = xT – qT , for which he receives a salvage value of r per  
unit. Thus, his total revenue from his fixed inventory is R = p1q1 + p2q2 + . . . + pT qT + ry. In  
a deterministic model, the seller finds the set of prices that maximize R. In a probabilistic  
model, he finds the prices that maximize the expected value of R.  
12.2.1 A Deterministic Model  
Since we know that sales in each period need to be less than starting inventory in that  
period, one might think that we need a set of T constraints specifying that qi ≤ xi for i =  
1, 2, . . . , T. However, with a little reflection, it should be clear that we require only one  
constraint — namely, that the sum of sales for all periods needs to be less than or equal to  
the starting inventory. With this in mind, we can write the deterministic markdown opti-  
mization problem as

markdown management  
The interpretation of the markdown management problem is straightforward. The ob-  
jective function 12.1 states that the goal of the retailer is to maximize total revenue. This is  
expressed as maximizing the total increment over the salvage value received for each unit  
sold. Constraint 12.2 states that the retailer cannot sell more than his first-period inventory.  
The constraints in 12.3 guarantee that the markdown prices are decreasing over time, and  
constraint 12.4 guarantees that the final price is greater than the salvage value.7  
Example 12.1  
A retailer has a stock of 160 men’s sweaters, and he has four months to sell the  
sweaters before he needs to clear the shelf space. The merchant wishes to estab-  
lish a list price at the beginning of the first month and then mark the sweaters  
down at the beginning of each of the next three months. Sweaters unsold at  
the end of the fourth month will be sold to an outlet store for \$5 apiece. Fur-  
thermore, by dint of his long experience, the seller knows that demand in each  
of the four months can be represented by independent linear price-response  
functions\:  
d1\(p1\) = \(120 – 1.5p1\)+  
,  
d2\(p2\) = \(90 – 1.5p2\)+  
,  
d3\(p3\) = \(80 – 1.5p3\)+  
,  
d4\(p4\) = \(50 – 2p4\)+  
,  
where pi is the price in month i for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. Formulating this problem  
as in MDOWN \(Equations 12.1 through 12.4\) gives the results shown in Ta-  
ble 12.2. If the retailer had to maintain a single price during the entire four  
months, his price-response function would be the sum of the four individual  
price-response functions — that is, d\(p\) = d1\(p\) + d2\(p\) + d3\(p\) + d4\(p\)— and  
his price optimization problem would be to find the price p that maximizes  
pd\(p\) + \$5\[160 – d\(p\)\]+. The optimal solution to this problem is p = \$34.72  
with d\(p\) = 133, so the total contribution is 133 × \$34.72 + 27 × \$5 = \$4,752.76.  
The optimal markdown policy resulted in a revenue increase of about 7% over  
the use of the optimal single price.  
If a seller really knew the price-response functions for each week in the selling season, he  
could plug them into MDOWN and solve for the optimal markdown schedule at the begin-  
ning of the season, and his work would be done. Since the functions are deterministic, sales

will be exactly as predicted, and there would be no need to deviate from his initial planned  
markdown schedule. In reality, of course, things are not so simple. Without access to the  
ever-elusive crystal ball, sales are likely to deviate from expectations. The most effective ap-  
proach is to incorporate this uncertainty explicitly in calculating prices — an approach we  
take in the next section. However, the deterministic problem formulation can be used as  
the basis of a simple dynamic markdown algorithm.  
Deterministic Markdown Pricing Algorithm  
1\. 2. 3. 4. Solve MDOWN to determine the initial price of p1.  
Observe sales q1 during the first period. Starting inventory for the second period is  
x2 = x1 – q1.  
Solve MDOWN for p2, p3, . . . , pT using a starting inventory of x2. Put p2 in place as  
the price for the second period.  
At the beginning of each subsequent period, the current inventory is the previ-  
ous period’s starting inventory minus last-period sales — that is, xt  
= xt –1 – qt. Solve  
MDOWN for pt , pt +1, . . . pT , using a starting inventory of xt. Use the value of pt as  
the price during the upcoming period t.  
Example 12.2  
Consider the previous example and assume that during the first month, the  
retailer sells 70 sweaters instead of the 56 he anticipated. This means he has a  
starting inventory of only 90 sweaters at the beginning of month 2. Using x2 =  
90, he can use the price-response functions d2\(p2\), d3\(p3\), and d4\(p4\) to recalcu-  
late prices for months 2, 3, and 4. The new optimal prices are p2 = \$34.00, p3 =  
\$30.67, and p4 = \$16.50. He therefore sets his price for month 2 at \$34.00. At  
the end of month 2, he can observe remaining inventory and solve once more  
to determine the price he will charge in month 3.  
This algorithm does not explicitly incorporate future uncertainty into its calculation  
of the current price. However, it is adaptive in the sense that it recalculates the price in  
each period, recognizing that sales to date are likely to be different from those originally  
anticipated. While this is less than ideal, this general approach can lead to improvements  
over human judgment. One study computed the results of a deterministic algorithm simi-  
lar to MDOWN applied to 60 fashion goods at a women’s specialty apparel retailer in the  
United States and compared the predicted results to what actually occurred when the store  
used its usual markdown policy. To conform with the business practices of the retailer, the  
algorithm only changed the discount level if the new discounted price was at least 20%  
lower than the previous price. Furthermore, each style had to be offered at list price for at  
least four weeks prior to the initial markdown. The deterministic algorithm increased total  
revenue by about 4.8% relative to standard store practice. Much of this increase came from  
taking smaller markdowns sooner than usual store policy \(Heching, Gallego, and van Ryzin  
2002\). 322  
markdown management  
12.2.2 A Simple Approach to Including Uncertainty  
A seller is facing his last markdown opportunity. He has a fixed inventory x and must set  
the price p for which it will be sold during the upcoming period. At the end of that period,  
any remaining unsold inventory will be sold for the salvage price r \(which may be 0\). If he  
knows the price-response function for this period, his problem is a simple single-period  
special case of MDOWN. But now we add uncertainty to the mix. Specifically, we assume  
that demand given price, D\(p\), is a random variable whose distribution depends on p. What  
price should the seller set to maximize expected revenue? The problem faced by the seller is  
max  
E\[ \( \)\] = \[min\{ \( \), \}\] + \( – \[min\{ \(  
R p pE D p x r x E D p p x \), \}\]\)  
p  
\( \) \[min\{ \( \), \}\] + = p – r E D p x rx ,  
\(12.5\)  
where the first term on the right-hand side of Equation 12.5 is expected revenue from first-  
period sales and the second term is salvage revenue.  
Equation 12.5 is not too difficult to solve if we can model how the expectation  
E\[min\{D\(p\), x\}\] depends on p. One simple possibility is to assume that D\(p\) follows a  
uniform distribution between 0 and a – bp for some a and b. Then, if a = 200 and b = 10,  
demand would be uniformly distributed between 0 and 180 when p = \$2.00 and uniformly  
distributed between 0 and 150 for p = \$5.00. Expected first-period revenue, salvage rev-  
enue, and total revenue for different prices are illustrated in Figure 12.5 for the case of a =  
200, b = 10, a salvage value r = \$5.00, and an inventory of x = 60. In this case, the optimal  
price is \$13.29, with corresponding expected sales revenue of \$440.89, expected salvage  
revenue of \$134.23, and expected total revenue of \$575.02.  
We can extend this formulation of the two-period markdown problem to create a simple  
algorithm that incorporates uncertainty. The idea is similar to the deterministic algorithm

Expected revenue as a function of price in the single-period markdown model markdown management 323  
in the previous section, in which we solved the single-period deterministic problem to  
­ establish a markdown price for the next period, observed sales during that period, and then  
solved the same problem again at the beginning of the next period, using the new inventory  
value to get a new price. This time we follow a similar philosophy using the probabilistic  
formulation in Equation 12.5, but with a twist. At the beginning of each period, we estimate  
a probability distribution on future demands as if we are going to hold the price constant  
for all remaining periods. That is, for any price in period t, we define the random variable  
ˆ

Example 12.3  
A seller faces two pricing periods, with the out date occurring at the end of  
period 2. D1\(\$5.00\), the demand in period 1 given a price of \$5.00, follows a  
normal distribution with mean of 50 and variance of 25, and D2\(\$5.00\) follows  
ˆ  
a normal distribution with mean of 30 and variance of 10. Then D  
\(\$5.00\) =  
D1\(\$5.00\) + D2\(\$5.00\) follows a normal distribution with mean of 80 and vari-  
ance of 35.  
In the simple probabilistic algorithm, we calculate the price for the upcoming period as  
if it were the final markdown period. Then we find the current price pt by solving Equation  
ˆ  
12.5 using D  
\(pt\) as our probabilistic forecast of demand. This is equivalent to assuming that  
the price we choose for the current period will be held constant for the remainder of the  
selling season. This leads to the simple probabilistic algorithm.

This approach was tested for six items in eight stores of the Chilean fashion retail chain  
Falabella and compared against actual sales for the 1995 autumn-winter season. The rec-  
ommendations from the probabilistic algorithm generated revenue 12% higher than that  
obtained by the product managers \(Bitran, Caldentey, and Mondschein 1998\). It is tempt-  
ing to compare the 12% improvement in this study with the 4.8% improvement reported  
from the deterministic approach described in Section 12.2.1 and attribute the improve-  
ment to the incorporation of uncertainty in the algorithm. However, this would ignore the  
fact that the improvements came from applications in two very different settings and that  
the improvements were reported based on differences from previous store practices, which  
may have been very different in the two situations. 324  
markdown management  
12.2.3 Exhaustive Search  
The previous two sections described approaches to setting markdown prices using explicit  
optimization. In both cases, the optimization problems were specified without incorporat-  
ing any of the business considerations described in Section 12.1.4. One way to incorporate  
such business considerations into the markdown problem would be by adding constraints  
to the optimization problems in 12.1 through 12.4 and 12.5. As long as the number of the  
constraints is relatively small and remains stable over time, this is not much of a problem.  
However, if the number of constraints is large or is changing over time, then it can be-  
come a problem. Specifically, explicit optimization approaches tend to work well when the  
number of constraints is small and the constraints have a simple structure. As the number  
and complexity of constraints increases, then explicit optimization approaches tend to take  
more time — often much more time — to find a solution. In the case where business con-  
siderations require many constraints to be imposed and these considerations change over  
time, exhaustive search may be a superior alternative to explicit optimization.  
To understand how exhaustive search works, assume that our current price is p1, our  
current inventory is I, and we have three periods left and four possible prices at which we  
can sell in each period with p1 \> p2 \> p3 \> p4. We also assume that there is a salvage price  
r \< p4 at which all unsold inventory can be sold, with the possibility that r = 0. We want to  
determine what price to charge in the next period \(t = 2\), knowing that we will be able to  
change the price at most twice more. Possible markdown price paths are shown in Figure  
12.6\. Each arrow represents a potential price transition. To execute exhaustive search, we  
calculate the demand at each node in the graph in Figure 12.6 at the specified price so that  
the demand at price-level i in week t is given by dt \(pi\). These demands can be estimated us-  
ing a demand model such as the one described in Section 12.3.  
Once these demands have been calculated, we move forward in time and estimate the ex-  
pected revenue for each possible path. For each pathway, we start with the initial inventory.  
When we arrive at a node, we calculate sales as the minimum of the demand at that node

and the remaining inventory. Revenue at a node is the product of the sales and the price  
associated with that node. Each path terminates at the salvage node and any remaining in-  
ventory is sold at the salvage price —which will be zero if the inventory is totally perishable.  
Note that, for exhaustive search as for explicit optimization, we calculate a markdown price  
for all future periods, but we only need to commit to the price for the upcoming period. If  
sales are higher or lower than expected, we can recalculate the future markdown path based  
on updated inventory.  
Example 12.4  
Consider a retailer with 95 units left in stock of a television that is being re-  
placed by a newer model in three weeks and needs to be marked down. The  
television set currently sells at \$500, and the seller has a pricing ladder with  
four prices\: \$500, \$450, \$400, and \$350. Unsold televisions will be sent to an  
outlet where any remaining inventory will be sold for \$300 — the salvage price.  
The demand for the television set is independent of week with d\(\$500\) = 10,  
d\(\$450\) = 20, d\(\$400\) = 40, and d\(\$350\) = 60, where each number is demand  
per week that will be realized at that price. We can calculate his optimal policy  
using enumeration. Starting in the first period, if he sets the initial price at  
\$500, he will sell 10 televisions for first-period revenue of \$5,000 and have a  
remaining inventory of 85; if he sets the initial price at \$450, he will sell 20  
televisions for revenue of \$9,000 and have a remaining inventory of 75, and  
so on. When we have completed this process, we can add up the revenue per  
period and the salvage revenue for each policy to calculate the total revenue per  
policy as shown in Table 12.3. As can be seen from the table, the optimal policy  
is to drop the price immediately to \$450 and then drop it again to \$400 for the  
second and third weeks. This policy sells all of the television sets and realizes  
expected revenue of \$39,000. Note that the only immediate decision facing the  
seller is the next price to set. In this case, he would set the price to \$450, observe  
demand during the week, and perform another optimization at the end of the  
week to determine the next price to charge.  
The complexity of the exhaustive search method comes from the dimensionality of the  
problem. The markdown schedule shown in Figure 12.6 has 20 possible markdown policies;  
a full 13-week schedule with 10 rungs each week would have 497,420 possible markdown  
schedules. While this does not necessarily present a particular computational challenge in  
itself, it can begin to present an obstacle when markdowns need to be computed for mil-  
lions of items across hundreds of stores. To deal with this challenge, systems based on ex-  
haustive search use various methods to prune the tree — that is, eliminate branches before  
evaluating them further. For example, if one combination of prices for the first two weeks  
results in less revenue and less remaining inventory than another combination, then the  
first combination can be eliminated from further consideration.8  
The strength of the exhaustive search method arises from the fact that additional con-  
straints tend to make exhaustive search easier because they eliminate the need to evaluate  
pathways that do not meet those constraints. For example, assume that in Example 12.4, the 326

end of the season. By eliminating markdown plans with multiple markdowns, this would  
reduce the number of alternatives that need to be evaluated from 20 to 16. In general, add-  
ing constraints makes explicit optimization more difficult but exhaustive search easier.  
12.3 ESTIMATING MARKDOWN SENSITIVITY  
Key inputs to all of the optimization approaches described in Section 12.2 are estimates of  
demand \(or expected demand\) as a function of the price in each period — the functions  
denoted di \(pi\) and E\[d\(p\)\] in Section 12.2. Any of the techniques for measuring price sen-  
sitivity described in Chapter 4 can be used to estimate the parameters of these functions.  
However, markdown management systems often use forecasting approaches that focus on  
the change in demand from an expected path that was induced by a markdown.  
Sales and prices from an actual markdown schedule are illustrated in Figure 12.7. This  
figure shows price \(as a percentage of list\) and weekly sales for a woman’s blouse across a  
30-week selling season that started in week 23 and lasted through week 52. In this case,  
there were three markdowns\: a 30% markdown in week 32, a further 20% taken off in week  
40, and another 20% reduction in week 48. The final price was 30% of the list price. Sales of  
the blouse grew for the first few weeks and then began to decline until the first markdown  
was taken, at which point sales surged. Each of the three markdowns was accompanied by a  
jump in sales followed by a decline. This pattern is typical— markdowns can induce sudden  
and substantial sales gains. Markdown optimization systems typically seek to represent this  
phenomenon by separately modeling the natural time track of demand — the product life  
cycle —and the incremental effect of markdowns and then combining the two. markdown management 327

Actual sales Baseline forecast  
Example of weekly sales and baseline product life cycle forecast corresponding to  
Figure 12.8 Figure 12.7.  
The first step in estimating markdown sensitivity is to calculate a baseline product life  
cycle forecast. This is a forecast of how sales would have proceeded through the season with-  
out any markdowns — that is, how the item would have sold if the price remained constant  
at list price. The baseline product life cycle can be estimated by aggregating sales of fashion  
goods for periods in which no markdowns have been taken. Figure 12.8 shows the baseline  
product life cycle along with actual sales for the markdown schedule in Figure 12.7. One  
way to estimate price sensitivity is to attribute all sales in excess of the baseline product life  
cycle to the effect of markdowns and to fit an appropriate price-response function. For the  
example in Figure 12.8, the sales in excess of the baseline for weeks 32 through 39 would  
be attributed to the 30% markdown taken in week 32, the sales in excess of the baseline for  
weeks 40 through 47 would be attributed to the 50% total discount in place during that 328

Example 12.5  
For the example in Figure 12.8, the baseline product life cycle forecast of sales  
and the actual sales for weeks 32 through 39 are as shown in Table 12.4. Fore-  
cast sales of 1,219 at the list price and actual sales of 4,253 at the 30% discount  
provide two points that can be used to establish a price-response function.  
Note from Table 12.4 that the seller experienced a \(4,253 – 1,219\) /1,219 = 249% in-  
crease in sales from a 30% decrease in price, corresponding to a markdown elasticity of  
249/30 = 8.3\. Such unusually high levels of elasticity are often found in markdown and  
promotions situations. They do not imply that the elasticity of sales with respect to list  
price is anywhere near as high under usual circumstances. Typically, markdown elastici-  
ties are higher than list price elasticities both because some customers wait to purchase  
in anticipation of the markdown and because advertised markdowns increase excitement  
and sales.  
In addition to product life cycle and markdown sensitivity, demand forecasts for mark-  
down management typically include seasonality. Seasonality represents the natural varia-  
tion in sales for different product categories over the course of year. This can be driven by  
the seasonality of the items themselves —bathing suits sell more in the summer than in the  
winter — as well as events such as holidays and Black Friday. Seasonality can be modeled  
using a factor that depends on the week of the year.  
We can put these elements together to derive a simple demand model. Let t = 1, 2, . . . ,  
52 represent the week of the year and τ represent the number of weeks since a product was  
introduced.  
d\(t\) = LC\(τ\)  SEAS\(t\)  PD\(t\). \(12.6\)  
In this equation,  
d\(t\) = Demand for an item \(what we are trying to forecast\) in week t  
LC\(τ\) = Natural life-cycle demand for an item as a function of weeks since it was intro-  
duced markdown management 329  
SEAS\(t\) = Seasonality as a function of week of the year  
PD\(t\) = Price discount effect in week t  
The price discount effect represents the increase in demand that will be realized from a  
markdown in a period. It can be modeled in several ways, but one approach is to set  
PD\(t\) = e  
β \[\(p–p t  
\) /p\]  
,  
where p is the full price, pt is the actual \(marked-down\) price, and β \> 0 is the markdown  
elasticity. Note that pt  
= p corresponds to no markdown, in which case PD\(t\) = 1, which  
means that demand is entirely determined by the product life cycle and seasonality. As the  
markdown discount increases, pt decreases and PD\(t\) accordingly increases, reflecting the  
ability of the markdown to drive additional demand.  
Equation 12.6 incorporates the three most important elements that determine demand  
in a markdown situation. However, other factors may need to be incorporated to make the  
model fully realistic. For one thing, additional promotions — such as taking an additional  
10% off of everything — may occur during the markdown period. Such promotions may  
require an additional factor to be added. Also, when inventory of an item gets low, sales  
often drop as a result of the broken assortment effect\: When inventory of an item is low  
in a physical store, the remaining items may become harder to find. Furthermore, some  
items — like a sweater — may be priced at the item level, but, as inventory becomes low,  
certain sizes will sell out before the inventory is totally depleted. Finally, some consumers  
may want to purchase a certain minimum quantity of certain items but are unable to do so  
if inventory is too low. The result is that sales will drop independently of price if inventory  
drops below a certain level. Both promotions and broken assortment effects can be mod-  
eled by adding factors to Equation 12.6.9  
12.4 STRATEGIC CUSTOMERS AND MARKDOWN MANAGEMENT  
In his 1885 novel, Au Bonheur des Dames \(The Ladies’ Paradise\), Emile Zola chronicled the  
changes that a new form of commerce was bringing to Paris. The action in the novel re-  
volves around the new department store Au Bonheur des Dames. The fictional store is based  
closely on Le Bon Marché, a pioneering store that brought mass merchandising and pro-  
motions to Paris for the first time. In the novel, two friends, Madame Marty and Madame  
Bourdelais, are shopping together when Madame Marty, on a whim, buys a red parasol for  
14 francs, 50 centimes. Madame Bourdelais chides her, “You shouldn’t be in such a hurry,  
in a month’s time you could have got it for ten francs. They won’t catch me like that!” \(Zola  
\[1885\] 1995, 245\).  
Madame Bourdelais is the first recorded example of a strategic customer— a customer  
who anticipates future pricing action on the part of a seller and acts accordingly. Specifi-  
cally, modern customers have learned from past experience that most fashion goods and  
other markdown items will be marked down. This creates a motivation to wait for the  
sale — a phenomenon that has become so pervasive that, as noted above, only a small frac-  
tion of fashion goods are still sold at list price. Waiting for the sale is not just a phenom-  
enon for brick-and-mortar stores; it is also commonplace in e-commerce where retailers 330  
markdown management  
not only apply markdowns but also employ regularly scheduled promotions such as Cyber  
Monday and Amazon’s Prime Day. One survey showed that 77% of customers in India who  
purchase online “sometimes” or “always” wait for a sale \(Gautam, Shubham, and Mishra  
2018\). Customers have learned that goods being sold on the internet are just as likely to be  
marked down as they are in physical stores.  
The fact that customers can anticipate a markdown and that some of them are will-  
ing to wait for it complicates markdown pricing. So far, the discussion has assumed that  
customers do not anticipate a markdown — they purchase when the price first goes below  
their willingness to pay. If customers truly behaved this way, the logic behind a markdown  
strategy would be unassailable — the model of sequential downward pricing introduced in  
Section 12.1 would maximize revenue. But a customer who believes that she could pur-  
chase the item in a future period at a lower price and is willing to wait might do so even if  
the current price is less than her willingness to pay. Countering her tendency to wait is the  
possibility that the item may not be available in the next period if it sells out in the current  
period.  
We can formulate the decision faced by a customer in the following way. Assume that  
the current price of the item is pH and that the customer believes, based on the past actions  
of the sellers, that, in the next period, the item will be marked down to some lower price  
pL \< pH. Her willingness to pay for the item is w and, for simplicity, we assume that she is  
indifferent between purchasing the item today or purchasing in the next period. We further  
assume that w \> pH so that she would be willing to purchase in the first period if she knew  
that the item would not be available in the second period. The final element in her decision  
is whether the item is likely to be available for purchase if she waits. Denote her judgment of  
the probability that the item will be available in the second period as ρ. Then, a risk-neutral  
customer will purchase in the first period if and only if her surplus from a first-period  
purchase is greater than her expected surplus from waiting — that is, if w – pH ≥ ρ\(w – pL\).  
Rearranging terms, we see that she will purchase in the first period if ρ ≤ \(w – pH\) /\(w – pL\).  
Example 12.6  
Sharon is considering whether to buy a ticket for a Broadway show for full price  
at \$400 or go to the TKTS outlet on the day of the show in hope that a ticket  
will be available at half price for \$200. Her willingness to pay for a ticket is \$500.  
She will purchase now if her probability that the ticket will be available at TKTS  
is less than or equal to \(\$500 – \$400\) /\(\$500 – \$200\) = 1/3. If Sharon believes  
that the probability that a ticket for the show will be available at TKTS is greater  
than 1/3, then she will take the chance and seek to buy at half price.  
Example 12.6 illustrates the important role that consumer expectations play in deter-  
mining the profitability of a markdown strategy. Specifically, the higher the likelihood that  
a good will be sold at a markdown in the future, the more customers will be willing to wait.  
In Example 12.6, the ticket seller wants customers to believe that tickets will be scarce in the  
future so they will buy now. However, to segment the market and sell at differential prices,  
the seller would like to sell second-period seats at a discount. If the seller sells too many seats markdown management 331  
at a discount, it encourages high-willingness-to-pay customers to wait rather than purchase  
at full price. How do we determine the right policy in this case?  
We can explore this issue with a simple game-theoretic model. Assume that a seller sells  
to two classes of customers\: those with a high willingness to pay \(wH\) for his product and  
those with a low willingness to pay \(wL\), with wH \> wL \> 0. Assume that the number of high-  
willingness-to-pay customers is DH and the number of low-willingness-to-pay customers is  
DL. The seller can sell in either period at one of two prices\: a high price pH or a low price pL,  
with pH \> pL \> 0. For the moment, we assume that pH and pL are given — that is, they are not  
determined by the seller. Finally, we assume that wH \> pH \> wL \> pL, which means that the  
high-willingness-to-pay customers would be willing to purchase at either price, while the  
low-willingness-to-pay customers would only be willing to pay at the lower price. The seller  
has two decisions\: how much of the good to purchase \(x\) and the price to charge in each  
of the two periods. We assume that customers are aware of the seller’s decisions and act to  
maximize their expected utilities.  
Assume that the seller has x units on hand. What prices should he charge in each period?  
There are three possibilities\:  
1\. 2. 3. Charge the high price in both periods — denote this policy by \(pH  
, pH\).  
Charge the low price in both periods\: \(pL, pL\).  
Adopt a markdown policy\: \(pH  
, pL\).  
We do not need to consider the policy of raising the price \(pL, pH\) since everyone would  
purchase in the first period and it achieves the same revenue as \(pL, pL\).  
Under the first policy, only the high-willingness-to-pay customers will purchase and  
the seller will realize revenue of R\(pH  
, pH\) = pH min\(x, DH\). Under the second policy, both  
high- and low-willingness-to-pay customers will purchase at the lower price and the cor-  
responding revenue will be R\(pL, pL\) = pL min\(x, DH + DL\). Let us assume that x ≤ DH + DL  
so that supply is less than or equal to total demand. In this case, R\(pH  
, pH\) ≥ R\(pL, pL\)  
if x ≤ \(pH /pL\)DH  
. In other words, if supply is sufficiently scarce, it is better to price high than  
price low. If supply is sufficiently abundant, then it is better to price low than price high.  
But is a markdown policy ever optimal? Whether a markdown is optimal depends on  
the expectations of the high-willingness-to-pay customers. Assume that the seller adopts  
the markdown policy \(pH  
, pL\). Then, as noted above, high-willingness-to-pay custom-  
ers will purchase in the first period if they feel that the probability that the item will be  
available at the lower price in the second period is lower than \(wH  
– pH\) / \(wH  
– pL\). If  
all of the high-willingness-to-pay customers wait until the second period to purchase,  
they will be competing with the low-willingness-to-pay customers for the scarce supply.  
Assuming that every customer has an equal probability of purchasing the scarce supply,  
the probability that any customer will be able to purchase is equal to the supply divided  
by the total demand, or x/\(DL  
+ DH\). This means that a markdown policy will only be  
effective if

\(12.7\) 332  
markdown management  
If condition 12.7 holds, under a markdown policy \(pH  
, pL\), the high-willingness-to-pay  
customers will all purchase in the first period at the high price, while the low-willingness-  
to-pay customers will wait to purchase in the second period at the lower price. If condition  
12.7 does not hold, all of the high-willingness-to-pay customers will wait and seek to pur-  
chase at the lower price. If x ≤ DH  
, there is no motivation for the seller to adopt a markdown  
policy since he can sell all of his inventory in the first period at the high price. Define Z as  
the quantity on the right side of the inequality \(Equation 12.7\)— that is, Z = \(DL + DH\)  
\(wH  
–  
pH\) /\(wH – pL\). Now assume that DH  
\< x \< Z. In this case, by adopting a markdown  
policy, the seller can achieve revenue of pH DH + pL \(x – DH\). This is clearly higher than the  
revenue of pH DH that he would achieve from the high-price policy \(pH pH\). It is also higher  
than the revenue of pLx that he would achieve from the low-price policy \(pL pL\). So, in this  
case, a markdown policy is optimal. Finally, when x ≥ Z, the revenue from a high-price  
policy is pH DH and from a low-price policy is pLx ; which of these two policies generates  
higher revenue will depend on the specific values of pH pL, x, and DH  
. The conditions under  
which these different policies are optimal are summarized in Table 12.5.  
Example 12.7  
A theater owner has 100 unsold seats left and has established the price of tickets  
for his show at \$100 per seat. He has the option to sell unsold seats for \$50 on  
the day of the show. Alternatively, he could drop the price to \$50 immediately.  
He knows that there are two types of customers for the show\: theater lovers  
who are willing to pay up to \$150 for a seat and bargain hunters who are willing  
to pay \$75 for a seat. He believes there are 50 theater lovers and 200 bargain  
\(200 50\)\(150 100\)  
+–  
hunters in the market. This means that Z=  
. 125\. Since his  
= 125  
\(150 50\)  
–  
remaining inventory of 100 seats is greater than the theater-lover demand of 50  
but less than Z, his optimal policy is a markdown policy. Under this policy, he  
will achieve revenue of 50  \$100 + 50  \$50 = \$7,500. Note that, if he had 130  
seats left, his optimal policy would be to discount immediately, in which case  
his revenue would be 130  \$50 = \$6,500.  
In Example 12.7, increasing the available seating capacity from 100 to 130 actually re-  
duces the revenue that the theater owner can generate. This occurs because, with the greater  
capacity, high-willingness-to-pay customers realize that the seller will ultimately reduce the

price and that their chance of scoring a ticket at a discount is sufficiently high to make it  
worthwhile for them to wait. This illustrates that it is in the seller’s interest to communicate  
when supply is constrained —“Only two seats left at this price” or “Available only while  
supply lasts”— to encourage buyers to purchase now under the belief that the future price  
will not be discounted.  
This model of strategic customers is quite simple and is based on possibly unrealistic  
assumptions — namely, that both the seller and all customers have full information about  
willingness to pay, supply, and demand. However, despite these simplifications, the model  
provides a number of key insights. First of all, the optimality of a markdown policy depends  
on the relationship of supply \(or capacity\) to high-willingness-to-pay demand. If high-  
willingness-to-pay demand is less than \(or not much greater than\) supply, it may make  
sense to keep the price high — as with a hot toy at Christmas. If supply is much greater  
than high-willingness-to-pay demand — and customers know it — it may be better simply  
to lower price now rather than delay sales. It is the intermediate case in which it makes sense  
for the supplier to adopt a markdown policy.  
The simple strategic customer model assumes that all customers know what policy the  
seller will follow — in particular whether he is going to mark down the price in the second  
period. This assumption is not as unrealistic as it seems — for seasonal fashion goods, sell-  
ers often have rather predictable markdown cadences and customers can use the seller’s past  
markdown behavior to determine the likelihood that the seller will mark down current in-  
ventory. This suggests that it is in the interest of the seller to create doubt in the customer’s  
mind over whether he will be marking down current inventory — specifically to reduce the  
probability in the customer’s mind that inventory will be put on sale. Research has shown  
that there can be cases in which a seller should pursue a mixed strategy — that is, sometimes  
not mark down inventory even when it would maximize short-run revenue for him to do  
so, or even withhold inventory from a markdown to reduce the probability that a customer  
who waits for a sale will be able to purchase at a discount. The point of both of these strat-  
egies is to artificially reduce the probability that customers who wait will be able to find  
inventory on sale, therefore encouraging them to purchase now at full price.  
12.5 MARKDOWN MANAGEMENT IN ACTION  
Automated markdown management and optimization systems were first developed and  
deployed at scale in the 1990s. One motivator was a dramatic expansion in retail capacity  
in the 1990s, which was followed by the need to focus on improving operations. Another  
reason was the arrival of the 800-pound gorilla of brick-and-mortar retailing\: Walmart.  
With its wildly successful everyday-low-pricing policy, Walmart forced its competitors to  
improve every facet of their operations, from purchasing and logistics through pricing and  
promotions. While retailing has always been a thin-margin business, the need to wring  
every penny of profit from the market has never been greater.  
The first widely publicized success of markdown optimization was at ShopKo. In 2000,  
ShopKo, which operated 141 discount stores under the ShopKo name and another 229  
smaller, rural discount stores under the Pamida brand, installed a markdown optimiza- 334  
markdown management  
tion system developed by Spotlight Solutions. A pilot program showed a 14% increase in  
revenue from using the markdown optimization software. The success of the ShopKo pilot  
was widely reported, including in a Wall Street Journal article, helping to spur interest in  
the potential for such solutions. In addition to ShopKo, retailers that have announced the  
adoption of markdown optimization systems include the Gap, JCPenney, Home Depot,  
Bloomingdale’s, Sears, and Circuit City.  
Markdown managements systems were initially developed for traditional retailers, who  
typically order their inventory well in advance — often six months or so — and then have it  
delivered by ocean shipping. For these retailers, there is usually no opportunity to replenish  
stock during the season \(at least at a regional level\), which means that ordering inventory  
for the season is a one-shot deal. As we have seen, this creates a strong incentive to order  
substantial amounts of inventory at the beginning of a season and then rely on a markdown  
strategy to maximize revenue from the inventory. One of the most successful innovations  
in retailing in the past 30 years is fast fashion, pioneered by the Spanish retailer Zara. In  
contrast to traditional retailers, Zara and other fast-fashion retailers, such as H&M and  
Forever 21, use a much more rapid supply chain to allow multiple replenishments during  
a season. This allows them to purchase much less initial inventory, thereby reducing the  
need for markdowns — the fraction of items that go on markdown at Zara is less than 20%,  
compared to 40% at traditional retailers. Furthermore, Zara realized 85% of list price on  
marked-down inventory compared to 25% on the part of traditional retailers. Nonetheless,  
Zara sponsored the development of a markdown optimization system tailored to its specific  
needs that is credited for increasing revenue from marked-down inventory by 6% \(Caro  
and Gallien 2012\).  
It should be noted that markdown optimization is equally applicable to online and offline  
fashion retailers. Online retailers have the same need to clear excess inventory as their  
offline counterparts, and many of them use markdown optimization systems to maximize  
the return from their inventory.  
In theory, markdown optimization increases revenue by optimizing the timing and  
depth of each markdown decision. In practice, a substantial portion of the benefits from  
markdown optimization comes from two sources. First, human decision makers typically  
wait too long to begin marking down inventory and then take very large markdowns. The  
reason seems to be that the people making markdown decisions tend to be the same people  
who bought the merchandise in the first place and are reluctant to appear to admit a mis-  
take by marking down. As the pioneering American retailer E. A. Filene put it\:  
One of the few certainties in retailing is that some of the merchandise bought enthusiasti-  
cally in the wholesale market, where it looks eminently saleable, will, when it reaches the  
store, prove stubbornly unsaleable. But despite this inevitability, buyers, like the rest of  
humanity, are reluctant to admit and address their errors. They find endless excuses for the  
slow sale of merchandise\: the weather’s still too hot; the weather’s still too cold. Easter’s late  
this year; Easter was early this year. It hasn’t been advertised; the ad was lousy; the ad ran on  
the wrong day; the ad ran in the wrong newspaper. markdown management 335  
The danger in these rationalizations is that they usually increase markdowns. A coat that  
does not sell early in the fall may still tempt customers if it is marked down early by as little  
as 25 percent. But as the season ends, it must be marked down far more drastically to tempt  
a customer who, having done without a new coat for so long, may otherwise reasonably  
decide to wait until the next season. \(Quoted in Harris 1982, 132\)  
Markdown optimization systems have generally resulted in retailers’ taking smaller dis-  
counts earlier than they used to do, usually substantially increasing overall revenue \(Namin,  
Ratchford, and Soysal 2017\); E. A. Filene’s observation from 1910 has been vindicated, over  
100 years later.  
A second important benefit from markdown management systems has been their abil-  
ity to tailor markdown schedules to the particular characteristics of individual regions or  
stores. In many cases, retailers had simply used the same markdown cadence for all stores in  
a chain\: a particular style of sweater would be marked down by the same amount at the same  
time in Boston as in Los Angeles. Markdown management systems have been an important  
catalyst for enabling different markdown schedules for different stores. Canadian apparel  
retailer Northern Group Retail Ltd. implemented a markdown management solution from  
ProfitLogic \(now part of Oracle\) that it credited for helping move the company away from  
chainwide discounting to an approach “more attuned to regional needs, weather patterns,  
and other trends” \(McPartlin 2004, 50\). In another example, a men’s retail clothing chain  
traditionally put swimsuits on sale in September in all its stores nationwide. This made  
sense in northern locations such as Boston, Chicago, and New York, where the summer  
season was ending, but it made little sense in Orlando and Miami, where the tourist season  
was just beginning. The adoption of a markdown management system was the catalyst that  
enabled the chain to establish different markdown schedules in New York and Miami.  
12.6 SUMMARY

Under a markdown policy, the price of an item is sequentially decreased until either  
it sells or a selling period expires. Markdowns are widely used in a variety of indus-  
tries — notably fashion goods and short-life-cycle products. The use of markdowns  
has been growing steadily in the United States, at least since World War II.  
A markdown policy is effective when the item for sale is perishable, supply is limited,  
and the desirability of the item decreases as it approaches its expiration date.  
A markdown policy is also a way for a seller to maximize expected revenue when  
supply is constrained and he is uncertain about the distribution of customer willing-  
ness to pay.  
Markdowns enable a seller to segment his customers between those who are willing  
to pay more to buy early and those who are willing to wait in order to save money.  
When price-response functions are known, the markdown optimization problem  
can be formulated and solved as a mathematical program. 336  
markdown management

When price-response functions are uncertain, the markdown optimization problem  
can be formulated and solved as a dynamic program. This requires starting in the  
last period and working backward in time to determine the optimal policy for the  
present.  
Business constraints such as a limit on the number of markdowns that can be taken  
or minimum time intervals between sequential markdowns can significantly add to  
the complexity of the markdown problem. When the markdown problem is highly  
constrained, it can be more efficient to solve it using exhaustive search than to apply  
explicit optimization.  
Another consideration in markdown management is the presence of strategic con-  
sumers who anticipate the possibility of a markdown and may wait to take advantage  
of a lower price. When strategic consumers are present, it may be profitable for a  
seller to destroy unsold inventory rather than mark it down or to adopt a mixed  
strategy and randomize the decision to mark down.  
Many of the benefits of real-world markdown management implementations have  
come from taking smaller discounts earlier than customary practice and from the  
ability to derive markdown cadences tailored to the specific situations of individual  
stores within a chain.  
12.7 FURTHER READING  
More discussion of markdown optimization can be found in Smith 2009, which describes  
results at some retailers. Valkov 2006 describes other successful implementations. Namin,  
Ratchford, and Soysal 2017 compares the results of different markdown approaches to  
human-managed markdowns. Ramakrishnan 2012 has an extensive discussion of practi-  
cal considerations in modeling markdowns, including the incorporation of business con-  
straints and the use of exhaustive search. Hamermesh, Roberts, and Pirmohamed 2002  
presents a case study of the challenges faced by ProfitLogic, one of the earliest commercial  
providers of markdown optimization software.  
Markdown pricing in the presence of strategic customers has been a topic of consider-  
able research over the last decade or so. For a survey, see Gönsch et al. 2013. On using a  
mixed strategy, see Gallego, Phillips, and Sahin 2008. On withholding inventory, see Liu  
and van Ryzin 2008. Özer and Zheng 2016 considers the effect of potential customer regret  
on the decision of whether to mark down inventory.  
12.8 EXERCISES  
1\. Extend the two-period markdown model in Section 12.1.1 to three periods. That  
is, assume that the price-response function is d\(p\) = 1,000 – 100p, marginal cost  
is 0, and customers purchase as soon as price falls below their willingness to pay.  
What three prices, p1, p2, and p3, will maximize total revenue? What if there are four  
periods and four prices? What is the general formula for n prices? markdown management 337  
2\. 3. 4. Now extend the two-period markdown model in Section 12.1.1 to the case where  
customers have a lower willingness to pay for the good in the second period. Spe-  
cifically, assume that each customer’s willingness to pay in the second period is 75%  
of her willingness to pay in the first period. All other assumptions remain the same.  
a. What is the optimal price and corresponding total revenue for the seller, assum-  
ing he can charge only a single price in both periods?  
b. What are the optimal prices and corresponding total revenue, assuming he can  
charge different prices in the two periods?  
A department store has 700 pairs of purple capri stretch pants that it must sell in  
the next four weeks. The store manager knows that demand by week for the next  
four weeks will be linear, with the following price-response functions\:  
Week 1\: d1\(p1\) = 1,000 – 100p1  
Week 2\: d2\(p2\) = 800 – 100p2  
Week 3\: d3\(p3\) = 700 – 100p3  
Week 4\: d4\(p4\) = 600 – 100p4  
Assume that the demands in the different weeks are independent — that is, that  
­ customers who do not buy in a given week do not come back in subsequent  
weeks.  
a. What is the optimum price the retailer should charge per pair if he can only set  
one price for all four weeks? What is the corresponding revenue?  
b. Assume he can charge a different price each week. What are the optimum prices  
by week he should charge? What is the corresponding revenue?  
Consider a seller who wants to sell a product in two periods when all customers are  
strategic\: they all fully anticipate the actions of the seller and choose to purchase  
in the first period, wait to purchase in the second period, or do not purchase at  
all. There are two classes of customers\: low-willingness-to-pay customers have a  
maximum willingness to pay of \$4, while high-willingness-to-pay customers have  
a maximum willingness to pay of \$10. All customers maximize expected value and,  
if demand exceeds supply in either period, the limited supply will be allocated ran-  
domly to all customers without regard to their willingness to pay. In either period,  
the seller can set a price of either \$2 or \$7. The seller must choose what price to  
charge in each period as well as the total amount of the product to purchase. The  
unit cost of the product is \$1 and the salvage value is \$0.  
a. Assume that there are 10,000 low-willingness-to-pay customers and 5,000 high-  
willingness-to-pay customers. How much should the seller order and put on sale  
to maximize profitability? What price should he charge in period 1 and in period  
2? What is the resulting revenue?  
b. Now, assume that the seller can charge any price he wants in both periods — that  
is, he is not constrained to \$2 or \$7. What price would he charge and how much  
would he order? 338

5\. The questions in this problem are variations on Example 12.4. The best way to  
answer them is to build a spreadsheet model that calculates the revenue for the  
­ different policies under different parameter values. Each subproblem starts with  
the values as in the example — that is, the subproblems are independent, not cumu-  
lative.  
a. b. c. d. Consider the markdown problem in Example 12.4. What is the optimal policy  
if everything else is the same as in the example, but the salvage value is \$0 per  
television?  
What is the optimal policy if the starting inventory is 120 instead of 95?  
What is the optimal policy if the seller wants to have at least 10 television sets  
remaining at the end of the third week to provide sufficient inventory for his  
outlet store?  
What is the optimal policy and corresponding revenue if each markdown  
generates additional demand of 5 television sets on top of the standard de-  
mand? Assume that the additional demand occurs once, in the period when the  
markdown occurs. That is, if the seller adopts the policy \(\$500, \$450, \$450\), he  
will generate an additional 5 units of demand in week 2; if he adopts the policy  
\(\$500, \$450, \$350\), he will generate an additional 5 units of demand in week 2  
and in week 3.notes  
1\. These examples and others can be found in Warner and Barski 1995.  
2\. In this section, I use the terms markdown management and markdown optimization  
interchangeably.  
3\. This model was first proposed by in Lazear 1986.  
4\. TKTS is a nonprofit consortium of theaters operating a discount-ticket booth.  
Obtaining tickets at the discount prices requires waiting in line, and there is no guarantee  
that the show you want will be available when you get to the counter. Thus, TKTS creates  
an inferior product that can be sold at a lower price with minimal cannibalization of full-  
price tickets.  
5\. The term Dutch auction has also been used for a somewhat different method for  
selling multiple products in financial markets and on eBay, leading to some confusion.  
6\. There is no requirement that the periods need to be of equal length. If, for example,  
the retailer had a policy that all items had to be sold at list price for at least three weeks  
before being marked down for the first time, the first period would be three weeks long,  
and there would be only 13 total pricing periods for the season.  
7\. Strictly speaking, constraint 12.4 is not required, since the optimal solution to  
MDOWN will never result in a markdown price that is less than the salvage value.

agement, including additional examples of path reduction rules, see Ramakrishnan 2012.

incorporated in modeling markdown demand, see Ramakrishnan 2012. 13 Customized Pricing  
13.1 BACKGROUND AND BUSINESS SETTING  
The pricing tactics we have studied so far all assume that buyers and sellers interact in the  
same basic fashion. The seller offers a stock of goods to different customer segments, pos-  
sibly through different channels. Customers arrive, observe a price, and decide whether  
to purchase. The seller decides what price to offer for each product to each customer type  
through each channel. The seller monitors sales of his goods and periodically updates the  
prices and /or availabilities he is offering. This is the list-pricing modality and it is character-  
ized by the fact that the seller publishes to customers a price or set of prices that are gener-  
ally final and nonnegotiable. All the methodologies covered so far, including peak load  
pricing, revenue management, and markdown management, assume list pricing.  
List pricing may seem quite general— in fact, it is what first comes to mind when people  
think about pricing. However, there is another important pricing modality —customized  
pricing— that is of equal or greater importance in many industries. In customized pricing,  
potential customers approach the seller, one by one, and the seller quotes each one a price.  
Often \(but not always\) each potential buyer wants something different — either a different  
bundle of products or services, a different quantity, or a different variation on a basic prod-  
uct. In customized pricing, the seller can quote a different price for each request. A price list  
may exist, but it is usually an upper bound on the price quoted. The price quoted to a buyer  
can be based on knowledge of the individual buyer, the product\(s\) requested by the buyer,  
and other factors, such as general market conditions and competitive offerings. Following  
are some examples of customized pricing.  
•  
Auto lending. e-Car is an online auto lender. A customer arriving at the e-Car website  
fills out a loan application with information about the customer’s identity. The loan  
application also specifies the term and amount of the loan, along with whether the  
loan would be used to purchase a new car, purchase a used car, or refinance an exist-  
ing car loan. Using this information, e-Car will pull a credit score for the customer, customized pricing 341  
•  
•  
•  
•  
estimate the riskiness of the loan, and determine whether to extend a loan to the  
customer.  
If an applicant is judged too risky, e-Car will reject her application. If an applicant  
is judged creditworthy, e-Car will offer her a loan and quote an annual percentage  
rate \(APR\) for the loan along with the monthly payment. The customer has 45 days  
to accept the loan. If the customer does not accept the loan within 45 days, the offer  
expires and the customer is considered lost.  
e-Car can use all of the information in the application including the customer’s  
credit score, the amount and term of the loan, and whether it is for a used car, a  
new car, or a refinance in determining the rate to quote to the customer. Since  
e-Car can quote different rates to different customers, this is a customized-pricing  
problem.1  
Trucking services. Businesses that purchase trucking services usually solicit bids from  
a number of competing carriers, such as Old Dominion and YRC. Each carrier will  
submit a bid detailing a price schedule at which it will carry freight for the customer  
for some period of time, usually a year. Each carrier faces the problem of determin-  
ing what price schedule to bid.  
Telecommunications services. A telecommunication company sells a menu of telecom-  
munications services to corporate, educational, and government customers. It can  
determine a price to bid for each customer depending on the size and type of cus-  
tomer, the services it requires, and the amount of business it might generate. It has  
categorized its customers according to the division in Table 13.1. For each customer  
in each category, the telecommunication company bids annually to provide services  
for that customer in the following year.  
Automotive fleet sales. A metropolitan police department wants to purchase 50 police  
cars. It solicits bids from Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler. The bid solicitation  
describes the performance and options required. Each of the three manufacturers  
needs to determine what price to bid.  
Medical equipment. A hospital has decided to purchase a magnetic resonance imag-  
ing \(MRI\) machine to improve its diagnostic capabilities. It sends copies of a request  
for proposal \(RFP\) to the five leading MRI manufacturing companies. The RFP spec-  
ifies the required capability as well as the criteria the hospital will choose to deter-  
mine the winning bidder. Each of the manufacturing companies needs to determine  
what price to bid.

customized pricing  
The customized-pricing modality has three characteristics that differentiate it from list  
pricing.  
1\. 2. 3. Customers approach the seller prior to seeing a final price. In the cases described  
above, the customer takes the initiative and describes what she wants to purchase  
prior to seeing the price.  
The seller can quote a different price to each customer. The customized price can \(and  
should\) reflect the best information — including customer-specific information —  
that the seller has at that time. Of course, the seller will usually not have perfect  
information about the preferences of any individual customer or about competitive  
prices. But, as we will see, he can use statistical reasoning to increase his expected  
profitability for each bid.  
In customized pricing, the seller can track lost business. In a customized-pricing situa-  
tion, the seller will either win — that is, get the business — or lose. In some \(but not  
all\) situations, a losing seller can find out which of his competitors won the busi-  
ness. However, even when this information is not available, the buyer knows that  
a potential customer has inquired about his product and decided not to purchase.  
This is in contrast to list pricing, in which the seller can only observe how many  
units he sold — not how many customers considered buying his product but de-  
cided against it. This lost bid information is important because it can form the basis  
for statistical estimation of customer bid-response functions.  
The existence of a bid or a price quote is a common element in customized pricing. In  
business-to-business settings, the quote is often in response to an RFP or a request for  
quote \(RFQ\) issued by a buyer. In business-to-consumer situations, such as unsecured  
consumer loans and mortgages, the final price quote usually occurs after a customer has  
made a phone call or filled out an application. In any case, the price quote occurs only after  
the seller knows something about the buyer and what she wants. This contrasts with list  
pricing, in which potential customers find prices by accessing a price list \(online or in a  
catalog\) or reading a label in a store and the prices need to be set before the seller has infor-  
mation about any individual customer.  
List pricing and customized pricing often coexist, in the sense that a seller will use  
a list price to set a ceiling, while most customers are quoted a price at a discount from  
the list. For example, the manufacturer’s suggested retail price \(MSRP\) is usually an up-  
per limit on the price for, say, a new car, with the selling price ultimately determined by  
some combination of the customer’s ability to negotiate and the dealer’s willingness to  
sell at a lower price.2 In a similar vein, shipping companies maintain voluminous tariff  
schedules that specify list prices for shipping different types of freight between every zip  
code pair in the United States. However, only a small fraction of sales \(usually less than  
5%\) takes place at list price. The rest moves at discounted rates negotiated individually  
with customers.  
In the remainder of this chapter, we formulate the customized-pricing decision as an  
optimization problem and see how that problem can be solved to maximize the expected customized pricing 343  
contribution margin from each bid. A key element in the customized-pricing problem is  
the bid-response function, which specifies the seller’s expectation of how each customer will  
respond to his bid price. We see how bid-response functions can be estimated for differ-  
ent customers who are seeking to purchase different products. We then look at how the  
customized-pricing model can be enhanced to deal with other pricing settings as well as  
objectives other than maximizing expected contribution. Finally, we examine how these  
computations fit into a general process for customized pricing.  
13.2 CALCULATING OPTIMAL CUSTOMIZED PRICES  
To motivate the formulation of the customized-pricing problem, we put ourselves in the  
place of a seller who has been asked to bid on a potential deal. Here, deal means a particular  
piece of business, which may be a single order or a contract to provide future products and  
services. Bid means the price we offer.3 This is a simplified setting because it assumes the  
buyer has dictated all elements of the deal and that the only decision on the part of the seller  
is what price to bid. In the real world, a seller may also have to decide on other elements in  
his bid, such as delivery date, contract terms and conditions, and even product functional-  
ity. Furthermore, we assume initially that the seller is submitting a single take-it-or-leave-it  
bid. Of course, in many situations, not only price but every element of the deal may well be  
on the table and there may be more than one round of negotiation.  
The first thing we need to determine is our goal for this bid. That is, what is our objective  
function? For now, we assume that we want to maximize expected contribution from the  
bid. For a given price, p, expected contribution can be expressed as  
Expected contribution at price p = \(contribution at p\)  
× \(probability of winning bid at p\) \(13.1\)  
The first term on the right-hand side of Equation 13.1 is the deal contribution— the mar-  
gin we will realize if we win the bid. If the bid is to sell d units of an item with unit cost of  
c, then our deal contribution would be \(p – c\)d. The calculation of deal contribution would  
be more complicated if we were bidding to supply a complex bundle of products and ser-  
vices, each of which has a different unit cost, or if we were negotiating a contract for future  
services in which the volume and mix of services to be supplied were uncertain.  
The second term on the right-hand side of Equation 13.1 is the probability that we will  
win the deal at a given price. Our uncertainty about winning at a given price derives from  
two sources.  
•  
•  
Competitive uncertainty. We do not know what our competitors will bid. In fact, in  
many cases we may not know the identity or even the number of competitors we  
face.  
Preference uncertainty. We usually do not know exactly what criteria \(both conscious  
and unconscious\) the buyer will use to evaluate competitive bids. Nor do we know  
for sure how the buyer values our brand and our product /service offerings relative to  
the competition. 344  
customized pricing  
In most situations, both preference uncertainty and competitive uncertainty will be pre-  
sent\: we will not know exactly what our competitors are going to bid; nor will we know  
exactly how the buyer will choose among competing bids. Of course, if we knew what our  
competitors were bidding and how the buyer would choose among bids, our problem  
would be relatively simple —we would submit the highest-price bid that would win \(as-  
suming that we would be profitable at that price\). However, in the real world, sellers rarely,  
if ever, have access to that level of information — at least not legitimately.  
There is, however, one important situation in which preference uncertainty is absent —  
when we know that the buyer is going to choose the lowest bid. Many government agen-  
cies are required by law to purchase from the lowest bidder. In these situations, the agency  
often issues extremely detailed specifications for the goods to be purchased so that price is  
the only difference among bids. In a seller auction \(also called a reverse auction\), the buyer  
initially selects a set of acceptable suppliers and commits to purchase from the lowest bid-  
der. In most seller auctions, each supplier has the opportunity to observe the bids of other  
suppliers and then to submit a lower bid if he desires to do so. The ability to rebid based on  
the bids of other suppliers is not addressed here.  
13.2.1 Single-Competitor Model  
Imagine you are an auto manufacturer bidding against a single competitor to sell 50 pickup  
trucks to a county park district. The park district will buy all 50 trucks from a single sup-  
plier and is committed by law to pick the lowest bidder. Each supplier has been asked to  
submit a single sealed bid. The bids are final, and the lower of the two bids will win. Your  
production cost per truck is \$10,000. Based on past experience, your belief about what  
your competitor will bid can be described by a uniform distribution between \$9,000 and  
\$14,000, as shown in Figure 13.1. What should you bid to maximize expected profitability?  
Call your bid p and the competing bid q. You will win if your bid is less than the com-  
peting bid — that is, if p \< q. \(For simplicity, we ignore the possibility of a tie.\) Let ρ\(p\) be

the probability that you would win if you bid price p. Then ρ\(p\) = 1 – F\(p\), where F is the  
cumulative distribution function of the competing bid — that is, F\(x\) is the probability that  
the competing bid will be less than x. Your probability of winning the bid as a function of  
price is shown in Figure 13.2. If you bid below \$9,000, then you will win for sure, since you  
know that the competitor will bid more than \$9,000. Your probability of winning the bid  
decreases linearly between \$9,000 and \$14,000 and is zero if you bid above \$14,000.  
The expression ρ\(p\) denotes the bid-response function for this deal\: Figure 13.2 shows  
the bid-response function in the case described above. For each deal, the bid-response  
function specifies the probability of winning the deal as a function of our bid. It is  
the customized-pricing analog of the price-response function introduced in Chapter 3.  
Where the price-response function specifies total expected demand as a function of list  
price, the bid-response function specifies the probability of winning an individual bid as a  
function of bid. Like the price-response function, the bid-response function is downward  
sloping; that is, the probability of winning the bid decreases as the bid price increases. The  
bid-response probability is less than or equal to 1 for all prices and decreases to 0 at high  
bids. For the example, the bid-response function is given by

The objective function in Equation 13.3 is maximized at p\* = \$12,000. At this price, the  
probability of winning the bid is 2.8 – 12,000/5,000 = .4. The margin per unit if the deal is  
won is \$12,000 – \$10,000 = \$2,000 and the expected margin is .4 × 50 × \$2,000 = \$40,000.  
Figure 13.3 shows how expected profit varies as a function of bid. The expected profit  
function has the familiar hill shape. At a bid price below \$9,000, we are certain to win  
the deal, but at a loss. Above \$9,000, the probability of winning the bid decreases. Ex-  
pected profit is positive for any bid above the cost of \$10,000. Above \$10,000, unit mar-  
gin increases with increasing price, but this increase is counterbalanced by the decreasing  
chance of winning the deal. At \$12,000, these two effects balance, and expected contribu-  
tion is maximized. Above \$12,000, decreasing chances of winning the deal overwhelm the  
increased margin. At any bid above \$14,000, you are certain to lose the deal, so expected  
contribution is \$0.  
The optimization problem in Equation 13.3 is identical to the problem confronting a  
seller facing a deterministic price-response function of 50\(2.8 – p/5,000\)+ and a unit cost  
of \$10,000. In both cases, the optimal price is \$12,000. However, there is an important dif-  
ference between the two situations. A seller facing a deterministic price-response function  
of d\(p\) = 50\(2.8 – p/5,000\) and charging \$12,000 per unit will sell exactly 20 units and will  
make a profit of \$40,000. But in the bid-response case, by bidding \$12,000 per unit, the  
seller will either win the bid and sell 50 units, for a total contribution of \$100,000, or the  
seller will lose the bid and realize nothing. Changing the bid does not change the number of  
units sold; it changes the probability of selling all the units. At the optimal bid of \$12,000,  
the seller has a 40% chance of winning the deal and making \$100,000 and a 60% chance of  
losing the deal and making nothing.  
13.2.2 Multiple Competitors  
We would naturally expect the addition of more competitors to reduce the probability of  
winning a deal. Otherwise, we would be willing to pay additional companies to compete  
against us —behavior that is never seen in real life. We can see the effect of multiple com-  
petitors using the simple example of the county park district. What if we faced two com-  
petitors instead of one bidding for the order of 50 pickup trucks? To simplify matters, let us customized pricing 347  
assume we have identical beliefs about how both competitors will bid. That is, we believe  
that both competitor 1 and competitor 2 will each price according to the uniform distribu-  
tion shown in Figure 13.1.  
We also assume that the two competing bids will be independent — that is, that informa-  
tion about one competitor’s bid would not change our assessment of the bid distribution  
of the other competitor. While the independence assumption may generally be reasonable,  
there are situations where it is not appropriate. One case would be when we believe that our  
two competitors are colluding to coordinate their bids. The second case would be when the  
two competitors are not necessarily colluding but are basing their bids on joint information  
that we do not share. If both of the competitors share a common cost \(say, from a common  
supplier\) and that cost is unknown to us, learning what one of them planned to bid might  
enable us to estimate the common cost and therefore to come up with a better estimate of  
what the other competitor would bid. In that case, the bids would not be independent.  
We will win the deal if and only if our bid is below the lower of the bids submitted by  
competitor 1 and competitor 2. For a given p, the probability that our bid will be lower  
than the bid from competitor 1 is 1 – F\(p\) = 2.8 – p/5,000, which, by assumption, is also the  
probability that our bid will be lower than the bid from competitor 2. Since competitors 1  
and 2 are submitting independent bids, the probability that p will be lower than both com-  
peting bids is ρ\(p\) = \(2.8 – p/5,000\)2. This bid-response function is shown in Figure 13.4.  
You can see that the addition of the second competitor decreases our chance of winning the  
bid for all realistic prices.  
With two competitors, our expected contribution is given by 50\(2.8 – p/5,000\)2 \(p –  
10,000\). The price that maximizes expected revenue is p\* = \$11,333.33 per unit, with a cor-  
responding probability of winning the bid of 28.4% and an expected total profit of \$18,963.  
Note that the additional competition creates pain for us in two ways\: our optimal bid is  
lower, so total contribution is lower if we win the deal, and our probability of winning the

deal is lower, even at our lower bid. The overall effect is dramatic\: Our expected contribu-  
tion from the deal is reduced by more than 50% from \$40,000 to less than \$19,000. This is  
a graphic illustration of the power of competition to reduce both the price and the profit-  
ability of a deal. Obviously, there is a strong incentive for the buyer to increase the number  
of bidders — or at least make the bidders believe there are more competitors!  
As a matter of reference, the probability that a bid p is the lowest when there are n com-  
petitors submitting independent bids is given by  
g\(p\) = \[1 – F1\(p\)\]  \[1 – F2\(p\)\]  . . .  \[1 – F  
n\(p\)\], \(13.4\)  
where Fi\(x\) is the cumulative distribution function on the price bid by competitor i— that  
is, the probability that competitor i will bid less than x.  
Equation 13.4 gives the probability that our bid will be the lowest in any situation where  
competitors are submitting independent bids. If the buyer is choosing a winner based  
strictly on lowest bid, then this also gives our probability of winning at any price; that is,  
ρ\(p\) = g\(p\). However, if the buyer is taking factors other than price into account when  
choosing a winner, then our probability of winning the bid will not be the same as our  
probability that we have submitted the lowest bid.  
13.2.3 Nonprice Factors in Bid Selection  
So far, we have assumed that the buyer makes her purchasing decision based entirely on  
price. This is the exception rather than the rule. Price is almost always a factor in bid selec-  
tion, but it is rarely the only factor. It is much more common for a buyer to make her choice  
based on a combination of factors. Sometimes the buyer will lay out her decision criteria in  
an RFP, perhaps like this example\:  
•  
•  
•  
Previous experience with supplier —10%  
Quality of proposal—5%  
Technical fit of solution —25%  
•  
Price — 60%  
In this case, the buyer is declaring that price will be the most important factor in her decision  
but that other factors will also be considered.4 In most cases, the buyer does not pro-  
vide even that much information. From the sellers’ point of view, the buyer is going to  
make her decision based on some combination of objective factors, such as price and solu-  
tion fitness, and subjective factors, such as the brand image of the seller, the buyer’s experi-  
ence \(or lack of it\) with the different sellers, and even the personal relationship the buyer  
might have with a seller’s sales representative. These elements need to be incorporated into  
the process of optimal customized pricing.  
To make this more specific, consider the case of a large insurance company deciding to  
purchase 150 laptop computers for a new branch office. The information technology \(IT\)  
department invites Lenovo and Hewlett-Packard \(HP\) to bid on this business. Lenovo and  
HP both know they are the only suppliers invited to bid. However, both of them also know  
that the company has only purchased Lenovo computers in the past, that its overall expe- customized pricing 349  
rience with Lenovo has been good, and that the purchasing agent has a good relationship  
with the Lenovo sales representative. In this case, both HP and Lenovo are likely to believe  
that Lenovo has an edge on this deal. In the extreme case, HP might believe that Lenovo has  
a lock on the deal and the buyer is only going through a competitive bidding process to sat-  
isfy its own internal procedures and to keep Lenovo honest. If HP truly believes this, then it  
is facing a bid-response function such that ρ\(p\) = 0 for any value of p ≥ c ; that is, it stands  
no chance of winning the deal. HP might still bid — if only to keep pressure on Lenovo and  
to signal HP’s willingness to sell to the buyer in the future —but it would need to use these  
strategic considerations to determine which price to set.  
In the more likely scenario, HP might feel that Lenovo has an edge but that HP has a  
shot at winning the business if it significantly beats Lenovo’s price. How can this situation  
be addressed? One possibility is for HP to estimate Lenovo’s bid premium on this deal. The  
HP sales representative might believe that HP needs to bid at least \$200 per laptop less than  
Lenovo to win. This bid premium reflects the edge that Lenovo has won through its strong  
history and good relationship with the customer.  
It is easy to incorporate this type of premium into the calculation of the optimal custom-  
ized price. Let us assume for a moment that HP’s cumulative distribution on Lenovo’s bid  
is F\(x\); that is, for any x, HP believes that the probability that Lenovo will submit a total bid  
less than x is F\(x\). If Lenovo and HP were at parity — that is, neither one had a premium  
relative to the other — then the buyer would be choosing a supplier based strictly on price  
and, as described in Section 13.2.1, the bid-response function ρ\(p\) would be equal to 1 –  
F\(p\). The effect of a \$200-per-unit premium for Lenovo is to shift this bid-response func-  
tion to the left by 150 × \$200 = \$30,000, as shown in Figure 13.5. In other words, HP needs

to bid \$30,000 lower on the deal to achieve the same probability of winning as it would  
without the premium. For any potential bid p, HP’s probability of winning is the prob-  
ability that Lenovo’s total bid is greater than p + \$30,000 and HP’s bid-response function is  
ρ\(p\) = 1 – F\(p + 30,000\). As shown in Figure 13.5, the net effect is that, for any bid it might  
make, HP faces a lower probability of winning the deal than if it were at parity with Lenovo.  
In this situation, HP can calculate its optimal bid by solving Equation 13.4 using the shifted  
bid-response function \(see Exercise 1\).  
Let us pause here to consider several points. First, it is unlikely that HP would know  
Lenovo’s exact bid premium. In fact, HP might be uncertain about which seller actually  
enjoys a premium; that is, HP may not know whether the buyer favors HP or Lenovo or  
is truly neutral between the two vendors. In this case, the bid premium itself is a ran-  
dom variable. Second, the buyer has a strong motivation to mislead the sellers about her  
preferences — or at least to be selective with her communication. It is in the buyer’s best  
interest for each bidder to believe that the other bidder is preferred and therefore enjoys  
a premium. Thus, the buyer may overstate her satisfaction and loyalty to Lenovo when  
talking to the HP sales representative and to deny any loyalty to Lenovo when talking  
to the Lenovo sales representative. Of course, both Lenovo and HP should have savvy  
sales representatives who know enough to take such statements with the requisite grains  
of salt.  
Third, regardless of the posturing and misrepresentation that may take place, at the end  
of the day each seller must take all the information it has available to it and craft the best bid  
that it can \(or decide not to bid\). Information is likely to be asymmetrical among sellers\: As  
the incumbent, Lenovo should know much more about the buyer and her needs than HP  
does. Since different sellers have different levels of information, the bid-response functions  
are subjective and specific to each seller. In our example, Lenovo may submit a bid that it  
believes has a 70% chance of winning, while HP submits a bid that it believes has a 45%  
chance of winning. Obviously, these estimates are inconsistent with each other, but that is  
no more unusual than two people with different beliefs or information assessing different  
probabilities for a given team to win a football game.  
13.2.4 The General Problem  
The customized-pricing problem for a particular deal is  
max  
p ρ\(p\)m\(p\), \(13.5\)  
where ρ\(p\) is the bid-response function, and m\(p\) is deal contribution at price p. For our  
purposes, ρ\(p\) will be a continuous, downward-sloping function of p, and m\(p\) will be  
a continuous, upward-sloping function of p. This means that the expected contribution  
from each deal will be a hill-shaped function of price as shown in Figure 13.3. Assume that  
satisfying the order will have an incremental cost of c. Then, we set the derivative of \(13.5\)  
with respect to price to 0 and apply some algebra to obtain

\(13.6\) customized pricing 351  
The expression on the right-hand side of Equation 13.6 is the bid-response elasticity— that  
is, the percentage change in probability of winning the bid that will result from a 1% change  
in price.5 It is the customized-pricing version of own-price elasticity. A bid-price elasticity  
of 2 means that a 1% increase in price will lead to a 2% decrease in the probability of winning  
the deal. The expression on the left-hand side of Equation 13.6 is the inverse of the con-  
tribution margin ratio. In other words, at the optimal customized price, the bid-response  
elasticity is equal to the inverse of the contribution margin ratio\:  
Bid-response elasticity at optimal price = 1/\(contribution margin ratio\)  
Equation 13.6 is the customized-price version of the condition for optimal list prices in  
Equation 5.7, which demonstrates the similarity of the customized-pricing optimization  
problem to the list price optimization problem. It also means that all of the conditions for  
existence and uniqueness of an optimal list price described in Section 5.2.1 can be applied  
to customized pricing.  
Note that using probabilities to represent our chances of winning a deal does not imply  
that either the buyer or our competition is making decisions by flipping a coin or using  
any other type of random process. Indeed, we would expect the competition to be setting  
the prices they will bid based on rational analysis of the opportunity — including their best  
information on what they believe we will bid. The uncertainty in the process arises entirely  
from our lack of information on the behavior of the other players in the bidding game\: the  
buyer and the competition.  
13.3 BID RESPONSE  
The most challenging part of optimizing customized prices is determining an appropriate  
bid-response function. If we had a bid-response function already in hand, finding the price  
that maximizes expected contribution is relatively simple — just solve the optimization  
problem in \(13.5\). So how do we estimate the bid-response function to use for a particular  
deal? There are at least three possibilities.  
•  
•  
•  
We could use bottom-up modeling to derive a bid-response function from our prob-  
ability distributions based on how we believe our competitors will bid and the selec-  
tion process we believe the buyer will use. This is what is done in Sections 13.2.1 and  
13.2.2.  
We could convene the people within the company who have knowledge of this  
particular deal, experience with the customer, understanding of the competition, and  
experience with similar bidding situations and derive a bid-response function based  
on their expert judgment. This approach is often used when a deal is particularly  
large, important, or unique. For example, the telecommunication company with the  
market segmentation shown in Table 13.1 might use this approach for preparing bids  
for the relatively small number of customers in the Global market segment.  
We could use statistical estimation based on the historical patterns of wins and  
losses we have experienced with the same \(or similar buyers\) in similar past bidding 352  
customized pricing  
­ situations. For the Growth and Metro segments in Table 13.1, it would be impossible  
for the telecommunication company to convene a panel of experts to independently  
strategize and prepare a unique bid for thousands of bids per month. We describe an  
approach that uses statistical analysis of prior bids to estimate an optimal price for  
each bid moving forward.  
Customized pricing requires two steps\: estimating the bid-response function and then op-  
timizing to find the price that maximizes the expected contribution for each bid. In this  
section, we consider estimation of the bid-response function.  
13.3.1 Estimating the Bid-Response Function  
We can use historical information about bids won and lost at different prices to estimate a  
bid-response function if three conditions hold.  
1\. 2. The historical record includes bids for similar products to similar customers.  
The current market conditions and products being offered are similar to those in  
the historical record.  
3\. There is a sufficient number of bids in the historical record to estimate a statistically  
significant bid-response function.  
Under these conditions, many different functions can be used to represent bid response,  
and these functions can be fit to historical data in a number of different ways. This chapter  
does not try to cover all the different bid-response functions; nor does it cover all the pos-  
sible estimation approaches, which would involve a long detour into statistical issues that  
are well outside the scope of this book. Rather, the chapter gives an overview of the most  
popular approach \(maximum likelihood estimation\) to estimating the most commonly  
used bid-response function \(the logit function\). Along the way, it mentions some of the  
alternatives and provides references to more extensive discussions of the pros and cons of  
different approaches.  
The starting point for the bid-response estimation process is a bid-history database. A  
simple example of a bid-history database is shown in Table 13.2, which shows the bid prices  
and the results of 40 bids for a hypothetical item. Note that the bids range from \$9.10 to  
\$9.80. For the first bid, the bid price was \$9.20 and the outcome was a win \(W\). On the  
other hand, for the third bid, the bid was \$9.70 and the outcome was a loss \(L\).  
We can visualize the relationship between price and wins and losses by assigning each  
win a value of 1 and each loss a value of 0. The outcomes of the 40 bids in Table 13.2 as a  
function of price are shown as a scatter plot in Figure 13.6. Graph A in Figure 13.6 shows  
the actual data; graph B in Figure 13.6 shows the same data with the points jittered — that  
is, a small random number has been added to each value. The sole purpose of jittering is  
to separate points representing multiple values; in analyses, only the unjittered values are  
used. It is apparent by looking at the chart that lower bids are more likely to win, but there is  
not a strict relationship between price and outcome\: some bids at \$9.50 were won and some  
bids at \$9.30 were lost. We want to find the bid-response function that best captures our T A B L E 1 3 . 2

probability of winning a bid at each price based on the results of these 40 bids —­ recognizing  
before we start that a bid-response function estimated on such a small amount of data is  
unlikely to have much statistical significance.  
Fitting a bid-response function to data such as those in Table 13.2 is a problem of statis-  
tical estimation similar to the problem of estimating a price-response model discussed in  
Chapter 4. In Chapter 4, the independent variables in the estimation of the price-response  
function are price and a set of exogenous variables, and the dependent variable is either  
total demand or the fraction of potential demand that would convert to actual demand.  
For customized pricing, the independent variable is price and all of the characteristics of a  
particular deal, and the dependent variable is the won /lost indicator, which can be either  
0 or 1. This means that we want to fit a function that incorporates information about each  
deal to predict a binary dependent value. This is a problem of binary or Bernoulli regres-  
sion.  
The first question we need to answer is\: What kind of function do we want to fit to the  
data in Table 13.2? One possibility is a linear model, which would correspond to a uniform  
probability density function on winning the bid, such as the one in Figure 13.1. The linear  
bid-response function that best fits the data in Table 13.2 can be determined using linear  
regression\: it is ρ\(p\) = 14.8 – 1.51p, shown in graph A of Figure 13.7 along with the jittered  
win /loss data.  
The linear price-response function in graph A of Figure 13.7 is not too unreasonable.  
It is continuous and downward sloping. Since it has a constant slope of –1.51, this price-  
response function implies that each increase of \$0.01 in price would result in a decreased  
probability of winning the bid of about 0.015. However, there are problems with a linear  
bid-response function. First, for prices above \$9.81 it predicts that the probability of win-  
ning is less than 0, and for prices less than about \$9.14 it predicts win probabilities greater  
than 1. Since probabilities must be between 0 and 1, a realistic bid-response function would  
need to be capped at 0 and 1 as shown in graph B of Figure 13.7.  
Even when capped, however, a linear price-response function is unrealistic. Inspection  
of Figure 13.7 indicates that the linear model \(capped or uncapped\) is not a very good fit  
to the data. For one thing, the linear model specifies that the change in probability from a  
\$0.01 price is the same for any price between \$9.14 and \$9.81. However, we would usually  
expect that the effect of changing our price would be greater when our probability of win-  
ning the bid is around 50% than when it is very high or very low. This would imply that we  
should consider an alternative form for the bid-response function.  
Consider the bid-reservation price— the maximum price at which the buyer would ac-  
cept our bid. \(The bid-reservation price is the customized-pricing equivalent of customer  
willingness to pay.\) If the bid-reservation price is \$9.50, then we will win the deal if we bid  
at any price of \$9.50 or less, and we will lose the deal if we bid above \$9.50. Of course, as a  
seller we do not know the buyer’s bid-reservation price — if we did, we would simply bid at  
that price \(assuming, of course, that it is above our variable cost\). This means we need to  
treat the bid-reservation price as a random variable, say, x, with a corresponding distribu-  
tion f\(x\) and cumulative distribution function F\(x\). At any price p, our probability of win-  
¯  
ning the bid is simply the probability that p ≤ x ; that is, ρ\(p\) = 1 – F\(p\) = F  
\(p\). Note that customized pricing 355

the cumulative distribution function incorporates both our preference uncertainty and our  
competitive uncertainty about the deal.  
The logit bid-response function. What form would we expect the bid-response func-  
tion, ρ\(p\), to have? If f \(x\) is uniform, then ρ\(p\) will be linear. But in most cases, we would  
expect f \(x\) not to be uniform but to be more or less bell shaped. When f \(x\) is bell shaped,  
the corresponding bid-response function ρ\(p\) has a reverse S shape — similar to the price-  
response function shown in Figure 3.6. When our bid price is very high or very low \(rela-  
tively speaking\), the effect of a small price change on our chance of winning the bid will be  
relatively small. However, when our price is in the more competitive intermediate range, we  
would expect that small changes in our price would have a larger effect on our chances of  
winning. Among the alternatives, by far the most common and convenient functional form  
for a bid-response function is the logit. 356

For a realistic bid-response function in which the probability of the bid is a decreasing  
function of price, we must have the parameter b \> 0. Various properties of the logit are de-  
scribed in Section 3.3.4, and its slope, hazard rate, and elasticity are shown in Table 3.3. The  
logit provides a smooth, realistic bid-response function, with the probability of winning  
the bid approaching 0 as price increases indefinitely. Note that Equation 13.7 is identical to  
Equation 3.11, with A = 1. This highlights that customized pricing is similar to list pricing,  
but with a sequential series of market-of-one pricing decisions rather than a single price  
that a population of customers will all see.  
Estimating a logit bid-response model. Section 4.2.2 describes how to use linear regres-  
sion to estimate a logit distribution when the target variable is the fraction of potential  
demand that converts at a price. In that case, the target variable is the conversion rate for  
each period, which is between 0 and 1, and we can use the transformation ln\[rt  
/\(1 – rt \)\]  
to convert the underlying model to a linear model. However, in the case of bid-response  
estimation, the target variable is the win indicator for each bid i, with Wi = 1 indicating that  
we won the bid and Wi = 0 indicating that we lost the bid. In either case, the transforma-  
tion ln\[Wi  
/\(1 – Wi \)\] is undefined, which means that we cannot convert the data to a linear  
model and use linear regression to estimate the parameters as we did with the logit model  
in Chapter 4. Fortunately, there is a very straightforward approach to the problem of logistic  
regression called maximum likelihood estimation \(MLE\).  
We specify the problem as follows. We have a sequence of historical bid observations i =  
1, 2, . . . , n. For each bid, we have the price that we bid, pi, and the corresponding outcome,  
Wi  
. We want to find the values of the parameters a and b such that Equation 13.7 best pre-  
dicts the observed values of Wi given the price bid pi  
. For any values of the parameters a  
and b, the probability of winning bid i is ρ\(pi\) = e  
a –bpi/\(1 + e  
a –bpi\), and the probability of  
losing bid i is 1 – ρ\(pi\) = 1/\(1 + e  
a –bpi\). We want to find the values of a and b that result in  
predictions of ρ\(pi\) that are each as close to the corresponding values Wi as possible.

1 means that we multiply the n individual elements together. MLE  
finds the values of a and b that maximize the likelihood of the actual observation. That is,  
MLE solves the nonlinear optimization problem maxa,b L\(a, b\), where L\(a, b\) is given by  
Equation 13.8.  
With a large number of observations, the likelihood associated with even a very good  
predictor will be very low. For example, assume we had a model that could predict, with  
90% accuracy, whether we would win or lose a bid — far higher than we will ever be able  
to achieve in practice. For a sample of 1,000 bids, the expected likelihood for such an esti-  
mator would be 0.91,000 = 1.75 × 10 – 46. Working with such tiny numbers presents all sorts  
of numerical problems. Therefore, the usual approach is to maximize the natural loga-  
rithm of the likelihood. Since the logarithm is an increasing function of the probability,  
the values of a and b that maximize likelihood will also maximize the logarithm of likeli-  
hood \(and vice versa\). So, in MLE, we find the values of a and b that solve the optimization

This is a much easier problem to work with than maximizing the likelihood function  
itself. Not only does it enable us to work with much more reasonable numeric values; it is  
additive, which makes it easier to work with in general. Note that, since the likelihood is  
always less than 1, the log likelihood will always be less than 0. Maximizing the log likeli-  
hood means finding the values that bring the value of Equation 13.9 as close to 0— the least  
negative value — as possible.  
Solving Equation 13.9 for the data in Table 13.2 gives us the values of a = – 80.576 and  
b = 8.506 as the maximum likelihood estimators for the logit parameters. The correspond-  
ing logit bid-response function is shown in Figure 13.8. Note that these parameter values  
imply that we would expect to win 50% of our bids if we set a price of 80.567/8.506 =  
\$9.47. The corresponding total log likelihood is –19.752. We can compare this to the log

logit response model has resulted in an improvement in log likelihood of about 30% over a  
constant estimator. In case this does not seem sufficiently impressive, we can look at it this  
way\: it improves the likelihood by a factor of 1,808!  
13.3.2 Extension to Multiple Dimensions  
We have seen how the parameters of the logit bid-response function can be estimated in the  
case of a single product being sold to a single customer segment through a single channel.  
In this case, we only need to estimate values for two parameters\: a and b. However, in most  
cases we would expect there to be differences in customers, channels, and products. Some  
of the differences that can occur include the following.  
Channel Variation  
•  
Internet versus call center  
•  
Retail versus wholesale  
•  
Direct versus indirect  
Product Variation  
•  
Size of order  
•  
Products ordered  
•  
Configuration of products  
•  
Ancillary services \(e.g., extended warranty\)  
Customer Variation  
•  
Size of customer  
•  
Location  
•  
Size of account  
•  
Business  
•  
New or repeat  
To maximize profitability, a company would like to use as many of these variables as  
possible in setting its prices. A new, small customer with a large order entering through the  
internet should get a different price from a repeat large customer with a small order enter-  
ing through a direct channel, and so on. In the extreme, we want to estimate different bid-  
response functions — and hence different optimal prices — for every element of the pricing  
and revenue optimization \(PRO\) cube in Figure 2.5.  
Customized pricing is commonly used for highly configured products, in which case  
the product dimension of the PRO cube can be quite rich. One example is the heavy truck  
manufacturing industry\: customized pricing 359  
The 2008 Model 388 Day Cab heavy truck sold by Peterbilt allows the customer to choose  
his desired options for thirty-four different components of the truck ranging from the rear-  
wheel mudflap hangers which can be straight, coiled, or tubular to fifteen different choices  
for rear axles to seven different transmissions to the choice between an aluminum or steel  
battery box. Multiplying the number of options in the Peterbilt list would imply that they  
could be combined in 75  1016 possible ways — each corresponding to a different truck.  
\(Phillips 2012a, 467\)  
The fact that each customer is likely to be ordering a different truck gives wide scope for  
the price to be customized. The question is how to determine the influence of different  
combinations of product characteristic, channel, and customer characteristic to determine  
the best price to offer for each transaction. To do this, we need to have information from  
historical bids about the customer segment, channel, and product\(s\) associated with that  
bid as well as the price and whether we won the bid. This richer set of information is illus-  
trated in Figure 13.9.  
We incorporate additional dimensions in the bid-response function by using a multi-  
variate logit function of the form  
ρ \( \) =  
pijk  
–  
e  
aijk bijk pijk  
–  
e  
aijk bijk pijk  
.  
1+ \(13.10\)  
Here, pijk is the price we offer to a customer of type i, purchasing a product of type j, through  
channel k, and aijk and bijk are the parameters of the corresponding logit function. Given a  
sufficient number of bids, we could use MLE to estimate these parameters, establishing a  
separate bid-response function for each cell in the PRO cube.  
The bid-response function specification in Equation 13.10 has a drawback\: estimating all  
the values of aijk and bijk requires running MLE independently for each cell in the PRO cube.  
However, reliable estimation of the parameters of the logit bid-response function requires  
at least 200 historical observations. In general, we cannot expect to have this many obser-  
vations for every cell. If we had 50 different products being sold to 10 different customer  
types through five channels, then our PRO cube would have 50 × 10 × 5 = 2,500 cells. For  
each cell to have 200 historical observations, we would need a historical-bid database with  
at least 2,500 × 200 = 500,000 entries. This approach would obviously be infeasible for the

­ Peterbilt example above where there are 75 × 1016 potential products — not even including  
the customer or channel dimensions. Most companies do not have anywhere near this  
much historical-bid data. This means that we have to reduce the dimensionality of the  
problem.  
One way to reduce dimensionality is to define a single value of a and a single value of b  
for each product, customer, and channel value, rather than for each combination. In this  
case, changing our notation slightly, our model becomes

where ai and bi are the parameter values estimated for customer type i, aj and bj are those  
estimated for a product of type j, and ak and bk are those estimated for channel type k.  
This reduces the number of parameters required for the 50-product, 10-customer-type,  
5-­ channel case from 5,000 to 2 × \(50 + 10 + 5\) = 130. The historical data required to derive  
a statistically reliable estimate of this smaller parameter set is much reduced.  
To see how this works, consider the case of a company that sells three grades of printer  
cartridges — silver, gold, and platinum — to three types of customers\: government agencies,  
educational institutions, and retailers. The seller has kept records on the outcome of each  
bid that it has made historically and the amount of business that it has done in the previous  
year in a format similar to that shown in Table 13.3.  
The seller wishes to use this historical data to estimate a bid-response function. Define  
the following variables6 to represent the information in Table 13.3\:  
•  
•

GRADES = 1 if grade is silver, 0 otherwise.  
GRADEG = 1 if grade is gold, 0 otherwise.

BUSLEVEL = 1 for the total amount of business that has been done with the cus-  
tomer in the last 12 months.  
The variables specifying the product grade, the type of customer, and whether the customer  
is new or old are called categorical variables. When there are two or more mutually exclusive  
categories such as GRADES, GRADEG, and GRADEP, exactly one of the variables will be  
equal to 1 with the others equaling 0 \(assuming that there are no other alternatives\). This  
means that GRADES + GRADEG + GRADEP = 1 and the variables are collinear, which  
means that if we know the values of two of the variables, we could calculate the value of the  
other; for example, if we know GRADES and GRADEG we can calculate GRADEP = 1 –  
GRADES – GRADEG. As a consequence of collinearity, when there are n mutually exclusive  
alternatives for a feature, we only need to include n – 1 categorical variables. This is obvious  
in the case when there are only two categories such as new or old\: we do not need a variable  
named OLD ; we can simply let NEW = 0 represent the case of an existing customer. When  
there are more than two alternatives, we can either choose which of the options to leave out  
or, with most regression software packages, allow the software to choose automatically. For  
this reason, we exclude GRADEP and OLD from the formulation here.  
Define the following linear function\:  
g\(p, x\) = β 0  
– β 1  PRICE  
+ β 2  GRADES + β 3  GRADEG \(13.11\)

.  
The next step is to estimate the values of the coefficients β 0, β 1, . . . , β 8 that best fit the his-  
torical data. The same procedure of maximum likelihood estimation discussed in Section  
13.3.1 can be applied to Equation 13.11, with the only difference being that, in this case, we  
are estimating nine coefficients, β 0, β 1, . . . , β 8, instead of two.  
Equation 13.11 is not the only possible formulation of a bid-response model given the  
available data. For example, Equation 13.11 includes the term β 4  SIZE, which specifies 362  
customized pricing  
that the effect of order size on winning a bid is linear, all else being equal. It is not unusual  
for this effect to be significant — customers placing large orders tend to be more price sensi-  
tive than those placing smaller orders. However, it may be that this effect is not linear but  
tends to get weaker the larger the order. To represent this possibility, we might try replacing  
the term β 4  SIZE with a term β 4  ln\(SIZE\). \(Recall that ln\(SIZE\) denotes the natural  
logarithm of the variable SIZE.\) In addition, we might want to try a model in which the  
product of order size and price influences the probability of winning a bid, in which case  
we could add another term of the form β 9  PRICE  SIZE.  
The process of determining the best model to fit the data is discussed in Section 4.3.3 —  
the same process holds for fitting bid-response data as price-response data. Generally, a  
modeler will use a forward stepwise regression process, which means starting with a simple  
model such as that in Equation 13.11 and then experimenting with adding transformed  
variables such as ln\(SIZE\) and crossed variables such as PRICE  SIZE. For each model,  
measures of model performance on historical data are calculated, and once multiple mod-  
els have been tested, the model demonstrating the best performance on these measures is  
selected.  
13.3.3 Binary Model Performance Measures  
Section 4.2 describes three measures of model fit\: root-mean-square error \(RMSE\), mean  
absolute percentage error \(MAPE\), and weighted MAPE. RMSE can be applied to binary  
models without any modification; however, neither MAPE nor weighted MAPE can be di-  
rectly applied to binary models because they both require dividing by the outcome, which  
is often 0. Fortunately, there are two additional model-fit measures that are applicable to  
binary regression problems.  
•  
•  
Concordance \(also called area under the curve, or AUC\) measures the frequency with  
which a model estimated a higher conversion probability for accepted bids than  
for rejected bids. A concordance of 1 means the model is a perfect predictor — that  
is, there is some value of p ˆ such that every bid for which the bid-response model  
estimated ρ\(pi\) \> p ˆ was accepted and every bid for which ρ\(pi\) \< p ˆ was rejected. A  
concordance of .5 means that the model was no better than random chance and a  
concordance less than .5 means that the model was worse than chance. The higher  
the value of the concordance, the better job the model does of predicting success. In  
practice concordance is typically between .5 and 1.0, with a higher value indicating a  
better-fitting model.  
Log-likelihood is calculated according to Equation 13.9. It measures the probability of  
observing the pattern of wins and losses in the test data set if the underlying model  
were correct. Log-likelihood is always less than 0, with larger values \(i.e., less nega-  
tive\) indicating a better-fitting model.  
Example 13.1  
Assume that our test data set includes only five bids \(a woefully inadequate  
number for any meaningful analysis\) and that the predicted win probability customized pricing 363

ρ\(pi\) from our challenger model and the actual outcome Wi are as shown in  
Table 13.4. The squared error for each bid is e 2 = \[ρ\(pi\) – Wi\]2  
, and the likeli-  
hood for each bid is Li = ρ\(pi\)Wi + \[1 – ρ\(pi\)\]\(1 – Wi\). The mean squared error  
of the model on the test data set is the average of the squared errors, which is  
.188, and the RMSE is the square root of this number, which is .44. The likeli-  
hood of the observed outcome is the product of the individual likelihoods\: L  
= L1 × L2 × . . . × L5 = .069; the log-likelihood is the natural logarithm of the  
likelihood, or ln\(.069\) = − 2.67. To calculate the concordance, we look at all  
pairs of bids in which one was accepted and the other was not \(disparate pairs\).  
There are six disparate pairs in Table 13.4. A disparate pair is concordant if  
the predicted win probability for the win was greater than or equal to the win  
probability for the loss. For example, the pair \(1, 3\) is concordant because the  
predicted win probability for bid 1 \(which was won\) is greater than the pre-  
dicted win probability for bid 3 \(which was lost\). On the other hand, the pair  
\(3, 4\) is discordant because the predicted win probability for bid 3 \(which was  
lost\) is higher than the predicted win probability for bid 4 \(which was won\).  
Of the six disparate pairs, five were concordant and one was discordant, so the  
concordance is 5/6 = .833.  
Each of these measures can be useful in comparing the performance of different models  
on the same test data set. In addition, concordance and RMSE can be useful in comparing  
models across data sets. Log-likelihood is not useful for comparing model performance  
on different test data sets because it depends strongly on the number of entries in the  
data set.  
13.3.4 Endogeneity  
Endogeneity can be an issue in estimation, as seen in Section 4.4.2. Endogeneity arises when  
unrecorded characteristics influence both the final price and the customer willingness to  
pay. This is a common problem in customized pricing when the final prices are set by ne-  
gotiation with a salesperson. In this case, the local salesperson may observe customer or  
market attributes that are not recorded in the data and use those attributes in negotiating  
the final price.7 For example, a salesperson, noticing that a particular customer seems very  
eager to purchase, holds the line to achieve a higher price, while another customer seems 364  
customized pricing  
less eager to purchase and the salesperson drops the price to close the deal. To the extent  
that the salesperson is correct in his estimation of customers’ willingness to pay, the price  
offered depends on customer willingness to pay through variables not recorded in the data.  
In this case, endogeneity will bias the coefficient of price in the estimation process.  
The bias introduced by endogeneity can go either way. If sales staff systematically adjust  
prices toward customers’ willingness to pay \(as they should to increase profitability\), then  
a naïve estimation procedure that ignores endogeneity will underestimate customer price  
sensitivity. If, however, sales staff are using their pricing discretion on the average to adjust  
prices away from customer willingness to pay, naïve estimation will lead to price sensitivity  
being overestimated. If sales staff are varying prices in a way that is uncorrelated with cus-  
tomer willingness to pay, then they are just adding noise to the process and the estimate of  
price sensitivity will be unbiased.  
When the variation of prices in historical data is due partially or entirely to sales force  
discretion, it is prudent to test for the presence of endogeneity and, if necessary, correct  
for it. One common approach to deal with endogeneity in customized pricing is to use a  
control-function approach, which proceeds in four steps\:  
1\. 2. 3. 4. Estimate an expected price for each bid. This is the price that would have been bid in  
the absence of local knowledge of unrecorded characteristics. One approach to es-  
timate this expected price is to average the prices offered for similar bids during the  
same time period. For example, the expected price might be calculated as the aver-  
age price of all bids or of similar products to similar customers. An alternative is to  
build a model that predicts expected price for each bid as a function of customer,  
product, and channel characteristics.  
Calculate the differences between the expected prices estimated in step 1 and the  
actual prices bid.  
Run a regression with Outcome as the target variable that includes the differences  
calculated in step 2. If these differences enter the regression as significant, this indi-  
cates that endogeneity is present.  
If endogeneity is present, then the difference between the actual price and the ex-  
pected price should be included as an explanatory variable in the regression.  
Although this may sound complicated, the basic idea is simple. In step 1, we estimate the  
prices that would have been offered for each bid if the sales staff did not possess unobserved  
bid-specific information. This expected price is an instrumental variable because it is plau-  
sibly correlated with the bid price, but it is not correlated with the customer’s idiosyncratic  
willingness to pay. If the difference between expected price and the price actually offered is  
not significant, then endogeneity is not present and the results of a regression using Price  
as an independent variable will not be biased. If, however, the difference between predicted  
price and actual offered price is a significant predictor of Outcome, then this difference  
should be included as an explanatory variable in the regression. The coefficient of this  
variable will be a better estimate of price sensitivity than the coefficient of Price estimated  
through simple regression. customized pricing 365  
13.4 EXTENSIONS AND VARIATIONS  
We have seen how a seller can find the customized price that will maximize expected con-  
tribution from a prospective deal in a simple bidding situation, assuming that the seller  
faces no constraints on the price he can bid. There are two obvious variations on this basic  
model\:  
•  
•  
The seller might want to do something other than maximize expected contribution.  
The seller might be constrained in the price he can offer for this deal.  
In the first case, the seller is pursuing a strategic goal that involves something other than  
maximizing expected deal contribution. If it is a goal that can be imposed on a deal-by-deal  
basis, then he can do this by simply maximizing a different objective function than Equa-  
tion 13.5 for each deal. For example, if he wants to maximize expected revenue, he could  
substitute the objective function R\(p\) = ρ\(p\)p as an alternative to maximizing expected  
profit. The properties of revenue- and profit-maximizing prices are similar to those dis-  
cussed in Chapter 5 — the revenue-maximizing price is lower than the profit-maximizing  
price for each bid. Furthermore, the profit from a bid may be negative at the revenue-  
maximizing price. It is also possible that the seller is interested in multiple objectives, such  
as maximizing profit and maximizing sales. In this case, the efficient frontier described in  
Section 5.7 can be used to understand the trade-off between competing objectives.  
The other case occurs when the seller is subject to one or more business rules that limit  
his choice of prices. These business rules could arise externally \(it may be illegal to charge  
different prices to certain groups of customers\) or internally \(the company may wish to  
keep prices through one channel lower than prices through another channel, for example\).  
In both cases, the effect is to make the customized-pricing problem more complex than  
solving the unconstrained optimization problem in Equation 13.5. In particular, business  
rules usually require adding constraints to the basic problem.  
In addition, there are many cases in which the bid setting itself is more complicated than  
a simple optimization —bids may involve many different bundled products and services  
and may involve several rounds of negotiation. These variations require extensions to the  
simple model, which Section 13.4.2 discusses.  
13.4.1 Strategic Goals and Business Rules  
Consider the following situations.

currently seeks to maximize expected contribution for each bid, and it wins approxi-  
mately 40% of the time. In 2021, senior management for the company declares that  
the company has an important new initiative with the goal “to become the dominant  
provider of shipping services to online retailers.” As part of this initiative, the CEO tells

retail customers throughout North America. Gammatek has five divisions\: CPUs,  
printers, storage devices, peripherals, and consumer electronics. It has about 23,000  
customers and bids on about 400,000 pieces of business a year, with about 25% of  
the bid requests coming in to the call center and the remainder via the internet. Since  
Gammatek can set a different price for each bid, it has adopted a customized-pricing  
process. At the beginning of the 2021 fiscal year, Gammatek’s president announces  
that each division will have a minimum average margin target that it will be expected  
to meet for the coming year. These targets were adopted because of the perception  
that stock analysts will be watching margins particularly closely in the coming year  
because of a soft economy and are likely to reduce the rating of any company with  
eroding margins.  
The Bank of Albion in the UK receives about 1 million requests per year for con-  
sumer loans. For each loan, the bank quotes an APR based on the size and term of  
the loan, customer credit score, and channel through which the request was received.  
Its newest marketing campaign advertises that a “typical” £5,000 loan has an APR of  
13.9%. This means that, by British law, the average APR for £5,000 loans issued by  
the bank must be less than or equal to 13.9%.  
In each of these three cases, the seller needs to do something beyond simply determining  
the prices that maximize expected contribution for each bid. The package express com-  
pany needs to calculate prices that enable it to hit its market-share target for the online  
retail market. It can meet this strategic goal by solving the customized-price optimization  
problem with a different objective function. Gammatek and the Bank of Albion want to  
maximize expected contribution, but they now face business rules that constrain the prices  
they can charge. In the case of Gammatek, the constraints arise from the internally imposed  
margin targets; in the Bank of Albion’s case, the constraint is an externally imposed legal  
requirement. In both cases, the business rules can be addressed by constraining the basic  
customized-pricing problem.  
Let ρi\(p\) and fi\(p\) be the bid-response function and the contribution, respectively, for a  
particular deal, i. One way for the package express company to meet its market-share target  
would be to solve the constrained optimization problem  
max  
p ρi \(p\)fi \(p\),  
subject to  
ρi \(p\) ≥ 0.75, \(13.12\)  
whenever it is bidding to an online retailer. \(Bids to all other customers would still be  
unconstrained.\) Constraint 13.12 guarantees that the company will have at least a 75%  
probability of winning each bid to an online retailer. If the unconstrained optimal price  
would result in a probability of winning the bid that was greater than 75%, the constraint  
will not make any difference — the optimal price will be the same. On the other hand, if the customized pricing 367

unconstrained optimal price would have resulted in a probability of winning of less than  
75%, constraint 13.12 will ensure that the calculated price yields a win probability of 75%.  
In this case, the constrained price will be lower than the unconstrained price.  
Figure 13.10 shows expected contribution as a function of the probability of winning  
the bid in a typical bid-response situation. The unconstrained optimum contribution is, of  
course, at the top of the hill. The win probability corresponding to the unconstrained opti-  
mum price is denoted by ρ\*, which is equal to about 0.55 in the figure. If the market-share  
target is less than ρ\*, then the constrained optimum price is the same as the unconstrained  
optimum price. If the market-share target is greater than ρ\*, then the constrained optimum  
price will be lower than the unconstrained optimum. As shown in Figure 13.10, the ex-  
pected contribution from this bid will also be lower —we are buying market share by pric-  
ing lower than the contribution-maximizing price. Figure 13.10 shows the amount of lost  
contribution if the seller enforces a target win probability of 0.75 for this bid. This differ-  
ence is the opportunity cost associated with the constraint that enforces the business rule.  
To guarantee that it meets its minimum margin targets, Gammatek will need to apply a  
constraint to its prices. Gammatek’s unit margin contribution for each sale is m = \(p – c\) /p.  
Let m\* be the minimum margin required for a particular line of business. \(There would  
be a different value of m\* for each line of business.\) Then one way to meet the minimum  
margin requirement is to ensure that \(p – c\) /p ≥ m\* for every bid, or, equivalently, that p ≥  
c/\(1 – m\*\) for every bid. This constraint can be applied directly to the customized-pricing  
problem.  
The minimum margin target has an effect opposite to that of the minimum market-  
share target\: For each bid, it will result in prices that are greater than or equal to the uncon-  
strained optimal prices. However, like any constraint, if it is binding, it will result in a lower  
expected contribution than the unconstrained case.  
Portfolio constraints. You may have noticed that we fudged in applying the minimum  
margin constraint at Gammatek. The corporate goal was for each division to meet a margin  
target. This target would logically be applied to the total margin achieved by the ­ business — 368  
customized pricing  
the total contribution for the division divided by the total revenue for the division. How-  
ever, we applied the constraint that p ≥ c/\(1 – m\*\) to every deal. This is too restrictive!  
The division could accept a lower-than-target margin on some deals as long as there are  
sufficient higher-margin deals so that the division average exceeds the target. Specifically,  
the division could possibly make additional money by pricing below the margin target to  
some very price-sensitive customers while pricing higher to some other customers who are  
less price sensitive.  
It is clear that the package express company is in a similar situation — it does not need  
to have a win probability of 75% or higher on every bid in order to win 75% of its bids.  
It could well be optimal for the package express company to accept a 70% probability of  
winning a particularly competitive bid if it anticipates that it will be bidding on a less com-  
petitive bid in the future with an 80% chance of winning. Finally, it is not clear at all how  
to incorporate the mean APR constraint into the customized-pricing problem at the Bank  
of Albion, other than forcing every bid to take place at the mean, which would hardly seem  
to qualify as PRO.  
The upshot is that certain business rules cannot be applied independently to each bid as  
it arrives. Rather, they need to be treated as portfolio constraints to maximize expected profit  
over all bids. That is, these rules cannot be applied one bid at a time; they must be applied  
across the portfolio of all bids. This requires that the seller maintain a forecast of expected  
business for each combination of customer, product, and channel— in effect, for each cell  
in the pricing and revenue optimization cube. To see this, let di be the number of bids we  
anticipate from cell i in the PRO cube and pi be the corresponding optimal price. \(In other  
words, each index i corresponds to a different combination of product, customer type, and  
channel.\) Then the problem faced by the Bank of Albion can be formulated as  
max \( \) \( \)  
∑ p f p d ,

\( \)

i  
where p\* is the advertised typical rate. The constraint guarantees that the average price over  
all bids will be less than or equal to p\*, but it does not constrain every single price to be less  
than or equal to p\*.  
From a practical point of view, the existence of one or more portfolio constraints sig-  
nificantly complicates the customized-pricing process. Instead of being able to calculate bid  
prices for deals one by one as they arrive, prices need to be precalculated for the entire PRO  
cube. Precise treatment of portfolio constraints also requires the forecasting of anticipated  
demand for each combination of product, customer type, and channel \(the di in the earlier  
example\). For these reasons, it is worth carefully considering whether it is important to  
incorporate portfolio constraints into the estimation of customized prices, or whether bid-  
by-bid approximations will suffice.  
Infeasibility. Business rules are usually applied for good reasons. However, there can  
be a dangerous tendency for business rules to accrue over time, particularly if obsolete customized pricing 369  
rules are never removed. If unchecked, the accumulation of business rules can lead to the  
customized-pricing problem becoming overconstrained or even infeasible. For example, a  
computer equipment wholesaler may want to impose two business rules\:  
•  
•  
“We need to win at least 40% of our bids in the small-business segment.”  
“We need to maintain a margin of at least 12% on sales in our printer division.”  
Taken individually, each goal might be quite reasonable. However, if printers represent a  
large fraction of the company’s sales to the small-business segment, the two goals might be  
mutually incompatible — namely, it might be impossible for the company to win 40% of its  
bids in the segment while maintaining a margin of 12% or more on its printer sales. This is  
the problem of infeasibility. The likelihood of infeasibility rises as the number and variety  
of business rules in place at one time increases.  
Infeasibility is often dealt with in customized-pricing software by forcing the user to  
rank the business rules in the order of importance. In case of infeasibility, the software will  
start by relaxing the least important rule first and continue to relax rules until it can find a  
solution. This is a common technical solution. However, the larger issue is that any company  
using customized pricing needs to actively manage business rules to keep them from be-  
ing overapplied and accruing over time. As we have seen, adding business rules can never  
improve expected contribution. Therefore, they should be added only when necessary. In  
particular, it is important to have a process for periodically reviewing the rules that are in  
place and replacing those that are obsolete or no longer applicable.  
13.4.2 Variations on the Basic Bidding Model  
So far, we have looked at customized pricing in its simplest setting —when sellers submit a  
single bid for a known product to a buyer. Although this setting is realistic in some markets,  
in many others there are significant variations that have implications for how the sellers  
should set their prices. This section touches on a few of the most important examples.  
Contract versus single purchase. In many cases, a buyer will request bids for a contract  
for future goods or services, typically for a fixed period, such as the next six months or a  
year. This is a very common way of purchasing freight, telecommunications, and other  
services. A five-year information technology \(IT\) outsourcing or cloud computing deal  
would also fall into this category. This adds a twist to customized pricing\: a seller must  
make its bid without knowing the precise level or mix of business it will actually realize if  
it wins the bid.  
Consider a video game manufacturer soliciting bids from a trucking company to dis-  
tribute its video games nationwide for the next 12 months. The trucking company needs to  
decide what discount from its basic tariff it should offer. If the manufacturer’s newest game  
is a hit, then the trucker may ship a huge volume of games over the next few months — so  
much so that it might require additional trucks to be added to the fleet to accommodate the  
increased business. If, on the other hand, the game is a bust, the additional business from  
this customer would be simply incremental and not require any additional investment. A  
trucking company needs to incorporate this uncertainty into its bid. 370  
customized pricing  
In this case —when the level or mix of demand from a potential customer is uncertain  
and the profitability of an account depends on the level or mix of demand — the seller  
needs to forecast the demand he anticipates from that customer and use that information in  
calculating the price to bid. Furthermore, if there is a wide range of possible outcomes, he  
may need to explicitly incorporate the uncertainty in the business level in his bid.  
Multiple line items. It is extremely common that a bid includes more than one item. As a  
very simple example, a park district may submit an RFQ that asks for a bid on 10 medium-  
size automobiles and 10 pickup trucks as part of the same bid. At the more complex end  
of the spectrum, a bid to construct a power plant may include thousands of individual line  
items. As an intermediate example, the heavy truck offered by Peterbilt described in Section  
13.3.2 has 75 different options. For each option \(e.g., engine type\), there are two or more  
alternatives, each with a different list price. A customer configures the truck by choosing  
the options she wants, and the manufacturer must determine the overall discount to offer  
based on the fully configured truck.  
When multiple line items are involved in a bid, the tactic a bidder should use to deter-  
mine his bid price depends on how the buyer is going to select a supplier. Here are the three  
broad possibilities.  
•  
•  
•  
Single bundled price. The buyer may commit ahead of time to purchase from a single  
bidder and require only a single, all-inclusive price from each bidder. This is the case  
with the configurable heavy truck purchase, for example. In this case, the price for  
the entire bundle can be determined using the standard optimal customized-pricing  
approach.  
Itemized prices with single supplier. In this case, the purchaser commits to purchase  
from a single bidder but requires itemized prices. This may seem identical to the  
previous case, but there are a number of potential pitfalls. First, even though the pur-  
chaser will only be paying a single price, his choice of supplier may be influenced by  
some of the itemized prices. For example, automobile purchase decisions are often  
more influenced by the base price of the car than by the cost of the options. Some  
purchasers are more likely to purchase the same car if it is presented as a \$19,000  
car with \$5,000 worth of options than if it is presented as a \$20,000 car with \$3,800  
worth of options. This is an issue of price presentation, which is treated in Chap-  
ter 14.  
A more important issue with itemized prices is that they give the purchaser more  
scope and leverage for negotiation, particularly in a competitive bid. When there  
is only a single price, there is only one dimension for negotiation. When there are  
many line-item prices, a savvy buyer will negotiate each one along with the total  
discount. For this reason, sellers prefer to offer a single bundled price, while buyers  
almost always prefer line-item prices, even when they will only be purchasing from a  
single supplier.  
Itemized prices and multiple suppliers. In this case, the purchaser requests itemized  
prices and reserves the right to purchase different items from different bidders. For customized pricing 371  
example, the park district might reserve the right to purchase the cars from one  
company and the trucks from the other. Obviously, the motivation for the purchaser  
is to select the cheapest supplier for each item \(cherry picking\). In this case, the  
strategy for the seller is to treat each item as an individual bid and to calculate the  
optimal price for each line item independently of the others. Of course, a supplier  
might want to provide an extra discount if the purchaser will purchase everything  
from him.  
The tactics for dealing with these different settings are fairly clear\: What is most impor-  
tant for a bidder is to understand what game he is playing before he submits his bid. That is,  
if itemized prices are requested, it is critical to know whether the purchaser is committed to  
a single supplier or is reserving the option to purchase from more than one bidder.  
Negotiation. In many customized-pricing situations there is an element of negotia-  
tion — the first deal proposed is not necessarily the final one, and there may be several  
rounds of negotiation before the final price is determined. Negotiation may take place on  
price \(“Cut the total price by 1%, and I’ll sign right now”\), on product bundle \(“Throw  
in the extended warranty and we have a deal”\), or both. Clearly, this is a different setting  
from the single-bid process that we have considered, and recommended prices need to be  
modified accordingly.  
There is a substantial literature on the art and science of negotiation, not to mention a  
small industry devoted to helping people become better negotiators. However, from the  
point of view of pricing and revenue optimization, a typical approach is to give the sales-  
person a range within which to bid. How such a range can be incorporated into sales force  
guidance is illustrated in Figure 13.11 for the example of the park service vehicle bid. Ex-  
pected contribution is within 4% of the optimal for any amount bid between \$11,600 and  
\$12,400. The salesperson negotiating the deal might be provided with this range of prices  
and expected to use his negotiating skill to obtain a price as high as possible within the  
range. The savvy salesperson will choose an initial bid at the high end of the range to give  
himself room to bargain. This allows the company to provide guidance to a salesperson in  
the negotiation process while ensuring that the final price achieved is sufficiently close to  
optimal.  
A price range such as the one shown in Figure 13.11 is often used to support a combined  
centralized /decentralized approach to negotiated pricing. In this approach, headquarters  
can determine the target price and the upper and lower bounds for each deal. The local  
salesperson has the freedom to negotiate the best price he can within these bounds. The  
idea is to gain the best of both worlds\: to use all of the data available centrally to calculate  
bid-response functions and bounds while enabling the salesperson to adjust the price to  
the characteristics of a specific deal and the characteristics of an individual customer. Ide-  
ally, the local salesperson will have immediate knowledge of the local competitive situation  
or the needs of each customer that can be used to determine a better price than could be  
generated centrally.  
Does setting price ranges centrally improve results over the two alternatives of com-  
pletely centralized and completely decentralized pricing? In theory, negotiation within 372

bounds should benefit the seller, since a savvy salesperson should be able to evaluate the  
eagerness of a customer to purchase and adjust the asking price accordingly. This is what  
a study of auto-loan pricing found — loan officers who had authority to negotiate rates  
within a range were able to increase the profitability of loans over the price list that had  
been centrally established \(Phillips, Simsek, and van Ryzin 2015\). On the other hand, an in-  
ternal study by Nomis Solutions found that loan officers for a Canadian bank were actually  
reducing the overall profitability of the portfolio by negotiating prices that were consist-  
ently lower than optimal. The difference between the two situations can be best explained  
by incentives — the auto loan negotiators were incentivized \(indirectly\) on profitability,  
while the Canadian loan officers were incentivized in large part by portfolio growth and  
by a recommender score. This motivated them to offer lower prices than those that would  
have maximized profit.8  
Fulfillment. In many contract bidding situations, a buyer may not want to commit all  
of her business to a single supplier. For example, a shipper may not want to commit all of  
her business for the next year to a single trucking company. Instead, the shipper may want  
to have contracts with two different trucking companies to provide herself with flexibility  
in case of a dispute with one of the companies or in case one is shut down temporarily by a  
strike. Furthermore, having contracts with two different trucking companies may save the  
shipper money if she picks the cheaper trucker for each shipment. In other business-to-  
business relationships, a purchaser will choose two or more competitors as preferred suppli-  
ers. As specific needs arise during the year, the purchaser will choose among the preferred  
suppliers for each order.  
In this case, the determination of the price to bid needs to consider not only the prob-  
ability of winning — that is, becoming a preferred supplier —but also the amount \(and  
mix\) of business that will come his way during the term of the contract. Generally, both the customized pricing 373  
bidder’s probability of becoming a preferred supplier and the amount of business he will  
receive from the contract will increase as he decreases his price. Both considerations need  
to be incorporated into the estimated contribution.  
13.5 CUSTOMIZED PRICING IN ACTION  
Effective customized pricing requires a disciplined business process both to calculate and  
administer prices and to ensure that the parameters of the bid-response functions are up-  
dated to capture changes in the market. A high-level sketch of such a process is shown in  
Figure 13.12. There are three core steps in the customized-pricing process.  
1\. 2. 3. Calculate bid-response function. Using available information about the customer,  
the product \(or products\) she wishes to purchase, and the channel through which  
the request was received, the seller estimates how the probability of winning this  
customer’s business varies as a function of price. This requires retrieving \(or cal-  
culating\) the parameters of the bid-response function that apply to this particular  
combination of segment, channel, and product.  
Calculate deal contribution. The seller estimates the deal contribution function relat-  
ing contribution from this deal to its price.  
Determine optimal price. Combining the bid-response function and the deal contri-  
bution function, the seller calculates the price that maximizes expected contribution  
\(or other goal\) subject to applicable business rules.  
These three core steps may be executed each time a bid request is received and a price  
needs to be calculated. Alternatively, the PRO cube might be populated ahead of time with

optimal prices that are accessed whenever a bid request is received. This requires executing  
the three core steps in batch mode prior to processing any bids. Which approach is better  
depends on the volume of bids to be processed and the time available to respond to each  
one. A lending company that needs to respond rapidly to thousands of customer inquiries  
about consumer loans every day is more likely to prepopulate a database with prices. On  
the other hand, a heavy equipment manufacturer that responds to 40 or 50 RFPs per week,  
with several days available to respond to each, is more likely to optimize the price for each  
bid independently.  
Whichever approach is used, the core steps need to be supported by three additional  
steps that are executed less frequently.  
1\. 2. 3. Segment the market. The seller determines the market segments he will use to dif-  
ferentiate his prices. This establishes the structure of the PRO cube and needs to be  
done prior to estimating any bid-response parameters. Typically, the market seg-  
mentation does not need to be updated often — perhaps annually or semiannually.  
The exception is when the seller seeks to serve a new market or type of customer.  
Note that the extent to which a seller will be able to segment his market will be  
limited by the amount of historical bid-response data that he has.  
Estimate bid-response parameters. The seller estimates the parameters of the bid-response  
function when the market is initially segmented. The bid-response param-  
eters need to be reestimated whenever the segmentation itself is changed.  
Update bid-response parameters. The seller updates the parameters of the bid-  
response function on a routine basis —usually weekly or monthly — to ensure that  
changes in the underlying market are captured. Updating the bid-response param-  
eters is not much different from estimating them in the first place. In the simplest  
approach, the results of the most recent bids \(i.e., those since the last update\) are  
appended to the bid-history file in Figure 13.9, and the same approach is used to es-  
timate the updated parameters using the new, larger database of bids. However, this  
approach would give increasingly old bid results the same weight as much newer  
bids in estimating the parameters. For this reason, most companies drop old bids —  
for example, those over a year old — from their bid-history file. Alternatively, other  
companies use Bayesian updating approaches that incorporate all bid information  
but weight newer bids more than older bids.  
13.6 SUMMARY  
•  
•  
Customized pricing occurs when customers approach a seller individually and de-  
scribe their desired product \(or products\) prior to purchasing. Customized pricing  
is commonplace in business-to-business marketplaces as well as some consumer  
marketplaces, notably lending and insurance.  
In a customized-pricing setting, the seller knows the desired product for each  
customer, the channel through which the customer approached, and some of the customized pricing 375

characteristics of the customer. Furthermore, the seller can use this information to  
set a customized price for each bid.  
An important aspect of customized pricing is that the seller obtains information  
about not only bids that he won but also bids that he lost. He can use this informa-  
tion to estimate a bid-response function that determines his probability of winning a  
bid based on the characteristics of that bid and the price that he charges.  
When a seller quotes a price for a bid, he faces two types of uncertainty\: competi-  
tive uncertainty regarding competing bids and preference uncertainty regarding the  
criteria the purchaser will use to choose a winner. In some cases, the buyer is com-  
mitted to purchasing from the lowest bidder — in this case, the seller can calculate  
a bid-response function based entirely on his uncertainty regarding competitive  
bids.  
In the more common case, a seller needs to estimate a bid-response function based  
on the historical characteristics and prices of bids that he has won and lost. This is a  
problem of binary regression, and the most popular approach to estimating a bid-  
response function is to use logistic regression.  
A seller who has estimated a bid-response function can use it to determine the price  
that maximizes his expected profitability from each bid, which is calculated as the  
probability of winning the bid at a price times the profitability of the bid at that price  
if it is won.  
Application of optimal customized prices is complicated by the fact that many sellers  
are subject to business requirements such as minimum margin requirements and  
minimum market-share requirements. These are typically imposed as constraints  
in the customized-pricing optimization problem. Applying inconsistent constraints  
can lead to infeasibility, in which no set of prices can simultaneously satisfy all the  
constraints.  
Optimal customized pricing is typically implemented in an ongoing business process  
in which the optimal price for each bid is determined based on the characteristics of  
the product, the channel, and the customer at the time of the bid. The parameters  
of the bid-response function are periodically updated based on the performance of  
recent bids.

1\. 2. HP is bidding against Lenovo for an order of 150 laptops. HP’s unit cost is \$1,000  
per laptop, and, based on previous experience, HP’s belief is that Lenovo’s bid will  
be uniformly distributed between \$1,200 and \$1,500 per unit.  
a. Assuming that HP and Lenovo are at parity \(e.g., neither supplier enjoys a  
premium on this deal\), what is HP’s optimal price per unit to bid? What is HP’s  
corresponding probability of winning the bid and expected contribution?  
b. Assume that Lenovo is an incumbent supplier to this customer and, as a result,  
HP believes that Lenovo enjoys a \$200 per unit premium for this deal. Assuming  
that HP has the same distribution on Lenovo’s bid as previously stated, what is  
HP’s optimal price per unit to bid? What is HP’s corresponding probability of  
winning the bid and its expected contribution?

2\. The exception is the rare case when a hot new model is introduced and demand at  
the MSRP far exceeds supply. In this case, dealers may decide to charge more than the  
MSRP. However, this practice tends to be unpopular with customers. For example, a  
California dealership quoted a price \$10,000 above the MSRP for the extremely popular  
Corvette Stingray to widespread complaints of price gouging \(Automotive News 2013\).  
3\. In this chapter, I occasionally talk about the bid price, by which I simply mean the  
price associated with the bid. This should not be confused with the bid price used in rev-  
enue management, as defined in Section 9.2.3.

pliers and the extent to which the buyer is being truthful about her selection criteria are  
separate issues.  
5\. As in the definition of price elasticity in Equation 3.8, the minus sign guarantees that  
the elasticity will be positive, since ρ′\(p\), the derivative of the price-response function, is  
less than 0.  
6\. Following common practice, I capitalize and italicize explanatory variables such as  
GRADEP and PRICE.  
7\. In this case, the word “negotiation” does not necessarily indicate the back and forth  
usually associated with the term. It may be that the customer does not know that the price  
is actually negotiable and therefore treats the quote as fixed.  
8\. The studies on auto lending and Canadian lending are discussed in Phillips 2014. 14 Behavioral Economics and Pricing  
The foundation for the standard model of price response is the assumption that consum-  
ers are rational utility-maximizing agents. Before making a purchase, a rational consumer  
gathers information and then systematically and dispassionately evaluates her alternatives.  
A rational consumer has a willingness to pay \(which may be less than zero\) for every item  
on offer to her by every seller. She chooses the set of purchases that maximizes her expected  
utility \(measured in monetary units\) from the purchases minus the total amount she must  
pay. Variation of willingness to pay among customers generates a price-response function as  
described in Chapter 3. In a similar vein, neoclassical economics assumes that firms choose  
among alternatives to maximize expected profit; uncertainty on the part of sellers about  
how different customers value their product offerings relative to the competition gives rise  
to the bid-response function described in Section 13.3.  
The idea of rationality is based on a handful of plausible axioms about how consumers  
and firms behave, and it provides an intuitive and compelling basis for price optimization.  
However, it is not difficult to find examples of behaviors that are not consistent with the  
assumption of consumer rationality. Consider the following two examples.  
Coca-Cola makes customers hot. In a 1999 interview with the Brazilian magazine Veja,  
Douglas Ivester, chairman and chief executive officer of the Coca-Cola Company, an-  
nounced that his company was testing a new vending machine that would change the price  
of soft drinks in response to outside temperature. When it was hot outside, a cold can of  
Coke would cost more than when it was cold outside. As he explained\:  
Coca-Cola is a product whose utility varies from moment to moment. In a final summer  
championship, when people meet in a stadium to enjoy themselves, the utility of a chilled  
Coca-Cola is very high.1 So it is fair it should be more expensive. The machine will simply  
make this process automatic. \(Martinson 1999\)  
While Douglas Ivester might have thought this was fair, others emphatically did not agree.  
The San Francisco Chronicle \(1999\) called the idea “a cynical ploy to exploit the thirst of  
faithful customers,” the Honolulu Star-Bulletin labeled it “a lunk-headed idea” ­ \(Memminger 380  
behavioral economics and pricing  
1999\), and the Miami Herald referred to Coca-Cola management as a bunch of “soda jerks”  
\(Hays 1999, 18\).  
Coke began to backpedal immediately. “We are not introducing vending machines that  
raise the price of soft drinks in hot weather,” said spokesperson Ben Deutsch \(Reich 1999\).  
Although Coca-Cola is rumored to have tested weather-sensitive machines in Japan, it has  
never employed them in the United States. And the temperature-sensitive vending machine  
gaffe is widely considered to be one of the factors contributing to Ivester’s losing his job.  
Amazon flubs DVD pricing. One night in August 2000, a customer ordered from Ama-  
zon the DVD of Julie Taymor’s movie Titus, paying \$24.49. Browsing on Amazon a few  
nights later, he found that the price had jumped to \$26.24. As an experiment, he deleted  
the cookies on his computer that identified him to Amazon as a regular customer. Revis-  
iting the Amazon website, he was quoted a price of \$22.74 for the same DVD \(Streitfeld  
2000\).  
This customer happened to be a regular purchaser of DVDs from Amazon, and he came  
to the reasonable conclusion that Amazon was charging higher prices to its most loyal cus-  
tomers. When he recounted his experience with Amazon on the website DVDTalk.com,  
the reaction was immediate and overwhelmingly negative. Comments posted on DVDTalk.  
com over the next weeks included\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
“Amazon is over in my book.”  
“I will never buy another thing from those guys!”  
“I am so offended by what they did that I’ll never buy another DVD from them  
again.”  
“Amazon is suck \[sic\].”  
The tale spread via email and chat rooms, and Computerworld published a story about  
Amazon’s pricing policies. The national press picked up the story. Press coverage generally  
jumped to the conclusion that Amazon was experimenting with “dynamic pricing,” by  
which they would charge different customers different prices. As one reporter commented,  
“Dynamic pricing . . . involves putting customers into groups based on how price sensitive  
they appear to be. If someone accepts the \$10-higher price, say, three times in a row, maybe  
that’s all they will ever get in the future” \(Coursey 2000\).2 While a few reporters noted that  
dynamic pricing was hardly unknown in the offline world, the response to Amazon’s action  
was almost universally negative.  
In response to the negative publicity, Amazon apologized and claimed that it was merely  
running a price-sensitivity test\: “It was done to determine consumer responses to different  
discount levels,” said Amazon spokesman Bill Curry. “This was a pure and simple price  
test. This was not dynamic pricing. We don’t do that and have no plans ever to do that”  
\(Streitfeld 2000, A1\).  
What happened? In both cases, consumer reaction did not follow the standard model of  
rational economic decision making. After all, a rational consumer should care only about  
her price — not the prices charged to other customers or what the company might have  
charged under different conditions. In the cases of Amazon and Coke, apparently sensible behavioral economics and pricing 381  
pricing schemes were abandoned as a result of consumer reaction. Clearly, the consum-  
ers quoted in these stories are not automatons comparing price to willingness to pay and  
dispassionately deciding whether or not to buy. Rather, they are human beings reacting  
emotionally to such seemingly irrelevant issues as the prices other people might be offered  
or how prices might change with the weather.  
The topic of this chapter is how consumers react to prices in ways that deviate from the  
assumptions of rationality — as in the Amazon and Coca-Cola examples above — and the  
implications of these deviations for pricing and revenue optimization. Although the basic  
model of customer price response is quite robust, there are many types of behavior that it  
cannot represent. In particular, customers do not view buying and selling dispassionately as  
simple transactions among consenting adults. Rather, they often react to prices in ways that  
economists consider irrational.3 Customer response to price is not always based only on the  
price and product being offered. Instead, a number of other, seemingly irrelevant, factors  
can influence buying behavior, including these\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
How the price is presented and packaged  
How much profit the customer believes the merchant will realize  
How this price compares to the customer’s expectation of what the price should be  
Prices the customer believes are being charged to other customers  
All of these factors can influence consumer behavior, but none of them can be easily ac-  
commodated within the standard model in which willingness to pay and price alone govern  
whether or not a customer will purchase.  
The study of deviations from rationality and their implications is called behavioral eco-  
nomics. Many behavioral studies have found effects of pricing that might be hard to use  
in the real world — for example, that customers are less sensitive to prices when the cents  
match their birthday \(Coulter and Grewal 2014\) or the final digits are associated with a  
favorite sports team, such as \$.49 for a fan of the San Francisco 49ers \(Husemann-Kopetzky  
and Köcher 2017\). While phenomena such as these may have little practical significance,  
three important and well-established categories of consumer irrationality are important for  
pricing and we examine them at length.  
The first category consists of violations of the law of demand — the principle introduced  
in Chapter 3 that specifies that, all else being equal, an increase in price should lead to  
decreased demand, and a decrease in price should increase demand. However, there are  
situations in which the opposite effect might occur — raising price might lead to increased  
demand, and lowering price might decrease demand.  
The second category consists of presentation issues in which customers react not only  
to a price but also to the way in which it is communicated. One well-known example of  
a price presentation issue is the digit-ending phenomenon —buyers in Europe and North  
America tend to overweight the leading \(leftmost\) digits when comparing prices so that, in  
immediate impression, \$19.99 seems to be a greater savings from \$20.00 than \$19.93 from  
\$19.99. Because of this phenomenon, certain penny-endings such as 9 and 5 are far more  
common than others.4 382  
behavioral economics and pricing  
The third category of irrational price response involves the issue of fairness. The belief  
that one is entitled to fair treatment is deeply ingrained in most people. Perceptions of  
unfair treatment can trigger strong emotional responses such as those expressed in the  
DVDtalk.com postings about Amazon.  
These three categories all influence consumer decisions, but they manifest themselves  
in different ways. A company that is doing a poor job at price presentation will simply sell  
less than it might otherwise, but it is unlikely to hear anything from its customers. After  
all, customers are unlikely to complain if a merchant’s prices end in \$.83 rather than \$.99.  
Similarly, customers are unlikely to complain if they think that an item is priced too low  
for them. In contrast, customers are likely to complain — and loudly — if their sense of fair-  
ness is violated. Poor price presentation will probably not land you on the front page of the  
newspaper, but pricing considered unfair might — just ask Coca-Cola and Amazon.  
14.1 VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW OF DEMAND  
The law of demand specifies that demand for a good decreases as its price is increased and  
that demand increases as price is decreased. This corresponds not only to intuition but also  
to the fact that the price-response function is derived from the distribution of willingness to  
pay across a population. If this is the case, then raising prices should always lower demand  
and vice versa. Therefore, any violations of the law of demand must arise from situations  
in which the willingness-to-pay assumption does not hold. Three kinds of cases have been  
identified in which individual purchase behavior is not well described by a maximum will-  
ingness to pay, and therefore the law of demand might be violated.  
14.1.1 Giffen Goods  
Economic theory allows for the possibility of Giffen goods, whose demand rises as their  
price rises because of substitution effects. An example might be the case of a student on a  
strict budget of \$8.00 per week for dinner. When hamburger costs \$1.00 per serving and  
steak costs \$2.00, she eats hamburger six times a week and treats herself to steak once a  
week. If the price of hamburger rises to \$1.10, she stops buying steak and buys hamburger  
seven times a week to stay within her budget. In this case, a rise in the price of hamburger  
causes her consumption of hamburger to increase. While this behavior might conceivably  
occur at an individual level, a Giffen good requires that enough buyers act this way that they  
overwhelm other buyers who would buy less hamburger as the price rises. Giffen goods are  
rarely, if ever, encountered in reality — in fact, many economists doubt whether they have  
ever existed in the real world.5  
14.1.2 Price as an Indicator of Quality  
In some cases, price may be used by some consumers as an indicator of quality\: higher  
prices signal higher quality. In this case, lowering the price for a product may lead consum-  
ers to believe that it is of lower quality, and demand could drop as a result. Typically, mar-  
kets in which this is an issue have a large number of alternatives, and some buyers who do behavioral economics and pricing 383

Price  
\$20  
Figure 14.1 Price as signal of quality.  
not have the time or resources to research the relative quality of all the alternatives instead  
use price as a proxy. Wine is a classic example\: Faced with a daunting array of labels and  
varietals, many purchasers are likely to use a rule such as a \$10 bottle for dinner with the  
family, a \$15 bottle if the couple next door is dropping by, and a \$25 bottle if our wine-snob  
friends are joining us for dinner.  
Using price as an indicator of quality is not necessarily an irrational strategy on the part  
of a consumer, particularly when quality is correlated with price. Consider a customer who  
is not highly knowledgeable about wine but has consumed a number of different California  
Chardonnays at different prices. Each dot in Figure 14.1 represents the utility that she enjoyed  
\(denominated in dollars\) from drinking a Chardonnay at that price point. Clearly her enjoy-  
ment of Chardonnay is correlated with its price, but the correlation is not perfect. In addition,  
her enjoyment demonstrates decreasing marginal utility—spending more at higher prices  
delivers less marginal utility than at lower prices. The solid curve shows her expected utility  
from purchasing a bottle as a function of price based on her experience. Assume that she is at  
a wine store shopping for a bottle and is unfamiliar with any of the brands on offer. With only  
price to guide her, it is perfectly rational for her to purchase at the price point that maximizes  
her surplus as defined by the difference between her expected utility and the price—which,  
in this case of the customer in Figure 14.1, occurs at about \$20. If enough customers share  
similar experiences, a Chardonnay might well sell more bottles at \$20 than at \$12.  
The price-as-an-indicator-of-quality effect can be particularly important when a new  
product enters the market. A medical-product company developed a way of producing a  
home testing device at a cost 75% below the cost of the prevailing technology. It introduced  
the new product at a list price 60% lower than the list price of the leading competitors,  
expecting to dominate the market. When sales were slow, the company repackaged the  
product and sold it at a price only 20% lower than the leading competitor. This time, sales  
took off. The company’s belief is that the initial rock-bottom price induced customers to  
believe its product was inferior and unreliable. The higher price was high enough not to  
raise quality concerns but low enough to drive high sales.  
More recent studies have shown that not only may price be a signal of quality, but the  
price itself may influence customer enjoyment. In one study, the price of an energy drink 384  
behavioral economics and pricing  
influenced the ability of purchasers to solve puzzles after consuming the drink \(Shiv, Ca-  
mon, and Ariely 2005\). And in a widely publicized study, researchers performed a brain  
scan while subjects drank wine. They found that subjects reported enjoying a wine more if  
they thought that it was priced higher. Perhaps more surprisingly, the brain scan showed  
that they apparently did enjoy the same wine more if they thought it cost more — regions  
of the brain associated with pleasure were more highly activated when a subject consumed  
what they believed was a high-priced wine than when they consumed the same wine but  
believed it was low-priced \(Plassmann et al. 2008\).  
14.1.3 Conspicuous Consumption  
The sociologist Thorstein Veblen coined the term conspicuous consumption for the situation  
in which a consumer makes a purchase decision in order to advertise his ability to spend  
large amounts. As he put it, “Conspicuous consumption of valuable goods is a means of  
reputability to the gentleman of leisure” \(Veblen 1899, 57\). Thus, it is likely that a large  
segment of the purchasers of Bentley Continental GT automobiles \(advertised as starting  
at \$202,500\) and Louis Roederer Cristal Brut Champagne \(about \$200 –\$3,000 per bottle\)  
are not necessarily purchasing entirely based on their willingness to pay for qualities of the  
car and the taste of the champagne, respectively, but are also making a statement about  
their ability to afford such luxuries. For a product that has been successfully marketed as an  
expensive luxury product, there may be those who will purchase it in part because it has a  
high price — and others know it. For such products, maintaining the air of exclusivity will  
influence marketing and pricing — for example, many luxury brands will not allow their  
products to be sold through the usual channels at a discount, even though it might be prof-  
itable to do so, because of the potential damage to the brand. Instead, they will sell through  
alternative channels, such as outlet stores, or ship to other countries to sell or even destroy  
product to maintain the image of high price and exclusivity.  
14.2 PRICE PRESENTATION AND FRAMING  
Consider the following three scenarios\:  
1\. 2. 3. You walk up to the box office to buy two tickets to a movie. A sign in the window  
reads\:  
General Admission\: \$15.00  
Senior Citizen \(65 and over\)\: \$13.00  
Youth \(18 and under\)\: \$13.00  
You walk up to the box office and the sign in the window reads\:  
General Admission\: \$13.00  
Middle Aged \(over 18 and under 65\)\: \$15.00  
You walk up to the box office and the sign in the window reads\:  
General Admission\: \$13.00  
Middle Aged \(over 18 and under 65\)\: \$2.00 surcharge behavioral economics and pricing 385  
Chances are that most people would consider the first scenario to be unremarkable. How-  
ever, the second scenario would likely raise eyebrows. The effect is likely to be even stronger  
under the third scenario. In fact, you can almost hear the cries of “Why should I be pun-  
ished because of my age? It’s not fair!” Yet, of course, all three price schemes are exactly the  
same, at least in the sense that everyone would pay the same amount for admission under  
each scheme. However, people perceive them and react quite differently. The most widely  
accepted reason for why this is so is provided by prospect theory.  
14.2.1 Prospect Theory  
Prospect theory was introduced by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979 based on  
their observation that people do not evaluate opportunities based on a strict evaluation of  
expected costs and benefits. Rather, they use various mental shortcuts and rules of thumb  
to make decisions. This can lead to outcomes that are inconsistent with economic rational-  
ity. For example, prospect theory proposes that people tend to experience losses much more  
intensely than they value gains\: this is called asymmetrical treatment of gains and losses. This  
idea is illustrated in Figure 14.2. Customers value a gain of Δ much less than they feel the  
pain of a loss of equal value. Since paying a higher price is viewed as a loss, this means that a  
surcharge \(or price rise\) of \$5.00 is viewed much more negatively than a discount \(or price  
drop\) of \$5.00 is viewed positively. In short, price rises are felt more intensely than price  
drops.  
An important implication of prospect theory for price presentation is that the presen-  
tation of prices can establish the baseline against which the actual price is compared. As an  
example, consider the following scenario.

behavioral economics and pricing  
•  
•  
Station A sells gasoline for \$2.60 per gallon but gives a discount of \$0.10 per gallon if  
you pay with cash.  
Station B sells gasoline for \$2.50 per gallon but charges a surcharge of \$0.10 per gal-  
lon if you pay with a credit card.  
The two approaches are identical in terms of what any particular buyer will pay. Yet Station  
B’s approach is never seen in the real world. Why? According to prospect theory, the reason  
is immediate from Figure 14.2. For each station, the list price establishes the baseline price  
in the buyer’s mind. For Station A the \$0.10 discount \(+Δ\) is viewed as a gain relative to  
the baseline price of \$2.60, while for Station B the \$0.10 surcharge \(–Δ\) is viewed as a loss  
relative to the baseline price of \$2.50. Prospect theory predicts that a buyer using a credit  
card would be more likely to patronize Station A than accept the surcharge associated with  
Station B.  
For each of the three movie-pricing scenarios, the general admission price establishes  
the baseline against which the price that a customer will actually be charged is compared.  
When the actual price includes a discount, it is viewed as a gain, which is viewed favorably.  
When the actual price includes a surcharge, it is viewed as a loss, which is felt negatively.  
Asymmetric treatment of gains and losses also explains why the middle-age-surcharge ap-  
proach to movie pricing seems so jarring — and is never found in the real world.  
Asymmetrical treatment of losses and gains may explain some of the negative reaction  
to Coca-Cola’s announcement of temperature-dependent vending machine pricing. Note  
the wording of Douglas Ivester’s announcement\: “In a final summer championship, when  
people meet in a stadium to enjoy themselves, the utility of a chilled Coca-Cola is very  
high. So it is fair that it should be more expensive.” From a prospect theory point of view,  
he chose the worst price presentation possible —he framed the scheme in terms of a sur-  
charge relative to a baseline price. This framed the higher price as a loss and triggered an  
immediate negative reaction. Coca-Cola would probably have fared better if Ivester had  
said something like\: “On a cold day, the utility of a chilled Coca-Cola is not as high as on  
a hot day. So it is only fair that it should cost less — our customers deserve a price break in  
that situation.” In fact, when faced with the negative reaction to the original suggestion,  
the company tried to reframe the description in just those terms by insisting that “its ma-  
chines would be more likely to lower prices during off-peak hours in offices, for instance”  
\(Martinson 1999\).  
Prospect theory provides an explanation for a nearly universal phenomenon in pric-  
ing — discounts are common, and surcharges are rare. As Chapter 12 notes, almost 80%  
of apparel sold in the United States in 2006 was sold at a discount from list price \(Levy et  
al. 2007\). It is safe to assume that only a tiny fraction \(if any\) of retail apparel sales took  
place at a surcharge from list price. Clearly, sellers believe that promotions and markdowns  
stimulate sales more than is explainable simply by the lower price. If the absolute price  
was all that mattered, sellers would be indifferent between running a sale and lowering list  
price. Rational consumers would simply compare their willingness to pay against the cur-  
rent price and decide whether to purchase. It would not matter to a rational consumer if the  
price she was paying was the list price or a sale price. behavioral economics and pricing 387

a “Was Price” \(right\). Source\: Amazon.com.  
But both brick-and-mortar retailers and online retailers like to present prices as dis-  
counts from higher standard prices. As an example, Figure 14.3 shows the prices of two  
different popular toys displayed on Amazon.com. The Pull and Sing Puppy on the right has  
a price of \$9.99 presented with a “Was Price” of \$12.97, while the Take Apart Racing Car  
on the left has a price of \$15.99 presented with a “List Price” of \$26.65. In both cases, the  
selling price is presented in combination with the List or Was price and the corresponding  
savings. The List and Was prices establish a higher benchmark price compared to which the  
actual price can be evaluated as a gain.  
The practice has become sufficiently ubiquitous that some customers have become skep-  
tical about the validity of the list price. A New York Times reporter wrote\:  
Le Creuset’s iron-handled skillet, 11 3/4 inches wide and cherry in color. Amazon said late  
last week that it would knock \$60 off the \$260 list price to sell the skillet for \$200. . . . The  
suggested price for the skillet at Williams-Sonoma.com is \$285 but customers can buy it  
for \$200. At AllModern.com, the list price is \$250 but its sales price is \$200. At Cutleryand-  
More.com, the list price is \$285 and the sales price is \$200. An additional 15 or so on-line  
retailers — some hosted by Amazon, others on Google Shopping — charge \$200. On Le  
Creuset’s own site, it sells the pan at \$200. \(Streitfeld 2016\)  
Indeed, the power of perceived discounts is so strong that sellers are tempted to es-  
tablish fictitious list prices against which they can pose their actual prices. A 1989 law-  
suit held that the May Company “deceived customers by artificially inflating its so-called  
‘original’ or ‘regular’ \(reference\) prices and then promoting discounts from these prices  
as bargains. This practice has become so rife in the U.S. retail environment that many  
consumers will only buy ‘on sale,’ and then are skeptical about whether they have really  
bought at a fair price” \(Kaufmann, Ortmeyer, and Smith 1991, 117\). While displaying  
fictitious list prices is clearly deceptive \(and likely illegal\), whenever a seller is legitimately  
selling an item at a discount, it is extremely wise to make sure that customers are made  
aware of the fact. 388  
behavioral economics and pricing  
14.2.2 Reference Prices  
Kent Monroe \(1973\) introduced the idea that buyers shop with a reference price in mind  
that they consider fair. A price close to the reference price will be considered reasonable,  
and a consumer is likely to purchase if the selling price is close to her reference price. Prices  
much higher than the reference price may even trigger anger —“\$30 for a hamburger!  
That’s ridiculous!”  
While it is good to be priced below a customer’s reference price, a price much lower than  
the reference price may cause suspicion that the item for sale is inferior or damaged. As an  
example, a start-up invented a process that could produce paper strips for use by diabet-  
ics to measure their blood sugar at a fraction of the cost of previous methods. Historically,  
these strips had sold for about \$2.00 each. With the new process, the company decided to  
sell its strips \(which were of equal quality to those already on the market\) for \$0.50 each.  
To its surprise, the strips did not sell well. However, when the company raised the price to  
\$1.75 each, sales skyrocketed. The historical selling price had become the reference price  
in consumers’ minds and the substantially lower price was interpreted as meaning that the  
strips were of lower quality — a major consideration to customers whose health depended  
on accuracy of measurement.  
The reference price is not the same as willingness to pay. Willingness to pay is theoreti-  
cally a property only of the buyer’s utility for the item under consideration, which should  
be independent of current or past prices. On the other hand, reference price is a function  
of observed prices, past and present. In the example of the gasoline station discussed ear-  
lier, we assumed that the reference price was the list price. The use of “list prices” and “was  
prices” by retailers is clearly an attempt to influence consumers’ reference prices.  
This raises the issue of how reference prices are formed. As noted by Markus  
­ Husemann-Kopetzky, “People continuously learn new price information from past pur-  
chases, from current offerings of various competitors, from prices of comparable products,  
from regular or list prices, and so on. When consumers consider this information, they  
might adjust their internal reference price in either direction” \(2018, 111\). How different  
consumers process different types of information to update their reference prices is a topic  
of ongoing research. A useful survey lists a number of factors that could influence reference  
price, including price history, promotion history, store-visit history, brand, whether the  
purchase was planned or unplanned, store type \(everyday-low-pricing \[EDLP\] stores like  
Walmart versus “hi-lo” stores that cycle between list prices and discount prices\), advertised  
prices, frequency of purchases, durability, and associated services \(Mazumdar, Raj, and  
Sinha 2005\). These factors carry different weights for different types of customers. Given  
this complexity and the heterogeneity of consumers, it is impossible to perfectly engineer  
the reference price for any single consumer or chosen group.  
While perfect reference price engineering may be impossible, there are several practical  
implications of reference pricing. If a customer becomes used to seeing an item at a low  
price, she will expect the price to be low in the future and will be less likely to purchase if  
it is high. This can create a dilemma for the seller. Dropping the price on an item now may  
be optimal from a tactical point of view \(that is, it may maximize short-run contribution\), behavioral economics and pricing 389  
but it may have future repercussions if it lowers the reference prices of potential future  
customers. Several studies have shown that, if consumers utilize past prices in formulating  
their reference prices for future purchases, a cyclical hi-lo policy of periodic discounts can  
be optimal. It is also likely that if sellers ignore the effects of their pricing on reference price  
formation, then they will tend to underprice.6  
14.2.3 Mental Budgeting  
You are planning to go to a play by yourself one Sunday afternoon. Consider the following  
two scenarios.  
•  
•  
Scenario 1\: You have already bought a \$20 ticket for the play. Just after leaving your  
apartment, you open your wallet, and the ticket slides out and slips down the storm  
drain, where it is lost.  
Scenario 2\: You do not have a ticket but plan to buy one at the box office. Just after  
leaving your apartment, you open your wallet and a \$20 bill slips out of your wallet  
and is lost down the storm drain.  
The question under both scenarios is\: Would you go to the play and buy a \$20 ticket at the  
box office? \(Assume in both cases that you know that tickets will still be available for \$20  
when you arrive.\) Kahneman and Tversky \(1979\) found that the percentage of people who  
would go to the box office and buy a ticket is much higher under the second scenario than  
the first. Of 250 college students presented with the second scenario, 187 said they would  
buy a ticket, while only 120 of 250 said they would in the first scenario. This is contrary to  
economic rationality. The wealth effect of losing a \$20 bill and a \$20 ticket are exactly the  
same. Why are people more willing to purchase a ticket in one case and not the other? The  
explanation, which has been supported by numerous experiments, is that people main-  
tain mental budgets and evaluate expenditures against these budgets. Thus, someone might  
have a mental budget of \$20 \(or \$30\) for the day’s entertainment. The initial purchase of a  
\$20 ticket is counted against this budget, so the purchase of a second ticket would exceed  
the mental budget. On the other hand, the loss of a \$20 bill is not counted against the day’s  
entertainment budget \(perhaps it is counted as a loss against general funds\), so there is still  
sufficient entertainment budget to purchase a ticket.  
Mental budgeting can have implications for how \(and if \) products and services should  
be bundled. If certain options, say, a top-of-the-line car stereo, are viewed as counting  
against a separate mental budget than the base product \(the car itself \), then it will generally  
be more effective to sell them separately.  
14.2.4 Compromise Effects, Attraction Effects, and Decoys  
Not only do customers use their prior price experiences in making current purchase de-  
cisions; they also use the prices of substitutes and variations in their purchase decisions,  
sometimes in surprising ways. A particularly striking example of this was described by Dan  
Ariely \(2010\). In a study, he offered students one of two different choice sets for subscribing  
to the Economist\: 390  
behavioral economics and pricing  
Choice Set 1 Choice Set 2  
Internet subscription\: \$59 Print and internet subscription\: \$125 Internet subscription\: \$59  
Print-only subscription\: \$125  
Print and internet subscription\: \$125  
A total of 68% of the students presented with Choice Set 1 chose the internet subscrip-  
tion, while 32% chose the print-and-internet subscription. However, when presented with  
Choice Set 2, 84% chose the print-and-internet option, while 16% chose internet only and  
0% chose print only. The addition of an irrelevant third option substantially changed cus-  
tomer choice. In this case, it changed the average sales price per transaction from \$80.12 to  
\$114.44 — a 43% increase resulting from nothing more than the addition of an option that  
was of no interest to any customer.  
In the example above, the print-only subscription in Choice Set 2 is an example of a  
decoy\: an irrelevant product that is added primarily to boost the sales of another prod-  
uct — in this case the print and internet subscription —by making it look like a bargain in  
comparison. Needless to say, the fact that decoys can work by boosting the sales of other  
alternatives appears irrational— if consumers were fully rational, the addition of an irrel-  
evant alternative should not influence their choice between two relevant alternatives. Yet, as  
the Economist example shows, this is exactly what happens.  
Decoys can be considered as particularly extreme examples of the attraction effect— the  
fact that introducing a dominated alternative can increase relative sales of a high-end prod-  
uct. The idea is illustrated in Figure 14.4. Here, we assume two products in the marketplace  
at two levels of quality and at different prices represented by points A and B. Correspond-  
ing to customer expectations, the lower-quality product A is priced less than the higher-  
quality product B —which means that neither product dominates the other. Note that any  
product in the shaded region is dominated because a better product is available at a lower  
price. Product C1 is a decoy that is dominated by product A, which is the same quality but  
lower price. Product C1 is unlikely to generate much demand on its own, but offering it will  
move some demand from product B to product A. Similarly, product C2 is a decoy that is

dominated by product B. Again, product C2 is unlikely to attract much demand itself, but it  
is likely to shift some demand from product A to product B.  
A related phenomenon is the compromise effect in which adding a superior product to  
an existing product’s market at a higher price will cause demand to shift to higher-price  
products. One example of the compromise effect is provided by Starbucks, which initially  
offered its drip coffee in three sizes\: small \(8 oz.\), tall \(12 oz.\), and grande \(16 oz.\). In 1996,  
Starbucks introduced a fourth size, the 20-ounce venti. According to some sources, in ad-  
dition to attracting sales itself, introduction of the venti led to a 10–15% increase in grande  
sales and a corresponding reduction in small and tall sales \(Shartsis 2016\). The increase  
in grande sales is an example of the compromise effect — the introduction of the superior  
alternative led to increased sales for the next best alternative. In Figure 14.4, the venti might  
be represented by point D — it is actually superior \(i.e., larger\) than the best existing alter-  
native represented by point B. Because it is not dominated by any of the alternatives, it may  
attract some customers on its own merits, but it also will cause business to shift from point  
A to point B.  
The compromise effect has been described as the tendency of customers to choose an  
intermediate option when they are uncertain about the relative quality of different options  
or their own strength of preference among them.7  
14.3 FAIRNESS  
The reaction to Amazon’s DVD pricing illustrates the emotional response that differential  
pricing can evoke. Amazon learned the hard way that differential pricing can be the third  
rail of pricing. However, the Amazon story does not mean that differential pricing has to  
be entirely ruled out. On the one hand, a reputation for unfair pricing may alienate current  
and future customers. On the other hand, as Chapter 6 shows, the potential profitability  
increase from differentiated prices is great enough that companies that can find acceptable  
ways to segment their customers and charge differential prices have a strong incentive to  
do so.  
This section addresses the issue of fairness as it applies to customer reactions to pricing.  
Fairness in the sense discussed here — and the way that most people mean it when they cry,  
“That’s not fair!”—was not part of neoclassical economics. However, behavioral econom-  
ics has begun to research how consumers form their perceptions of fairness and how these  
perceptions influence the choices that they make. This is still an active area of research, and  
many aspects of perceived fairness in pricing are not fully understood. However, it has been  
shown that customers evaluate the fairness of a price in at least two ways. The first is relative  
to the perceived profit being earned by the seller. The second is relative to the prices the  
customer believes other buyers are paying. We consider these two in order.  
14.3.1 Dual Entitlement  
The first place that fairness can enter into pricing is via the buyer’s perception of the seller’s  
profit. Most people would agree that “greedy” companies should not generate “obscene” 392  
behavioral economics and pricing  
profits by “gouging” customers with “unfairly high” prices. Most people could probably  
give examples of pricing they believe violated this principle — although they might be  
harder pressed to give an objective criterion of when profits become obscene or when a  
high price becomes gouging. Nonetheless, most customers believe that it is unfair for com-  
panies to charge too much for their goods and services — even if customers are willing to  
pay a high price for the item. This idea was formalized by Daniel Kahneman, Jack Knetsch,  
and Richard Thaler \(1986b\) as the concept of dual entitlement. Dual entitlement postulates  
that consumers believe they are entitled to a “reasonable” price and firms are entitled to  
a “reasonable” profit. Pricing that seems solely aimed to increase profit beyond what is  
viewed as reasonable is likely to be viewed as unfair. Specific implications of the principle  
of dual entitlement include the following.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Raising prices to recoup increased costs is viewed as fair by most consumers.  
Raising prices simply to increase profits is likely to be viewed as unfair —even if peo-  
ple are willing to pay the higher price.  
Deviations from customary practices are often viewed with suspicion as hidden at-  
tempts to raise price.  
Providing information about the reason for increasing a price can often help acceptance.  
One of the predictions of the theory of dual entitlement is that customers should be more  
accepting of price rises resulting from cost increases than they would be of price rises result-  
ing from supply shortages. This does, in fact, appear to be the case — for example, charging  
more for vital supplies immediately before or after the arrival of a hurricane is viewed as  
very unfair by consumers. In this case, suppliers appear to be raising prices simply to grow  
profits unrelated to any change in costs in violation of dual entitlement. In the face of wide-  
spread consumer outrage after some suppliers hiked prices in the wake of Hurricane An-  
drew in 1992, Florida passed a law against price gouging. As of 2019, 35 states have passed  
laws against price gouging during periods of emergency \(FindLaw 2020\).  
Further evidence of dual entitlement was gathered by Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler,  
who posed the following scenario to a sample of consumers\: “A hardware store has been  
selling snow shovels for \$15. The morning after a large snowstorm, the store raises the price  
to \$20. Rate this action as\: completely fair, acceptable, somewhat unfair, or very unfair”  
\(1986b, 729\). Of 107 respondents, 18% rated the pricing action as “acceptable or com-  
pletely fair,” while 82% rated it as “somewhat unfair or very unfair.” In a similar vein, Kah-  
neman, Knetsch, and Thaler asked what a store should do if it found it had exactly one item  
left in stock of that year’s most popular toy, assuming that all other stores were sold out of it  
\(in their 1986 paper, it was a Cabbage Patch doll\). A vast majority of those surveyed thought  
that it would be “very unfair” for the store simply to sell the toy to the highest bidder.  
One problem created by dual entitlement is due to the fact that customers do not have  
a very good idea of sellers’ costs or profits. A 2001 survey of price and profit perceptions  
produced the results shown in Table 14.1. Each of the numbers in Table 14.1 is a gross  
overestimate of the actual margin. A typical discount store might realize a net margin of  
4% and a typical grocery store 2%— not the 30% and 27.5%, respectively, that customers behavioral economics and pricing 393

apparently believe. Part of the discrepancy may be explained by reference pricing, since  
consumers tend to set their reference prices based on the lowest prices they see for an item  
and they assume that these prices are still profitable for the seller. Since merchants often  
mark down items below cost, consumers tend to assume that the original list price must  
have included a vast profit for the seller. This creates a problem. As described in Chapter 12,  
markdown pricing is often the optimal tactical policy for a merchant selling a stock of per-  
ishable goods. However, the short-term gain in profitability from the markdowns must be  
compared with the longer-term effect of creating the perception in consumers’ minds that  
the cost of the item is low and that the merchant is reaping exorbitant profits at list price.  
The principle of dual entitlement seems to be closely entwined with reference prices  
in the minds of customers. Consider the following two scenarios, posed by Kahneman,  
Knetsch, and Thaler \(1986a\).  
•  
•  
A shortage has developed for a popular model of automobile, and customers must  
now wait two months for delivery. A dealer has been selling these cars at list price.  
Now the dealer prices this model at \$200 above list price.  
A shortage has developed for a popular model of automobile, and customers must  
now wait two months for delivery. A dealer has been selling these cars at a discount of  
\$200 below list price. Now the dealer sells this model only at list price.  
In the first case, 71% of those surveyed thought the dealer’s action was unfair, while only  
42% thought it was unfair in the second case. It appears that respondents are using the \(un-  
specified\) list price as the reference price at which the dealer is making a fair return. Pricing  
at this reference price is viewed as intrinsically more fair than pricing above it, independent  
of the absolute price being charged or the historical pricing practices of the seller. This is  
likely one reason why many customers view a dealer pricing a hot new model of car above  
the manufacturer’s suggested retail price as unfair.  
In view of this concern with fairness, music concerts and sporting events sometimes  
deliberately set prices below market based on the desire of the artist and /or promoter not  
to be perceived as gouging the fan base. As the late rock-star Tom Petty put it\: 394  
behavioral economics and pricing  
My top price is about \$65, and I turn a very healthy profit on that; I make millions on the  
road. I see no reason to bring the price up, even though I have heard many an anxious  
promoter say, “We could charge 150 bucks for this.” . . . It’s so wrong to say, “OK, we’ve got  
them on the ticket and we’ve got them on the beer and we’ve got them on everything else,  
let’s get them on the damn parking.” \(Quoted in Wild 2002, 23\)  
Kid Rock decided to take a “pay cut” on his 2013 tour by selling tickets in every venue  
for \$20, even though the market-clearing price was much higher \(Waddell 2013\). Bruce  
Springsteen gave away an estimated \$3 million in potential revenue to his fans at a Phila-  
delphia concert by selling tickets at a single price that was well below the price that would  
have cleared the market. Since the concert grossed about \$1.5 million, this is evidence of a  
serious desire to avoid perceptions of unfair pricing \(Perry 1997\).  
Many economists would argue that these attempts to keep concerts affordable for the  
average fan are in vain because underpriced tickets are rapidly purchased by scalpers who  
either resell in person or use online marketplaces such as RazorGator to sell them at the  
much higher market-clearing price. Indeed, many of the artists and promoters who want  
to make tickets available more cheaply have resorted to complicated rationing methods to  
try to ensure that scalpers do not purchase all the cheap tickets to resell on the secondary  
market. The fact that some artists believe that such strenuous exercises are worthwhile is  
strong evidence that they want fans to believe that they are being fair in setting ticket prices  
and not merely chasing massive personal profits.  
Dual entitlement also helps explain some of the negative reaction to Coke’s temperature-  
sensitive pricing scheme. Raising the price of a Coke on a hot day is viewed as similar to  
raising snow shovel prices after a snowstorm. This perception was reinforced by the fact  
that Coke’s announcement focused on the increased-price scenario, causing consumers to  
see the cold-weather price as the baseline price. It is likely that they believed Coke was mak-  
ing a reasonable profit at the cold-weather price and the hot-weather price was an attempt  
to gain an unreasonable profit, violating the principle of dual entitlement.  
14.3.2 Interpersonal Fairness  
As the Amazon case shows, price differentiation is an extremely sensitive issue. From the  
seller’s point of view, one of the most annoying aspects of interpersonal price comparison  
is that it can turn a happy customer into an unhappy customer for reasons totally unrelated  
to the quality of the underlying product or the responsiveness of customer service. The dis-  
gruntled Amazon customer who complained to DVDtalk.com about the price quoted for  
the DVD was not dissatisfied with his purchase or with Amazon’s service; he was unhappy  
because of the idea that someone may have been quoted a lower price. As one of the report-  
ers covering the Amazon story wrote, “I don’t like the idea that someone is paying less than  
I am for the same product, at the exact same instant” \(Coursey 2000\). In other words, “I was  
happy with my purchase until I found out that someone else paid less.” This ex post effect  
will be familiar to anyone who has ever been responsible for setting salaries\: employees  
who were perfectly happy with their raises become enraged upon hearing that someone  
considered less worthy received a larger raise. Similarly, learning that someone else received behavioral economics and pricing 395  
\(or was offered\) a better price for the same good can instantly convert a happy customer to  
an unhappy one. This is irrational, at least in the narrow economic sense\: my consumer’s  
surplus should depend only on the price I paid, not on what others paid. Despite this, as  
the Amazon DVD pricing example shows, pricing that is perceived as unfair can generate a  
tremendous amount of negative emotion, ill will, and bad publicity.  
Many cruise lines have faced this issue over the years. As discussed in Chapter 8, cruise  
lines have constrained, perishable capacity and most of the larger cruise lines actively prac-  
tice revenue management to maximize the revenue for different sailings. This means that, if  
a sailing is not booking up as expected, the cruise line will lower the price for different cabin  
types to stimulate demand. Thus, different passengers can end up paying different prices  
for the same cabin type on the same sailing. It is likely that such price differences will not  
remain secret. People on a cruise dine together every evening. On the second or third night,  
the conversation will almost inevitably turn to prices. Mr. Smith mentions that his travel  
agent got a great deal for him and Mrs. Smith — an upper-deck, ocean-view stateroom for  
only \$3,200. Mr. Jones responds that his travel agent got him an upper-deck, ocean-view  
stateroom for \$2,800. Mr. Smith’s face falls, and his cruise is suddenly ruined — at least  
for the moment. The cruise industry has tried various mechanisms to avoid this scenario.  
Currently the most popular appears to be a low-price guarantee or best-price guarantee  
in which a cruise line will provide a rebate — often in the form of an onboard credit — if a  
lower price is advertised within 48 hours of a purchase.  
There is evidence that emotional reactions to unfair treatment are widespread across  
cultures and that the phenomenon has deep roots. Just how deep these roots might go was  
demonstrated by researchers at the Yerkes Primate Lab who performed a set of experiments  
in which capuchin monkeys could “buy” food using stone tokens. The food reward was  
either a cucumber slice or a grape. The monkeys preferred grapes, but those who received  
a cucumber slice in return for a token were happy until they saw that another monkey was  
getting a grape. When this happened, the behavior of the monkeys receiving cucumbers  
changed abruptly — they refused to eat the cucumber slices and threw them back at the  
researchers — reactions that never occurred when all of the monkeys received cucumber  
slices. The researchers concluded\: “Capuchin monkeys . . . react negatively to previously  
acceptable awards if a partner gets a better deal” \(Brosnan and de Waal 2003, 299\).8  
By this point, you might be forgiven for believing that any form of price differentia-  
tion will be considered unfair by consumers. However, this is not the case. We have seen  
that dynamic pricing is standard practice in many industries, including both online and  
brick-and-mortar retailers. Furthermore, price differentiation is widely exercised in many  
industries through such practices as couponing, sales promotions, markdowns, regional  
pricing, and peak-load pricing with little or no objection from consumers. In addition,  
some examples of direct, customer-based price differentiation that are widely practiced  
with little controversy include these\:  
•  
Senior citizen discounts  
•  
Student discounts  
•  
“Kids ride free” 396  
behavioral economics and pricing  
•  
•  
Family specials  
Lower tuition for in-state students than for out-of-state students at state universities  
•  
College scholarships for low-income students, athletes, or those who score higher on  
tests  
These examples are all pure price differentiation, or group pricing in the terminology of  
Chapter 6, in the sense that they are based entirely on characteristics of an individual cus-  
tomer and do not reflect any product or cost-of-service differences. Because of this, we  
would expect them to be controversial. Yet, in most cases, such policies are not particularly  
controversial, probably because they correspond to an ideal of giving discounts to “deserv-  
ing” groups. What groups are deemed deserving will vary by country and culture. For many  
years, the French national railway \(SNCF\) maintained special discounts \(“social tariffs”\)  
for certain classes of workers, schoolchildren, apprentices, the unemployed, the disabled,  
the families of soldiers killed in World War I, and large families. The large-family \(Familles  
nombreuses\) tariff provided discounts of 30% for families with three children, 40% for fam-  
ilies with four, 50% for families with five, and 75% for families with six or more children.  
This particular discount was adopted in 1921 to encourage repopulation of the country  
after World War I and remained in place until 2008 \(De Boras et al. 2008; Chemin 2008\).  
Perhaps the most controversial form of group pricing that is still widely practiced is  
gender-based pricing. It is well established that women tend to be charged more than men  
for certain products and services. A study by the New York City Department of Consumer  
Affairs in 2015 found that across a sample of identical \(or very similar\) products marketed  
separately to men and women, the women’s version was priced higher 42% of the time,  
while the men’s version was priced higher only 18% of the time \(Bessendorf 2015\). A sur-  
vey by researchers at the University of Central Florida showed that, on the average, women  
tended to be charged \$2.17 more than men for a haircut at a low-end salon, \$11.71 more at  
a midrange salon, and \$12.24 more at a high-end salon. Furthermore, women tended to be  
charged an average of \$3.95 for dry-cleaning a shirt compared to \$2.06 for men, and wom-  
en’s deodorant averaged \$0.29 per ounce more than men’s deodorant. The prices of other  
types of dry-cleaning services, such as two-piece suits, blazers, and slacks, and other types  
of personal grooming products, such as razors, body spray, and shave gel, did not show  
statistically significant differences between women and men \(Duesterhaus et al. 2011\).  
The surcharge that women pay over men for these products and services has been called  
the “pink tax.” There have been popular press articles on the pink tax \(see Sebastian 2016;  
Ngabirano 2017\), and a few jurisdictions, such as California, Massachusetts, Miami /Dade  
County, and New York City, have outlawed gender differences in pricing. On the other  
hand, anti – pink tax legislation has failed to pass in a number of locations in the face of  
opposition by business lobbyists. Even in jurisdictions with laws banning gender discrimi-  
nation in pricing, enforcement has been sporadic and the practice persists. For example, in  
California, fewer than five suits were brought in the 20 years following the passage of the  
Gender Tax Repeal Act in 1995. And, although gender-based pricing for salons was \(and  
still is\) widely practiced in California, only five lawsuits were brought in the 10 years fol-  
lowing the adoption of the legislation \(Jacobsen 2018\). This might suggest that much of the behavioral economics and pricing 397  
public has learned to accept the practice — or is at least not sufficiently outraged by it to  
pursue legal remedies.9  
You may realize by now that there is no universally reliable test to determine what types  
of pricing will be widely accepted by consumers and what will raise complaints. Cultural,  
social, and educational factors all seem to play a role —what is acceptable to one group \(or  
one consumer\) may not be to others. Policies that favor groups perceived as disadvantaged,  
such as the elderly, seem to be more acceptable than those that appear more arbitrary,  
despite the fact that senior discounts could often be taking advantage of the tendency of  
seniors to be more price sensitive than other groups. Surveys have shown that business and  
economics students tend to accept differentiated and dynamic pricing tactics more readily  
than the general public. For example, in the snow shovel scenario discussed earlier in the  
chapter, 76% of University of Chicago economics students said that raising the price of  
snow shovels after a snowstorm was acceptable, compared to 18% of the general public.  
This disparity would suggest that the prospect for future pricing debacles is good, since it is  
the business and economics students who are likely to be formulating the pricing schemes  
of tomorrow and, as a group, they may be oblivious to presentation and fairness issues.  
14.4 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRICING AND REVENUE OPTIMIZATION  
The topic of irrational consumer behavior and its influence on real-world pricing is rela-  
tively new and not perfectly understood — especially when it comes to judgments of fair-  
ness. As one researcher put it, “Fairness, it seems, is a complex and dynamic concept with  
many varied inputs” \(Andreoni, Brown, and Vesterlund 2003, 22\). Given this, you might  
conclude that the current state of knowledge is that consumers act rationally except when  
they do not. To some extent this is a fair judgment. Nonetheless, enough is known that it is  
possible to make specific recommendations to increase the effectiveness of pricing and rev-  
enue optimization and increase its chances for consumer acceptance. We start by looking  
at a summary of the factors that make tactical pricing schemes more acceptable. We then  
consider the implications of these for implementing pricing and revenue optimization. Fi-  
nally, we return to the concept of fairness and examine two cases in which unfair pricing  
may have won out over fair pricing, despite consumer reactions.  
Key elements that influence the acceptability of pricing and revenue optimization pro-  
grams are shown in Table 14.2. The impact of these can be summarized as follows.  
•  
•  
Product-based. Product-based pricing differences are much more readily accepted  
than group pricing. As Chapter 6 shows, there is not a clear distinction between  
product-based differentiation and customer-based differentiation. To the extent that  
a pricing difference can be presented as product based rather than customer based, it  
is much more likely to be readily accepted.  
Openness. Customers certainly claim to prefer pricing schemes that are open. Some  
of the negative press that Amazon received for its DVD pricing dwelled on the idea  
that Amazon was doing something in secret. Furthermore, one of the lessons of the  
Amazon case is that any attempt to implement differential or dynamic pricing on 398

the internet will be discovered and publicized. You should avoid any online pricing  
scheme that does not meet the New York Times test — that is, you would be averse to  
having it the topic of an article in the New York Times.  
Reasonable. Customers consider certain reasons for raising prices more reasonable  
than others. They are more accepting of a price raise due to increased costs than they  
are of one that is just about increasing profit. Customers also have implicit beliefs  
about a seller’s costs and —via dual entitlement and reference pricing — some idea of  
what reasonable prices should be. Under the right circumstances, communicating the  
reasons behind discounts, but especially price increases, can help acceptance.  
Discounts and promotions are much more readily accepted than surcharges. Prospect  
theory predicts that the same price will be viewed more positively if it is the result  
of a discount rather than a surcharge. Furthermore, finding that another customer  
received a discount is much more likely to be received with equanimity than finding  
that one has been charged a surcharge — even when the net result is the same. As a  
result, list prices tend to be high, with discounts and promotions commonplace and  
surcharges rare.  
Rewards. In a similar vein, a reward for loyalty or volume purchases is much more  
likely to be acceptable than any kind of penalty. Airlines do much better offering  
frequent-flyer rewards than they would offering infrequent-flyer penalties.  
Easy to understand. Programs viewed as easy to understand are generally more ac-  
cepted. Programs that are difficult to understand will cause customers to be con-  
cerned that they are not getting a good deal simply because they do not know how to  
play the game. Several studies have shown that, in some cases, customers may actu-  
ally prefer suppliers who offer them fewer options — even if their resulting price is  
higher \(Iyengar and Lepper 2000\). Furthermore, customers often struggle to find the  
“best” option in cases in which computing the “real” price of an option is difficult —  
this is a particular issue in the case of financial products such as mortgages in which  
the total interest paid is a complex function of the interest rate, the term, the down  
payment, and other factors. In cases with many complex choices, many customers  
will revert to a simple heuristic such as “We’ll take the mortgage with the shortest  
term that has a monthly payment within our budget” even though that may not be  
the best choice.10 behavioral economics and pricing 399

Available. There seems to be a critical distinction in customers’ minds between a  
deal that is potentially available to them and one that is not — a distinction closely  
related to the difference between product-based and customer-based segmentation.  
Customers are much more likely to be accepting of a discount that was \(at least in  
theory\) available to them than one that was not available to them under any circum-  
stance. Thus, the acceptance of early-booking discounts in the airline industry was  
helped by the fact that any customer could take advantage of them, if only they had  
been able to make their travel plans earlier. In the same vein, the wide acceptance  
of discount coupons seems to stem in part from the fact that those who do not take  
advantage of the coupons realize that they could have done so by taking the time to  
clip them out of the newspaper. These behavior-based differentiation strategies seem  
to be much more broadly acceptable to customers than identity-based differentiation,  
which is predicated on factors such as race, age, and gender.  
Familiar. Customers are naturally conservative — they prefer traditional and custom-  
ary ways of doing business and distrust innovations. Virtually any change in the way  
that prices are calculated, billed, or presented is likely to be viewed with suspicion as  
an attempt to raise prices. For example, there was widespread belief among consum-  
ers in the Eurozone that merchants took advantage of the conversion from the native  
currency to the Euro to raise prices.11 As another example, ride-sharing companies  
such as Uber and Lyft traditionally based rates on a “surge multiplier” applied to  
the base fare \(see Section 7.6.4 for details on how these multipliers are calculated  
and used\). In 2019, Uber experimented with “additive surge,” in which the amount  
that drivers received would be a fixed surcharge — for example, \$2.10 — to the base  
price of a ride rather than a multiplier \(Garg and Nazerzadeh 2019\). Many drivers  
assumed — largely without evidence — that the new practice was designed to reduce  
their earnings and enrich Uber.  
You should anticipate negative reactions to virtually any deviation from traditional  
pricing practice. The least disruptive way to introduce pricing and revenue opti-  
mization in a market is within the context of existing and accepted tactical pricing  
practices, such as markdowns, promotions, and customized pricing.  
One final note\: While it is important to be sensitive to customer price perceptions, it  
is equally important not to allow anticipated customer reaction to squelch all possibility  
of pricing innovation. Many of the key findings on price perception, prospect theory, and  
fairness have been based on surveys, and, as any marketing professional knows, survey re-  
sponses do not necessarily reflect how people will react in real life. For example, a majority  
of golfers stated that charging different prices depending on when they booked a tee time  
\(e.g., two weeks in advance versus two days in advance\) would be unacceptable \(Kimes and  
Wirtz 2003\). Nonetheless, several golf courses and online golf booking services have im-  
plemented time-of-booking pricing, with few or no customer complaints. While a pricing  
innovation may initially meet resistance and generate complaints, over time it may become  
the accepted norm. This is certainly what happened with airline fares —when revenue  
management was first initiated, customers complained about changing fares and that “the 400  
behavioral economics and pricing  
person sitting next to me is paying half of what I paid.” However, over time, dynamic pric-  
ing and revenue management became accepted as the norm, and the complaints subsided.  
The lesson is that customer complaints and negative press do not necessarily mean that a  
pricing program is a failure. Consider the case of the First National Bank of Chicago \(usu-  
ally called First Chicago\). In the first quarter of 1992, the First Chicago realized that it had  
a problem with its retail banking operations. It calculated that 67% of its retail customers  
were not achieving adequate profitability. A primary reason\: whereas many customers used  
tellers rarely if it all, a small number were so-called transaction hounds using tellers more  
than four times a month while maintaining less than \$2,500 in their accounts. Since teller  
salaries and benefits were a major part of the bank’s variable cost, it seemed only fair to  
charge customers for the service. As Jerry Jurgensen, First Chicago’s executive vice presi-  
dent in charge of branches, put it, “If nobody changed their behavior, 80% of my customers  
would never see the \$3.00 charge. For the other 20%, I want one of three things to happen\: I  
need for them to change their behavior; I need for them to be willing to pay more, or I need  
for them to find another bank” \(O’Sullivan 1997, 44\).  
First Chicago held a breakfast press conference to announce the new plan. It was not  
well received. The headline in the Chicago Tribune read, “First Chicago Loses Touch with  
Humans.” Competing banks leaped at the chance to tout their free checking services. The  
story hit the national papers and was even featured in a joke on The Jay Leno Show.  
First Chicago was baffled by the reaction to its new pricing scheme. It had tested the plan  
for 18 months on different focus groups. It had gone out of its way \(perhaps too far out of  
its way\) to be open, announcing the new scheme at a press conference. And, after all, the  
\$3.00 teller fee was based on passing a real cost through to the customer, just the type of  
price change that the principle of dual entitlement predicted would be acceptable.  
This would seem like a classic case of a pricing fiasco, and it is often presented as such\:  
A clueless marketing department instituted a bonehead pricing program that ignored cus-  
tomer sensitivities and reaped a whirlwind of criticism. Another disaster, to be put along-  
side Amazon and Coca-Cola in the annals of pricing infamy. However, there is a twist to the  
story. From a financial point of view, the First Chicago program was a success. According to  
an article in the American Banking Association Banking Journal\:  
Banks are uniform in disassociating their profitability-probing behavior from First Chi-  
cago’s, which some consider to have been “PR suicide.” “They fired their marketing people  
the next day \[after the teller-fee story broke\],” said a source who preferred not to be named.  
However, it is widely conceded that First Chicago has had material success. It reportedly  
lost less than 1% of customers, not the 10% predicted — despite some other Chicago-area  
banks advertising against it —while branch staff decreased 30% and ATM activity “sky-  
rocketed” \(ATM deposits grew 100% in three months\). Speaking seven months after the  
restructuring, \[former First Chicago senior vice president Marion Foote\] said the bank was  
making an “adequate return” on 44% of customers, versus 33% beforehand, and customer  
satisfaction scores were higher than ever. \(O’Sullivan 1997, 43\)  
Was teller surcharging a success or a failure at First Chicago? It depends on whom you  
ask. The marketing and public relations staff who lost their jobs would probably claim that behavioral economics and pricing 401  
it was PR suicide. Anecdotal evidence seemed to indicate that some potential new custom-  
ers were lost because of the negative publicity. But from the cold numbers it would appear  
that the teller fees were successful at achieving the announced goals\: increasing customer  
profitability. It is suggestive that, despite the overwhelmingly negative publicity, First Chi-  
cago retained the fees for more than seven years, until it became part of BankOne. And  
since 1995, more and more banks have begun to charge teller fees \(often as part of bundled  
pricing packages\). For many banks, the purpose of the fee is to motivate customers to move  
from using human tellers \(at an estimated cost of \$4 per transaction\) to using video tell-  
ers \(at an estimated cost of \$2 per transaction\) \(Lake 2018\). However, the banks who have  
adopted teller fees since First Chicago have had the good sense not to call a press conference  
to announce that they were doing so.  
Finally, competitive and market forces may not allow a company to simplify its pricing,  
even if it wants to. Consider the case of American Airlines.  
By the spring of 1992, Robert Crandall, chairman and CEO of American Airlines, de-  
cided that airline fares had gotten too complex. While American’s revenue management  
system had originally given it an advantage over its rivals, United and Continental had  
developed systems of their own and it was not clear that American retained any advantage.  
Furthermore, customers continued to complain about a system where business travelers  
paid much more money than leisure travelers for substantially the same service. Simplify-  
ing fares seemed to be a logical choice — it would allow all of the carriers to jettison the  
increasingly complex fare structures, eliminate much discounting, and improve customer  
satisfaction, all at the same time. American had led the majors into this swamp, and as the  
world’s largest carrier, perhaps American could be the airline to lead them out.  
On April 9, 1992, American Airlines called a press conference to announce its “value  
pricing” program. Crandall explained the rationale for change\:  
We have said for some time that our yields are too low, yet the conventional solution,  
higher and higher full fares and an ever-growing array of discount fares surrounded by an  
ever-changing plethora of restrictions, simply does not work. . . . In our unsuccessful pur-  
suit of profits, we have made our pricing so complex that our customers neither understand  
it nor think it is fair. \(Quoted in Silk and Michael 1993, 5\)  
Under value pricing, American sold only four fares in every market\: first class, regu-  
lar coach, 7-day advance purchase booking discount coach, and 21-day advance purchase  
booking discount coach. This simple structure was to replace the previous situation, in  
which American often offered 10 or even 20 different fares in a market, with different book-  
ing restrictions in different markets. Value pricing would reduce the total number of fares in  
the network from 500,000 to 70,000 \(Silk and Michael 1993\). As part of the plan, American  
also lowered its fares —first-class fares were reduced by 20–50% and regular coach fares  
were cut by about 40%. However, a myriad of other promotions and discount programs  
for groups and corporate customers were eliminated. Crandall’s plan was that the new and  
simpler fares would induce enough additional traffic to outweigh the fare reductions.  
American expected other carriers to follow its lead. After all, the complex fares associated  
with traditional revenue management were just as unpopular at competing carriers, and the 402  
behavioral economics and pricing  
cost savings from fare simplification would be significant across the industry. American an-  
nounced its intentions well ahead of time and did everything it could to signal to the other  
airlines that its new fare structure was about simplification, not starting a new fare war,  
and that simplification would be good for the entire industry. And the initial response was  
promising. Within a week, most major carriers, including United, Delta, Continental, and  
Northwest, adopted the value pricing fare structure, either in part or in whole. Initially, it  
looked like American had been able to lead the airlines successfully to a new, simpler struc-  
ture without touching off a fare war.  
Unfortunately, the hope was premature. TWA began a fare war in the second week  
of April. Initially, American stood by its new pricing scheme. However, in late May,  
Northwest issued a more serious challenge. It announced a special fare promotion called  
“Grown-Ups Fly Free” that offered free tickets to an adult when accompanied by a paying  
passenger between 2 and 17. The other airlines, including American, matched the promo-  
tions with 50% discounts of their own. These discounts were certainly effective in stimu-  
lating demand, and aircraft were flying with record loads — in many markets load factors  
approached 100%. However, the demand stimulated by the discounts did not outweigh  
the cannibalization, and many of the airlines suffered record losses along with their record  
load factors.  
Increasingly, it became clear that value pricing was doomed. With an increasing vari-  
ety of discounts and promotions being offered, things were reverting to the bad old days.  
American’s rivals were setting up fare structures that bracketed American’s three coach fares  
and then using their revenue management systems to feast on American, just as American  
had used its system to feast on PeopleExpress. By October 1992, it was evident that value  
pricing was finished. In an interview with the BBC, Crandall said that value pricing was  
“dying a slow death” and that the plan had “clearly failed” \(Silk and Michael 1993, 7\). By  
November, American had jettisoned value pricing completely and was back to setting and  
manipulating thousands of fares throughout its system.  
Value pricing is often presented as a failed attempt at price leadership —which it was.  
Competitors found that by offering more complex fare structures, they could outcompete  
American in key markets, and the lure of doing so proved irresistible. Ultimately, complex  
fare structures backed up by sophisticated revenue management beat out the simplicity of  
value pricing.  
But there is another lesson from the value pricing failure\: Customers may prefer simple  
pricing to complex pricing, but they are not willing to pay for it. Customers praised the  
simplicity of value pricing, but when the time came to purchase a ticket, they bought from  
the airline that was offering the cheapest seat — not from the one offering the simplest fare  
structure. The customers who flocked to take advantage of “Grown-Ups Fly Free” tickets  
from Northwest did not care that they were destroying value pricing — they were simply  
looking for a bargain. This indicates that the success of everyday low pricing is primarily due  
to the fact that it is low, not to the fact that it is every day.  
The most successful pricing and revenue optimization tends to be the most invisible.  
Systems that simply do a better job of setting prices within the context of an existing and ac-  
cepted tactical pricing structure have the highest chance of success and acceptance. None- behavioral economics and pricing 403  
theless, capturing the full benefits of pricing and revenue optimization may require new  
pricing practices. You can increase the chance of success by paying close attention to issues  
of price presentation and fairness in implementation. However, you should also expect  
that virtually any pricing innovation will be met with skepticism \(at best\). Part of the art  
of pricing and revenue optimization is knowing when to change in response to consumer  
resistance and when to persevere.  
14.5 SUMMARY  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Customers do not always respond to prices in a way that is consistent with economic  
theory. Instead they are influenced by a variety of considerations, including the way  
the price is framed and the prices offered to others. When this occurs, it is said that  
customers behave irrationally. The study of the ways in which customers deviate  
from the predictions of economic rationality is called behavioral economics.  
In general, lower prices lead to higher demand and vice versa; this is the law of  
demand. However, there are three situations in which demand may actually increase  
with price\:  
•  
With Giffen goods, an inferior good whose price is rising is substituted for a supe-  
rior good.  
•  
Price is considered a signal of quality by consumers in some cases.  
•  
In conspicuous consumption, the price of a purchase signals to others the presumed  
wealth of the buyer.  
Customers are sensitive to the way that prices are presented — a price that is pre-  
sented as a discount will typically attract more demand than the same price pre-  
sented as list price. In addition, customers tend to be very averse to any price that is  
presented as a surcharge or a penalty. For this reason, sales promotions and dis-  
counts are common, while surcharges are rare. This phenomenon has been explained  
by prospect theory, which specifies that people are more averse to perceived losses  
than they are attracted to gains. A discount is perceived as a gain relative to a baseline  
price, which may be a reference price or a published list or “was” price, while a sur-  
charge is perceived as a loss.  
Consumers believe it is fair that a company makes a reasonable profit and that they  
are offered a reasonable price — this is the principle of dual entitlement. Consumers  
are likely to reactive negatively if they believe that a company is violating this princi-  
ple. This is an explanation for the fact that most consumers find price raises due to  
cost increases more acceptable than those due to scarcity.  
Consumers are also concerned with interpersonal fairness. In particular, they are  
likely to get upset if they learn that another customer paid \(or was offered\) a lower  
price for the same item at the same time. This makes many forms of group price  
differentiation controversial. Indeed, some forms of group price differentiation are  
illegal, depending on the jurisdiction. As a result, although individualized pricing on 404  
behavioral economics and pricing

•  
the internet may be tempting, it raises the very real likelihood of strong consumer  
pushback.  
Consumers also tend to be conservative when it comes to pricing approaches. They  
are likely to believe that any change in pricing structure is an excuse for raising prices  
and violates the principle of dual entitlement.  
Pricing changes are more likely to be accepted if they are\:  
•  
Product based rather than customer based  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Open rather than hidden  
Posed as a discount or reward rather than a surcharge or a penalty  
Easy to understand rather than hard to understand  
Available to all customers rather than restricted  
•  
•  
Cost based rather than profit based  
Familiar rather than unfamiliar  
Consumers’ conservatism means that they are likely to object to any change in the  
way that goods are priced. But this does not mean all pricing innovation should be  
stifled. For example, customers objected to First Chicago’s introduction of teller  
fees; however, it turned out to be reasonably successful. On the other hand, while  
consumers complained about the complexity and volatility of airline fares, American  
Airlines was unsuccessful in introducing a simplified fare structure because, at the  
end of the day, consumers preferred low fares to simple fares.

Behavioral economics has roots in the 1950s with the concept of bounded rationality devel-  
oped by Herbert Simon. During the 1960s and 1970s, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky  
published a series of papers that essentially established behavioral economics as a field. An

laboration between the very different personalities of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky

1\. 2. Giffen good. A penurious graduate student has a food budget of \$100.00/week. To  
survive with sufficient energy to attend classes, he knows that he needs to consume  
50 protein units per week. The only two foods he can stand to eat on a regular basis  
are beans and hamburger. He derives twice as much pleasure per protein unit from  
eating hamburger as he does from beans.  
a. Assume that hamburger costs \$3.00 per protein unit and beans cost \$1.00 per  
protein unit. Formulate the student’s diet problem as a linear program. \(You  
can assume he wants to maximize his total utility from his diet and that he gets  
1 utile from each protein unit of beans he consumes and 2 utiles from each  
protein unit of hamburger.\) What is the optimal consumption of beans and  
hamburger in this case?  
b. Plot the student’s price-response function for beans as the price of beans goes  
from \$0.01 to \$2.00 per protein unit, assuming that everything else \(including  
the price of hamburger\) stays constant. Note that his individual price-response  
function is indeed upward sloping. Why? What happens when the price of beans  
exceeds \$2.00 per unit?  
c. The student receives a scholarship that enables him to spend \$300 a week on  
food. What is his price-response function for beans now?  
A particular market was served by two products offered by Acme and a competitor.  
The prices and quality ratings of the two products are as follows\:  
Price Quality rating  
Acme brand \$2.00 50  
Competitor brand \$2.50 70  
The two brands each have a 50% share of the market. Now Acme introduces a new  
product with a price of \$2.20 and a quality rating of 30. What would you expect to  
happen in the market?12  
a. b. c. The new product will grab a dominant share of the market.  
The new product will split the market with the existing products into thirds.  
The new product will not gain much market share, but Acme will increase mar-  
ket share at the expense of the competitor.  
d. The new product will not gain much market share, but the competitor will gain  
market share at the expense of Acme.  
e. The new product will not gain much market share, and the relative shares of  
Acme and the competitor will be unchanged.notes

appendix  
# A  
Optimization refers to the process of finding the maximum or minimum of a function in  
some defined region, which could be either finite or infinite in extent. Here we look only at  
finding the maximum of a function, since that is the most relevant for pricing and revenue  
optimization.  
A.1 CONTINUOUS OPTIMIZATION  
In continuous optimization, we want to maximize a continuous, differentiable function  
f \(x\) over a certain region — say, x ≥ 0. Here, x may be either a single number — a ­ scalar—  
or a vector x = \(x1, x2, . . . , x  
n\). In either case, we seek the value of x, for which f \(x\) is  
maximized. This general problem can be complex and subtle. In particular, a function  
may have many different local maxima within the region. If so, the problem of finding  
the global maximum among all the local maxima may be very difficult and may require  
the use of such approaches as genetic algorithms. Fortunately, the problems treated in  
this book typically have unimodal objective functions; that is, any local maximum will  
also be a global maximum. The problems we consider also generally have convex feasible  
regions. The combination of a unimodal objective function with a convex feasible region  
means that hill-climbing approaches typically work well. Starting at any point, we find an  
improving direction and move in that direction to a point with a higher objective func-  
tion value. From that point we find a new improving direction and repeat the process  
until we get to a point where no further improvement is possible. This point is the global  
maximizer.  
There are three possibilities.  
1\. The function may have no maximum. For example, Chapter 5 shows that a supplier  
facing a constant-elasticity price-response function with elasticity greater than 1 can  
always increase revenue by increasing his price. In this case, there is no finite price  
that maximizes revenue. 408  
appendix a  
2\. 3. The function may attain its maximum value within the interior of the region.  
The function may attain its maximum value on the boundary of the region  
Given the restrictions we have put on the underlying function and the feasible region,  
an intelligent hill-climbing approach will find the optimal solution in the second and third  
cases. The first case will never occur in a well-posed problem — if we find that our pricing  
optimization problem has no finite solution, it generally means that the problem has been  
incorrectly specified or that one or more important constraints have been inadvertently  
excluded.  
For an interior point x\* to be a maximizer of a function f, it must be the case that all of  
the derivatives are equal to zero at x\*— that is, ∂ f \(x\*\) /∂ xi \* = 0 for all i. \(If x is a scalar, this  
is equivalent to the requirement that f '\(x\*\) = 0.\) If ∂ f \(x\) /∂ xi \> 0 for some i, then f \(x\) could  
be increased by increasing xi \* by a small amount. If ∂ f \(x\) /∂ xi \< 0 for some i, then f \(x\) could  
be increased by decreasing xi \* by a small amount. In either case, x\* is not a maximizer.  
Thus, ∂ f \(x\*\) /∂ xi \* = 0 for all i is a necessary condition for x to be an interior maximizer  
of f. It is not, however, a sufficient condition. There are two other possibilities\: x\* could be a  
minimizer of f \(x\). Or, more rarely, x\* could be an inflection point of f \(x\). In the case when x  
is a scalar, the most common test to ensure that x\* is a maximizer of f \(x\) is that the second  
derivative f″\(x\) \< 0. If this condition is satisfied, then x\* will be a local maximizer of f \(x\).  
And if f \(x\) is unimodal, x\* must be a global maximizer as well.  
Calculating the second derivative can be difficult. However, note that an x\* that satisfies  
the first-order conditions will also be a maximizer of f \(x\) if perturbing any of its elements  
either up or down leads to a smaller value of f \(x\).  
Example A.1  
Assume that we want to maximize the function f \(x\) = –x2 + 2x + 6. The first  
derivative of f \(x\) is f '\(x\) = 2 – 2x, which is equal to 0 only for x\* = 1 with  
f \(x\*\) = 7. The question is whether x\* = 1 is a maximizer or a minimizer of f \(x\)  
\(or possibly an inflection point\). We note that f"\(x\) = –2 \< 0 for all x, which  
indicates that x\*is a maximizer. Alternatively, we note that f \(.9\) = 6.99 \< f \(x\*\)  
and f \(1.1\) = 6.99 \< f \(x\*\), which is another way of showing that x\* = 1 is a  
maximizer.  
This is a cursory treatment of a deep topic. It does not deal with the many exceptions,  
caveats, and subtleties to continuous optimization. However, for the purpose of basic pric-  
ing and revenue optimization, we usually do not need to deal with these subtleties; a sim-  
ple approach will usually suffice. Most pricing and revenue optimization problems have  
a simple structure\: Increasing a decision variable \(price or capacity allotment\) initially  
improves profit, but, at some point, further increases lead to lower profit. The maximum  
occurs at the point just before profit begins to degrade. With this structure, we can use  
simple approaches and not worry about some of the more subtle issues. This does not  
mean that these subtleties can always be ignored in practice. For example, in optimizing  
list prices, some products can be complements \(like hot dogs and hot-dog buns\), while  
others are substitutes \(like Coke and Pepsi\). In this situation, the problem of finding the appendix a 409  
price that maximizes total expected contribution can have many local maxima, and a point  
that satisfies all of the first- and second-order conditions may not be the global maximum.  
This means that genetic algorithms or related approaches may be needed to find the global  
maximum.  
A.2 LINEAR PROGRAMMING  
Linear programming is a well-established approach to optimization in the case where a  
linear objective function is being maximized subject to linear constraints. The simplex al-  
gorithm for solving such problems was initially developed by George Dantzig in the 1960s  
and has been extended and refined many times since. The simplex algorithm, like all other  
commercially used algorithms for solving linear programs, is a hill-climbing approach, in  
the sense that it moves from point to point within the feasible region, increasing the objec-  
tive function at every move, until no further improving direction within the feasible region  
can be found.  
The standard form of a linear programming problem is  
n  
max  
# ∑

for  
x i n  
i , , . . . , .  
The objective function coefficients ci and the constraint coefficients aij can each be either posi-  
tive, negative, or zero. The constraints have been specified as “less than or equal to,” but  
“greater than or equal to” constraints can also be incorporated by simply multiplying both  
sides by − 1. Equality constraints can be incorporated by including simultaneous “less than  
or equal to” and “greater than or equal to” constraints. The standard form has specified that  
each xi is zero or greater, but it is also possible to constrain any or all of them to be zero or  
less or to take either positive or negative values. Thus, the standard form is quite flexible in  
representing any linear objective function subject to any set of linear constraints.  
The standard form can also be written as  
max  
c x T  
\(A.1\)

Ax ≤ b,  
x ≥ 0,  
where c = \(c1, c2, . . . , c

n\), b = \(b1, b2, . . . , b  
m\), and the matrix A consists  
of the elements aij. 410  
appendix a  
An optimization problem that can be specified in this form can be solved efficiently by a  
number of commercial software packages such as CPLEX. Microsoft Excel includes a linear  
programming capability within its SOLVER function.  
A.3 DUALITY AND COMPLEMENTARY SLACKNESS  
Every linear program of the form of Equation A.1 has an associated dual linear program-  
ming problem of the form  
max  
λ λ  
bT  
λ λ  
, \(A.2\)  
subject to  
AT**λ** ≥ c,  
**λ** ≥ 0,  
where **λ** = \(λ 1, λ 2, . . . , λ  
m\) is a vector of dual variables, one corresponding to each of the  
constraints in the original formulation in Equation A.1. The importance of the dual arises  
partly from the complementary slackness principle\:  
The incremental change in the objective function from an incremental change in constraint j  
in Formula A.1 will be \(approximately\) λ j. If constraint j in Equation A.1 is not binding, then  
λ j = 0 and relaxing the constraint will not change the value of the objective function. If λ j \> 0,  
then constraint j in Equation A.1 is binding.  
In particular, if a constraint in a linear program is associated with a capacity or inventory  
limitation, the complementary slackness principle means that the corresponding dual vari-  
able will be the opportunity cost associated with that constraint.  
A.4 DISCRETE OPTIMIZATION  
Discrete optimization is in theory more applicable to pricing and revenue optimization  
than is continuous optimization, since most of the entities of interest \(demand, bookings,  
no-shows, prices, etc.\) are discrete rather than continuous. Unfortunately, discrete optimi-  
zation is more computationally difficult, in general, than continuous optimization. In con-  
tinuous optimization we are navigating a smooth surface, looking for the highest point. If  
the continuous function is differentiable \(as we have assumed\), either we are at a maximum  
or the local derivatives give us a clear direction to move. In contrast, discrete optimization  
is like hopping from island to island in an archipelago, looking for the island with the high-  
est peak. When we are on a particular island, there may be no indicator to tell us which  
island to jump to next.  
As a result, integer linear programming—finding the vector of integers x that solves Equa-  
tion A.1— is much more difficult than standard linear programming, in which the answers  
do not need to be integers. In principle, the optimal integer solution to a linear program  
could be far from the optimal continuous solution found by standard linear programming appendix a 411  
software. Since we are usually interested in integer solutions, this would seem to present  
a problem. Fortunately for most pricing and revenue optimization problems addressed in  
this book, rounding the continuous solution to a linear program to the nearest feasible  
integer solution usually turns out to give a good answer.  
A particular case of interest in revenue management is the situation in which we need  
to find the integer i ≥ 0 that maximizes R\(i\), where R\(i\) is known to be unimodal. This  
is the problem faced, for example, in setting a total booking limit for a flight or setting  
capacity limits with two booking classes. In this case, we can use the principle of margin-  
ality, which states that the value i\* that maximizes R\(i\) is the smallest value of i such that  
R\(i + 1\) ≤ R\(i\). This means that we can start at i = 0, calculate R\(i\) and R\(i + 1\), and stop  
whenever R\(i + 1\) ≤ R\(i\). As long as we know in advance that R\(i\) is unimodal, this ap-  
proach will always terminate at the optimal value of i.  
A.5 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING AND BANDIT APPROACHES  
The methods that we have considered so far are based on maximizing \(or minimizing\)  
some function subject to a set of constraints. Note that optimization requires a stylized  
model that is always an imperfect representation of the real world. Optimization is a math-  
ematical operation on this model that produces values of decision variables — in our case,  
primarily prices or booking limits — that can then be applied in the real world. For applica-  
tions such as pricing and revenue optimization, this is often called a forecast then optimize  
approach —we build a mathematical model that forecasts what we believe would happen  
for different decisions we could make \(often with a probability distribution\) and then use  
an optimization model to calculate the values of the decision variables that maximize our  
objective function. This approach has two drawbacks\: \(1\) it requires computational effort  
to estimate the parameters of the model and the forecast, such as the parameters of the  
price-response functions estimated in Chapter 4, and \(2\) the quality of the decisions is  
dependent on the quality of the assumptions underlying our model. If, for example, we as-  
sume demands by booking class are independent when, in fact, they are highly dependent,  
then our booking limits may be systematically biased.  
The idea behind reinforcement learning is “learning by doing”— to systematically try  
different alternatives and do more of what works well and less of what does not work well.  
Reinforcement learning \(RL\) approaches were developed in part in emulation of the way  
that animals learn to negotiate their environment and meet such goals as obtaining food  
or shelter. RL approaches have posted some highly publicized successes — for example, the  
triumph of Google’s DeepMind AlphaGo over the world champion human Go player in  
2018\. Since about 2010, RL has become commonly applied to a wide variety of business  
decisions including pricing.  
The basic idea behind reinforcement learning is shown in Figure A.1. At any time, an  
agent has a set of actions available to it and is in the current state. The agent chooses an  
action. On the basis of the current state and the action chosen, the environment will re-  
spond with a reward and a new state. Both the reward and the new state are likely to be 412

­ probabilistic, which is why the environment is represented as a cloud. The agent seeks to  
maximize the \(possibly discounted\) sum of the expected rewards that it will receive over  
time.  
these\:  
The structure in Figure A.1 is quite general. It could apply to such varied situations as  
•  
•  
•  
A driver is trying to get from an origin to a destination. His state is his location; his  
available actions are the choices he could make at any time, such as turn right, turn  
left, or go straight; and his reward is the inverse of the time it takes him to get from  
the origin to the destination.  
A poker player is playing a hand of poker. The player’s state is the cards she holds and  
the past actions of other players —how much they have bet in what order and which  
ones have folded. Her possible actions are all her possible bets, as well as “fold” or  
“stay,” and her reward is the payoff at the end of the hand.  
A chess player contemplates her next move. Her state is the position of the pieces on  
the board, her potential actions are her available moves, and the reward is either a  
win, a loss, or a draw at the end of the game.  
As the examples might suggest, the problems attacked by reinforcement learning can be  
quite complex. In the examples above, the rewards do not occur primarily in response to  
each action but at the end when the driver reaches his destination or the chess player either  
wins, loses, or draws. Such applications can require deep and sophisticated approaches such  
as neural nets as well as lots of training to become effective.  
Fortunately, the problems associated with pricing are much simpler — at least from a  
reinforcement learning point of view. The action available at each time is the price, and  
the reward is the immediate contribution — profit — received. There is no long-term goal  
such as winning a chess match or driving to a destination that requires thinking many  
steps ahead. And, at least as we consider it in Chapter 5, the pricing problem is stateless.  
This would not be the case if we were applying reinforcement learning to capacity control  
\(Chapter 9\), overbooking \(Chapter 11\), or markdown management \(Chapter 12\). In the  
case of these issues, the decision maker needs to keep track of the remaining unsold inven-  
tory, which would be a state variable. appendix a 413  
Because of its relative simplicity, many pricing problems can be formulated as a k-armed  
bandit problem, which is one of the simplest forms of reinforcement learning. The name  
k-armed bandit arises from the metaphor of a gambler in a casino who has the option of  
playing one of k different slot machines \(or one machine with k arms\). The slot machines  
have different payoff probabilities. For simplicity, assume that they are \$1 slot machines  
and that, if you lose, you lose your dollar, but if you win, you get your original dollar back  
plus an additional \$1. The problem is that you do not know the payoff probabilities for  
the different machines but you want to maximize your expected winnings over some large  
number of plays. What should you do?  
Let us start with the case of two machines —Machine 1 and Machine 2 — and the fol-  
lowing assumptions\:  
1\. 2. 3. The probability of winning on either machine is independent of the probability of  
winning on the other.  
The probabilities of winning on either machine do not change over time.  
We have no prior information on the payoff probability of either machine.  
For concreteness, let us assume that we bet \$1 each time and the payoff is \$2 if we win  
and \$0 if we lose. Let us consider the case where Machine 1 has a payoff probability of .7  
and Machine 2 has a payoff probability of .3.  
The most naïve strategy that we could play is to choose one of the machines at random  
and play it until we are tired of playing or run out of money —whichever comes first. Al-  
ternatively, we could alternate between the machines or flip a coin to determine which of  
the two machines to play on each turn. Under either strategy, the expected payoff per play  
is the same\: On each play, there is a 50% chance that we are playing the .7 payoff machine  
with expected payoff .7  \$1.00 – .3  \$1.00 = \$0.40, and there is a 50% chance that we are  
playing the .3 payoff machine with expected pay off .3  \$1.00 – .7  \$1.00 = –\$0.40. Our  
expected payoff per turn for any of these naïve strategies is thus .5  \$0.40 – .5  \$0.40 = 0.  
A more sophisticated strategy is to pick one of the two machines at random and play it.  
If we win, we play it again; if we lose, we move to the other machine. If we use this strategy,  
we will end up playing Machine 1 about 70% of the time and Machine 2 about 30% of the  
time on the average. Thus, using this strategy, our expected return is about .7  \$0.40 – .3  
 \$0.40 = \$0.16, which is not bad and far better than anything you will ever encounter in  
Las Vegas.  
However, the “play again if we win, otherwise switch” strategy has an obvious draw-  
back— it has no memory, so it cannot learn. Therefore, it can never realize that one machine  
is paying out more often on average than the other. The idea behind a bandit algorithm is  
to learn from experience. One particular approach — called an epsilon-greedy algorithm —is  
to do the following\:  
1\. 2. Set a small value of epsilon . For this example, we will choose  = .1.  
We have just completed our Nth play. For each machine, we record the number of  
times that we have played that machine, with n1N being the number of times that we  
have played Machine 1 and n2N the number of times that we have played Machine 414  
appendix a  
3\. 4. 5. 2. Note that n1N + n2N = N. Also, we have recorded the number of wins that we have  
enjoyed so far on each machine, w1N, w1N.  
Before play N + 1, calculate the win rates r1N = w1N /n1N and r2n  
= w2N /n2N.  
On play N + 1,  
a. If r1n  
\> r2n, play Machine 1 with probability 1 –  and Machine 2 with probability .  
b. If r2n  
\> r1n, play Machine 2 with probability 1 –  and Machine 1 with probability .  
c. If r1n  
= r2n, play either machine with 50% probability.  
For the machine that you played, i, update niN + 1= niN + 1\. If you won, set wiN + 1= wiN  
+ 1; if you lost, then wiN + 1= wiN . For the machine not played — call it machine j —  
set njN + 1 = njN and wjN + 1 = wjN . Increment N ← N + 1 and go to step 2.  
We continue until we run out of money or get tired of playing.  
How well does the -greedy multi-armed bandit algorithm perform? Over time, it will  
converge to the case in which Machine 1 is chosen 90% of the time. In this case, the aver-  
age payoff will be .9  \$0.40 – .1  \$0.40 = \$0.32, double the average payoff from the “play  
again if we win, otherwise switch” approach. In simulating 100 plays, it picks Machine 1  
about 85% of the time, so the average payoff is .85  \$0.40 – .15  \$0.40 = \$0.28. The aver-  
age fraction of the time that Machine 1 is chosen in 100 plays is shown for 50 replications  
in the left-hand graph in Figure A.2. The fraction is .5 on play 2 because each machine is  
chosen once in the first two plays — from there the algorithm learns fairly rapidly to favor  
Machine 1.  
The rapid learning displayed in the left-hand graph of Figure A.2 is partly a reflection  
of the fact that the payoffs from the two machines are so different —70% versus 30%.  
The algorithm learns much more slowly when the difference in payoff is smaller. The  
average learning trajectory in the case when the payoff from Machine 1 is 52% and that  
from Machine 2 is 48% is shown on the right-hand graph in Figure A.2. The learning is  
clearly slower and only an average of about 70% of the plays are on Machine 1 after 100

plays. On the other hand, when the difference between machines is smaller, learning is  
cheaper in the sense that there is less relative cost to spending time on Machine 2 rather  
than Machine 1.  
While there are many refinements and extensions, the algorithm described above incor-  
porates the fundamental features of k-armed bandit algorithms. The probability of picking  
a losing arm is critically important because, without occasional testing, there is a chance  
that the algorithm could pick the wrong arm and stick with it. In the case when the winning  
probabilities are 70% and 30%, there is a 9% chance that the first pull of Machine 1 will  
lose and the first pull of Machine 2 will win. In this case, a purely greedy algorithm \(i.e., one  
with  = 0 \) would continue playing Machine 2 forever. By occasionally testing a seemingly  
inferior alternative, we eliminate this possibility.  
The two-armed bandit in the example can be extended to multiple arms in a straight-  
forward fashion. After trying each of the arms, we choose the arm with the best average  
performance a fraction of 1 –  of the time. We can choose among the other arms based on  
their relative performance —better-performing arms should have a higher probability of  
being chosen, but every arm should have some chance of being chosen.  
The extension of the multi-armed bandit problem to the pricing optimization problem  
should be clear. For pricing, we have a discrete set of prices p1 \< p2\< . . . \< pn  
that we want to  
test. In period t, we decide on one of the n prices to charge. Assume that we have decided on  
ˆ  
ˆ  
price pit  
. We observe the realized demand d  
\(pit\) and the corresponding contribution d  
\(pit\)  
\(pit  
– c\). Let Ii\(t\) be an indicator variable such that Ii\(t\) = 1 means that price i was the price  
chosen at time t and Ii\(t\) = 0 means that price i was not the price chosen, so that one and  
only one value of i has Ii\(t\) = 1 for any t. Then, at time T, the average contribution from  
price i is

A multi-armed bandit approach to pricing uses the values of π  
−  
i\(T \) to determine which  
price to charge in period T + 1.  
While the multi-armed bandit approach is appealing in its simplicity and its lack of  
underlying assumptions, it has a number of potential drawbacks. First, it requires the  
ability to test frequently throughout the potential space of decisions. In some circum-  
stances, testing may not be feasible or desirable. For example, an airline may not want  
to do extensive testing of high overbooking levels, which may lead to high levels of de-  
nied boardings. Second, the two-armed bandit example assumed that the payoff prob-  
abilities of each machine were constant over time and not influenced by the external  
environment. However, in pricing and revenue optimization, there are multiple external  
variables that might change demand — for example, day of the week, whether it is the  
Christmas holiday season, and known competitive prices. In this case, we are searching  
not just for a price but a policy that maps possible values of external variables to a best  
price. There are many different approaches to generating a policy using reinforcement  
learning —however, they all require significantly more testing than the simple examples  
we have seen. 416

A.6 FURTHER READING  
There is a vast literature on classical optimization, both continuous and discrete. I am par-  
tial to Linear and Nonlinear Programming \(Luenberger and Ye 2008\) as a great single source  
for both continuous and discrete optimization. For those who want to go even deeper, Con-  
vex Optimization \(Boyd and Vandenberghe 2004\) is recommended for continuous optimi-  
zation, and Understanding and Using Linear Programming \(Matousek and Gärtner 2007\) is  
recommended for discrete optimization.  
For reinforcement learning in general and the bandit problem in particular, the best  
starting point is the excellent Reinforcement Learning\: An Introduction \(Sutton and Barto  
2018\); chapter 2 discusses the multi-armed bandit problem at length.probability  
appendix  
# B  
This appendix provides a brief review of the concepts and formulas from probability theory  
that are used in basic pricing and revenue optimization. A fuller treatment can be found in  
any text on the subject, such as Mood, Graybill, and Boes 1974; Jaynes 2003; or Bertsekas  
and Tsitsiklis 2008.  
We use the notation Pr\{X\} to refer to the probability that event X will occur. X can be  
any event — for example, “Total demand during the week for a product will be greater than  
100” or “No-shows will be exactly equal to 10 and shows will be equal to 95.” However, no  
matter what event X represents, its probability of occurrence will always be between 0 and  
1, so 0 ≤ Pr\{X\} ≤ 1. The probability that event X does not occur is 1 – Pr\{X\}.  
If X takes on numeric values — such as the number of heads when a fair coin is flipped  
100 times or the number of sweaters that will be sold in a month — then X is termed a ran-  
dom variable. By convention, random variables are denoted with capital letters.  
For any two events, X and Y, we use Pr\{X, Y\} \(or sometimes Pr\{XY\}\) to refer to the prob-  
ability that both X and Y occur. Thus, Pr\{Shows are greater than 80, Demand is equal to  
100\} means “The probability that shows are greater than 80 and demand is equal to 100.”  
This should be contrasted with the notation Pr\{X|Y\}, which denotes the conditional prob-  
ability of event X given that event Y occurs. Thus, Pr\{Shows are greater than 80|Demand is  
equal to 100\} means “the probability that shows are greater than 80 given that demand is  
equal to 100.” The two concepts are linked by the formula  
Pr\{X |Y\} = Pr\{XY\}/Pr\{Y\}  
for Pr\{Y\} \> 0. Note that since Pr\{Y\} ≤ 1, Pr\{X |Y\} ≥ Pr\{XY\}.  
Two events X and Y are called independent if Pr\{X |Y\} = Pr\{X\}. Intuitively, independence  
refers to the case in which the probability that event X will occur is unaffected by the value  
of Y. For example, if we say that weekly sales of product A are independent of product B, it  
means that our probability that sales of product B would exceed 10 units in that week would  
not change if we learned that sales of product A were 0, 10, or 100 units. Independence is  
always mutual; X independent of Y means that Y is independent of X, and vice versa. If X

B.1 PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS  
A probability distribution is an assignment of probabilities to a set of events that are “mu-  
tually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.” Mutually exclusive means that, at most, one  
of the events will occur. Collectively exhaustive means that one of the events must occur.  
Together they guarantee that the sum of the probabilities of all events \(or the integral of the  
probabilities if the events are continuous numbers\) equals 1.  
For a discrete distribution, f \(i\) is the probability that event i will occur. In this book,  
we consider only discrete distributions defined on the nonnegative integers — that is, on  
i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , ∞  
.  
1 By the mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive property, we must have  
∞  
# ∑  
f  
\( \) i =1.  
i  
=  
0  
The function f \(i\) is known as a probability density function. Given a discrete probability  
density function, we define the cumulative distribution function by  
i  
F i f  
\( \) = . \( \) j  
# ∑  
j  
=  
0  
If f is the probability density function on demand in a particular week, then F\(i\) is the prob-  
ability that demand will be less than or equal to i. Note that F\(i\) is increasing in i, f \(0\) =  
F\(0\), and lim i F i  
\( \) =  
→∞ 1 .  
Although discrete distributions are by far the most relevant for pricing and revenue  
optimization, we will use continuous distributions in some cases. For a continuous distri-  
bution, the cumulative distribution function F\(X\) denotes the probability that the random  
variable x will take a value less than or equal to X. We assume that F\(X\) is continuous and  
differentiable, in which case the corresponding probability density function can be com-  
puted as f \(x\) = dF\(x\) /dx. Then  
F x f y  
\( \) = \( \) . dy  
# ∫  
x  
– ∞  
For a continuous distribution, the probability that a random variable will be between a  
and b, with a \< b, is F\(b\) – F\(a\). The cumulative distribution function F\(x\) is increasing in  
x and lim x F x  
\( \) =  
→∞ 1 .  
For both continuous and discrete distributions, we define the complementary cumulative  
¯  
¯  
distribution function \(CCDF\) as F  
\(x\) = 1 – F\(x\). The CCDF F  
\(x\) is the probability that a  
random variable X with cumulative distribution function F\(x\) will be greater than x. It is a  
nonincreasing function of x.  
B.1.1 Expectation  
Let the random variable X be distributed according to f. Then, the expectation or mean of  
X is defined by  
∞  
µ = \[ \]= E X i f i  
# ∑  
×  
\( \)  
i  
=  
0 appendix b 419  
when f \(·\) is a discrete distribution and by  
µ = \[ \]= E X xf x dx  
# ∫  
∞  
\( \)  
– ∞  
when f \(·\) is continuous. The notation E \[·\] denotes the expectation operator, meaning  
that it is the probability-weighted sum \(for a discrete variable\) or integral \(for a con-  
tinuous variable\) of the function inside the brackets. The mean of the variable itself is  
denoted by .  
The mean of a distribution should not be confused with the mode of the distribution,  
which is the most likely observation given a single sample. Nor should it be confused with  
the median of the distribution, which is the value such that the probability that a single  
observation will exceed that value is the same as the probability that it will be less than the  
value.  
An alternative formula for calculating the mean of a discrete distribution defined over  
the nonnegative numbers i = 0, 1, . . . , ∞ is  
∞  
∞  
µ = \[ \( \)\]= \( \)  
– . F i F i

# ∑  
∑ \(B.1\)

0  
A similar result holds for a conditional probability distribution for a random variable X  
defined for X ≥ 0 — namely,  
µ = \( \)  
# ∫  
∞  
F x dx .  
0  
The concept of expectation can be extended to any function. Thus, if g \(i\) is a function  
of i, the expectation of g\(i\) is defined as  
∞  
E i g i f i  
\[ \( \]= \( \) \( \),  
g \)  
# ∑  
i  
=  
0  
for a discrete variable and  
\[ \( \]= \( \) \( \) g dx  
E x g x f x  
# ∫  
∞  
\) 0  
for a continuous variable. Note that, in general, E\[g\(i\)\] ≠ g\[E\[i\]\], with equality holding only  
if the function g is linear.  
For any random variable X and any number a, E\[aX\] = aE\[X\]. Furthermore, for random  
n  
variables, X1, X2, . . . , X

1 1  
i  
This property does not apply to general functions of random variables — for example,  
E\[X/Y\] ≠ E\[X\]/E\[Y\] in general.  
For purposes of pricing and revenue optimization, the expectation of the minimum of a  
random variable and a fixed capacity is often important. In other words, we want to calcu-  
late E\[min\(i, C\)\], where C is a fixed capacity and i follows some discrete distribution f \(i\) on  
the nonnegative integers. The following formula is often useful in this case\: 420

\[min\( \)\]= \( \), .  
# ∑

\(B.2\)  
We are also often interested in E\[\(i – C\)+\] ≡ E\[max\(i – C, 0\)\]. If f \(i\) is a probability density  
function of total demand and C is capacity, then E\[\(i – C\)+\] is the expected number of cus-  
tomers in excess of capacity — that is, the expected number of customers turned away. Since  
the expected number of customers served plus the expected number turned away must  
equal expected demand, we can combine Equations B.1 and B.2 to derive  
E\[\(i – C\)+\] = E\[i\] – E\[min\(i, C\)\]

B.1.2 Variance and Standard Deviation  
Two other important properties of probability distributions are the variance and the stand-  
ard deviation, both of which measure the spread of the distribution. The variance of a dis-  
tribution is the expected square of the distance between a sample from the distribution and  
the mean. That is,  
X E X E X E X E X – . \( \)         \( \)2 2 2  
var\[ \]= \[ \] = – \[ \]  
The variance of a distribution is always greater than or equal to 0; the higher the variance,  
the broader the spread of the distribution. For independent random variables, the variance  
of the sum is equal to the sum of the variances; that is,  
n

. \(B.4\)  
i  
The standard deviation, denoted by σ, is equal to the positive square root of the variance\:  
σ = var X \[ \]. Like the variance, σ ≥ 0 for any distribution. Let σ\[Xi\] be the standard de-  
viation associated with random variable Xi  
. Then, from Equation B.4, we can derive the  
formula for the standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables\:

Note that Equations B.4 and B.5 hold only when X1, X2, . . . , X  
n are independent.  
The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of a distribution is sometimes called the  
coefficient of variation, or CV, where CV = σ/.  
B.2 CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS  
B.2.1 The Uniform Distribution  
The uniform distribution is “the distribution of maximum ignorance.” It is used when we  
know nothing about the distribution of X except that it lies between bounds a \< b, but we appendix b 421  
have no reason to believe that it is more likely to lie at any one point within that interval  
than another. The uniform distribution has a probability density function,

  
The mean of the uniform distribution is  = \(a + b\) /2, and its standard deviation is  
σ = \(b – a\) / 12 .  
B.2.2 The Exponential Distribution  
The exponential distribution has a single parameter, λ \> 0, and a probability density func-  
tion,  
\( \) = λ λ  
e–  
f xx  
for x ≥ 0. The mean of the exponential distribution is  = 1/λ , and the standard deviation  
is the same as the mean\: σ = 1/λ.  
B.2.3 The Normal Distribution  
The normal \(or Gaussian\) distribution is the famous bell-shaped curve, the most widely  
used distribution in statistics and mathematical modeling. There are two reasons for its  
popularity. The first is that theory has shown that the normal distribution is, in many situa-  
tions, a reasonable distribution to use when the actual underlying distribution is unknown  
or when the underlying distribution is the result of many different random influences. The  
second reason is that many practical techniques have been developed for making calcula-  
tions with the normal distribution. Such techniques are easily accessible in most software  
and spreadsheet packages, such as Excel.  
The probability density function for the normal distribution is

mulative distribution function of the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard devia-  
tion 1 is denoted by Φ\(x\). Both ϕ \(x\) and Φ\(x\) are included in all statistical and spreadsheet  
packages. This is useful because they can be used to calculate f \(x\) and F\(x\) for any normal  
distribution, by means of the following transformations\:

where f\(x\) is the normal density function with mean µ and standard deviation σ, and F\(x\)  
is the corresponding cumulative distribution function.  
Example B.1  
Monthly demand for a product has been observed to follow a normal dis-  
tribution with mean of 10,000 and standard deviation of 8,000. The prob-  
ability that demand will be less than 12,000 units is then given by Pr\{Demand  
less than 12,000 units in a month\} = Φ\[\(12,000 – 10,000\) /8,000\] = Φ\(0.25\)  
= 0.60.  
The normal distribution is widely used. However, a few words of caution are in or-  
der. First, the normal distribution is continuous, so care needs to be used in applying it  
to situations where outcomes are discrete. These issues are addressed in Section B.3.4 on  
the discrete normal distribution. Second, bear in mind that the normal distribution puts  
positive probabilities on all outcomes from –∞ to ∞. This can become a problem in situa-  
tions where outcomes less than zero are not physically meaningful \(e.g., demand, sales, no-  
shows, prices\). Third, caution is particularly important when using the normal distribution  
in a situation where the standard deviation is large relative to the mean. For example, when  
the mean is equal to the standard deviation \(e.g., the coefficient of variation is 1\), the nor-  
mal distribution places about a 16% probability on the outcome’s being less than zero. In  
cases where the coefficient of variation is high, it may be necessary to use another distribu-  
tion to obtain reasonable results.  
B.3 DISCRETE DISTRIBUTIONS

The Bernoulli distribution is the simplest interesting discrete distribution. It is defined as

otherwise.  
The Bernoulli distribution applies to the situation in which a particular event has a  
probability p of occurring and, thus, a probability 1 – p of not occurring. In this case, the  
outcome of the event’s occurring can be arbitrarily labeled 1 and the outcome where the  
event does not occur can be labeled 0. The probability 1 – p of the event’s not occurring is  
often denoted by q.  
Example B.2  
A fair coin is to be flipped once. Let 0 denote heads and 1 denote tails. Then the  
outcome of the flip follows a Bernoulli distribution with p = 0.5.  
The mean of the Bernoulli distribution is p and its variance is p\(1 – p\) = pq, so its stand-  
ard deviation is σ.

B.3.2 The Discrete Uniform Distribution  
The discrete uniform distribution is appropriate whenever a number of mutually exclusive  
events all have equal probability of occurring. Then, if there are n events, the possibility  
that any one of them will occur is 1/n. We assume that the events are indexed by consecu-  
tive integers i = a, a + 1, a + 2, . . . , b, where a ≥ 0 and b \> a. In this case, we can write the  
uniform probability density function as

The cumulative distribution function for the uniform distribution function F  
\(i\) =  
1 – F\(i\) is linear between a and b. This leads to the connection between the uniform  
­ willingness-to-pay distribution and the linear demand function discussed in Chapter 3.  
The mean of the uniform distribution is  = \(a + b\) /2, and its standard deviation is  
σ = \( – \)\( – 2\)

Example B.3  
A seller believes that if he prices a new shirt at \$79.00, then total demand for  
the shirt will have equal probability of being any amount between 10,000 and  
20,000 units. This corresponds to a uniform distribution with a = 10,000 and b  
= 20,000\. This means the probability that demand will be less than or equal to  
18,000 will be F\(18,000\) = \(18,000 – 10,000 + 1\) /\(20,000 – 10,000 + 1\) = 0.8.  
Mean demand is \(20,000 + 10,000\) /2 = 15,000 shirts, with a standard deviation

B.3.3 The Binomial Distribution  
The binomial distribution arises whenever each of a known number of people makes  
a decision between two mutually exclusive alternatives when each person has the same  
­ probability of choosing the first alternative and the decisions are all made independently  
\(in the probabilistic sense\). If the number of people choosing between the alternatives is n  
and the probability that any individual will choose the first alternative is p, then the total  
number choosing the first alternative will follow a binomial distribution with parameters n  
and p. In addition, the total number choosing alternative 2 will follow a binomial distribu-  
tion with parameters n and q, where q = 1 – p. 424  
appendix b  
Example B.4  
One hundred passengers have booked the same flight. Each passenger has  
probability of 0.8 of showing, and passengers will make independent decisions  
whether or not to show. In this case, the number of shows will follow a bino-  
mial distribution with p = 0.8 and n = 100. Furthermore, no-shows will follow  
a binomial distribution with p = 0.2 and n = 100.  
Example B.5  
Ten thousand shoppers will log on to the website of a car loan provider. The  
supplier believes that if he offers an annual percentage rate of 6.9%, each shop-  
per will have a 0.05 probability of filling out an application for a loan. The  
distribution of applications filled out would then be binomial with p = 0.05  
and n = 10,000.  
The classic example of a binomial distribution is drawing balls from a large urn with  
replacement. If an urn contains a large number of black and white balls such that p is the  
fraction of black balls, and n balls are drawn from the urn with the drawn balls replaced,  
then the number of black balls drawn will be binomial with parameters n and p. Similarly,  
if a fair coin is tossed n times, the number of heads tossed will be binomial with parameters  
n and p = 0.5.

The mean of the binomial distribution is  = pn, the variance is p\(1 – p\)n, and the stand-  
ard deviation is σ.

Example B.6  
A bed-and-breakfast has 8 rooms and has accepted 10 bookings. On average,  
85% of its bookings show, with the rest canceling. Assuming a show rate of  
.85, the expected number of guests who will show up is .85  10 = 8.5, with a  
variance of .85  .15  10 = 1.275 and a standard deviation of 1.13. The prob-

Because of the terms of the form in Equation B.7, the binomial distribution can be very  
difficult to work with in practice. In particular, the term n! grows very large very quickly. appendix b 425  
Using Equation B.7 to calculate the number of shows given 100 bookings would require cal-  
culating 100!, which is a 158-digit number. In addition, there is no closed-form solution for  
the cumulative distribution function F\(i\) for a binomial distribution. Fortunately, for large n,  
the binomial distribution is well approximated by the normal distribution with mean µ = pn  
and standard deviation σ.  
= p\(1 – \) p n  
Example B.7  
An online tour broker believes that 30,000 people will visit his website in  
the next week, with each visitor having a 2% chance of purchasing a tour.  
The number of tours sold would then follow a binomial distribution with  
p  
=  
0.02 and n = 30,000. His probability density function on demand can be  
approximated by a normal distribution with mean 0.02 × 30,000 = 600 and  
= × × =  
σ. . , . .  
0 02 0 98 30 000 24 25 The tour operator wants to know the  
probability that more than 580 customers will seek to purchase a tour. He can  
estimate this as 1 – Φ\[\(580 – 600\) /24.25\] = 1 – Φ\(– 0.8025\) = 0.788. Therefore,  
there is about a 79% chance that demand will be greater than 580.  
B.3.4 The Discrete Normal Distribution  
The normal distribution is a continuous distribution. However, in some cases we want to  
apply it to situations in which outcomes are discrete. For example, we might want to model  
demand for one-night arrivals at a hotel as “normal with mean 200 and standard deviation  
100.” Furthermore, in most of these cases only nonnegative values will be meaningful—  
therefore, we need to restrict the distribution to the nonnegative numbers. We do this by  
defining  
F\(i\) = Φ\[\(i – \) /\] for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,   
and

Defining the normal distribution in this fashion makes it easy to use standard statistical func-  
tions in Excel, for example, for computations. However, a word of caution that this comes  
with a cost\: The discrete normal distribution as defined here will now have a mean that is  
different \(generally higher\) than µ and a standard deviation that is somewhat lower than σ.  
Whether this is important or not depends on the application.  
B.4 SAMPLE STATISTICS  
So far, this appendix has discussed concepts such as the mean, standard deviation, and vari-  
ance in terms of somewhat abstract probability distributions. In practice, we are often inter-  
ested in calculating the best estimates of these statistics from data. Of course, all ­ statistical  
software packages provide built-in functions for generating these estimates; thus, the 426  
appendix b  
­ AVERAGE function in Excel estimates the statistical mean of a set of data, and the standard  
deviation is determined by the STDEV.P function.  
Assume that we have N numerical data observations x1, x2, . . . , xN  
. Then the mean of the  
observations is given by  
=   
N

µ,  
    
N

# ∑

the variance is given by

N  
   
# ∑

xi  
µ  
i

1  
and the standard deviation, by δ = var.  
These statistics are often measures of interest in themselves. For example, it may be of  
interest to know that the mean daily demand for a product over the last month was 140.3,  
with a standard deviation of 61.2. However, the mean and standard deviation can also be  
used as estimates of the properties of an underlying distribution; thus, we might model fu-  
ture demand for the product using a normal distribution with mean 140.3 and a standard  
deviation of 61.2. By the law of large numbers, the sample statistic estimates will approach  
the “true” values for a population as the number of observations N increases.note

gers. However, this book considers only distributions over nonnegative integers. This page intentionally left blank References
