# REFERENCE GUIDES  
This section provides suggestions on the selection and use of various elements  
to consider when planning your event. For further assistance, please contact us.

# Seating  
For any type of party, it is crucial to consider the appropriate amount of space  
needed to accommodate the number of guests you plan to host. A cocktail  
party will certainly have different spacing needs than a formal sit-down dinner.  
Here are some suggestions to help you plan the perfect amount of space  
necessary for your event.  
Cocktail Parties  
Seating Style Square Feet Per Person  
Standing 6  
Partial Seating 8

Classroom Style Guidelines  
Allow 30 inches between tables for seating on one side of the table only. Divide  
the room area in square feet by 10 for maximum seating.

# Dance Floors  
Dance floors can also provide an important focal point at your event. We offer  
modular flooring in several finishes and a wide variety of sizes and  
configurations.  
Dance floors require 12 sq. ft per couple for dancing and generally 40% of guests  
will dance at one time.  
ESTIMATED DANCE FLOOR SIZING\:  
Calculate the total number of couples dancing at one time by multiplying total  
number of guests by 40% than divide by 2 to determine the total number of  
couples and multiply the number of couples by 12sq. ft to determine the size of  
dance floor required. \(example\: 100 guests x 40%= 40 people dancing at one  
time, 40/2 =20 couples dancing, 20 x 12= 240 square feet is required\)

DANCE FLOOR CARE  
To preserve the condition of the dance floor, please be aware of the following  
facts\:  
Ø Any water or moisture exposure will cause severe damage to any dance  
floor.  
Ø Long exposure to direct sunlight can warp dance floors \(especially vinyl  
material\).  
Ø It is best to minimize the amount of time a dance floor is laid on grass to  
avoid any damage to the lawn.  
Ø The area where a dance floor is to go should not be watered for at least  
24 hours before installation. Any watering systems should be completely  
turned off until the dance floor has been removed.  
Ø On grass, a sub-floor \(provided by Handy Special Events\) is required to  
avoid damage from ground moisture.  
Ø If the dance floor is going in a tent and rain is possible, a sub-floor is  
strongly recommended.  
Ø Installing a dance floor on uneven ground is not recommended.

# Handy Hints  
This section contains fun and useful information for planning the details of your  
successful event.  
Ordering Hints  
Ø Always round up your estimates, don't round them down  
Ø Generally you can expect about 75% of invited guests to show up  
Ø When serving a buffet order 25% more dishware and flatware then the  
number of guests for each dish type.  
Ø Order chairs and place settings for the full number of invited guests to  
ensure availability, then pare the number down one month prior to the  
event  
Ø When ordering glassware and napkins for a cocktail or wine bar order 1  
glass or napkin/person for each hour of the event.  
Ø When ordering glassware and napkins for a cocktail party order 3 glasses  
or napkin/person.  
Ø When ordering glassware and napkins for a banquet order 2 glasses or  
napkin/person.  
Ø When ordering dance floor, keep in mind that you need approximately 2  
to 3 feet per person. And always mow your lawn before the installation of  
a tent or dance floor.  
sohandy.com 10HANDY SPECIAL EVENT RENTALS  
Bar and Beverage Hints  
Ø When stocking up on ice you should have 1 lb. of ice/person.  
Ø For a basic bar you'll want to stock up on vodka, whiskey wines and beer.  
Ø When serving punch figure 10 people to the gallon. This will allow for 3 - 4  
oz. servings per guest.  
Ø When serving cocktails or beer figure that your guests will consume 2  
drinks per person per hour in the first 2 hours and 1 drink per hour after  
that.  
Ø When serving wine or champagne for a 2 hour party, you will need to  
have 1 bottle for every 2 guests.  
Ø One pound of coffee yields approximately 60 cups. Be sure to have  
cream and sugar available.
