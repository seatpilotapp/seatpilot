# Foreword to the  
# Second Edition  
We experience the physical world in different ways at different times.  
On a vacation trip to Paris, just wandering through the streets and  
passageways of the Left Bank with no pre‐determined route can be a  
joyful and serendipitous experience. But when first arriving in the city,  
whether at the airport or train station, we basically just want to know how  
to find the Metro or a taxi, and we rely on clearly visible and unambiguous  
signs to direct us.  
When we need to see a doctor in a large metropolitan hospital, we follow  
signs and other visual clues that will hopefully get us through the maze of  
floors, disciplines, and services to the correct destination. But when we  
are a patient in that hospital, we would like the physical environment to be  
as calm and pleasant as possible.  
Environmental graphic design plays a role in both aspects of these places.  
The signs directing us in and out of Charles De Gaulle Airport were  
undoubtedly the work of environmental graphic designers, working along  
with the facilities architects and planners. But in central Paris itself, signs  
of a different kind help define the character and ambience of that place  
we think of as “Paris.” Many of the shop signs, with their beautiful scripts  
and richly ornate letterforms, were the work of generations of skilled  
craftsmen. Professional architects and planners contributed in other ways.  
For example, the architect Hector Guimard’s Paris Metro entrances, with  
their famous Art Nouveau lettering, are used to symbolize Paris in many  
tourist brochures.  
And while environmental graphic designers are often challenged to  
provide clear, functional and attractive wayfinding for hospital labyrinths,  
they also have a role in helping make patient areas visually calm and  
pleasant through the use of carefully selected color and artwork. In  
this sense, environmental graphic design clearly ties into the idea of  
“branding” when the design is helping to establish an environment that  
delivers an image and experience consistent with and appropriate to the  
goals of the institution or place.  
As these examples indicate, environmental graphic designers, generally  
working behind the scenes, can have significant impact on how we  
experience the physical world. Since their work often directly effects Tom Geismar chaired the effort by the American  
Institute of Graphic Arts \(AIGA\) to research and  
design the now‐familiar Symbol Signs system of  
travel‐related pictograms for the United States  
Department of Transportation.  
people’s actions, the designer needs to understand human psychology  
as well as the basics of architecture, industrial design, color theory, and  
graphic design and typography. And today, continual advances in digital  
technology demand yet another complex discipline to understand and  
exploit for more effective signage, wayfinding and placemaking, to help  
people experience the physical world in appropriate and meaningful ways.  
This book, more than any other I’ve seen, clearly and succinctly  
describes the many overlapping aspects of the field, and presents proven  
approaches to a wide variety of real issues that the designer faces.  
Written by long‐time practitioners, it is clearly a labor of love, providing a  
great deal of information about this still‐evolving, multi‐disciplined field of  
design.

# Foreword to the  
# First Edition  
Regarding wayfinding, it might be noted that after you get there, in an  
ideal world, there would be very little that needs to be told about where  
to go, because on arriving at an unfamiliar destination the next directions  
would be self‐evident. Within the best architecture, finding one’s way  
around should hopefully require a relatively minimal effort and, at least,  
little signage.  
If some sign is needed at all, it should be one of confirmation, to make a  
visitor comfortable with the path taken. It is far better to say too little than  
too much. To quote Mies\: “Less is more.”  
Signage either adds some degree of quality to the environment in which  
it finds itself or it takes something away, diminishing the experience by  
being distracting to a visitor. If a message is there and is unnecessary,  
that’s a serious distraction that should be avoided.  
If a message is too big or too visually loud, if it overwhelms and negates  
other things such as the feeling of architectural materials, the play of  
light, reflections, the texture of surfaces, transparency, distant views,  
and a myriad of other environmental elements, including the presence  
and contribution of art or even the presence of other people, then the  
message is not quite right.  
Too small a message or a direction misplaced by being too low or too high  
when its meaning must be instantly grasped and acted upon, doesn’t help  
those who are insecure or hesitant and in need of help.  
The best signage is in the right place at the right time, considers the  
viewer, and is neither overly repetitive nor demanding.  
In fact, the best signage seems to take on an air of invisibility. It’s there,  
but is taken in and taken for granted.  
Of course, the opportunity exists for signage to add considerably to  
the excellence of any built environment, adding, by careful attention  
to details, color, compatible materials, and most importantly good  
typography that is easy to read and has character, often to reinforce  
the style and standards of the place, institution, or company which  
stands behind it. Chermayeff & Geismar’s iconic placemaking  
sign that has engaged and delighted millions of  
people passing by 9 West 57th Street in New  
York City since 1972, and will continue to do so  
for years to come.  
The meticulous specification of all the elements going into the making of  
signage to meet the reality of each situation, to stay in balance, finding  
the best point between the most basic adequacy at one extreme and  
the performance of refined and sophisticated excellence in design  
terms at the other end of the spectrum, is what Calori & Vanden‐Eynden  
consistently deliver time and time again.

Conversation with a New York City cabbie\:  
Cabbie\: “Whaddaya do?”  
Reply\: “I’m a designer.”  
Cabbie\: “Oh yeah, designer. So you’re in fashion design, right?”  
Reply\: “No. I design signs.”  
Cabbie\: “Whaddaya mean, you design signs?”  
Reply\: “I design signs. I mean, when you drive fares to LaGuardia, how do  
you know where to drop them off?”  
Cabbie\: “I follow the signs. Wait, you mean someone designs those  
things? Never woulda figured that someone designed signs.”  
Reply\: “Well, God didn’t put them here.”  
Cabbie\: “People really do that, huh? I mean, design signs?”  
Reply\: “Yep.”  
It’s been eight years since this book was first published. A lot has  
changed and a lot has stayed the same, including the relevance of the  
fictional dialogue above.  
Environmental graphic design, or EGD, a relatively new hybrid of the  
design field, is fairly long on practice but short on theory and formalized  
methodology. The first edition of this book filled that knowledge gap  
by putting forth the first formal methodology for solving signage and  
wayfinding problems\: the Signage Pyramid model.  
This second edition—the first we know of for any book on signage and  
EGD—builds on the Signage Pyramid method with updated content  
and full color throughout. David Vanden‐Eynden, my partner in design,  
business, and life, is co‐authoring this second edition. His insight and hard  
work has made this edition even better than the first.  
This second edition acknowledges some of the changes that have  
impacted EGD since the first edition. For openers, our professional  
organization, the SEGD, has changed the root word for the “E” in  
“SEGD” from “Environmental” to “Experiential,” but this book’s primary  
focus is still on environmental graphic design, as in graphics in the built  
environment.  
Introduction  
xv Introduction  
xvi  
This edition continues to discuss the design process in detail because  
this process is so important to the work of all designers. In the  
meantime, the business community has taken an interest in the design  
process, so while the design process remains the same, you may better  
recognize it repackaged as design thinking and repurposed for corporate  
problem‐solving.  
Branding is now a core element of identity strategies and EGD plays an  
ever‐increasing role in creating brand identities, be it for large corporations,  
small businesses, nonprofit institutions, events, community initiatives,  
and the like.  
Many people now possess smart phones, which give them personalized  
access to tailored information, including some wayfinding information.  
And digital signage is a hot term, but it mainly means deployed,  
nonmobile screens that deliver advertising/marketing information—when  
you enter a store, at the checkout lane, at the transit stop, on a city street,  
and so forth.  
The Americans with Disabilities Act’s \(ADA’s\) 2010 Standards for  
Accessible Design \(SAD\) are significantly different regarding signage than  
the original 1991 Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines  
\(ADAAG\). SAD or not, the basic principles of typography, a key element of  
signage, remain true after nearly six centuries of practical application and  
refinement.  
The physical world still exists and we still live in it and we still need to find  
our way through it. There are now multiple channels for communicating  
wayfinding information—digital and static—but the basic need for  
orientation still exists. After all, if the power goes out, that little blue dot  
on your smart phone map doesn’t exist, but physical signs do and you  
suddenly realize how essential they are to conducting your life.  
This edition, which acknowledges all of the above, still focuses on the  
very complex task of designing static signage and wayfinding systems  
that help people navigate their physical surroundings. This edition is for all  
those who work to make life better by designing signage and wayfinding  
programs that help fellow humans find their way through the real world.  
Signage is visual communication design at its most elemental level,  
helping people read the world. You are what you see. And yes, people  
design signs. 1

What Is Environmental Graphic Design?  
2  
Long before paper was invented, humans made marks on objects, such  
as cave walls, in their surrounding environment. The intent of making  
these marks, or signs, was to communicate information visually. This  
communication imbued these marks with meaning and they became a  
shared language among the people who made and understood them.  
\(See Figures 1.1 and 1.2.\) As such, environmental graphic design, or EGD,  
which can be defined as the graphic communication of information in the  
built environment, is one of the world’s oldest professions.  
And you thought something else was.  
Since the invention of paper and the electronic screen, most people think  
of graphic communication as taking place primarily in those two media.  
But just like early humans making meaningful marks on environmental  
objects, in the present era an enormous amount of information is  
communicated on signs and other objects located in the built environment.  
The contemporary incarnation of EGD is a relatively new, cross‐disciplinary  
field that has gained recognition and importance over the past 40 years.  
Sure, signs existed prior to that point, but they tended to pop up in an ad  
hoc, unplanned, almost reactionary manner—in other words, pretty much  
as an afterthought. \(See Figures 1.3 and 1.4.\) As cities grew and mobility  
increased, making the built environment more complex, people’s need for  
information to better understand, navigate, and use their surroundings also  
grew. Simultaneously, technological developments, such as photomechanical  
reproduction techniques and computer‐driven cutting devices, aided accurate  
large‐scale rendition of graphic elements, such as typefaces and symbols, on  
signs. Thus, the need for proactive, systematically planned, visually unified  
signage and wayfinding programs emerged.  
If you don’t think EGD is important, ask yourself\: Could you understand  
how to use a large international airport or an urban rail transit system if  
there were no signs at all, or if the signs were a disparate mishmash of  
messages, graphics, and physical forms? The answer is most definitively  
no! As such, contemporary signage and wayfinding programs give a  
singular, unified voice to an environment or a site within it. 1.1  
Looking to the future, there has been much speculation whether mobile  
computer devices with digital mapping and augmented reality applications  
will spell the end of physical signs. We say no, for many reasons, two of  
which are\: Physical signs don’t need a mobile device, signal, or battery  
power to operate; and not everyone is equipped with mobile computer  
devices. While there’s no doubt that the various wayfinding applications on  
such devices have enhanced the way millions of people navigate the built  
environment—and will continue to do so—the word enhance is key. Our  
belief is that physical signs are here to stay, and that mobile digital devices  
offer rich opportunities for augmenting the communication function  
of those physical signs. More about digital communication systems,

“The Hardware System.”  
To underscore the relative youth of EGD as a field, consider that the  
terms environmental graphics, signage, and wayfinding were barely in  
use 40 years ago. In fact, the word signage, whose origins are attributed  
to Canadian designer Paul Arthur, didn’t even appear in U.S. dictionaries  
until the 1980s. Nevertheless, in the 1970s, a group of designers found  
themselves designing graphics for a coordinated group of signs rather  
than for print. And because they often worked in architectural offices, and  
their design work related to architectural spaces, their work product was  
often referred to as architectural graphics or architectural signing.  
These architectural graphic designers realized that there were significant  
differences between their design and print design \(digital design didn’t exist  
then\)—most notably that architectural graphics encompassed the planning  
and communication of information on three‐dimensional \(3D\) objects in  
the built environment, which is far more complex than designing a two‐  
dimensional printed piece, such as a poster, book, or brochure. As these  
architectural graphic designers discovered each other and the commonalties  
of their professional interests, they joined together to form the Society  
of Environmental Graphic Designers \(SEGD\). The words relating to SEGD  
were slightly changed several years ago to the “Society for Environmental  
Graphic Design” to focus on the field rather than its practitioners, and  
changed again in 2014 to the “Society for Experiential Graphic Design.”  
With the birth of the SEGD, the term environmental graphics replaced  
architectural graphics, for two reasons. First, architectural was viewed  
as too limiting, in that this form of graphic design is often geared toward  
nonarchitectural open spaces, such as roadways, cities, theme parks, and SEGD  
The SEGD \(Society for Experiential Graphic Design\)  
is a global community of professionals who create  
experiences that connect people to place. Through  
educational programs, its website www.SEGD.org,  
publications, and research, SEGD’s mission is  
to provide learning opportunities and resources  
for professionals involved in Environmental and  
Experiential Graphic Design \(EGD/XGD\), promote  
the importance of the discipline in establishing  
place, and continue to refine standards of  
practice for the field. SEGD members are leading  
developers of wayfinding programs; placemaking  
and identity projects; immersive media  
environments; exhibition and experience designs;  
and design research, strategy, and planning.  
SEGD, 1000 Vermont Ave., Suite 400, Washington, DC 20005,  
202.638.5555,www.segd.org  
so on—that is, the larger sphere of the built environment. Second, the  
term architectural graphics could be confused with the drawings architects  
create to document their building designs.  
As noted above, in 2014 the SEGD changed the referential word for the  
“E” in “SEGD” to “Experiential” to broaden the SEGD member base. This  
has created some confusion and consternation as to what EGD activity  
is, particularly in the context of this book. As with the first edition, EGD is  
considered to focus on environmental graphic design, that is, the design  
of graphics in the built environment.  
Regardless of whether the “E” refers to “environmental” or “experiential,”  
the SEGD has grown to become the premier professional organization for  
all designers who practice EGD. And signage is now in the dictionary.  
# The Spectrum of EGD Activity  
We’ve established that contemporary EGD activity involves the  
development of a systematic, informationally-cohesive, and visually  
unified graphic communication system for a given site within the built  
environment. Such sites can range from a single building to a complex of  
buildings to a city or to a transportation network connecting multiple sites  
on a regional or national scope—all of which have complex communication  
needs. EGD can respond to those environmental communication needs in  
three distinct but often overlapping arenas. As shown in Figure 1.5, these  
have been identified by one of our colleagues, Wayne Hunt, as\:

Although this book focuses on physical signage and wayfinding  
design—and in particular static, nonelectronic signage—the above three  
communication facets of EGD and their interaction apply to both the  
physical and digital realms, and warrant a bit more exploration.  
# Signage and Wayfinding  
Signage and wayfinding are most commonly expressed in unified sign  
programs that informationally and visually knit together a site, a collection  
of related sites, such as regional parks or global corporate facilities; or  
networks, such as a transportation system. Examples of signage and  
wayfinding programs are shown in the Gallery section at the end of this  
book, as well as throughout this chapter and others in the book. In the  
sense that well‐designed sign programs serve to visually unify a site,  
signage can perform a placemaking role by establishing a unique identity  
and sense of place, thereby creating a brand image in environmental form.  
\(See Figures 1.6 and 1.7.\) In addition to wayfinding and placemaking roles,  
signage programs can also communicate other kinds of information, such  
as warning, operational, and interpretive information, as examined further  
in Chapter 4, “The Information Content System.”  
Although the terms signage and wayfinding are often used interchangeably,  
it’s very important to keep in mind this distinction in mind\: Typically, the  
primary objective of a signage program is to help people find their way  
through an environment, whereas effective wayfinding solutions often  
involve more than signage alone. \(See Figure 1.8.\) Clear, well‐defined  
pathways and other visual cues, such as prominent landmarks, all aid  
wayfinding, as do printed maps, human guides, and, more recently, mobile  
computer devices that utilize GPS and augmented reality technology.  
A key objective in wayfinding design, which our colleague Per Mollerup  
terms “wayshowing,” is to enable each person to form a mental map  
of a site or environment, so the clearer the physical layout of a site,  
the clearer those mental maps will be. In other words, even the most  
carefully conceived sign program can’t solve all the problems of navigating  
a site that contains confusing, circuitous pathways. In such cases, the  
sign program is like using a Band‐Aid to patch together a rather large  
wound\: It’s some help, but not a panacea. Think about it\: How many  
times have you blamed the signs when you’re having difficulty navigating  
a complicated highway interchange? In many such cases, the signs  
themselves aren’t the problem; they can only do so much to guide you  
through what is the underlying problem—a poorly laid‐out interchange.  
Wayfinding is an active process, requiring mental engagement and  
attention to the environment one is trying to navigate. That is why in a sports car rally, the navigator is just as important as the driver. The fact is,  
however, that many people are better at understanding information given  
to them verbally and so would rather ask someone how to go from point  
A to point B than to follow the signs or read a map. Signage and other  
visual wayfinding cues can, however, help even these people navigate  
their environment when there’s no one around to ask.

park\), an event \(e.g., the battle of Gettysburg or the Jamestown flood\), a  
historical figure \(e.g., Franklin Delano Roosevelt or Martin Luther King\),  
a corporation and its products, and so on. Interpretive information is  
most often expressed in the form of exhibitry, which can be composed  
of a site itself, physical artifacts, audiovisual \(A/V\) and interactive media,  
static images and graphics, casework, and more. Interpretive exhibits can  
be temporary or permanent or exterior or interior. Exhibits can serve a  
placemaking role in that they often become destinations unto themselves.  
Interpretive information intersects with signage, in that interpretive  
information in the form of text and images can also be displayed in  
signage programs. \(See Figures 1.9 through 1.12.\)

# Placemaking  
Placemaking creates a distinctive image for a site, and can be expressed  
in several ways. As already discussed, signage and interpretive exhibits  
can create a sense of place, as can gateways, portals, gathering points,  
and landmarks. What separates placemaking, in the EGD sense, from  
other forms of placemaking is the explicit communication of information  
through both static and digital channels.  
Without this explicit communication intent, placemaking becomes an  
exercise of architecture, interior design, sculpture, theater, and so on.  
This is not to discount that EG designers may team with any of those  
disciplines in order to create placemaking objects or events, which are  
often monumental—typically in scale, but sometimes also in quantity—  
even if sometimes temporary.  
New York’s Grand Central Terminal or an exquisitely designed restaurant  
interior may convey a wonderful sense of place but they are not  
placemaking in the EGD sense, because their inherent purpose is not  
to communicate information. Times Square, on the other hand, derives  
its entire sense of place from the sheer concentration of signage—both  
static and electronic—surrounding it. And because the intent of all that  
signage is to communicate, even if primarily marketing messages, Times  
Square does represent placemaking in an EGD sense. \(See Figures 1.13  
through 1.15.\)

# The Importance of EGD Today  
As explained, the difference between EGD and other types of  
design is the explicit purpose of EGD to communicate meaningful  
information via words, symbols, diagrams, and images. Because  
of this expressed communication function, EGD plays a key—and  
increasingly recognized—role in how people use and experience the  
built environment.  
Furthermore, the signage and wayfinding aspect of EGD is being  
recognized as a key contributor to a sense of personal well‐being, safety,  
What Is Environmental Graphic Design?

1.15  
and security in unfamiliar and often high‐stress environments, such as  
airports, hospitals, and cities. Additionally, EGD has gained importance for  
its capability to create a sense of place for a given site and for its power to  
reinforce a brand image.  
Signage was once considered a necessary evil—or worse, an  
afterthought—but a growing number of people in the design,  
construction, development, marketing, and policy arenas have gained an  
understanding of signage and EGD’s role in humanizing and demystifying  
the complexities of the built environment. They have found that well‐  
designed signage and environmental graphic programs not only fulfill  
their communication function of informing, directing, and identifying but  
also serve to enhance the aesthetic and psychological qualities of an  
environment.  
Certainly, EG designers are often part of the consultant team  
assembled by architects for a building design or renovation project,  
but EG design has finally come into its own, as well. Cities and  
universities are engaging EG designers, sans architects, to create  
signage and other EG design programs. Real estate managers are  
engaging EG designers, sans architects, to revitalize the image  
of a building or facility. Corporations and institutions, including  
transportation agencies, are engaging EG designers, sans architects,  
to unify environmental communication systems on regional, national,  
and global scales. Even general contractors and construction

University of Pennsylvania’s crest brands every

managers are including signage as a line item in their procurement  
budgets. All this has happened, in part, because people have  
recognized that signage and EG design have a unique branding power.  
\(See Figure 1.16.\)  
# Signage and EGD\: The Brand Connection  
The importance of brand strategy and management has risen to top  
attention within many organizations, large and small, commercial  
and institutional. Brand strategies recognize that people come into contact with a brand via several types of “touchpoints,” and seek to  
maximize not only the quantity of those touchpoints, but also the  
quality.  
A comprehensive brand strategy embraces signage and EGD programs as  
important touchpoints that have the power to build brand images in three‐  
dimensional, environmental form. This can take place through harmony or  
imposition strategies.  
Using the harmony strategy, the visual characteristics of a sign  
program can reflect and reinforce the visual characteristics of a  
site’s design or architecture to create a seamless, totally integrated  
identity. \(See Figures 1.17 and 1.18.\) The harmony approach works  
well when the signage program is being designed for an environment  
with a high level of visual unity, be it an existing site or, more  
commonly, a new development or major renovation, when design  
details can be coordinated among all the design professionals involved  
in the project.  
Using the imposition approach, signage can create or impose a unique,  
singular identity on a site—an identity that’s completely independent of  
the site’s visual characteristics. This approach works well for existing sites  
that have disparate visual elements, such as cities, college campuses,  
corporate facilities, and transportation networks, that can be linked  
together by the metabranding of the signage program. \(See Figures 1.19  
through 1.21.\)  
In an ideal branding situation, signage relates to an organization’s or  
a site’s other communication channels, such as its website, mobile  
device applications, and electronic directories in a seamless brand  
expression. This is often not easily accomplished, since many large  
organizations have different departments responsible for these various  
communication channels. For example, a university’s marketing  
department oversees the website, its communications department  
oversees electronic screens, and the facilities department oversees  
physical static signage—and seldom are these departments’ efforts  
coordinated. Add in the fact that each department may have different  
procurement procedures and it can become quite difficult to impose  
a unified brand persona across all of an organization’s communication  
channels.  
Whether a signage program brands by harmony or imposition, signage  
provides needed information to people using it, engendering feelings of  
goodwill and security, thus enhancing the quality of the brand experience.  
And since signage programs provide information that people actively seek,  
signage links this sought‐after information directly to the brand. There  
is no doubt that good signage builds good relationships with any given

# Digital Information Systems and EGD  
Digital information systems that display graphics on electronic screens  
have become an important part of everyone’s daily life, and since these  
systems serve a communication function, they have a relationship to  
EGD. This relationship is somewhat nebulous at this time but more clarity  
should evolve as the future progresses.

The focus of this book is on static, nonelectronic signage programs, but  
some discussion of the digital realm is in order. We’ll start with some  
basic definitions of types of digital systems currently in use. These  
definitions build on those offered on the Digital Screenmedia Association  
website. More information on digital display units is presented in Chapter  
6, “The Hardware System.”  
# Digital Signage  
Digital signage refers to electronic display screens, which are typically  
large but increasingly include smaller tablet‐sized screens, deployed in  
a permanent, fixed position to display information content to a mass  
audience. Digital signage content is typically preprogrammed and  
noninteractive, that is, not selected by individual user, and is often of an  
advertising or entertainment nature. In fact, the term digital signage is  
currently somewhat misleading because most “digital signage” is used  
to display advertising content, not wayfinding or other informational  
content that helps people navigate an environment. That said, digital  
signage is being used for EGD applications, such as flight or train  
schedule information and exhibit interpretation, and more will emerge  
with time and as the cost of infrastructure and deployment diminishes.  
\(See Figure 1.22.\)  
# Interactive Kiosks  
Interactive kiosks are a form of digital signage in that they use display  
screens deployed in a fixed position with preprogrammed content, but  
they have the distinction of allowing individual users to access information  
or perform a transaction as selected by each user from the kiosk’s  
preprogrammed information pool. The classic example of an interactive  
kiosk is an ATM. EGD examples include the New York City MTA’s On  
The Go! interactive wayfinding kiosks, which display customized,  
user‐selected travel and local information; and electronic building  
directories, which a user accesses to find a tenant in an office building.  
Users interact with these devices via touchscreen or keyboard/pad  
interfaces; gesture‐based interaction may become more commonplace in  
the future. \(See Figure 1.23.\)  
# Mobile Devices  
Mobile devices, also known as handheld digital devices or smart  
phones, are small, self‐contained portable computer devices, such as  
phones or tablets, which people carry with them. Mobile devices are  
completely interactive and personalized by the individual owner of the  
device. By connecting to the Internet via phone/data or Wi‐Fi service,  
mobile users have access to the universe of digital information and  
can select any information they want or need. Most mobile devices are 1.23 Interactive kiosks\: New York City MTA On  
The Go! kiosks allow users to select customized  
wayfinding and other information from a  
preprogrammed menu of choices.  
1.23  
equipped with GPS technology, which locates the phone’s geographic  
position; this in turn, has led to many mobile wayfinding applications,  
including the map applications that are native to most mobile  
operating systems. Since GPS currently only works outdoors, these  
wayfinding apps are suitable for navigating exterior environments, but  
developments in mobile interior wayfinding include use of augmented  
reality and Wi‐Fi triangulation. In addition to the more generalized map  
apps, there are specialized wayfinding apps for specific locations, like  
the myNav\: Central Park app, which provides wayfinding and other  
information about the park. \(See Figure 1.24.\) Also in the EGD realm,  
specific mobile apps provide enriched interpretive information to  
museum visitors.  
As stated previously, the explosion of digital information systems  
has created some flux in the EGD world. The above basic definitions  
attempt to impose some order on the flux, but are necessarily brief and  
general. They don’t get into the technical nitty gritty of the hardware  
and software infrastructures that deliver content to each of the above  
digital systems. This infrastructure is complex, expensive, in need of  
relatively frequent upgrading, and generally beyond the skills set of  
most EGD practitioners and sign fabricators, and certainly beyond the  
scope of this book.  
Even digital content production can elude EG designers if it involves  
writing code or the production of video or animated content.  
Yet content is the key to effective, engaging, relevant digital  
communication; after all, the digital sign, kiosk, or mobile device  
Digital Information Systems and EGD

What Is Environmental Graphic Design?  
is just a blank screen waiting to be filled with content, similar to  
a blank canvas waiting to be filled with paint—and the quality of  
that content affects the user’s perception of the message being  
conveyed. In this respect, EG designers can use their communication  
skills to shape and direct digital content’s structure, theme, and  
visual appearance, often by partnering with technical specialists  
who can transform the EG designer’s vision into pixels on a screen.  
EG designers can also use their 3D design skills in developing the  
appearance of the physical housings for deployed digital signage and  
kiosks, again often by teaming with the developers of the content  
delivery infrastructure.  
The impact of digital information systems on EGD is profound  
and evolving, as is the world of digital communications itself.  
Some resources on current developments and trends include the  
websites and events of the SEGD, the International Sign Association,  
the Digital Screenmedia Association, and the Digital Signage  
Federation.  
There is no final, definitive word on digital information systems  
and EGD, as the area of digital communications is in its infancy.  
As stated earlier in this chapter, digital signage, interactive kiosks,  
and mobile devices can complement and augment physical, static  
signage, particularly in a coordinated multichannel communications  
program, such as a branding campaign. Digital information systems  
will likely never completely replace physical signs, however, for various  
reasons\: expense, relatively rapid technological obsolescence, power  
consumption, resource depletion, plus the fact that lots of people  
20 just like the reassurance and permanence—let alone the placemaking  
qualities—of physical signs and interpretive graphics. The challenge  
for the EGD community, including sign fabricators, is how to harness  
the rich potential of digital information systems for communicating  
relevant information about the built environment, together with more  
conventional media, such as static signage, in a coordinated, meaningful  
way. The possibilities are endless and the creative imagination is the  
only limit!  
# You Can’t Learn This in College  
EGD projects are typically complex, with many problems and  
subproblems, which cross the boundaries of various design  
disciplines. Accordingly, EGD is a cross‐disciplinary specialty field  
that combines aspects of the graphic design, architecture, and  
industrial and interior design professions. \(See Figure 1.25.\) Currently,  
there are no comprehensive undergraduate EGD degree–granting  
programs in the United States \(of which the authors are aware\),  
although certain undergraduate design programs, typically in graphic  
design, do offer students exposure to EGD in a specific course. These  
courses either may be exclusively dedicated to EGD or incorporate  
EGD within a broader course of study, such as a brand identity design  
course. On the graduate level, Iowa State University offers an MA in  
Environmental Graphic Design, the first EGD graduate program in the  
United States.  
Due to the lack of comprehensive EGD educational programs, and  
because of the cross‐disciplinary nature of the field, the only way  
EGD practitioners can fill gaps in their knowledge base is by learning  
in the workplace. For example, a graphic designer must learn about  
three‐dimensional forms and materials, working in scale, interpreting  
architectural drawings, and basic drafting. An architect or industrial  
designer must learn about graphic communication purposes and  
1.25 The spectrum of design disciplines and  
their products.

22  
techniques, two‐dimensional design principles, and graphic application  
techniques. This book aims to fill in those gaps for both aspiring and  
current practitioners, including students.  
This book is also for clients who procure EGD services, including brand  
managers, communication directors, architects, landscape architects,  
urban designers, planners, public administrators, transportation officials,  
real estate developers, general contractors, and facility and construction  
managers. This book will help those who engage the services of  
environmental graphic designers gain an understanding of EGD processes  
and methodologies, leading to more effective working relationships with  
EG designers.  
# What’s Ahead in This Book  
This book will take you, the reader, into the wonderful world of  
EG design, with the focus on static, nonelectronic signage and  
wayfinding design, although many of its broad principles apply to the  
digital realm. Think of it as a guidebook, which leads you first into  
the design process as it relates to EG design, then reveals what we  
call the Signage Pyramid methodology, which Chris Calori developed  
in graduate school. This methodology divides signage into three  
interrelated focus areas or components\: the Information Content  
System, the Graphic System, and the Hardware System. This divide‐  
and‐conquer strategy makes it easier to solve the complex problems  
and subproblems posed in the design of a comprehensive signage  
program. Along the way, you’ll also find lots of tips, and a relatively  
small dose of opinion.  
Ultimately, this book is about the design process and methodology  
that leads to the end product of a built, functioning signage program.  
The Gallery section at the end of this book showcases the built signage  
programs that are products of the process while the photos and diagrams  
throughout the book reflect aspects of the process itself. The photos  
in the book represent the work of our office, as well as that of several  
leading EGD consulting firms, primarily firms located in the United States  
but also some located throughout the world.  
As you read, keep in mind that every signage and wayfinding project  
is different—different sites, different sizes, different clients, different  
everything! So the generalized, idealized process and methodology  
presented in this book won’t directly mirror the process for each and  
every signage project an EG designer or client has encountered or  
will encounter. But though signage and wayfinding design is complex, it’s not rocket science. There are few hard‐and‐fast rules, and there  
are many ways to approach many of the items discussed in this  
book. There’s also a multitude of signage and wayfinding issues and  
technicalities that this book doesn’t address. In sum, we recommend  
you use this as a big‐picture book, and adapt what you learn to your  
own projects.

# The Design Process  
# Design is a creative problem‐solving process.  
The Design Process  
The design of signage and wayfinding programs is part of a broader  
design discipline that has come to be known as environmental graphic  
design, or EGD. As defined in Chapter 1, EGD activity is concerned with  
the graphic communication of information in the built environment, which  
is just about anything built by human intent, be it a single building, such as  
a hotel or stadium; an assemblage of buildings, such as a city or campus;  
a planned open space, such as a park or historical site; or a transportation  
network, such as a subway or rail system.  
While the primary communication goal of signage and wayfinding design  
is to help people navigate the built environment, EGD encompasses two  
other important communication functions, placemaking and interpretation,  
and signage design often intersects with these other EGD activities, as  
discussed and illustrated in Chapter 1, “What Is Environmental Graphic  
Design?”  
Though this book focuses on the signage aspect of EGD, the terms  
signage design and EGD are used interchangeably. EGD exists in a  
broader design universe and is, in fact, the ultimate hybrid—or, if you’re  
less charitable, mongrel—of design. EGD is the ultimate multidisciplinary  
design discipline, where graphic design, architecture, industrial design,  
interior design, landscape architecture, city planning, and urban design all  
converge. And common to all of these design disciplines, including EGD,  
is the design process, also known as design thinking.  
Design thinking has been adopted by various nondesign organizations  
as a novel problem‐solving approach in their arsenal of management  
techniques; while the name is different and the approach may involve  
fewer, differently named steps, the process is essentially the same. If  
considering this chapter to be about design thinking helps you better  
understand the design process, that’s fine by us.  
All design activity is a problem‐solving process. All design activity is also  
creative, but unlike fine art, it takes place under real‐world constraints.  
24 Designers focus their creative talents on solving problems for their  
clients, not on self‐expression. We, as designers, have a unique gift to  
give\: life to our clients’ ideas, which we make tangible and real. It’s a  
heady responsibility, one we must undertake with diligence and good  
stewardship. We must consider all things possible to the extent possible.  
Moreover, we must extend our best effort to employ our creative talents,  
skills, and knowledge in making the world a better place.  
Designers, including EG designers, typically do not directly produce the  
objects of their design/creative activity. Unlike painters who put their  
creative compositions on canvas with their own hands, designers rely on  
other parties to produce the objects they design. There’s the architect,  
who designs a building but relies on a contractor to build it; the industrial  
designer, who designs a consumer product but relies on a manufacturing  
facility to produce it; or the traditional graphic designer, who designs a  
book but relies on a printing facility to print and bind it. The EG designer  
relies on a sign fabricator to build and install a signage program.  
A key role of the designer emerges in the preceding examples, that of  
an intermediary, between the client and the producer, and between the  
design problem and the embodiment or realization of the design solution.  
\(See Figure 2.1.\) In this role, the basic process any design professional  
uses becomes evident. It is to\:  
1\. Assess the client’s problem.  
2\. Apply creative skills.  
3\. Synthesize a solution.  
4\. Communicate the solution to the producer.  
5\. Oversee production of the solution.  
6\. Evaluate effectiveness of the finished product.  
The universal design process is evolutionary, with the design solution  
unfolding in a series of steps, from general to more specific. And while  
the steps or phases of the design process typically progress from one  
to the next in a somewhat systematic, linear order, they may at times  
overlap, repeat, or feed back into each other. Ultimately, however, the end  
goal is to progress from the first phase to the last. And every effective

the design problem and the design solution.  
The Design Process  
2.1  
25 A Word about Technology and the Design Process  
Technology impacts the design process in  
ever‐changing ways. The purpose of this chapter  
is to delineate the design process in a clear  
series of basic steps, without the distraction  
of details on current and future technologies  
that designers can use for managing the design  
process.  
Certain technologies are mentioned in this chapter,  
but keep in mind that they will constantly change  
and evolve. The most important thing to take away  
from this chapter is an understanding of the design  
process, along with the knowledge that designers  
must constantly stay abreast of and master the  
latest technological tools to aid them in the process.  
designer on the planet employs essentially this type of systematic  
process to arrive at design solutions, whether he or she is consciously  
aware of it or not.  
# The Client Is Part of the Process  
When a client engages any designer, including EG designers, a  
partnership is formed, with both clients and designers performing various  
roles. The designer’s role is to make a diligent, earnest effort to solve  
the client’s problem. The client’s role is to provide adequate information,  
feedback, and guidance in a timely manner—and to pay the designer’s  
invoices on time.  
Most successful projects are the result of an active working relationship  
grounded in mutual trust between client and designer.  
Message to designers\: The client is part of the process, so don’t ignore  
the client’s needs and constraints.  
Message to clients\: You are a part of the process, so don’t think the  
designer can magically solve the problem without your active involvement.  
Effective design solutions require client input and engagement. Passivity  
on the client’s part doesn’t work. If both clients and designers remember  
that they have a partnership—and all that this relationship entails—a  
successful outcome is likely to result.  
The Design Process  
# The Design Process Applied to EGD  
The basic design process can be effectively tailored to EGD scenarios,  
maximizing the efficiency of EGD activity. Because so many EGD  
projects are coupled with architectural design projects, the design  
phases of the EGD process model outlined in this chapter are analogous  
to those used in the architectural profession. This process model is also  
26 Pre-design Post-design  
2.2  
a useful framework for outlining design services to be performed on a  
project in fee proposals to prospective clients. Additionally, it’s useful  
for educating clients about the evolutionary process from which design  
solutions emerge and become implemented. The design process model,  
which includes predesign, design, and postdesign phases, is shown in  
Figure 2.2.  
Each EGD phase, described in sequence in this chapter, has several  
tasks associated with it. Keep in mind that though these phases are  
presented as distinct and in linear order, they often overlap and feed back  
into each other, as noted previously. Also be aware that while the client’s  
involvement is mentioned primarily at project milestones, the designer  
typically maintains ongoing contact with the client throughout all the  
phases.  
# Coordinating Timing of the EGD Process  
If a signage project is independent of any larger design and construction  
project, the design process timetable can be set fairly easily. If, however,  
a signage project is part of a new construction, project timing of the  
EGD process with that of the overall project becomes critical. Often,  
EG designers are brought into a project too late, but they can also be  
brought in too early, such as before floor plans are frozen or locked—that  
is, while the plans are still in a state of flux and sign locations cannot be  
pinned down. Ideally, the signage design process should lag behind the  
architectural design process by one or two phases.  
While on the subject of time, note that signage projects are usually of  
much longer duration than typical graphic design projects for print or  
electronic media. It is not uncommon for a signage project to take months  
or years to complete—although the EG designer may not be working  
continuously on the project during that time frame—so EGD is definitely  
not for those who seek instant gratification in their work.  
Throughout this chapter the design process is illustrated with photos that  
trace the development of the One Raffles Quay \(ORQ\) signage program  
2.2 The phases of the design process include  
predesign, design, and postdesign activity.  
The Design Process Applied to EGD  
27 at our office, from the data collection and analysis phase through to the  
fabrication/installation observation phase. The end product of the design  
process for the ORQ project—the built signage program—is depicted in  
the Gallery section at the end of this book, as are sign programs which  
are the built products of the design process for our office and many other  
EGD consulting firms.  
Our office designed the ORQ signage program for a very large, approximately  
2-million-square-foot office complex in Singapore which has several mixed‐  
use components, including below‐grade connections to the metro rail  
system, above‐grade parking facilities and pedestrian bridge network, and  
retail shops on the lower level. We designed the ORQs sign program with a  
harmony strategy, as described in Chapter 1, to create a strong, unique brand  
image inspired by the lantern‐like forms and transparency of ORQ’s two office  
towers. The ORQ signage program has been internationally recognized for  
design excellence in many awards programs and publications.  
The Design Process  
2.3 Data collection and analysis phase\:  
An architectural rendering provides initial  
information about the building’s size, shape,  
materials, and lighting.  
# Phase 1\: Data Collection and Analysis  
# \(Predesign\)  
Also known by terms such as preschematic, research, discovery, and  
others, this is a very important predesign planning phase that’s often  
neglected in the designer’s eagerness to get the creative juices going. But  
remember that design doesn’t happen in a vacuum! You have a client who  
has engaged your services to solve a signage problem, and that client  
and that problem come with a whole range of parameters and constraints  
that you need to know about before you put pencil to paper or mouse to  
mousepad and begin to synthesize an effective design solution.  
Put simply, phase 1 is the information‐gathering and analysis phase, the  
discovery or learning phase. During this period, EG designers collect as  
much information as they can on the fledgling project and then make  
sense of it. Examples of types of information studied and analyzed  
during this phase are shown in Figures 2.3 through 2.5. An appropriate  
description of the designer’s role in phase 1 is that of a sponge, absorbing  
and assimilating as much about the project as possible, then filtering that  
information into a plan of action.  
At first, phase 1 is focused on divergence, when the designer reaches  
out and plucks as much information about the project as possible with  
little regard to its ultimate usefulness. At this stage, it’s important to be  
open‐minded and nonjudgmental about the data being gathered. As more  
is learned about the project, phase 1 activity becomes more convergent.  
Now the designer analyzes and distills the information to draw  
conclusions and set goals for the subsequent design‐oriented phases.  
28 2.4  
Subjects for up‐front research can vary widely from project to project, but  
some basics for signage programs include, in no particular order\:  
• Time and budget constraints  
•  
• Image and branding goals  
•  
• Formal and thematic context\(s\) of the site\(s\)  
•  
• User profiles  
•  
• Physical characteristics of the site itself  
•  
• Circulation pathways and decision points  
•  
• Applicable codes affecting signage  
•  
2.4 Data collection and analysis phase\: A  
site plan allows the designer to understand  
circulation paths, entry points, and identification  
opportunities.

determine the site’s identification strategy.

• Whether the client hates the color blue  
•  
No doubt both you and your client will be impatient to get to the really  
fun, pretty‐picture phases of design, but it’s important to keep in mind  
that the careful planning of phase 1 sets the stage for more focused,  
viable solutions in subsequent design phases. Remember to find out what  
you’re jumping into before you jump in! Remember, too, that while the  
big research push occurs at the beginning of a project, data collection and  
analysis often continues throughout a project.  
# Phase 1 Goals and Results  
The primary goal of the data collection and analysis phase is to gain a  
comprehensive understanding of the project at hand and to verify that  
your understanding meshes with that of the client. Phase 1 results in  
conclusions drawn from the data collection and analysis activity, as well as  
a plan for moving the project forward. Various diagrams and lists may be  
generated, as well as sketches, photo/video surveys, and other records.  
These may be informal working tools just for the design team’s use, or  
they may be formalized for presentation to the client in a written report or  
visual presentation. In either case, the phase 1 results should be reviewed  
and discussed with the client.  
# Phase 2\: Schematic Design  
Once the predesign project research and planning phase is completed, the  
EG designer should have a good grasp of what the project entails, and a  
focused design effort can begin. The schematic design phase is the initial  
design phase and is undoubtedly the most creative, exciting phase, for  
it’s when the informational and visual foundations of the signage program  
are laid. Initially, schematic design activity is divergent and exploratory,  
with the goal of generating as many ideas, concepts, and approaches  
to the design problem as possible, and then becomes convergent as  
these various schemes are evaluated and selected. Overall, subsequent  
project phases continue to be convergent as the selected design solution  
is refined and finalized. This divergent‐convergent aspect of the design  
process is illustrated in Figure 2.6.  
The visual aspects of a sign program are deeply influenced by its  
informational aspects, so it’s important to start phase 2 with exploration of  
the program’s information content system. Briefly, this includes determining  
the locations and communication functions of key signs in the program, as  
well as generating approaches to sign message nomenclature and hierarchy.  
In this process, the designer begins to formulate the building blocks—such  
as communication functions, message vocabularies, mounting conditions, 2.6  
and viewing distances—that are expressed in the visual aspects of the  
sign program. This activity will provide the designer with an inventory of  
key signs that represent the range of signs the program will encompass.  
This key sign inventory then becomes the focus of the visual concepts  
generated in schematic design. \(Chapter 4, “The Information Content  
System,” has a more detailed discussion on developing the sign information  
content system, an activity that’s often referred to as programming.\)  
While it’s essential to address the sign program’s informational aspect early  
on in the schematic design phase, most designers focus their creative  
energies during this phase on the sign program’s visual aspects\: the graphics  
and hardware. \(See Figures 2.7 through 2.10.\) The creative juices and wild  
concepts should flow freely during the early stages of this phase—no holds  
barred. This is the divergent, ideation portion of phase 2, where the goal is to  
generate as many rough visual concepts as possible, where every little inkling  
of an idea is explored and no idea is negated/judged until later. The key word  
here is rough; schematic design should not delve too deeply into detail.  
A tip for improving concept generation at the beginning of phase 2 is to  
never fall in love with your first—or any—idea. If you do, you run the risk  
of investing too much of your time, effort, and ego into a so‐so concept  
when other, absolutely brilliant ones could be out there just waiting  
for your discovery. And when you invest too much of yourself into one  
concept, and detail it to death too early, you become reluctant to give it  
up, thereby blinding yourself to potentially exceptional concepts.  
Another tip\: It may take a while for ideas to emerge. The creative mind often  
needs what is sometimes referred to as an incubation period to formulate  
concepts and ideas subconsciously. When this is enabled, often a great idea  
will just pop out—sometimes at seemingly odd moments, such as in the  
shower or at the grocery store, in what’s known as the “eureka” or “ah‐ha”  
phenomenon. So be aware that creative ideas can take some time to  
emerge, although a deadline has a wonderful way of focusing the mind.  
More brains generate more ideas, so it’s often productive to gather as  
many designers as possible within the EGD firm to participate in the  
2.6 The design process involves divergent  
and convergent activity. Divergent activity  
focuses on gathering as much information  
and generating as many ideas as possible.  
Convergent activity focuses on selection,  
refinement, and conclusion.

2.10 Schematic design phase\: Sign form study 3 shows a concept of a lighted lantern derived from the building’s lighting scheme.  
33 ideation stages of phase 2, even if some of those designers may not be  
assigned for the duration of the project. Collaborative brainstorming and  
word association techniques can stimulate the flow of design concepts,  
as can pencil‐and‐paper sketching, versus computer rendering, as the  
computer interface is not as simple and direct as hand‐sketching. Some  
EGD offices, in fact, don’t permit computer use in ideation, in part because  
computer use tends to foster endless minutely detailed variations on a  
possibly mundane idea rather than exploration of many, truly novel ideas.  
Pinup sessions, too, are very useful for comparing and cross‐fertilizing  
ideas and concepts. The concept sketches generated by the EGD team  
are pinned up on the wall and discussed among the team, with each  
designer articulating the thinking behind his or her various ideas. These  
pinup sessions can be both convergent and divergent. Some concepts  
will be rejected, but even rejected concepts can stimulate entirely new  
directions, so plan on at least two pinup sessions to get out the ideas.  
And check your ego at the door.  
As phase 2 progresses, it becomes convergent, as concepts for the sign  
program’s visual aspects are weighed and selected to form clear design  
directions to finesse for presentation to the client. As with ideation,  
concept selection should be a team effort, with each concept thoroughly  
debated, defended, and discussed in relation to how well it points to  
a solution to the client’s problem. The key phrase here is “pointing to  
a solution.” Remember that the design process is evolutionary, that  
schematic design is an early phase of that process, and that the various  
problems and subproblems of the sign program will be solved as the  
process unfolds in subsequent design phases. \(See Figures 2.11 and  
2.12.\) Think of phase 2 as skimming the surface of the solution and you  
won’t run the risk of becoming too invested too early in what may be a  
wrong solution. This is not the phase for working out the details.

The culmination of phase 2 is a presentation to the client of the EG  
designer’s schematic design activity. \(See Figures 2.13 through 2.15.\)  
This is typically the first time the client is presented with the visual fruits  
of the designer’s creative labors, so it’s a major project milestone that  
either sets the tone for the rest of the project or sends the designer back  
to the drawing board to seek other design directions. If the designer  
has conducted thorough research, however, the need for revisiting other  
design solutions is minimized. Another strategy is to fly some preliminary  
concepts by the client on an informal basis to test the waters—to gain  
input that you’re on the right track before investing in an elaborate  
schematic design presentation.

Many EG designers present up to three schematic design directions,  
explain the merits of each, and then gently guide the client toward the  
selection of one concept. Some designers present just one design  
concept and advocate forcefully for its adoption, which minimizes the  
risk of the client creating a “camel,” that is, an awkward combination of  
two fundamentally different concepts. The drawbacks to the single‐idea  
approach are that the client may\: \(1\) reject the concept outright, and/or  
\(2\) feel that the designer is being too dictatorial by not presenting enough options. Indeed, the designer should have discovered in phase 1 whether  
the client wants multiple options.  
The key to presentation of multiple concepts, however, is to not  
overwhelm the client with too many options, or with any option the  
designer doesn’t believe to be viable. In other words, don’t show the  
client a direction you don’t believe in because that may very well be the  
concept the client selects, and you’ll be doomed to struggling with it for  
the duration of the project.  
# Phase 2 Goals and Results  
The primary goal of the schematic design phase is to generate and  
present informational approaches and visual concepts for client review,  
selection, and approval in order to proceed to subsequent design phases.  
Another goal is to obtain client input and feedback that may affect the  
basic informational or design directions of the sign program.  
Phase 2 results in presentation materials that convey the schematic  
design concepts and approaches to the client. Depending on the size and  
nature of the project and client, these presentation materials typically  
consist of an A/V presentation in the form of a PDF or PowerPoint/Keynote  
file, which may be supplemented by material boards, study models, or  
other visuals such as animated fly‐throughs. The client may also wish to  
have a printed booklet or an electronic file of the A/V presentation.  
A basic content checklist for the phase 2 presentation includes the items  
listed below. Of course, the EG designer can supplement or omit these  
basic content items as appropriate to a given project.  
• Overview of project context, including survey\(s\) of existing conditions,  
•  
if available  
• Key sign locations in plan view  
•  
• Approaches to sign message nomenclature and hierarchy  
•  
• Evocative or metaphorical references, typically images  
•  
• Typeface and symbol options  
•  
• Material and color palette options  
•  
• Basic elevations of key signs, including scale references such as  
•  
people, cars, and trees, and so on  
• Perspective montages of signs in their environmental context, using  
•  
renderings or photos of the actual site as underlying images  
• Animated fly‐throughs of key sign location areas to illustrate the signs  
•  
within space/time sequence  
• Basic study models of sign forms and shapes  
•  
Phase 2\: Schematic Design  
37 Persuasion is certainly part of the design process, as is the ability to  
articulate and present your concepts effectively, sometimes in formalized  
situations before large audiences. Whatever the context, successful  
presentations are visually compelling and verbally engaging, and clearly  
speak to the client’s design problem.  
In an ideal world, the schematic design presentation is a huge success and  
the client makes an immediate—or at least prompt—decision to select and  
approve one of the presented directions. So on to the next design phase,  
but not until you have clear client input and approval to proceed, especially  
because some clients take more time than others to reach decisions. And  
keep in mind that, occasionally, the designer must point to the project time  
schedule and gently prod the client to make a decision.  
# Phase 3\: Design Development  
Approval has now been granted to proceed further onto the design  
process, and the design development \(DD\) phase begins. Whereas the  
initial stages of schematic design \(SD\) are divergent, seeking many ideas,  
DD continues the convergence of the later SD stages, to focus more  
deeply on the selected schematic design direction. Phase 2 just skims the  
surface of the design solution; it is during DD that the solution is fleshed  
out, filled in, modified, and refined. \(See Figures 2.16 and 2.17.\) The  
methods for documenting and tracking various project elements are also  
solidified in phase 3.  
As in phase 2, it’s important to tackle the sign information content system  
in the early stages of design development. During phase 3, a complete  
inventory of all the signs in the program must be developed, meaning that  
each and every sign must be located, messaged, typed, and assigned a

unique identifying/tracking code. This sign inventory process is essential  
because the EG designer cannot meaningfully proceed with design of  
the visual aspects of the program until all the particulars of its parts are  
known. In other words, the designer must know the physical conditions,  
such as width or height constraints, as well as the specific message  
content of each sign before it can be designed. Human factors such as  
viewing angle and distance, as well as code‐mandated factors such as  
typographic sizes, also affect how each sign is designed, as described in  
more detail in Chapters 4, 5, and 6.  
Comprehensive sign programs are composed of hundreds, even thousands,  
of sign units, so it’s inefficient from both design and manufacturing  
standpoints to design each and every one of them individually. Therefore,  
after sign locations and messages are established for the information  
content system, the designer can begin to look for commonalities among  
the various signs to group them into standardized sign types. The objective  
of sign typing is to reduce and simplify the sign program into the fewest  
number of groups that share common features standardized for each type,  
while still fulfilling the communication function of the sign program.  
In a simple example of sign typing, assume the EG designer has  
located and messaged ceiling‐hung, freestanding, and wall‐mounted  
plaques within the project environment, and that they all have message  
Phase 3\: Design Development  
39 content of varying length and importance. The first obvious common  
characteristic by which certain signs can be grouped together is mounting  
method; for example, Sign Type A is a ceiling‐hung sign, Sign Type B is a  
freestanding sign, and so on. Then when message length and importance  
is considered, sign types can be further differentiated; for example, Sign  
Type A1 is a large ceiling‐hung sign to hold message content of the largest  
quantity or highest importance, Sign Type A2 is a small ceiling‐hung sign  
to hold message content of lesser quantity or importance. Many other  
factors can also affect the development of sign types, such as low ceiling  
clearances requiring the use of a smaller ceiling‐hung sign type at certain  
locations, or narrow corridors that limit a sign type’s width. Figure 2.18  
shows a list of sign types and quantities for the ORQ project.  
The Design Process  
2.18 Design development phase\: Sign types and  
quantities list for One Raffles Quay.  
2.18  
40 When signs are typed accordingly, the designer gains efficiency and  
visual unity by designing the sign type, which can cover a large quantity  
of sign messages and units, rather than designing each individual sign  
as a unique, stand‐alone object. And sign typing improves resource  
conservation and manufacturing effectiveness because, for example,  
several units of the same size and shape can be cut, formed, and  
assembled more efficiently than if the same quantity of units were all  
of different sizes and shapes. If you think of sign typing as designing for  
limited mass production, the usefulness of typing becomes clear. And,  
from a design point of view, visual order is enhanced, with fewer sizes,  
proportions, and shapes of signs in the project environment.  
The best way to track and manage sign types is by keeping a list that  
defines the characteristics and size of each type. Pinning down sign types  
is, however, a balancing act, as sign types typically evolve and mutate as  
the DD phase progresses. For example, the need for new sign types may  
emerge, some sign types may be deleted, two sign types may merge into  
one, or the definition of a sign type may change.  
Methods for defining sign types vary, but the two basic approaches are to  
type signs by\:  
• Physical characteristics, such as size, shape, material, mounting  
•  
method, graphic application technique, and so on.  
• Communication function, such as whether the sign communicates  
•  
identification, direction, or another kind of information, as described in  
more detail in Chapter 4, “The Information Content System.”  
At C&VE \(Calori & Vanden‐Enyden\), we prefer to type signs by physical  
characteristics, as they most directly translate into drawings, schedules,  
and bid forms. Our thinking behind this is that the primary fabrication cost  
factor of a sign is its physical characteristics, not the kind of information  
it displays. For example, a 12‐inch square, wall‐mounted aluminum  
plaque with two‐color silkscreened graphics costs the same to fabricate  
and install regardless of whether it displays identification or directional  
information. And a 12‐inch square, wall‐mounted bronze plaque with two‐  
color silkscreened graphics costs more to fabricate than the aluminum  
plaque with all the same characteristics. In this example, the material—  
aluminum versus bronze—is the distinguishing factor between these two  
signs, so we define them as different sign types.  
Other EGD practitioners type by communication function, rather  
than physical characteristics. And sometimes signs are typed using a  
combination of physical characteristics and communication function. There  
is no hard‐and‐fast rule for sign typing, but as recommended by EGD  
pioneers John Follis and Dave Hammer in their seminal book Architectural  
Signing and Graphics \(Whitney Library of Design, 1979\), “All signs in  
Phase 3\: Design Development  
41 The Design Process  
42  
a given sign type should have the same size, shape, and method of  
attachment to the building.” We agree with this recommendation.  
Regardless of the sign‐typing technique you choose, each sign type is  
assigned a code—typically alpha, numeric, or a combination of the two. This  
code is a shorthand way to refer to everything that comprises a given sign  
type. For example, the aforementioned Sign Type A is a code that succinctly  
refers to a large exterior internally illuminated ground‐mounted pylon. As such,  
the sign type code is an essential element of the sign message schedule,  
which is used to track and inventory each and every sign in a program.  
During phase 2, key signs may be numbered, but it is during phase 3 that  
the sign numbering system for tracking all the signs in the overall project is  
typically established, as that’s when all the signs in a program need to be  
located on plans and entered into a message schedule. The sign numbering  
system, sometimes called the location numbering system, identifies and  
distinguishes each sign unit on the location plans and the message schedule.  
The sign numbering system is itself a coding system that conveys  
distinguishing information about each sign unit. To effectively track all the  
signs in a program, each sign should be assigned a unique sign location  
number—meaning it’s not duplicated elsewhere in the program. Other  
information about the sign unit, such as its sign type, which floor the sign  
is on, or whether it’s an interior or exterior sign, can also be coded into its  
sign number.  
There are several approaches to sign numbering, some of which can  
be quite complex. A numbering system that’s suitable for one project  
may not be for another, so it’s wise to weigh various sign numbering  
approaches carefully before putting a given system to use, because it’s  
tedious and time‐consuming to completely revamp the sign numbering  
system once sign numbers have been entered on location plans and the  
message schedule. \(See Figures 2.19 and 2.20.\)  
The sign location plans indicate on plan drawings each sign in a program,  
along with its identifying sign or location number. This sign number is  
entered into the sign message schedule, which contains all the essential  
information about each sign unit, such as its\:  
• Sign type, if it’s not a component of the sign number  
•  
• Message, including arrows and symbols  
•  
• Plan drawing number  
•  
• Construction drawing reference, if applicable  
•  
• Mounting drawing reference, if applicable  
•  
• Graphic layout reference, if applicable• 2.19 Design development phase\: Sign message

Most message schedules also contain a Remarks column for tracking  
such items as changes, additions, deletions, signs for which client input is  
required, and so on.  
Message schedules are formatted as tables, typically on letter‐size,  
landscape \(horizontal\) pages. EGD practitioners can use a range of  
applications to generate message schedules, from word processing  
applications for relatively simple, small sign programs to spreadsheet  
and database applications, which provide more powerful, sophisticated  
tools for data entry, sorting, searching, and editing functions. All of these  
functions are definitely required during the development of a message  
schedule for large, complex signage programs, and in such cases a  
database application is the most powerful tool.  
A word about computer platforms\: Most EG design offices operate on the  
Macintosh platform while most clients, including architects, are on the  
PC platform. This situation creates some file exchange issues, particularly  
with message schedule files, the EG designer’s drawing files, and  
architectural CAD files.  
In the case of message schedules created in a database, most clients  
don’t have database programs in their desktop applications, but they do  
typically have spreadsheet and Acrobat Reader applications, therefore  
the database message schedule may need to be exported to either  
spreadsheet or PDF format, which is easily accomplished. A spreadsheet  
format allows the client to edit the message schedule, if that’s desirable;  
PDFs should be considered uneditable unless the client has the full Adobe  
Acrobat Pro application.  
Regarding the exchange and display of other kinds of files developed by  
the designer or the client for a project, the PDF format facilitates this  
process, particularly for the EG designer’s Adobe Illustrator \(AI\) drawings  
and the client’s architectural CAD files.  
And yet another word about computer technology and cross‐platform  
matters\: In lieu of CAD, more architectural offices are using Building  
Information Management \(BIM\) programs to accomplish their work. It’s not  
the purpose of this book to explain PC‐based BIM and how EGD may or may  
not relate to it. Suffice to say that EGD offices are devising their own ways of  
adapting to the cross‐platform issues and opportunities BIM provides.  
Sign location plans are prepared by placing a marker indicating each sign’s  
location, along with its identifying number, on base plan drawings of the  
project. Most clients possess or can provide architectural plan drawing  
files, so the designer should always request those files—typically as  
PDFs—for use as the sign location base plans rather than going through  
the time‐consuming effort of creating them anew. 2.21

2.23 The Design Process  
46  
The sign locations and numbers need to be clearly visible on the sign  
location plans, but this is easier said than done because plan drawings are  
typically cluttered with written information \(such as notes, dimensions,  
symbols, etc.\), which is necessary for construction of the project but  
tends to obscure sign locations. Nevertheless, there are several ways to  
increase the prominence of sign locations and numbers.  
• Always request clean base plans with the written information removed,  
•  
if possible. While this is a relatively easy process if the architectural  
drawings were created in CAD, some clients may not want to take  
the time. If the plans are from the pre‐CAD era, just be happy that the  
drawings exist at all and take them however you can get them, making  
sure to check that they reflect the currently configured plan.  
• Whether the plans are clean or not, they should be “grayed back” so  
•  
that they’re still readily visible, but fade into the background relative to  
the sign locations and numbers, which are not grayed back.  
• Enclose the sign numbers in a distinctive shape that stands out visually  
•  
from the plan background and any architectural symbols or shapes on it.  
Another consideration is color coding on final plan drawings. While many  
organizations are reducing their reliance on paper prints, and while full‐color  
printing has become relatively widespread and affordable, some parties  
that use the signage drawings may still be using paper prints reproduced  
in black‐and‐white. The techniques outlined here don’t rely on color to  
distinguish sign locations and numbers, and therefore result in drawings  
that are readable when reproduced in either black‐and‐white or color.  
When it comes to size, because plans are typically generated at small  
scales, the sign locations often need to be indicated at a scale larger than  
that of the base plan in order to be visibly prominent. This alarms some  
clients, however, because they think that there’s too many signs or that  
the signs are going to be really large or that they’re too close together,  
so some explanation of the scale discrepancy may be necessary. There  
are projects where indicating the signs in scale on the plans is useful and  
necessary. In these cases, the base plans must be of adequate scale so  
the signs can be accurately indicated and seen in the same scale, which  
may result in several plan sheets with match lines for a given area.  
Another advance caveat\: The sign locations and numbers can crowd  
each other on some plans, so give some thought to arranging them in an  
orderly fashion. Another recommendation is to pull out the sign numbers  
beyond the plan footprint, to help keep the plan itself uncluttered and  
readable—but this, too, requires careful arrangement.  
As the information content system is developed and tracked in the  
DD phase, the design of the visual elements—the sign graphics and  
hardware—also progresses, as shown in Figures 2.21 through 2.25. 2.24  
2.25  
2.24 Design development phase\: Symbols and  
icons, in addition to typefaces, are selected,  
refined, and finalized.  
2.25 Design development phase\: Color and  
material samples are gathered and evaluated.  
Phase 3\: Design Development  
47 The Design Process  
48  
During DD, the EG designer begins to address the details of the graphic  
system and the hardware system, to solve the subproblems that lie in  
those details. The EG designer can use scale and full‐size models and  
mock‐ups, drawings—including 3D computer renderings—and even  
design prototypes to study and refine those all‐important details that  
contribute so much to the quality of the final sign objects. As the famed  
modernist architect Mies van der Rohe said, “God is in the details.”  
# Phase 3 Goals and Results  
The primary goal of the design development phase is to solidify and refine  
the conceptual direction selected at the end of phase 2, and to obtain  
client input and approval before proceeding into final documentation of  
the signage project.  
Phase 3 results in several items that convey the evolution of the  
informational and visual aspects of the design concept to the client. At the  
very least, these items include\:  
• Sign location plans in progress  
•  
• Message schedule in progress  
•  
• Drawings showing development of sign graphics  
•  
• Drawings showing development of sign hardware  
•  
Other items that may or may not be reviewed with the client include\:  
• Study and/or presentation models  
•  
• 3D computer renderings  
•  
• Full‐size mock‐ups  
•  
Depending on the project’s requirements, the EG designer may make a  
formal presentation during or at the end of phase 3, or may just submit a  
progress set of the location plans, message schedule, and design drawings  
for the client’s review. In either case, client input on the development  
of the sign program’s details is essential throughout the DD phase, and  
the EG designer should seek the client’s review and approval of the sign  
program’s development before proceeding into the documentation phase.  
# Phase 4\: Documentation  
The documentation phase, which is the final design‐centered phase  
of the design process, begins upon the client’s approval of the work  
accomplished in phase 3. Phase 4 continues the convergent activity  
of phase 3, honing in on detailed solutions and refinements to the  
subproblems of the sign program. The goal of the documentation phase is to convey the design intent of the  
sign program to sign fabricators for pricing and production. In other words,  
the EG designer works out all the details and ties up all the loose ends of  
the sign program’s design before it gets priced and built. The documents  
that work together to convey this design intent include\:  
• Sign location plans  
•  
• Message schedule  
•  
• Design drawings for the sign graphics and hardware  
•  
• Specifications  
•  
Note that work on most of these documents was started in the design  
development \(DD\) phase, and that the documentation phase is aimed at  
filling in and finalizing the information contained in these documents to  
provide fabricators with a complete picture of the sign program’s design.  
\(See Figure 2.26.\)  
Before the documentation phase begins, the EG designer and client  
should agree on the format for the signage design documents, if that  
discussion has not already taken place. This includes the final sheet  
sizes of all documents in the package, whether the signage package is a  
standalone or part of the document package for an overall construction  
project—which often happens when signage is part of new construction.  
It also includes the titleblock, whether the EGD firm’s own or that of  
2.26 Documentation phase\: Design refinements  
often continue into the documentation phase,  
as shown in these full‐size mock‐ups of pylons  
and an elevator bank identification sign, to study  
and finalize such items as size, readability, and  
lighting.  
Phase 4\: Documentation  
2.26  
49 The Design Process  
50  
another party, such as the project architect. Titleblocks appear on all  
drawings and contain general project and specific drawing information,  
such as drawing number, drawing title, date, scale, and so on.  
\(Remember\: If the project is overseas, paper sizes and proportions are  
different from those in the United States.\)  
As in phases 2 and 3, it’s important to focus on the sign program’s  
information content system in the early stages of the documentation  
phase. It’s time to nail down every last sign location and message  
because, inevitably, a few will still be left open from the DD phase. Only  
when the sign locations and messages are finalized can the details of  
the sign graphics and hardware be finalized, as resolution of these visual  
aspects of the program is contingent on the quantity, kind, and viewing  
conditions of the information displayed on the signs.  
# Finalizing Sign Types  
The documentation phase is also when sign types are finalized to  
address the few that may have still been in a state of flux during  
phase 3. Keep in mind that, at the very least, the sign type is keyed  
into the message schedule, and is perhaps part of the sign number  
keyed on both the message schedule and the location plans. In either  
case, sign type revisions are tedious because they must be tracked  
and updated in the schedule and perhaps the plans as well. That said,  
if sign typing was carefully considered during phase 3, the need  
to revise sign types during phase 4 should be minimal; but there’s  
always the possibility that the definition of a given sign type needs to  
be changed or that a type needs to be added or deleted for the final  
project documents.  
The sign message schedule is the master inventory list for the entire  
program, which is why it is updated and finalized during phase 4 with  
all changes, additions, and deletions to sign messages and sign types/  
numbers. Sign or location number, and perhaps type, changes must also  
be updated on the final sign location plans. Additionally, drawing reference  
numbers are entered into the message schedule as final drawings are  
generated for the sign graphics and hardware.  
This work is very tedious because each sign needs to have its own unique  
number and that number needs to be the same on both the sign location  
plans and the message schedule. The reason each sign needs its own  
number is because, with the exception of some repeating messages like  
women’s restroom wall plaques, each sign has its own location‐specific  
message, such as a room number plaque. Directional sign messages are  
even more location‐specific since destinations change along circulation  
paths. Thus, sign program message schedules are more complex  
than architectural door schedules because most signs in a program communicate a unique, location‐specific message. Software developers  
have at various times grappled with easing and automating this aspect of  
signage documentation, and some EG designers are successfully using  
such applications for this task.  
Just as the message schedule and location plans document the sign  
program’s information content, the design drawings document the visual  
aspects of the sign program. Often called working drawings or design  
intent drawings, these drawings convey the details intrinsic to the design  
of the sign graphics and hardware.  
# Deciding on Level of Detail in Drawings  
The eternal question on design drawings is how much detail needs  
to be conveyed in order to obtain clear apples‐to‐apples pricing from  
fabricators; thus, this is where the distinction between design intent and  
working drawings comes into play. It’s generally understood among EGD  
practitioners that design intent drawings contain just the amount of detail  
that’s required to convey the intent or outward appearance of the sign  
program’s design; in contrast, working drawings contain a higher level of  
detail, typically regarding how the signs could be built.  
It’s important to note that most EGD practitioners are typically trained  
in graphic design. Since they don’t have training in engineering or  
architecture, they are not qualified nor licensed to perform either of  
these services. Signs, particularly those that are large, electrified, or  
similarly complex, and their connections to adjacent surfaces need to  
be engineered. This is typically the responsibility of the sign fabricator,  
but some clients want signs to be engineered as part of the design  
documentation. In these cases, the EGD firm will need to engage the  
services of a licensed professional engineer.  
Along the continuum of design intent to working drawings detail, it’s  
impossible to decree the appropriate amount of detail for any given project,  
design firm, client, or perhaps most importantly, budget. Accordingly, this  
section focuses on the core or essential information that needs to be  
conveyed in the drawings for a sign program. \(See Figure 2.27.\)  
As noted earlier about sign location plans, the design drawings  
shouldn’t necessarily be prepared assuming that they’ll be reproduced  
in full color. In other words, it’s wise not to rely on the use of color to  
communicate important information. For example, if a sign background  
color is blue, it should be noted as such in writing on the drawing; if  
this is not so noted and the drawing is reproduced in black‐and‐white,  
there is no way to know that the sign background is blue. These  
annotations, which indicate colors, materials, finishes, and so on are  
referred to as callouts.

layouts and colors.  
The Design Process  
# Dimensioning and Scale  
Size is another essential piece of information that needs to be conveyed  
about each unit in a sign program, so all design drawings must be  
dimensioned. The extent of dimensioning depends on the complexity  
of a given sign type, but at the very least overall dimensions \(height,  
width, and depth\) should be indicated, as well as the dimensions of any  
components of the sign type. For example, the overall dimensions of a  
post‐and‐panel sign unit are indicated, along with dimensions for the post  
component and for the panel component. Dimensions indicating where  
signs are positioned relative to their surroundings are also important. For  
example, a typical wall plaque mounting elevation indicates dimensions  
for the plaque’s mounting height and distance from door openings.  
In addition to being dimensioned, all design drawings must be prepared  
at scales that can be measured with a scale ruler, typically an architectural  
scale ruler. \(See Figure 2.28.\) The smaller signs in a program can be drawn  
at full or half size, but larger signs have to be drawn at a smaller scale  
to fit on the drawing sheet. Again, all drawings must be at a measurable  
scale—that is, not reduced an arbitrary percentage to fit on the sheet. The  
scale of each drawing should be indicated in writing, and anything that is  
52 2.28 Documentation phase\: Scale rulers\: An  
Imperial architectural scale is shown in the  
foreground, a metric scale in the background.  
2.28  
not drawn to a measurable scale should be clearly indicated as N.T.S., for  
“not to scale.” CADtools, an Adobe Illustrator plug‐in, equips AI users to  
draw and dimension in measurable scales.  
The importance of measurably scaled, dimensioned design drawings  
cannot be overstated, particularly to graphic designers, who are not  
typically trained to work at scales less than actual size. Use of dimensions  
and measurable scales is the only clear, accurate way to convey the sizes  
of the various sign units within a program. And it’s important to point out  
that the metric system must be used for dimensioning and scaling on  
any project outside the United States. You’ll find the metric system, once  
mastered, to be much easier to use than the U.S. system.  
# Conveying Design Information  
In addition to providing dimensional information, the design drawings  
contain a package of information about the sign program’s visual aspects.  
\(See Figure 2.29.\) A checklist guide for the drawings package content  
includes\:  
• Listing of the graphics vocabulary, including the full fonts of all  
•  
typefaces, along with all symbols and arrows used  
• Summary of all colors, materials, and finishes used in the program  
•  
• Front, side, and top views of each sign type, with callouts  
•  
• Representations of the different graphic layouts for each sign type, with  
•  
callouts  
Phase 4\: Documentation

2.29 Documentation phase\: Working drawing

documents hardware system components  
of the monumental freestanding glass site

The Design Process  
• Mounting elevations, fixing signs in relation to architectural or site  
•  
features  
• Sign location plans, typically bound in with the design drawings  
•  
package  
Depending on the sign program’s design, more or less detailed  
information may be required than indicated on this checklist. For example,  
if a sign is a simple, flat, square wall plaque, top and side views may  
not be required, since the thickness of the plaque can be conveyed by  
a callout rather than dimensioned on a side or top view. Similarly, if that  
plaque is simply glued to the wall, that can be called out as a note rather  
than shown in a side or top view. However, in the case of a sign that’s  
more complex in form, say, with tapering or multileveled planes, all sides  
may need to be shown—front, back, top, right side, and left side, possibly  
even along with some sections through it. The drawing number of a sign  
type’s primary elevation—typically the front elevation, since it’s usually  
the most distinctive—is entered into the message schedule for each sign  
number. \(See Chapter 6, “The Hardware System,” for an explanation of  
these drawing views.\)  
54 The key to the drawings package is to include all the design information  
about the signs that will affect how they’re priced, how they’re built, and  
how they’re installed. The goal is to cover all the bases for all the unique  
conditions in the program; the trick is to do this without being unduly  
repetitive. For example, several elevations may be required to show the  
different mounting conditions for a given sign type at different locations,  
but a typical mounting elevation can be used for a condition that’s the  
same at many locations, such as wall plaques mounted next to doors. At  
this point, the drawing number for the mounting elevation corresponding  
to each sign number is entered into the message schedule.  
In the graphics drawings, the EG designer controls the appearance of the  
sign graphics for a wide range of message content. The graphics drawings  
should show each unique layout configuration for each sign type, since  
a given sign type may display several different kinds of informational  
content, with each requiring a different layout. Keep in mind that a given  
layout configuration can be used for any number of similar messages, so  
it’s inefficient to provide a layout for each and every sign message in a  
program, unless the sign program is very small. At this point, the drawing  
number for the graphic layout that corresponds to a given sign number’s  
message content is entered into the message schedule.  
# Distinguishing Between Drawings and Artwork  
It’s important to make the distinction here between drawings and  
artwork for sign graphics. The graphic layout drawings visually depict the  
graphic arrangement of various kinds of messages, but they are not the  
actual artwork for the final sign graphics. It’s more efficient for the sign  
fabricator, rather than the designer, to produce the final digital artwork for  
each individual sign unit in a program, so digital art production is typically  
the fabricator’s responsibility; but it’s the EG designer who controls the  
visual appearance of the artwork by providing graphic layout drawings.  
Since design firms use computers to produce their design documents,  
the content and nature of documents for the sign graphics have changed.  
In the precomputer era, it was typical to highly dimension the graphics  
drawings, because they served as layout grids that the sign fabricator  
used to produce and assemble the final artwork for each sign’s graphics.  
But now that design firms produce their layout drawings as computer  
files, it’s become common for the designer to provide those files as  
templates for the fabricator to use in producing the final art.  
And that brings up another important distinction\: between template files  
and artwork files. Think of a template as a digital grid, which has typical  
graphic elements in their specified size\(s\) and arrangement, into which  
new messages are input to create individual artwork files for each unique  
sign message. Template files have active, editable fonts so the fabricator  
Phase 4\: Documentation  
55 The Design Process  
56  
can input the various messages specified for a given layout template to  
create the final digital artwork file for each sign. Again, sometimes the EG  
designer will produce individual artwork files for a very small sign program  
or for a relatively small collection of signs within a larger program.  
Once the messages have been input into the artwork files, the fonts  
are typically converted to paths or outlines, which renders the fonts  
uneditable \(i.e., deactivated\) in the final artwork files, to avoid font  
conflicts with computerized cutting equipment in the fabricator’s shop. At  
this point, the fonts become mere geometric vector files in the shapes of  
letterforms. But messages can’t be edited in files with deactivated fonts,  
so it’s important for the EG designer to maintain the source files with  
editable, active fonts in case artwork for additional or revised messages  
needs to be produced. \(Chapter 5, “The Graphic System,” has more on  
graphic layouts.\)  
# Compiling Technical Specifications  
Specifications serve as an adjunct to the design drawings, communicating  
verbally what the drawings can’t communicate visually. As such, the  
specifications, or specs, can be thought of as the instructions to the sign  
fabricator. As with the design drawings, the appropriate level of detail and  
formality of the specifications varies with each project.  
An entire book could be written about specifications—indeed, there are  
professional spec writers, who occasionally become involved with signage  
projects—so the purpose of this section is to provide only a general  
overview of specifications relating to signage.  
As mentioned, signage fabrication is part of the construction industry,  
and the signage specs become part of the fabrication contract,  
which is typically let by construction industry professionals such as  
general contractors \(GCs\) or construction managers \(CMs\). The actual  
fabrication contract is a legal document that consists of many more  
general contractual items than the signage specs, including terms and  
conditions \(often referred to as boilerplate or up‐front conditions\), bonding  
requirements, and others; thus, the specs that are concerned solely with  
the product to be constructed—that is, signage—are termed the technical  
portion of the specs.  
The extent and formality of signage technical specs is dependent on  
the size and circumstances of each project. On smaller projects, the  
specs can effectively be incorporated into the design drawings. On larger  
projects, particularly those for large government or institutional clients,  
the EG designer may be required to provide highly detailed, formalized  
specs conforming to the MasterFormat® established by the Construction  
Specifications Institute \(CSI\). CSI format specs are in the form of a letter‐sized document independent from the drawings. \(More information  
about CSI format can be found at www.csinet.org.\)  
Most signage specifications fall somewhere between drawing notes  
and CSI’s MasterFormat® in detail and formality. Often the signage  
specs are wordy enough that they’re easier to produce as a letter‐sized  
word processing document than put on the drawings. \(See Figure 2.30.\)  
And even if the client doesn’t demand strict CSI language, the EG  
designers should not be surprised if they are told to label the signage  
technical specs as “Section 10 14 00,” which is the section of the CSI  
MasterFormat® devoted to “Signage.” Note that the 2012 MasterFormat®  
has further subcategories, such as “10 14 16, Plaques” under the Signage  
section. Nor should the EG designer be surprised to see the signage  
2.30 Documentation phase\: Technical  
specifications for a typical signage project.  
Phase 4\: Documentation  
2.30  
57 The Design Process  
58  
specs bound into a huge, comprehensive specification document for an  
overall construction project.  
Two other important tips about the detail and formality of the technical specs\:  
• Unless all the specs are treated as drawing notes, there should be as  
•  
little redundancy as possible between any drawing notes and the letter‐  
sized spec document. There will always be some redundancy between  
the two, but it’s time‐consuming to indicate a spec twice, or to need to  
change a spec in two places rather than one.  
• In the interest of clarity and brevity, spec language should be as  
•  
definitive and concise as possible. Specs are definitely not a creative  
writing exercise! Typically, sentences are formulated in a somewhat  
brusque, instructional form, such as, “Use stainless steel fasteners for  
all sign attachments,” and use the biblical‐sounding verb shall, as in “All  
signs shall be attached with stainless steel fasteners.” Words such as  
must, should, and even will are considered too indeterminate in intent  
for spec language.  
Regardless of the level of detail or formality required, on one level or  
another, the technical specs for signage should cover at least the following\:  
• Quality assurance  
•  
• Required submittals  
•  
• Quality/workmanship standards  
•  
• Materials and products  
•  
• Fabrication and graphic application techniques  
•  
• Installation and cleanup  
•  
Quality assurance specifies the qualifications fabricators must provide to  
assure they’re capable of performing the work required by the design.  
This is very important on projects that go out to publicly advertised  
bidding, as such projects often draw bids from unqualified fabricators.  
Qualifications requested may include length of time in business, photos  
and descriptions of similar projects in scope and cost, list of designer  
references, square footage of fabrication shop, list of shop equipment and  
personnel, percentage of work to be subcontracted, and the like. Some  
EGD firms require that, along with their bid, bidders submit a sample  
representing the quality and complexity required by the project at hand.  
Required submittals indicate which drawings, samples, and other items  
fabricators are to submit for design review as they produce the project.  
Submittals required for signage typically include shop drawings, artwork  
for all sign graphics, material/color/finish samples, product literature, and  
production prototypes. Quality/workmanship standards describe general standards for the quality  
of work to be performed by the fabricator, such as tolerances, accurate  
fitting of parts, use of nondefective materials and components, production  
and finish standards, and more.  
Materials and products specs indicate specific materials and products the  
fabricator is to use to produce the project, such as metals \(e.g., stainless  
steel, aluminum, etc., plus specific alloy if necessary for the appearance  
or integrity of the design\), plastics, paints, stock sign components,  
electronic displays, and so on. If a specific material or product essential  
to the design of the project is only available from one manufacturer, the  
material/product name should be specified, along with the manufacturer’s  
name and contact information. Such proprietary specs are sometimes  
frowned upon by clients, necessitating addition of the term “or approved  
equal” in the proprietary spec.  
Fabrication and graphic application techniques specify the techniques the  
fabricator is to use in producing the sign hardware and graphics, such as  
how parts are to be attached to each other, seamless or seamed assemblies,  
types of finishes and coatings, how graphics are applied, and others.  
Installation and cleanup indicates how the fabricator is to install the  
signs and clean up after installation, such as coordinating sign installation  
locations with other trades or parties, installing signs level and plumb,  
restoring any adjacent areas damaged by sign installation, removal of  
fingerprints and dirt from installed signs, and the like.  
# Phase 4 Goals and Results  
The primary goal of the documentation phase is to tie up all the loose  
ends of the sign program’s design, and clearly communicate the  
program’s design intent to sign fabricators, who will be bidding on and  
then producing the sign program. It’s the last design‐intensive phase of  
the design process before the design is handed off to the producer. As  
such, it’s the last chance to finalize all outstanding detail, approval, and  
coordination issues, to avoid unpleasant—and, often, costly—surprises  
during the postdesign bidding and fabrication phases.  
Phase 4 results in several documents that convey the final design intent to  
the client and other parties involved in procuring fabrication of the program\:  
• Final sign location plans  
•  
• Final message schedule  
•  
• Final sign graphics drawings  
•  
• Final sign hardware drawings  
•  
• Technical specifications

59 The Design Process  
60  
The EG designer wouldn’t have progressed to phase 4 without client  
approval of big‐picture presentations of the program’s design in phases  
2 and 3; therefore formal design presentations are rare during the  
documentation phase. Designer‐client interaction during phase 4 is usually  
more in the form of coordination meetings and document review to  
resolve all the details of the program, culminating in the client’s approval  
to release the design documents for the bidding phase. Coordination  
between the designer and the client’s contracting representative should  
also occur during phase 4 to prepare for the bidding phase.  
# Phase 5\: Bidding \(Postdesign\)  
Finally, the project has been appropriately documented and the design  
work is done, for all intents and purposes. Bidding is the first of three  
postdesign phases in the overall design process, and it’s the phase in  
which official, binding prices are competitively obtained for the sign  
fabrication contract, and a bidder is selected for the contract. As with  
previous phases, the formality of the bidding phase depends on the  
project at hand. On projects outside of the U.S. the bidding phase is  
sometimes referred to as the tendering phase.  
Remember, EG designers very rarely procure sign fabrication services  
because they don’t have the hefty financial or legal resources needed to  
enter into a construction industry contract. Rather, the sign fabrication  
contract is let by an outside entity who represents the client, such as a GC,  
CM, or a government or corporate procurement department; therefore, the  
EG designer’s role during the bidding phase can be described as advisory.  
After the designer releases the document package to the client’s contract  
representative, it’s that representative’s responsibility to compile and  
assemble the overall bid document package, issue the documents for  
bidding, administer the bid process, evaluate the bids, and award the  
fabrication contract. Unfortunately, contract reps sometimes leave the  
EG designer out of the bidding loop. This is a mistake for two reasons.  
First, the project design firm can provide valuable technical assistance on  
signage‐specific issues during the bidding phase; second, many contract  
reps don’t have experience with signage packages.  
Bid phase items on which the design firm can advise the contract rep  
include\:  
• Bidder qualification  
•  
• Bid form development  
•  
• Invitation to bid  
•  
• Responses to information requests, including prebid meeting• Developing Better Bid Documents  
# Mark Andreasson  
The quality and pertinence of the information  
included in your bid documents is the key to a good  
and fair result. From the fabricators’ perspective,  
there is some essential information that will help  
them to determine whether they should pursue the  
project in the first place.  
# The Basics  
Assembled bid documents should include  
information on the following basic items\:  
• What date is the bid due?  
•  
• Is a prebid meeting required? If so, has it been  
•  
scheduled?  
• What is the anticipated project schedule? When  
•  
would work be awarded and what is the project  
completion date?  
• Is it a public or private bid?  
•  
• Are there any special contract requirements  
•  
such as tax exemption, bonding requirements,  
union labor, off‐hours work, Minority and  
Women’s Business Enterprise \(MBE/WBE\)  
requirements, or owner‐controlled insurance  
programs \(OCIP\)?  
# The Bid Form  
A standardized bid form provides better control of  
the pricing information that comes back and aids  
setup of a precise comparative analysis between  
bidders. At a minimum, the form should include  
these items\:  
• A list of the quantities, by sign type.  
•  
• Space for itemized sign type cost and installation  
•  
cost, on a unit‐times‐quantity basis.  
• Individual line items for taxes, bonds, permits,  
•  
or any other special considerations, including  
alternates.  
• Space to list any general expenses that would  
•  
be part of the project costs, regardless of how  
the quantities may fluctuate—for example\:  
management costs, shop drawings, shipping,  
travel expenses, and equipment.  
# The Documents  
Specifications  
The written specifications should include a clear  
description of the scope of work. This may include  
identifying the party responsible for excavation  
and foundation work, bringing electrical service to  
the site, electrical tie‐in, removal of existing signs,  
layout of artwork or maps, permit procurement,  
and so on. Specifications will also encompass  
vendors and material and process information  
pertaining to metal alloys, coatings, surface  
finishes, illumination, adhesives, and the like. Bear  
in mind that the less control you, as a designer, will  
have over the final decision about which fabricator  
will be awarded the work, the more thorough  
you should be while preparing specifications and  
drawings.  
Sign Location Plans  
Sign location plans may not be an essential  
element at the time of bid; nevertheless, they  
will help the fabricator understand the site, and  
thus should be included—if they are accurate. In  
combination with the message schedule and the  
bid form, this gives the fabricator the opportunity  
to cross‐check quantities between the three  
documents.  
Message Schedule  
The message schedule is an essential tool for the  
fabricator to reference while preparing pricing.  
Some of the information contained will tell the  
fabricator whether a sign has one or more sides  
with graphics, or how many lines of text it has.  
Phase 5\: Bidding \(Postdesign\)  
61 The Design Process  
62  
Developing Better Bid Documents continued  
Signs that contain individual dimensional letters  
are usually priced by the letter, so an estimator will  
need to count each letter in the various messages.  
The message schedule should also contain a  
location number that will, in turn, reference the  
location plan. There are software programs available  
that will link all this information so that an update  
in any one document will be captured in all of the  
relevant documents.  
The Drawings  
The drawings comprise the primary tool used to  
communicate the form and spatial relationships  
among the sign program elements. The more  
information that can be conveyed through  
the drawings, the better. The fabricator will be  
examining the drawings primarily to identify  
information that has a cost impact—such as  
color breaks, material thicknesses, relationships  
between parts, dimensions, face and edge finishes,  
fasteners, graphic applications, for example,  
silk‐screen, vinyl, digital printing—so every effort  
should be made to include this level of detail.  
Context information communicated in the  
drawings is also very helpful—how each sign  
element is intended to interface with the  
architecture or landscape. Exploded views and  
perspective drawings are incredibly useful  
to an estimator, making it possible to quickly  
understand a design. Moreover, these will help  
you as a designer, to identify spatial or dimensional  
problems that may not be obvious in a typical  
front/top/side view.  
As a designer, the most valuable skill you can  
develop is a thorough understanding of the  
materials, technologies, and processes involved  
with the sign fabrication arts. This is the medium  
in which you work, and the better you understand  
the materials and the way things go together, the  
more design options you will have at your disposal.  
In this way, you become more valuable to both your  
employer and to your clients.

# Bidder Qualification  
Signs are some of the most highly scrutinized objects in the built  
environment, making bidder qualification a very important step in  
the design process. Simply put, an inexperienced or poorly equipped  
fabricator can destroy a sign program’s design value and create  
enormous headaches for the entire project team. Also, many owner  
reps, while perhaps experienced in general procurement management  
or in heavy construction trades, lack the means to assess the  
capabilities of sign fabricators to successfully execute the type of  
signage project at hand. While the owner’s rep has the experience  
to assess the financial condition of potential signage bidders, the  
EG designer has the experience to assess their technical production  
capabilities. When possible, to achieve a high level of quality control, it’s best to have  
bidders’ qualifications reviewed before bids are solicited; the project  
then goes out for bids from a preselected group of quality‐screened  
bidders. Many publicly funded projects, however, require open bidding  
without regard to prequalification. In such public‐funding scenarios,  
the qualification requirements of the technical signage specs become  
essential for eliminating unqualified fabricators that have submitted bids.  
The designer’s role in the qualification process may be as simple as  
providing a list of sign fabricators with whom the designer has previously  
worked as potential bidders for the project, usually a minimum of three.  
Or bidder qualification may entail much more work on the designer’s  
part, such as reviewing qualification literature and information provided  
by potential bidders, visiting their shop facilities, conducting interviews  
with them, and contacting their references to assess past performance  
on similar projects. In either case, the designer should have no affiliations  
with, nor imply performance guarantees for, any recommended or  
reviewed fabricator.  
# Bid Form Development  
Bid forms provide a standardized means for all bidders to submit their  
bids, easing the task of bid comparison and analysis. The EG designer  
can advise the contract rep on how to devise the bid form for the  
project, or can provide the bid form to the contract rep. At C&VE, we  
favor unit pricing for bid forms, since unit prices provide much more  
information for bid comparison than a single lump sum for the entire  
fabrication contract.  
At their most basic, unit price bid forms are itemized by the unit price for  
each sign type times the quantity of each sign type, yielding a total price  
for each sign type and a grand‐total, bottom‐line price. Of course, there  
are many variations. Client reps may want any of the following\:  
• The fabrication and installation costs quoted together on a unit basis for  
•  
each sign type  
• Fabrication and installation costs quoted separately on a unit basis  
•  
• Fabrication quoted only on a unit basis, with installation quoted as a  
•  
lump sum  
• Costs quoted with sales tax included in unit prices  
•  
• Costs quoted with sales tax as a lump sum  
•  
It may be helpful to include quantities for each sign type on the bid  
form, but with the caveat that each bidder is responsible for verifying  
all quantities.  
Phase 5\: Bidding \(Postdesign\)  
63 The Design Process  
64  
# Invitation to Bid  
The invitation to bid provides specific information to bidders on preparing  
and submitting their bids. This information can include when and where  
a prebid conference is held and whether attendance is mandatory,  
when and where to submit bids, contact information for the contract  
representative, brief scope of work, bid guarantee period, work  
completion dates, and any other information that may be pertinent to  
bidding the project.  
# Responses to Information Requests  
Responses to information requests are just that. Bidders sometimes  
have questions or need clarifications about the design documents—  
although generally not too many if the EG designer produced a  
thorough document package. These questions can come up in a prebid  
conference, where the EG designer is present to respond, or in the form  
of official requests for information \(RFIs\). Bidders are typically required  
to send an RFI to the owner’s representative, who in turn routes the  
RFI to the EG designer, often via the project architect, if one is involved.  
The designer then responds via the same channels, usually within a  
requested time period.  
A word about protocol during the bidding phase\: To ensure a fair bidding  
process, all bidders should have equal access to the same information.  
Accordingly, unless otherwise arranged, the designer should avoid  
responding directly to any given bidder’s questions and route all  
communication with bidders through the contract rep.  
# Bid Review  
Bid review involves the analysis of the bids submitted by fabricators.  
The client’s rep will usually organize the numerical bid results in some  
form, such as a table, and the designer should review this information for  
discrepancies or red flags among the field of bids, such as an unusually  
high or low unit price for a given sign type, or a wide spread between the  
lowest and highest bids. The designer should advise the contract rep of  
such anomalies and have the rep request clarification.  
# Contract Award Recommendation  
The contract award recommendation is typically a joint decision  
involving the contract rep, the client, and the designer. Depending on  
the project, factors other than price may play a role in the contract  
award decision. These factors can include the bidders’ conformance  
with the formal contractual requirements, qualifications, understanding  
and responsiveness to the project at hand, financial status, as well as  
others. Phase 5 Goals and Results  
The main goal of the bidding phase is for the client’s contract rep to  
award a contract to a fabricator qualified to produce the sign program at  
a competitive price. This process involves the contract rep’s solicitation,  
administration, and review of bids, with the EG designer performing an  
advisory role to the rep and client.  
Depending on the project, phase 5 can result in the designer providing or  
advising on certain documents for the bidding process, such as the bid  
form, invitation to bid, and responses to information requests.  
During phase 5, the designer should also be involved in reviewing the  
bids received by the contract rep and in contract award decision making.  
Additionally, the designer should attend the prebid conference and be  
involved in reviewing the qualifications and capabilities of the bidders.  
Even though the designer’s role is advisory during phase 5, all parties—  
including the designer—should feel confident that the selected bidder is  
capable of fabricating the sign program to the highest‐quality standards at  
the lowest possible price. This sense of confidence is the most important  
result of phase 5.  
# Phase 6\: Fabrication/Installation  
# Observation  
In this second postdesign phase of the design process, the client’s  
contract rep has contracted with a qualified sign fabricator to produce  
the sign program, and the EG designer’s creative solution to the signage  
problem is physically embodied. This is the exciting moment of truth for  
the designer, when all the planning, vision, and hard work literally take  
form.  
In the fabrication/installation observation phase \(subsequently referred  
to here as “observation”\), the designer reviews the fabricator’s work and  
progress for technical conformance with the design intent, while the  
contract rep administers the overall mechanics of the contract such as  
payment schedules, time schedules, coordination of signage with other  
trades, routing of project communications, and so forth.  
In the architectural profession, this phase of the design process is often  
termed construction administration \(CA\) or, simply, construction phase  
services. Note that the use of the word administration is somewhat  
misleading, because the overall administration of the contract, including  
payment of subcontractors such as sign fabricators, is primarily the  
responsibility of the client’s contract rep, not the architect. The EG  
Phase 6\: Fabrication/Installation Observation  
65 The Design Process  
66  
designer’s role during this phase is similar to the architect’s during the  
construction phase\: observing and reviewing the fabricator’s work, and  
advising the contract rep on its quality and progress in relation to the  
design intent. Thus, the designer’s role is of an advisory rather than an  
administrative nature \(which is why this book uses the term observation  
rather than construction administration\). That said, the EG designer’s role  
during this phase should, however, be much more active than that of a  
passive, disinterested observer.  
Activities in which the EG designer should be involved during the  
observation phase include\:  
• Coordination meetings  
•  
• Submittal review  
•  
• Shop visits  
•  
• Site visits  
•  
• Postinstallation punch list inspection  
•  
Although some clients, in an attempt to reduce design fees, request little  
or no designer involvement during the observation phase, it’s important  
to note that the designer’s involvement is a key quality control measure  
during sign fabrication. EG designers are far more experienced with the  
details that comprise a signage program, and they have the greatest  
expertise of anyone on the project team to review and assess the  
fabricator’s fidelity in executing the design intent. Certainly, the designer’s  
involvement may be limited in some of the activities listed, to reduce  
design fees, but at the very least the EG designer should review all of the  
fabricator’s submittals, which include shop drawings and samples, during  
phase 6.  
# Coordination Meetings  
Coordination meetings are important tools during the observation  
phase, starting with a fabrication kickoff meeting at the beginning  
of the phase, which the client’s contract rep, the fabricator, and  
the designer attend, along with any other interested project team  
members, such as the client or project architect. The kickoff  
meeting helps set the stage for an efficient observation phase,  
covering such items as the expectations and responsibilities of all  
parties, identification of any potential problem areas, identification  
of coordination points and processes, definition of project  
communications protocol, and so on.  
After the kickoff meeting, periodic coordination meetings are necessary as  
sign fabrication progresses, and the designer’s involvement with them can  
vary with the project at hand. In addition to face‐to‐face meetings, other 2.31  
tools can be used for project coordination, such as web conferencing,  
teleconferencing, e‐mail, an FTP site, or dedicated project collaboration  
websites.  
# Submittal Review  
Submittal review is the key role for the EG designer during phase 6. As  
noted in the discussion of phase 4, submittals are items the fabricator  
prepares to indicate how the sign program will be fabricated, and these  
items are submitted for the designer’s review and approval. Submittals  
required for signage typically include shop drawings, artwork for all sign  
graphics, material/color/finish samples, product literature, and production  
prototypes. \(See Figures 2.31 and 2.32.\)  
Each kind of submittal provides a different piece of information about the  
sign program’s fabrication.  
• Shop drawings indicate how the fabricator will construct and install  
•  
the signs.  
2.31 Observation phase\: Shop drawings  
indicate how the sign fabricator intends to build

Phase 6\: Fabrication/Installation Observation  
67 2.32  
2.32 Observation phase\: Shop drawing marked  
up with designer’s review comments.  
The Design Process  
• Artwork shows the size and layout of graphics for each unique  
•  
message/sign type combination within the sign program.  
• Material/color/finish samples show the actual materials, colors, and  
•  
finishes the fabricator will be using on the signs.  
• Product literature provides information and specifications on signage  
•  
components, such as lighting fixtures or digital display units, which the  
fabricator purchases from outside manufacturers.  
• Production prototypes are, effectively, samples of the actual,  
•  
completely fabricated and assembled signs, with one prototype  
typically provided for each sign type. Obviously, production  
prototypes are usually submitted after all the other submittals have  
been approved, giving the fabricator the green light for actually  
producing the signs on a trial basis. Approved production prototypes  
then become the quality standard for the remaining production run,  
and may also be part of the total sign product the fabricator delivers  
and installs.  
68 2.33  
2.34  
Submittal review is a checkpoint process that facilitates coordination  
and helps catch mistakes, inaccuracies, and defects, and resolves  
misunderstandings before the sign program is built. It’s in the best  
interest of every fabricator to provide meaningful, complete submittals for  
design approval, because approved submittals indicate that the fabricator  
is on the right track in interpreting the design intent of the sign program,  
thereby minimizing the chances of design rejection after the entire  
program is fabricated.  
Most kinds of submittals are sent to the EG designer’s office for review  
via a routing protocol set up for the project. The one exception may be  
production prototypes, as the prototypes for some sign types may be far  
too large to transport to the designer’s office. Prototypes for smaller‐sized  
sign types, however, can be reviewed in the designer’s office. Fabricators  
are increasingly using digital photos and videos taken in their shop to  
show fabrication details and progress, but since photos don’t show  
everything, they should be considered adjuncts to—not substitutes for—  
physical prototypes. \(See Figures 2.33 through 2.37.\)  
The formality of the submittal review process varies from project to  
project, as does the protocol for routing the submittals. The key is to  
keep all interested parties in the loop so they’re aware of all comments  
and approvals on all submittals. For this reason, it’s best for the fabricator

70 to issue all submittals to the contract rep, who in turn routes them to  
the proper parties for review. The routing order is reversed after the  
submittals are reviewed. Although such protocols can be cumbersome,  
they are vital, as they help prevent mistakes and misunderstandings by  
ensuring that all project communication is transparent and that all key  
players are aware of the status of the submittals. It is definitely bad form  
for the designer to discuss submittals directly with the fabricator without  
inclusion of the client’s contract rep and/or architect—although in certain  
cases the contract rep and/or architect will authorize such direct contact.  
Even when the design document package for a program is very thorough,  
many of the infinite details of the sign program are worked out during the  
observation phase. As such, sign fabrication is a give‐and‐take process  
that requires mutual respect between the designer and fabricator,  
assuming the fabricator is properly qualified. The two must work together  
to ensure that the design intent is executed as faithfully as possible, and  
that requires reasonableness—and, sometimes, compromise—on both  
sides regarding submittals.  
The fabricator shouldn’t try to “pull any fast ones”—for example, trying to  
convince the designer that substandard workmanship is within acceptable  
industry standards. The fabricator should also prepare meaningful shop  
drawings, which provide an accurate picture as to how the signs will  
actually be produced with that fabricator’s equipment, shop practices, and  
personnel, rather than an unconsidered rehash of the design drawings.  
This is now more important than ever, since technology has made it easier  
for some fabricators to try to pass off design drawing rehashes as shop  
drawings. Conversely, the designer shouldn’t be unreasonably fussy—  
for example, objecting to fabrication details that don’t compromise the  
appearance or functionality of the design intent.  
That said, the designer should review submittals very carefully, for  
once a submittal is approved it is considered an acceptable standard  
for fulfillment of the fabrication contract. In most cases, submittals  
are stamped or tagged with a review stamp that has check boxes  
for indicating the submittal’s approval status. Typically, these boxes  
are labeled in a range from Approved \(outright approval\) to Approved  
as Noted \(conditional approval\) to Revise and Resubmit to Rejected.  
Note that some EGD and architectural offices avoid the use of the  
word Approved on their stamps because it may imply the designer’s  
guarantee of the fabricator’s performance; in such cases, a less  
definitive word, such as Reviewed or Accepted, may be used.  
Depending on project protocol, the review stamp may belong to the  
EGD office or to another firm on the project team, such as the architect,  
or the review stamps of both may be used. In addition to the status  
check boxes, the review stamp typically contains a disclaimer of the  
Phase 6\: Fabrication/Installation Observation  
71 The Design Process  
72  
reviewer’s responsibility, along with spaces for the reviewer’s signature  
and review date.  
The review stamp status is accompanied by any applicable review  
comments written on the submittal. On paper submittals, such as shop  
drawings and graphics artwork, the drawings are typically marked up with  
review comments in red pencil—hence the terms markups and red lines  
for reviewed drawings. On some projects, other project team members,  
such as the architect, will mark up the drawings with comments  
additional to those of the EG designer. It is becoming more common  
for EG designers and architects to “mark up” electronic versions of the  
drawings rather than paper prints, by using Adobe Acrobat Pro or a project  
collaboration application. Figure 2.32 shows a marked up shop drawing.  
It’s rare for all the various submittals on a signage program, particularly  
shop drawings and graphics artwork, to be accepted, outright or  
conditionally, on the first round. It’s often a process of revise and resubmit  
based on the design review comments, or, less commonly, outright  
rejection, when a submittal is so off‐base that it doesn’t even warrant  
the EG designer’s time and consideration. The key is that the fabricator  
is required to resubmit, in a timely manner, each submittal item until it is  
accepted. As such, the resubmittal process can become a war of the wills,  
which requires judiciousness—and, sometimes, compromise—on behalf  
of both designer and fabricator.  
# Shop Visits  
Shop visits are performed during the course of fabrication to observe the  
quality and progress of sign production in the fabricator’s shop. The need  
for and number of shop visits varies with each sign program. Smaller,  
relatively simple programs, with just a few sign types that are physically  
small in size, may not require shop visits since production prototypes can  
be sent to the designer for review. Larger, more complex programs, with  
many sign types that are too large in size to transport to the designer,  
may require several shop visits. The use of digital photos and videos to  
indicate shop details and progress can help reduce the number of shop  
visits. \(See Figures 2.38 and 2.39.\)  
When shop visits are warranted, they are conducted by the EG designer,  
often accompanied by the contract rep and/or the client. The purpose of the  
first shop visit is typically to review production prototypes, although on some  
larger projects the first shop visit may be devoted to project coordination and  
review of other kinds of submittals. The need for additional shop visits varies  
with each project, but if only one shop visit is covered in the design budget,  
it’s most effectively allocated to production prototype review, during which  
the designer can discuss any design or fabrication issues directly with the  
shop‐floor personnel involved in building the prototypes. 2.38 Observation phase\: Steel molds were  
constructed for production of the monumental  
cast glass letters  
2.39 cast.  
Observation phase\: One of the  
monumental site identification letters being  
2.38 2.39  
The observations and conclusions of shop visits are documented in a  
memo or the meeting minutes, often with digital photos incorporated,  
which can be recorded by the EG designer, the contract rep, or the  
fabricator. In projects where the records of shop visit\(s\) are produced by  
others, the designer should review them for accuracy and completeness  
before they are distributed to the project team.  
# Site Visits  
Site visits are typically concerned with coordinating sign installation, such  
as verifying sign locations and mounting heights, and coordination of sign  
installation details with the adjacent site conditions. As with shop visits,  
Phase 6\: Fabrication/Installation Observation  
73 the need for and number of site visits varies with the sign program’s  
size and complexity. Site visit participants can include the EG designer,  
contract rep, client, and other members of the project team, such as the  
architect. Digital photos of specific sign location conditions can be sent  
to the project team to coordinate installation with fewer team members  
needed at the site. The observations and conclusions of site visits are  
documented similarly to shop visits.  
# Postinstallation Punch List Inspections  
Postinstallation punch list inspections are also site visits, but now the  
EG designer and/or contract rep walks the project site to inspect the  
signs after they’ve been installed, and enters any defects onto what is

termed a punch list—which is why this inspection process is also called  
punching out. On projects outside of the U.S. a punch list is sometimes  
referred to as a defects list. On some projects, the fabricator may  
accompany the punch lister\(s\) for at least part of the inspection. \(See  
Figures 2.40 through 2.42.\) Note that the term defects, as used here,  
includes not only fabrication defects but a whole host of other problems  
such as missing signs, signs damaged in shipping, signs mounted  
crooked or in wrong locations, sign installation damage to adjacent  
construction, and others.  
The message schedule, which already exists as a complete itemized  
inventory of every sign in the program, can be readily adapted for punch  
list comments, including the insertion of digital photos of problematic  
signs. The contract rep forwards the completed punch list, often  
accompanied by a memo summarizing general comments, to the  
fabricator to make any necessary corrections to the defective signs.  
On a large signage program, the punch list inspection can be very  
time‐consuming—and exhausting—so it’s important to point out that  
the design budget may not accommodate the EG designer performing  
an exhaustive inspection of each and every sign. In some cases, the  
design budget may not accommodate any onsite inspection by the EG  
designer.  
There are, fortunately, some ways to adhere to the design budget in such  
instances. For one, the designer could inspect all of the signs that receive

The Design Process  
the most public scrutiny and just spot‐check the less noticeable signs.  
Or the designer and the contract rep or client can spend a day together  
spot‐checking each sign type, with the designer pointing out what to look  
for and then handing off the inspection of all the remaining signs to the  
contract rep or client.  
Digital photos that show the completed signs as installed are helpful  
and can actually be proof of work done for payment. Site visits may  
not be possible on projects with limited design budgets, so photos  
may be the only way to ascertain how well the fabrication and  
installation was done.  
As with submittal review, the punch list inspection requires  
reasonableness and, sometimes, compromise. The punch lister needs  
to know where to draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable  
products, so the punch list can become an instrument of negotiation.  
There’s also the thorny issue of signs that have been damaged by other  
trades after the signs were installed but before they were punched out.  
For this reason, the sign program should be punched out as soon as  
possible after installation.  
After the fabricator has taken action to remedy any defects, the corrected  
signs should be punched out in a follow‐up inspection. This inspection is  
best performed by the designer, but can also be handled by the contract  
rep or client, if necessary, aided by digital photos sent to the designer.  
After all the work is completed to everyone’s satisfaction, the contract rep  
arranges the final payment to the fabricator, and the new sign program is  
76 up and running! It’s time for congratulations, handshakes, and professional  
photography to document the final product of the signage design process.  
# Phase 6 Goals and Results  
The main goal of the observation phase is to observe and review the  
fabrication and installation of the sign program. It is the contract rep  
who handles the general administration of the fabrication contract,  
with the EG designer taking on the dual roles of advisor and facilitator  
on the technical issues relating to the fabricator’s fulfillment of the  
design intent.  
Phase 6 should result in the EG designer participating in activities that  
provide review checkpoints for the sign fabricator’s quality, progress,  
and fulfillment of the design intent. These activities include coordination  
meetings, submittal review, shop visits, site visits, and post installation  
punch list inspections.  
At the very least, the designer should be thoroughly engaged in submittal  
review and approval, providing review comments and acceptance status  
marked up on the submittals. The designer’s involvement is also key to  
more effective coordination meetings, shop and site visits, and punch list  
inspections. Depending on the project, the designer may also be involved  
in providing coordination memos and meeting notes.  
# Phase 7\: Postinstallation Evaluation  
The signage program solution that took so long to evolve, to become  
reality, has been built and installed and is, everyone hopes, a huge  
success. It might seem, then, that the design process has been  
concluded in the observation phase and that it’s time to move on to  
another project. Not so fast. Whether formally or informally, paid for by the  
client or not, every design solution should be evaluated.  
In phase 7, the EG designer evaluates the effectiveness and  
functionality of the operational signage program. The major goal  
of evaluation is to learn which aspects of the signage program are  
successful and which aspects, if any, could use improvement. The  
results of the evaluation phase of a given sign program can be applied  
to both the program at hand and to other programs the EG designer  
develops in the future.  
It should go without saying that, in fact, evaluation takes place throughout  
the design process, as various solutions and processes are explored,  
considered, presented, and either selected or rejected. But only after  
installation can the sign program as a whole be evaluated in its real‐world  
environment.  
Phase 7\: Postinstallation Evaluation  
77 The Design Process  
78  
Most often, evaluation takes place informally and without the direct  
involvement of, or compensation to, the designer. So how can the  
designer obtain evaluation input? The two most basic ways are  
through client feedback and direct observation. After living with the  
operational sign program—and people’s responses to it—for a while,  
the client gains insights into the program’s strengths and \(ideally,  
few\) weaknesses. Accordingly, it’s useful to contact the client a few  
months after the sign program is installed to request the client’s  
assessment of the program’s effectiveness. At this point, the client  
may commission the designer to develop any additional signage or  
make any modifications to the in‐place signage that may be needed to  
fine‐tune the program.  
The designer can also visit the project site and directly observe how  
people interact with the sign program and how the program fits with  
its environment. This approach may also include interviews with site  
staffers who interact with the site’s users. The depth and formality of  
the direct observation approach tend to depend on the geographical  
distance between the project site and the design office and on  
whether or not the designer is being compensated by the client for  
assessing the project.  
# Phase 7 Goals and Results  
The primary goal of the evaluation phase is for the EG designer to learn  
how effectively the sign program solution functions in its operational  
environment. Phase 7 results in insights and findings that can be applied  
to the sign program being evaluated, as well as to other sign programs  
developed by the designer.  
As noted, the designer may or may not be compensated for performing  
an evaluation of the sign program, and this tends to determine the depth  
and formality of the assessment. In either case, client feedback and  
direct observation are helpful evaluation tools. If the designer is being  
compensated for phase 7, a report may be produced that summarizes  
the conclusions and recommendations of the evaluation process. In any  
event, after the sign program has been operational for a period, the client  
may engage the designer to fine‐tune the program with additional and  
modified signs.  
# Chapter Wrap‐Up  
That’s it for the design process. It’s quite a journey, even when delineated  
in somewhat simplified form, as in this chapter. And no two projects are  
ever quite the same, so it has myriad variations and nuances. Design is an evolutionary, creative, problem‐solving process, so plan  
thoroughly, don’t jump the gun, keep the ideas flowing, and follow through  
on everything. From the initial project research to conceptualization to  
development and documentation of the design to advising on bidding  
and fabrication to evaluating the final sign program, the design process  
involves a lot of work. It makes concepts become reality and, ideally,  
results in a successful sign program—and, perhaps, lasting friendships  
with other members of the project team.

Overview of the Signage Pyramid Method  
As explained in Chapter 2, “The Design Process,” the design of a  
comprehensive signage and wayfinding program is a very complex  
undertaking, more complex than most people—including those in the  
broad‐spectrum design community—might imagine. So how can EG  
designers approach a signage problem and begin to chase down a  
successful solution? By using the Signage Pyramid, a methodology we  
outline in this chapter and delineate further in the next three chapters. It  
is an effective, systematic, proven approach to mediating the problems  
and subproblems associated with the design of a comprehensive static  
signage program.  
Chris Calori initially developed the Signage Pyramid approach in her  
graduate school studies and thesis, and we have since noodled with and  
fine‐tuned it through years of practice at our design office. Although many  
people think we’re crazy to share this proprietary tool with our fellow  
designers \(and competitors!\), with the first edition of this book, the time  
had come to contribute it to the growing body of knowledge about EG  
design.  
As pointed out in Chapter 1, when Chris developed this approach, the  
terms signage and environmental graphic design were just coming into  
use, and the field was just progressing from its infancy to toddlerhood.  
The Society of Environmental Graphic Designers, now the Society for  
Experiential Graphic Design \(SEGD\), had been formed a few years prior to  
Chris’ graduate studies, and very little information was available on how  
to approach EGD problems. The notable exception to this knowledge gap  
was the groundbreaking book Architectural Signing and Graphics, written  
by esteemed pioneers of the field, John Follis and Dave Hammer, in 1979.  
# Genesis of a Design Approach  
In our professional careers, after receiving our undergraduate degrees, we  
gravitated from two‐dimensional print to three‐dimensional signage design  
because we found the 3D aspect of signage to pose more interesting  
80 design challenges than print work. Chris’ first foray into the signage world  
was as a member of a design team that was developing the signage for a  
large, new international airport being built overseas. The team consisted of  
graphic designers and architects working within the corporation that was  
designing and building the airport.  
In the early phases of that project, the signage team focused primarily  
on the design of the sign graphics, based on a limited list of messages,  
and the sign objects that would display those graphics. During the design  
development phase, the team began to develop the actual sign messages  
and locations that would be needed for people to find their way through  
this very complex airport environment. In the process, the number of  
messages that had to be displayed on the signs grew from one to many,  
and this required a fundamental alteration in the design of the signs from  
the one conceived during the schematic design phase. Chris somehow  
believed that this amount of backtracking shouldn’t be necessary, and  
so decided to take her budding professional EG design experience to  
graduate school to analyze what’s involved in EG design and to figure  
out a way to approach it more seamlessly. Thus, the Signage Pyramid  
approach was born.  
# The Signage Pyramid’s Component  
# Systems  
During Chris’ graduate ruminations, she deduced that the primary  
purpose of a sign program is to communicate information about a given  
environment to users of that environment, and that that information is  
conveyed via graphics displayed on physical sign objects or hardware.  
From that, she came to realize that the design of a signage program is  
composed of the design of three constituent yet interrelated systems, as  
shown in Figure 3.1\:  
• The Information Content System  
•  
• The Graphic System  
•  
• The Hardware System  
•  
Comprehensive sign programs consist of many types of signs, from large  
exterior freestanding pylons to small interior wall‐mounted plaques. A  
key design problem is how to create a unified family resemblance, both  
informationally and visually, among all the various types of signs in a  
comprehensive program. The Signage Pyramid does just that\: It provides a  
balanced, three‐prong solution to this problem.  
Basically, the Signage Pyramid approach is a classic divide‐and‐conquer  
strategy for solving a complex problem. By breaking down a complicated,  
The Signage Pyramid’s Component Systems  
3.1 The three components of the Signage  
Pyramid model.  
81 3.2 The information content system consists  
of sign messages, sign locations, and their  
interrelationships.  
Overview of the Signage Pyramid Method  
3.3 The graphic system communicates the  
information content of a signage program using  
two‐dimensional graphic elements and their  
arrangement into layouts.  
nebulous, seemingly insurmountable signage problem into its component  
parts, each of those parts can be more readily solved. The Signage  
Pyramid method views all signage programs as composed of the three  
distinct but interactive systems, itemized above, that must be balanced in  
the design process. Each of these systems is outlined briefly here.  
# The Information Content System  
The communication of information is the functional essence of any  
signage program; therefore, the information content system consists of\:  
• What information is displayed on the signs  
•  
• How the sign messages are worded  
•  
• Where the sign information is located  
•  
• How the messages and locations of the various signs in the program  
•  
relate to each other in a consistent, cohesive network of information  
Figure 3.2 represents the information content system component of the  
Signage Pyramid.  
# The Graphic System  
The graphic system is the two‐dimensional vehicle that visually encodes  
and displays the information content system. The graphic system  
consists of\:  
• What two‐dimensional graphic elements—typography, symbols,  
•  
arrows, and color—are used to encode the sign information  
• How the graphic elements are arranged into layouts, to organize the  
•  
information content, emphasize messages, and create a visual identity  
• How the graphics are applied to signs  
•  
Figure 3.3 represents the graphic system component of the Signage  
Pyramid.  
# The Hardware System  
The hardware system is the collection of three‐dimensional, physical sign  
objects that display the sign information as encoded by the sign graphics.  
The hardware system consists of\:  
• The three‐dimensional shapes of the signs  
•  
• The sizes of the signs  
•  
• How the signs are mounted or connected to other environmental  
•  
objects  
82 • The materials, coatings, finishes, and lighting techniques used  
•  
• The stylistic relationship of the sign objects to one another and their  
•  
surroundings  
Figure 3.4 represents the hardware system component of the Signage  
Pyramid.  
# System Roles  
Each of these systems plays a distinctive role in the development of  
a sign program, yet they all interact with each other. The information  
content system is the underlying reason for a sign program to exist.  
Sign information is not tangible, per se; it’s the raw communication  
material that makes a sign program work. In this respect, the information  
content system can be thought of as the software of a sign program—  
you can’t see it or touch it but the sign program wouldn’t be functional  
without it. In contrast, the graphic and hardware systems exist to make  
the program’s information content visible and concrete in the built  
environment.  
Given that the information content system is the bedrock of a sign  
program, the development of this system—often called programming—  
is a more planning‐oriented than design‐oriented activity. As such,  
the information content system should be mapped out and planned  
before design of the graphic and hardware systems begins in earnest.  
Why? Because any design activity will be somewhat meaningless and,  
therefore, wasted if the extent of the information content system,  
for which the graphic and hardware systems are being designed, is  
unknown.  
Take, for example, the design of a drinking vessel as a very simple  
analogy\: The type of liquid content—whether water, coffee, beer, wine,  
or a cocktail—and the quantity of liquid it can contain will, obviously,  
have a profound influence on the design of the vessel. \(See Figure 3.5.\)  
Should it be thick‐ or thin‐walled, stemmed or not, large or small, glass or  
ceramic or plastic, equipped with a handle, and so on? Without knowing  
the intended contents, the designer would very likely spend a lot of time  
designing a vessel that’s completely inappropriate to its required function.  
3.5  
3.4 The Hardware System consists of the three‐  
dimensional physical objects—their shapes,  
structures, arrangements, and materials—that  
display the sign graphics and information.  
3.5 Just as the kind and quantity of liquid  
content affects the design of a drinking vessel,  
the kind and quantity of information content  
affects the design of a signage program.  
The Signage Pyramid’s Component Systems  
83 Overview of the Signage Pyramid Method  
84  
The same applies to designing a sign program’s graphic and hardware  
systems before the EG designer has developed the information content  
system.  
Accordingly, the information content system is the foundation, the  
planning that needs to be substantially in place before design of the  
graphic and hardware systems commences. Thereafter, design of the  
graphic and hardware systems takes place concurrently, in a back‐and‐  
forth manner. Additionally, the information content system may be further  
refined or tweaked as design of the graphic and hardware systems  
progresses.  
# System Interactivity  
So much for the differences between the three systems of the Signage  
Pyramid; now, how do they interact? The information content system is  
the bedrock, the raw informational material that is communicated by the  
graphic system, which in turn is displayed on the hardware system. Let’s  
examine a few examples of this interaction. For starters, sign locations  
and messages, part of the information content system, have a profound  
effect on the size of the graphics for a given sign, as determined by  
factors such as reading distances for the graphics and the length and  
quantity of messages. The size of the sign graphics, in turn, affects the  
size of the sign hardware that displays the graphics.  
The sign location aspect of the information content system can also  
directly affect the hardware system, in that the location of a given sign can  
determine how large the sign object can be and how the sign is mounted;  
sign size and mounting are primary formal factors in the hardware system.  
The graphic and hardware systems interact in terms of visual appearance  
factors, such as style and color. There are many other ways in which the  
three systems of the Signage Pyramid interact with each other, as will be  
seen in Chapters 4 through 6.  
The Signage Pyramid method that this book delineates for designing static  
signage programs can also point to an approach to digital information  
systems. In this approach, the digital realm’s information content system  
would be the information being communicated, the graphic system would  
visualize the information in 2D graphics and/or video, and the hardware  
system would deliver and display the information on 3D electronic screens.  
# The Signage Pyramid and Resource  
# Allocation  
There’s no doubt that all design activity, including EG design, involves a  
certain amount of backtracking—one step backward for each two or three steps forward—as the designer progresses from initial concept to final  
product. But the Signage Pyramid approach can help reduce the amount  
of backtracking encountered when solving complex signage problems,  
and this translates into more efficient use of the EG design team’s time  
and, therefore, design budget.  
At the outset of any EG design project, there’s a big temptation,  
on behalf of both the designer and the client, to rush into creating  
design concepts—that is, the pretty pictures for sign graphics and  
hardware. But too often this just results in finding out later that the  
concepts won’t work at various sign locations or for the quantity and  
nature of information various signs need to contain. Don’t fall prey to  
this temptation! Keep in mind, the sign information content system  
is intangible, meaning it doesn’t lend itself to sexy visualizations; nor  
is the planning of this system as creative as design of the graphic  
and hardware systems. But, by gritting your teeth and tackling the  
information content system first, you’ll find the subsequent design  
of the graphic and hardware systems to be far more focused,  
hence effective.  
Think of trying to design a book or a website without having the  
information—or at least a good idea of the information—these items are  
to contain. Without the content, designing that book or website would  
be a waste of time, because the design of these items is so intrinsically  
linked to the quantity and nature of the information they contain. The  
same holds true for designing a signage program\: It’s a waste of both  
time and money to design the program’s graphic and hardware systems  
without the informational content.  
Not only can the Signage Pyramid approach help allocate design  
resources and budgets, it can also help in the allocation of  
fabrication budgets. The way the information content system affects  
fabrication budgets is essentially a numbers game\: The more sign  
units required to communicate the sign information, and the bigger the  
signs must be to hold all the required information, the more expensive  
the job will be to fabricate. The point? Take care not to oversign an  
environment.  
The graphic and hardware systems affect fabrication budgets  
differently. Generally speaking, sign quantities and sizes aside, more  
of the cost of fabricating a sign is tied up in the three‐dimensional  
hardware system than the two‐dimensional graphic system. This  
is due to the cost of the hardware system’s raw materials, such as  
aluminum and steel; the cost of working those materials into the final  
sign objects; and the cost of installing the sign objects at the project  
site. In a freestanding overhead freeway sign, for example, most

and treatments enliven flat, rectilinear sign

Overview of the Signage Pyramid Method  
of the cost goes into building and installing the three‐dimensional  
hardware structure that supports the sign panel that displays the  
message graphics—even though, often, these sign panels contain  
only a few words! In general, the simpler the detailing of the hardware  
system forms, the less expensive are the sign objects to fabricate.  
For example, a flat sign panel is cheaper to produce than a curved  
one. Rich detailing of the graphic system, however, has less impact on  
fabrication costs. \(See Figures 3.6 through 3.8.\)  
These facts can help the EG designer allocate fabrication budget  
resources. If the fabrication budget for a given project is limited, the EG  
designer may consider designing the sign program to be driven by the  
graphic rather than the hardware system. In such a case, the sign graphics  
are the primary design feature, as applied to simple, flat sign panels, or  
directly to walls.  
86 3.8 Flat graphics, whether as appliqué, wall  
covering, or paint, applied directly to wall  
surfaces create visual impact at less expense  
than three‐dimensional graphics or detailed sign  
hardware.  
3.9 and 3.10 This program featured a single  
monument sign as a centerpiece, whereas other,  
more commonplace signs have a related but  
simpler palette of materials and details.  
3.8  
Another strategy for allocating limited fabrication budgets is to concentrate  
the more expensive hardware system details on a few, highly visible  
showcase or centerpiece signs, and design the rest of the signs in the  
program with simpler hardware system details. \(See Figures 3.9 through  
3.12.\) The key in such cases is to maintain a formal resemblance among  
all the sign objects in the program’s hardware system—from the splashy  
showcase signs to the less obvious room number plaques, for example.

can be stretched by concentrating higher‐end  
materials and details into a showcase or

3.12 Chapter Wrap‐Up  
This chapter has provided an overview of the Signage Pyramid method  
for approaching the design of a signage program. This model divides and  
conquers the complexities of a signage problem by splitting it into three  
different yet integrated systems that are more readily managed and  
solved. These three component systems are the information content,  
graphic, and hardware systems.  
This chapter has also stressed the importance of planning a sign  
program’s information content system before designing its graphic and  
hardware systems, and has explained some of the ways in which these  
systems interact.  
Finally, this chapter has described how the Signage Pyramid method can  
aid in the allocation of both design and fabrication budget resources.  
The next three chapters are devoted to a detailed explanation of each  
of the component systems of this model, with the aim of providing the  
EG designer with the tools to effectively solve even the most complex  
signage problems.

# The Information Content System  
# Signs are meaningless without information.  
# What good is a blank sign?  
Signs exist for one purpose and one purpose only\: to communicate  
information to people about their environment. \(See Figure 4.1.\) Unlike  
other objects intentionally placed in the built environment such as light  
fixtures, walls, flooring, landscaping, and so on, signs literally speak to  
people, in that they convey meaningful information that people, in turn, act  
upon. In this respect, a sign is one of the few truly interactive elements  
of the built environment. And because people have to engage in the  
act of reading the information on signs, signs also are among the most  
scrutinized objects in the built environment. Other environmental objects,  
by their very form and existence, may connote an inherent message \(e.g.,  
a fence or high wall connotes “stay out”\), but they do not do so in a literal,  
denotative manner as do signs. \(See Figure 4.2.\)  
Put simply, a sign program’s information content system consists of  
what the signs say—the information they communicate—and where  
4.1 The information content system.  
4.2 Spikes added to standing pipes wordlessly  
connote “Don’t sit here.”  
4.2 that information is located in the environment. The information content  
system of a signage program can be compared to the operating system of  
a computer. Like all those unseen 0s and 1s in a computer program, the  
information content system makes the sign program function; indeed, it is  
the essence of signage, but it’s intangible, in that it doesn’t take physical  
form. Put another way, a sign program’s information content system is the  
program’s communication infrastructure, the network of content that links  
all the signs in a program together informationally.  
As explained in Chapters 2 and 3, it’s essential to plan and develop the  
information content system—an activity often called programming—early  
on in a project. Programming is critical because before meaningful design  
activity for the graphic and hardware systems can take place, the EG  
designer has to have a good idea of the amount of information each sign  
will display, the physical conditions of each sign’s location, and the viewing  
conditions for each sign.  
Unlike other graphic design projects, it’s typically the responsibility of the  
EG designer to take the lead in formulating the informational content of  
a signage program, with the input and approval of the client. In contrast,  
in collateral, Web, advertising, and other graphic design projects, the  
informational content—at least text content—is typically provided by  
others, such as professional copywriters.  
Why do EG designers generate the informational content for sign  
programs? Because they possess the skills to analyze a site’s plan, its  
circulation paths, and the informational needs of its users, all necessary  
to map out where signs are needed and the kinds of information content  
the signs should convey. More conventional content providers, such as  
copywriters, do not possess these skills.  
It’s important to reiterate that information content system development  
consists primarily of locating signs and generating their messages.  
Typically, the EG designer plays a lead role in locating signs, with the EG  
designer and the client playing a mutual role in the formulation of the sign  
messages. In some projects, the sign message content may be almost  
entirely developed by the client, with the guidance of the EG designer;  
in other projects, the sign message content may be almost entirely  
developed by the EG designer, with the client’s advice and approval.  
# Kinds of Sign Information Content  
The information content system serves many functions in a signage  
program and provides many kinds of informational content. For  
example, in wayfinding signage, the information content system is  
the “breadcrumb trail” that helps people find their way through an

arrived” at a destination, such as this sculptural

Westchester County, New York.  
environment. \(See Figure 4.3.\) The various types of informational content  
communicated by signage are categorized in this section, along with an  
indication of who may generate the message content and locations for  
each type of information. In a comprehensive signage program, all or  
many of these kinds of information will be displayed on the program’s  
various sign types. But before we delve into these categories, keep in  
mind that every signage program and every EG designer is different, so  
some EG designers may use different terms than the ones used here to  
The Information Content System

92 refer to the various kinds of sign information content. Additionally, some  
of these informational content categories may overlap.  
• Identification signs are located at a destination to identify that  
•  
destination or place in an environment. Identification signs confirm  
that “you have arrived” at a destination, and they may or may not  
have directional signs leading to them. Identification sign message  
content—that is destination names or room numbering systems—may  
be generated by the EG designer and/or the client. Identification sign  
locations are typically mapped out by the EG designer. Message content  
and locations for identification signs related to life safety and accessibility  
are often mandated by code authorities. \(See Figures 4.4 and 4.5.\)

93 Directional signs are also often referred to as wayfinding signs because  
they help people find their way to destinations. Directional signs almost  
always display arrows to point out specific paths—such as, left, right,  
straight ahead—to destinations. Directional sign message content—  
that is, destination names—may be generated by the EG designer and/  
or the client. Directional sign locations are typically mapped out by  
the EG designer. Locations and message content of directional signs  
related to life safety and accessibility are often mandated by code  
authorities. \(See Figures 4.6 and 4.7.\)

•  
environment. Two common examples are Danger\: High Voltage; and  
In Case of Fire, Use Stairs Unless Otherwise Instructed. Warning sign  
message content and locations may be developed by the EG designer  
and/or the client, and often are mandated by code authorities. \(See  
Figures 4.8 and 4.9.\)  
• Regulatory and prohibitory signs are intended to regulate people’s  
•  
behavior or prohibit certain activities within an environment. Two  
common examples in this category are Authorized Personnel Only and  
No Smoking. Regulatory and prohibitory sign message content and  
locations may be developed by the EG designer and/or the client, as  
well as mandated by code authorities. \(See Figures 4.10 and 4.11.\)

• Operational signs inform people about an environment’s use and  
•  
operations, thus may often be quite detailed, requiring some time  
to study and absorb. One example is directory signs, also called  
directories, which list the location of tenants within an environment,  
often accompanied by a locator map. Other examples include signs  
listing days and hours of operation, such as for a retail store; and the All  
Visitors Must Be Announced signs, which are ubiquitous in Manhattan  
apartment buildings. Message content and locations for operational

environment. A prime example is donor signage, which displays the  
names of financial benefactors of a site or facility. Another example is  
a building cornerstone, which typically displays the date of erection,  
along with the names of the building’s developers, architects, and

other notables. Honorific signage is most common at institutional and  
civic sites and facilities. The message content for honorific signage is  
typically provided by the client, but sign locations may be mapped out  
by the EG designer or the client. \(See Figures 4.15 and 4.16.\)  
• Interpretive signage helps people interpret the meaning of an  
•  
environment, or places within it, by providing information on its history,  
geography, inhabitants, artifacts, and more. Examples include plaques  
that commemorate the event\(s\) that took place at a historical site, such  
as a battlefield, and signs that provide information about the animals  
at a zoo or aquarium. Research—often quite scholarly and detailed—is  
usually required to develop the information content for interpretive  
signage, and the research, content development, and locations of  
interpretive signs may be undertaken by the EG designer, the client,  
and/or experts in the subject matter of the interpretive program. \(See  
Figures 4.17 and 4.18.\)  
4.14  
# Hierarchy of Content  
Not all informational content is equal in a signage program. Some sign  
messages and locations are more important than others; therefore, the  
designer must impose a hierarchical ranking on an environment’s sign  
messages and locations, based on relative importance. In this process,  
signs are ranked in regard to whether the information they display is  
primary, secondary, tertiary, or even less important. The general principle  
is that the more important the information, the higher the rank. This, in  
turn, translates into the size of the graphics conveying the information  
and, correspondingly, the size of the sign itself. Logically then, signs 4.15  
4.16  
communicating primary information are larger than those communicating  
secondary information, and so on. Additionally, the ranking of the  
information determines how visually prominent the sign that displays it  
should be. Generally speaking, the higher up a sign is displayed, within  
limits, the more visually prominent it is. \(Chapter 6, “The Hardware  
System,” has more on sign mounting heights.\)  
4.15 Honorific signage includes donor  
recognition signage such as this “woven”  
pattern of individual wall panels.

Hierarchy of Content  
99 The Information Content System  
100  
There are two basic, related reasons why a sign information hierarchy is  
necessary\:  
• To enhance communication effectiveness  
•  
• To conserve space on sign faces  
•  
Regarding the first, communication effectiveness, consider an airport  
terminal, which has many destinations, some of which are more important  
to a greater number of people than others. For example, more people  
will be seeking out check‐in, gate, and baggage claim areas \(primary  
destinations\) than the nursery \(secondary or tertiary destination\). To  
give all of these destinations equal importance on a primary directional  
sign—or, indeed, even to include all of them on such a sign—leads to  
information overload and communication breakdown. Particularly with  
directional signs, which often list multiple destinations, there is a limit  
to how much information people can absorb while moving through an  
environment, especially if they are in vehicles.  
A similar circumstance occurs with signs displaying content other than  
directional information. Continuing with the airport example, it would be  
confusing if the airport’s hours of operation were signed with the same  
prominence as the check‐in area or other major destinations. Similar  
confusion and overload would arise if the nursery and janitor’s closet were  
identified as prominently as the gate numbers.  
Related to communication effectiveness, sign information hierarchies help  
conserve sign space. As the old saying goes, “You can’t pour 10 pounds of  
flour into a 5‐pound sack.” The amount of space a sign has for the display  
of information is often constrained by various physical site factors, such  
as low ceiling heights, which limit the height of overhead signs to allow  
adequate vertical clearance for people or vehicles to pass underneath.  
A sign that’s limited in size is also limited in informational capacity;  
therefore, it should not contain messages other than those that are the  
most important. Even where there are fewer physical site constraints on  
sign face size, loading too much information on a sign is dysfunctional.  
# Developing the Sign Information Content  
# System  
As noted at the beginning of this chapter, developing a sign information  
content system is often called programming and this process is best  
introduced with a question\: What information do sign users need and  
where do they need it? Essentially, this process entails mapping out  
sign locations and establishing the message nomenclature that will be  
displayed on the signs at each location. Sign Locations  
Sign locations are determined by analyzing circulation routes and  
decision points within the project environment. This process, too, can be  
addressed by posing questions\: “Where are the pathways that people  
move along and where along those pathways must people decide  
whether to make a turn or proceed straight ahead?” The EG designer  
answers these questions by reviewing the project’s plan drawings, which  
depict a site or building from above, and marking out where the circulation  
routes and decision points are.  
If the project at hand is new and not yet built, plan drawings are the  
primary tools for analyzing circulation and decision points. If, on the other  
hand, the project site exists, the EG designer has an additional tool\: He  
or she can visit the site to survey circulation and decision points in situ.  
Obviously, it takes more skill to envision circulation and decision points  
for a site that doesn’t yet exist and is defined solely by drawings than for  
a site that can be directly experienced. Whether or not the project site  
exists, however, plan drawings are the medium for sign location analysis.  
\(See Figure 4.19.\)

secondary pedestrian pathways, as well as  
vehicular pathways, in Washington, DC.

101 The Information Content System  
4.20 Directory for the Cincinnati Children’s  
Hospital indicates vertical and horizontal  
circulation routes in an interconnected,  
multibuilding complex.  
Although plan review focuses on lateral circulation, it’s necessary to keep  
in mind that for many project environments vertical circulation routes  
are just as important as the lateral ones. A great many sites, such as rail  
stations, airports, hospitals, retail malls, and parking garages have multiple  
floor levels and the vertical circulation pathways between these levels  
present key decision points for navigating the site. \(See Figures 4.20  
through 4.22.\) Section drawings, which are vertical slices through a building  
that reveal the stacking of its levels, can aid vertical circulation analysis.  
4.20  
102 BIM models, which are digital and 3D, can provide useful visuals of a  
project site that doesn’t exist, including static perspective views, sections  
at any point, and animated fly‐throughs. These BIM visualizations are great  
tools that can help EG designers better assess both lateral and vertical  
circulation routes for projects that are not yet built.  
After studying decision points and user circulation, the EG designer begins  
to map out the signs on plan drawings, making a mark to indicate each  
sign on the plan. This initial go‐round of the sign location plans may include  
just primary signs, for simplicity and clarity, and they may be color‐coded  
by communication function—for example, red for directional signs, blue  
for identification signs, and so on. \(See Figure 4.23.\) Remember, though,  
as pointed out in Chapter 2, color‐coding can be useful for the initial sign  
location plans, but the final sign location plans should not rely on color‐  
coding to communicate important information about each sign, as the final  
location plans may be printed in black‐and‐white only.  
Keep in mind that like the design process itself, developing sign location  
plans is also an evolutionary process, so expect to go through several  
iterations of the sign location plans and corresponding messages before  
they are finalized.  
Tips for Determining Sign Locations  
• Always locate signs perpendicular to the viewer’s line of movement  
•  
and sight, as people can’t see signs located parallel to their line of  
movement/sight without turning their heads. This can be dangerous,  
particularly in driving situations, when drivers need to keep their gaze  
focused on the road ahead.  
• Always locate directional signs at decision points; and on long paths,  
•  
reinforce the information on additional signs to assure people they’re  
heading in the correct direction to their destination, as shown in  
Figure 4.24.  
• In certain situations, particularly those involving vehicular signage  
•  
where reaction time is a factor, use advance directional signs \(e.g.,  
Departing Flights Next Left\) to give people enough time to maneuver to  
the decision point. Use these in tandem with confirmatory directional  
signs \(e.g., Departing Flights with a left directional arrow\) at the actual  
decision points, as shown in Figure 4.25.  
• Place identification signs at the destinations to which people have  
•  
been directed, to confirm their arrival at the destination they’ve been  
seeking, as shown in Figure 4.25.  
Thus the wayfinding breadcrumb trail has been laid\: Directional signs point  
to the various destinations at each decision point along a circulation route,  
and each destination is identified to confirm that it has been reached.

indicates the vertical stacking of destinations.

cruise ship provides orientation to lateral and  
vertical circulation, as well as to the ship’s fore  
and aft.

The Information Content System  
4.24 Directional signs should be located at  
decision points, and directional information should  
be reinforced with additional signs on long paths.  
After the initial sign location plans have been developed, the EG designer  
should examine the site conditions at each location. These site condition  
factors include\:  
• Viewing distances  
•  
• Viewing angles  
•  
• Physical limitations on sign sizes and/or mounting heights, such as low  
•  
ceiling clearances or narrow corridor widths  
• Physical sight‐line obstructions, which can be immobile, such as  
•  
columns or trees, or movable, such as people or vehicles  
• Lighting conditions  
•  
• Sign mounting opportunities  
•  
• Adjacent surfaces, finishes, and functions  
•  
As with circulation analysis, it’s easier to determine conditions at each  
sign location when the project environment actually exists and can

be surveyed in person, rather than having to rely solely on drawings  
and other visualizations. But on projects whose sites are not yet built,  
drawings provide the primary reference for site conditions, so all available  
architectural and/or engineering drawings need to be studied carefully. In  
addition to plan drawings, these architectural drawings include elevations  
and sections, with elevations showing vertical surfaces such as walls and  
doors, and sections showing vertical slices through the site. On projects  
that require ceiling‐mounted signs, those drawings include reflected  
ceiling plans \(RCPs\), which should be consulted to ascertain ceiling  
conditions at each sign location. Renderings, models, fly‐throughs, and  
other visualizations of the site are also helpful in assessing sign location  
conditions. Again, such visualizations are getting easier to obtain as BIM  
gains hold in the architectural arena.  
Another important design consideration has to do with scale. That is, even  
if the final sign location plan documents aren’t prepared at a measurable  
scale, early sign location studies should take place on plans of a measurable  
scale so that viewing distances can be accurately measured with a scale  
ruler. Why is viewing distance so important? First, among other signage  
provisions, guidelines such as the Americans with Disabilities Act’s \(ADA’s\)  
Standards for Accessible Design \(SAD\) specify character heights related to  
sign mounting heights and/or viewing distances. Second, the farther the  
distance from which a sign must be viewed, the larger the sign typography  
must be; and the larger the typography, the larger the sign size must be to  
accommodate it. Chapters 5 and 6 go into greater detail about sizing sign  
typography for viewing distances.  
By identifying site parameters and constraints, the information gathered  
in studying sign locations begins to set the stage for designing the sign  
program’s graphic and hardware systems, as well as for defining the  
program’s sign types. It also aids in identifying and coordinating sign  
locations that require additional support systems to be brought in, such as  
electrical or structural.  
As the EG designer learns more about the conditions at each sign  
location, the sign location plans will be refined and filled in with all

# Wayfinding\: Passive and Active  
# Wayne Hunt  
In finding our way, we respond to two kinds of  
environmental information. First is the environment  
itself—sight lines to destinations, objects that  
help us maintain orientation, intuitive location of  
entrances, even lighting and sounds. These built‐in  
features in the natural and man‐made environment  
are the passive tools of wayfinding. The best  
places and spaces are rich with these integrated  
attributes that foster orientation, understanding,  
and self‐guiding.  
The second category of wayfinding information is  
the added active elements\: signs, directories, color‐  
coding, and other more literal tools that help guide  
us. These proactive elements are often needed  
to supplement and clarify the as‐is, or passive,  
environment. It is within this second category  
of design, active wayfinding design, that most  
environmental graphic designers operate. We plan,  
design, and implement systems of physical and  
virtual tools that are added to or overlaid onto and  
into existing or planned places and spaces.  
This combination of passive and active information  
allows us to navigate freeways, find our way in  
museums, stay oriented in malls, and even find  
the party in an apartment building—”After you get  
to our building, just follow the noise to our place.”  
However, the best environments have a higher  
percentage of passive wayfinding qualities. These  
are the intuitive, self‐guiding places that need  
relatively few directional signs\: the museum with a  
traditional formal entrance; the European town with  
a large clock tower in the center; the theme park  
with restrooms right where we expect them \(and  
when we need them\), and so on.  
# Lost in the Woods  
If you have ever been lost while hiking, you  
became dependent on the passive and native  
things in the natural world—the position of the  
sun, a distinctive rock formation you passed that  
morning, a distant mountain range. Regaining  
orientation is critical, often a matter of life or death.  
You are without active wayfinding elements until  
you stumble upon a trail sign.  
Note that a paper trail map is an active tool,  
but its utility depends on users matching the  
features shown on the map with their real‐life  
counterparts in the environment—a melding of  
passive and active wayfinding processes. But  
even with a good flashlight, a trail map is of little  
use after dark.  
# Where Is the Cave?  
Ancient humans were wholly dependent on  
reading the natural or passive environment for  
wayfinding information. Heading out for a day of  
hunting, ancient man intuitively recorded his route  
and could quickly retrace the path back to safety  
in an emergency. Survival depended on this innate  
ability to wayfind by means of a wide variety of  
passive elements. Some wayfinding experts say  
that even cues as subtle as regionally unique, tiny  
wind‐shaped patterns in desert sand could signal  
nearness to an important destination or the location  
of water.  
# Ever More Active Elements  
Modern urban development has covered over  
many natural wayfinding cues, so much so that  
our daily world is largely a human‐constructed  
place, but we still have a built‐in, innate need to  
be oriented—to know where the cave is. To meet  
this powerful need, we are increasingly more  
dependent on the hard and literal tools of active  
wayfinding. To interpret and navigate through  
today’s complex built spaces and places we need  
106 Wayfinding\: Passive and Active continued  
organized systems of signs\: signs to direct, signs  
to identify, signs to inform, and signs to regulate  
behavior.  
While this proliferation of signs solves immediate  
problems, often the real problem is the place itself,  
if it has been designed without important passive  
wayfinding qualities. A parking garage is set back  
from the street with no view to the entrance; the  
second floor in a hospital aligns with the third floor  
in the connected garage; the four corridors leading  
from an elevator in an office building look identical;  
the sections in a stadium have a counterintuitive  
numbering system. Unfortunately, the familiar  
remedy for all of these all‐too‐common situations  
is signs and more signs—that is, active elements  
added to make up for the missed opportunities of  
passive wayfinding.  
# Improving the Active; Influencing  
# the Passive  
As wayfinding designers, we continually try to  
improve the design of signage. But we also  
look for opportunities to participate in the early  
stages of projects and help advise on passive  
wayfinding elements to reduce the need for active  
interventions—signs. Such integrated elements  
and strategies include\:  
• Building entrances that look like entrances  
•  
• Providing clear sight lines to decision points  
•  
wherever possible  
• Incorporating the fewest turns in routes  
•  
between destinations  
• Centrally locating elevators  
•  
• Positioning elevator doors to be visible from a  
•  
distance  
• Differentiating paint and artwork schemes in  
•  
similar corridors  
• Adding views to exterior features  
•  
• Heightening lighting near entrances, both  
•  
exterior and interior  
• Using intuitive numbering systems for rooms,  
•  
airport gates, and buildings  
• Using descriptive building and department  
•  
names  
• Designing understandable paths through exterior  
•  
areas  
# What about Mobile Wayfinding?  
The development of GPS‐driven wayfinding  
programs and devices has added another method  
for finding one’s way. At the touch of a button,  
on‐screen turn‐by‐turn visual and verbal directions  
can provide accurate point A to point B guidance.  
But because knowledge of the surrounding or  
passive environment is not needed with GPS,  
users understand very little about where they  
actually are, or even how they got there. So  
even as this high‐tech wayfinding becomes more  
ubiquitous, human‐based passive and active  
wayfinding will remain important to accessing the  
built environment.  
Wayne Hunt is the founding principal of Hunt Design Associates in  
Pasadena, California.  
the signs necessary for the program. Concurrently with mapping out  
sign locations, the EG designer is also mapping out messages to be  
communicated at each location, which leads to a discussion of message  
nomenclature development.  
Developing the Sign Information Content System  
107 The Information Content System  
108  
# Sign Messages  
Each project site requires a message nomenclature vocabulary. This should  
be a consistent and concise collection of messages to be displayed on the  
site’s signage. The operative words here are consistent and concise, for a  
nomenclature vocabulary that is both consistent and concise is essential  
for clear communication of the sign information system.  
A consistent sign message vocabulary is key to maintaining the  
breadcrumb trail of information. Once a destination name has been  
determined, it should be used on every sign relating to it. As the saying  
goes, “Don’t change horses in midstream”—developing the sign  
message nomenclature system is not an exercise in creative writing.  
Also, never use synonyms! Imagine the confusion of users if some signs  
in a program display the message Downtown and others display the  
message Center City. Both have the same basic meaning, but using the  
terms interchangeably within a sign program causes confusion. Hence,  
rigid adherence to consistency of message nomenclature is essential for  
clearly communicating the sign information system.  
The sign message vocabulary must also be concise, for two previously  
stated reasons\: to conserve sign space and to prevent information  
overload. Accordingly, a message should communicate the essential  
information needed by the sign user in as concise a manner as possible.  
For example, often, the official names of destinations are quite lengthy,  
such as Ford’s Theater National Historical Site, and such messages  
take up a lot of real estate on a sign face. The more concise message  
Ford’s Theater communicates the core information necessary for  
sign users far more clearly and effectively than the lengthy, official  
message. Accordingly, destination names must be reviewed and edited  
for conciseness and clarity, and consistently used once edited. Note,  
however, that it may be difficult to build consensus with clients on the use  
of the edited versions of destination names. \(See Figure 4.26.\)  
Related to the conciseness of the message nomenclature vocabulary  
is the use of abbreviations, which is sometimes necessary to conserve  
sign space. The rule of thumb is that abbreviations should only be used in  
sign nomenclature when they are highly recognized by the general public.  
Examples of highly recognized abbreviations include\:  
• St., for street  
•  
• Hwy., for highway  
•  
• Fl., for floor  
•  
• Intl., for international  
•  
• Dept., for department• 12'

Stay away from less recognized abbreviations, such as\:  
• Arpt., for airport  
•  
• Term., for terminal  
•  
• Stn., for station  
•  
• Dntn., for downtown  
•  
Again, once the decision has been made to use a given abbreviation,  
use it consistently throughout the sign program. One more point\: Don’t  
hyphenate sign messages; while hyphenating words may be acceptable  
in large blocks of newspaper or book text, it is unacceptable in signage.  
Another critical element in achieving consistency of message vocabulary  
is message syntax, which refers to how the sign messages are structured.  
For example, there are two common ways to indicate a numerical series,  
such as levels of a building\:  
Levels 1 to 5  
Levels 1–5  
Both the word to and the dash are widely recognized, hence acceptable to  
use, but to prevent confusion, one method or the other must be chosen  
and employed consistently throughout a sign program.  
As stated previously, the EG designer is typically the lead orchestrator  
of the information content system for a sign program. In some cases,  
this entails structuring and editing message content such as destination  
names provided by the client. In other cases, the EG designer generates  
an entirely new message nomenclature vocabulary to impose on the  
project site; that is, he or she develops a new destination naming system  
that relates directly to the informational needs of the project’s sign users.  
The most straightforward example of this name imposition is the  
development of a signage room numbering system for a building in which  
the room numbers on the architectural plans must be superceded by a  
different numbering system for signage purposes. The need for this arises  
when the room numbers assigned during the architectural design process  
\(which properly fulfilled their architectural function\) do not make sense  
from a communication standpoint to a person navigating the building. For  
example, rooms are commonly added or deleted during the architectural  
design process, resulting in room numbers on the plans that aren’t in any  
logical sequence for a sign user; thus, the EG designer is called upon to  
develop a new, more logical room numbering system for sign program use.  
The EG designer may also generate and impose even more  
comprehensive new signage nomenclature vocabularies for complex, 4.27 The major interior circulation corridor of  
Boston’s Brigham & Women’s Hospital complex,  
named the “Pike” after the Massachusetts  
Turnpike, directs people to various destinations  
at numbered “exits.”  
4.27  
multibuilding sites, with the goal of organizing the site’s nomenclature to  
simplify and clarify user orientation and navigation. These vocabularies are  
almost always hierarchical and are developed for unbuilt as well as existing  
sites. A classic example is a new signage nomenclature vocabulary for  
a hospital complex that has grown from its original building to several  
buildings, often with complex, interconnected lateral and vertical  
circulation routes. \(See Figure 4.27.\)  
# Navigation\: Message Hierarchy and  
# Proximity  
People navigate from general to specific destinations, and the sign  
information system needs to be organized accordingly. Navigation is  
a process of zeroing in on a specific target destination in ever more  
discrete, nesting steps. In a simple example, consider the steps involved  
for a woman who lives outside of a city’s downtown district who is visiting  
a friend in a downtown hospital. She must\:  
1\. Find her way to the downtown district within the city.  
2\. Find the hospital within the downtown district.  
3\. Find the proper wing within the hospital.  
4\. Find the proper floor within the wing.  
5\. Find the proper room on the floor.  
Obviously, when this woman first enters the freeway to head downtown,  
she isn’t going to see her friend’s hospital room number on the freeway  
directional signs. She is likely to see the word “Downtown,” which is

111 4.28 destinations.  
People navigate from general to specific  
The Information Content System  
the first, most general, layer of the informational hierarchy leading to  
her friend’s hospital room sign. The point here is that it’s completely  
inappropriate, let alone impossible, to display every single, specific  
destination within an environment on all directional signs within the  
environment. Therefore, sign information must be organized so that it  
builds from less detailed to more detailed the closer the sign user gets to  
his or her target destination. \(See Figure 4.28.\)  
In another example, consider a traveler entering a city environment.  
Hundreds of thousands of destinations, ranging from major to  
insignificant, lie within the city, but they couldn’t—and shouldn’t—all  
be listed on directional signage. For a cohesive, comprehensible sign  
information system, the destinations need to be organized on two bases\:  
hierarchy and proximity.  
# Hierarchy  
Developing a sign information hierarchy starts with reviewing and  
analyzing all the various destinations within the project environment.  
The first step is to make a list of these destinations and then begin to  
rank them in order of importance for the sign user. Some rankings will  
be obvious, such as in an airport, where a janitor’s closet would be a less  
important destination than the security checkpoint. In a city wayfinding  
example, the municipal sewage plant would be a less important  
destination than the city government offices or the train station.  
In determining the ranking of destinations, the client’s input is extremely  
valuable, and often essential, particularly for projects such as urban or  
campus signage programs. In these cases, the client often has hard and/  
or anecdotal data regarding which destinations are most sought out or  
visited by the most people, and this data can be used to determine which  
destinations appear on which signs. This data is often referred to as trip  
generation data.  
Keep in mind that some destinations are just not important enough to  
be displayed on directional signs. Nevertheless, people will seek out  
these less important destinations, so they can be included on map  
signs, paper map handouts, and mobile wayfinding applications, space  
permitting. A good example of this sort of sign information hierarchy is  
found at large regional shopping malls. The primary vehicular directional  
signs typically display only the major anchor store destinations,  
because listing all the smaller specialty shops would overload the  
signs with information too detailed to be absorbed effectively. Instead,  
the specialty store names are displayed on the interior mall directory  
maps, which contain detailed information that requires more time to  
study and absorb.  
112 Proximity  
Along with hierarchy, sign information can be organized and displayed  
according to its proximity to the destination. Again, signs have limited  
message capacity, so not all destinations can be displayed on all signs  
within an environment. However, destination names are dropped  
from signs once they have been reached, freeing up capacity for new  
destinations, so that as the information system courses through a site,  
messages are added and deleted from signs.  
The general objective of proximity‐based messaging is to add a destination  
to a sign when the sign’s location is near to the destination. Just how near  
to the destination is a judgment call that varies with each project, and  
depends on the hierarchical ranking of a given destination. A very high‐  
ranking destination such as Downtown may be displayed on a sign quite  
far away from the destination, along with less highly ranked destinations  
in closer proximity to the sign location. For all but the most highly ranked  
destinations, however, a standard should be established stating at what  
point a destination will be added to a sign. That standard may be different  
for each project. It might, for example, state that the destination name will  
be added to all signs located within a 500‐foot radius of the destination,  
or within a .5‐mile radius, depending on the size of the sign program’s  
environment and the density of destinations within it. \(See Figure 4.29.\)  
4.29 Highlighted area on this proximity diagram  
indicates destinations located within a fixed  
radius from the center sign location.

# Other Factors Affecting the Sign  
# Information Content System  
By now it should be obvious that developing the sign information content  
system is not a simple process, so it shouldn’t be surprising to learn that  
there are still other factors that make it even more complex. These factors  
are primarily related to various government regulations and guidelines, as  
well as multiple language considerations.  
Unlike most graphic design projects, the information, graphics, and hardware  
systems of a signage program are affected by federal, state, and municipal  
codes and regulations of various forms. It is beyond the scope of this book  
to delve into the details of these regulations, which are numerous and  
constantly being revised; rather, the objective here is to raise awareness  
of the fact that signage must be designed with government regulations in  
mind, in order to help both the EG designer and the client to avoid pitfalls.  
To begin, it is important to note that regulations and guidelines, including  
those affecting signage, are typically written in cumbersome legal  
language that can be interpreted in several ways. It is therefore advisable  
for the EG designer and the client to thoroughly research and review the  
applicable sign regulations and then develop viable compliance strategies,  
with the input of legal counsel, code consultants, regulatory officials, and  
professional/trade organizations, as deemed necessary.  
# Signage and the Americans with Disabilities Act  
The Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\) is a federal regulation enacted  
by Congress to secure civil rights for disabled Americans, and these rights  
include physical access to the built environment. To that end, the ADA  
includes numerous provisions that affect physical elements of buildings and  
transportation facilities, including signage. These provisions were originally  
contained within the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines  
\(ADAAG\), which were published in 1991. The ADAAG was updated in July  
2004 and renamed ADA Standards for Accessible Design \(SAD\), which was  
adopted in 2010. The 2010 SAD guidelines are currently in effect and are  
available from the U.S. Department of Justice website at www.ada.gov or  
from the U.S. Access Board website at www.access‐board.gov. In addition to  
the federal regulations, it’s important to be aware that a number of states and  
local jurisdictions also have accessibility regulations and guidelines that affect  
signage, sometimes differently or more stringently than the federal regulations.  
While the SAD is a subset of the broader ADA legislation, this book  
uses the terms “SAD” and “ADA” somewhat interchangeably, partially  
because the term “ADA” has become so commonly associated with  
“signage.” The intent of the SAD signage provisions is to promote equal  
access to the built environment for visually impaired persons, as well as to point out accessible routes for those with mobility impairment. It’s  
important to note that the 2010 SAD signage provisions differ considerably  
from those of the 1991 ADAAG. The 2010 SAD signage provisions are  
more complex—notably making a distinction between tactile/raised and  
visual characters, with different standards for each—and require much  
study. Also note that this book is not intended to provide technical or legal  
advice on any aspect of the ADA/SAD, and that EG designers are advised  
to become thoroughly acquainted with the current guidelines.  
The SAD signage provisions stipulate standards to be met in the display  
of sign information; they do not, however, mandate specific messages  
that must be displayed on signs, nor that signs even be required at  
all. However, whenever a sign is programmed it must conform to all  
applicable ADA standards. \(See Figures 4.30 through 4.32.\)

signs, is affected by ADA/SAD provisions.

# Regulations and Architectural Signage  
# Ken Ethridge, AIA  
I’ll bet that, no matter where you studied design, the  
subject of regulation was never brought up. Don’t  
feel alone. It was barely mentioned when I studied  
architecture back when rocks were soft. Even then,  
the professors just said that we’d “. . . learn all that  
stuff later—in practice.”  
It’s all very well to say, “I’ll just design it and let the  
drones make it compliant.” But now the problem is  
your client actually thinks you know “that stuff” and  
is betting fee money that you do. So, here’s a very  
abbreviated version of what I wish someone had  
told me in school.  
Architecture, and its handmaiden architectural  
signage, is governed by four major groups of  
regulation\:  
1\. Land Use \(i.e., Zoning Regulations\)\: These  
address what can be built and how big it can be,  
depending on where it is. A municipal planning  
and zoning department normally enforces them,  
with reference to a local zoning code.  
2\. Structural \(i.e., Building Codes\)\: These address  
the question of how strong something needs  
to be to resist forces like wind and gravity. A  
municipal building code department normally  
enforces them, with reference to both state and  
local building codes.  
3\. Escape and Egress \(i.e., Fire Codes\)\: These  
address how people enter and exit a facility,  
every day and during an emergency. They are  
enforced by a municipal fire marshal, with  
reference to a state and local fire codes.  
4\. Accessibility \(e.g., Federal Standards for  
Accessible Design \[SAD\] and State and Local  
Accessibility Codes\)\: These address how a  
building should be built so that it’s available  
to the entire population, no matter what their  
disability. Enforcement for this group is more  
complicated than all the previous ones put  
together. The federal government ultimately  
takes precedence, because the SAD supports  
a federal civil rights law \(the Americans with  
Disabilities Act \[ADA\]\) and is enforced by the  
Department of Justice. The SAD, however, has  
generally been adopted by state building codes.  
Additionally, so‐called higher standards may  
have also been adopted by the states, further  
complicating the situation. Local building officials  
should enforce the federal SAD as the “law of  
the land.” In practice, they enforce the actual  
letter of state and local codes.  
In the case of architectural signage, Land Use and  
Structural regulations are most likely to affect exterior  
signs, because they’re public and large. But, the latter  
two groups, Escape and Egress and Accessibility, will  
almost always affect interior signage.  
As is the case for accessibility, local and state  
fire codes are based on so‐called Model Codes,  
developed by independent bodies with members  
drawn from public agencies, ranks of experts, and  
other interested parties. Enforcement is most  
often concentrated in the hands of local Fire  
Marshals from the inspection division of a local fire  
department, who have a great deal of leeway in  
their interpretations. For example, the necessity and  
location of fire egress maps are often completely at  
the discretion of the individual inspector.  
Accessibility is primarily an interior game because,  
with a few narrow exceptions, the SAD signage  
guidelines refer only to interior signs. Notice that I  
wrote guidelines, not regulations. That’s because  
there can’t be any fixed regulations supporting the  
ADA due to the nature of civil rights law. At base  
is the idea that an individual can bring civil suit  
against an alleged violator, saying, “The guideline  
was not enough for my case. The guideline should  
116 Wayfinding\: Passive and Active continued  
be changed to include me \(and people like me\).”  
Therefore, unlike a black‐and‐white regulation, a  
guideline can be a moving target, more dependent  
on the spirit rather than the letter of the law.  
This may seem a fine point, especially since  
meeting the guidelines and complying with the  
state building code’s accessibility regulations is  
usually enough for mere mortals. However, this  
difference accounts for most of the confusion that  
results when we expect hard‐and‐fast regulations  
but meet up, especially with accessibility, with a  
vast array of gray‐area guidelines. If that weren’t  
enough, both guidelines and regulations change  
over time, arguably to represent the best of current  
knowledge.  
Knowledge of regulations and guidelines—  
especially on accessible signage—is now assumed  
to be part of an environmental graphic designer’s  
toolkit. Welcome to the postgraduate world.  
Ken Ethridge, AIA, RAS is Director of Product Development at ASI  
Signage Innovations in Dallas, Texas. He is a Registered Accessibility  
Specialist in the State of Texas.  
The ADA signage provisions also address aspects of a sign program’s  
graphic and hardware system design, among them figure/ground contrast,  
symbol use, dimensional limits, and finish. These are discussed further in  
Chapters 5 and 6.  
In addition to the 2010 SAD guidelines document itself, a useful resource  
to guide EG designers and their clients is the SEGD 2012 ADA White  
Paper Update, which is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 5, “The  
Graphic System.”  
# Local Codes and Interior Signage  
Local codes, be they on the state or municipal level, contain regulations  
that affect the information content system of certain signs in a building  
environment, typically those relating to life safety and often accessibility.  
These codes can mandate both the locations and messages to be  
displayed on signage.  
The local building code is the most obvious and common source of  
interior signage regulations, but these may also be buried in local  
administrative and health codes. Building codes are usually adopted on a  
statewide basis and they can vary from state to state—although building  
code standardization efforts among the states are underway. Certain large  
municipalities, such as New York City, have their own building codes that  
supercede the state building code.  
It can be difficult to identify the local codes that apply to signage, and  
then to find the regulations on signage within the applicable codes. For  
example, even though some building codes have a section dedicated  
to signage, don’t be fooled into thinking that all the code’s signage  
Other Factors Affecting the Sign Information Content System  
117 The Information Content System  
118  
regulations are neatly contained in that section, because there’s a  
good chance that other signage regulations are scattered throughout  
other sections of the code. For example, a requirement for an elevator  
emergency evacuation sign may be buried in the elevators section of the  
code. And don’t trust the code’s index to capture all of the regulations  
pertaining to signs or signage, because they often don’t. The only reliable  
solution is to visually scan the entire code for the words sign or signage  
if the code is in print form, or use the search function \(if available\) if the  
code is in electronic form.  
Many states and cities adopt standard building codes formulated by  
independent code councils, such as the International Building Code \(IBC\)  
developed by the International Code Council \(ICC\). Other localities adopt a  
standard building code, with amendments/addenda tailored to the locality.  
Still others have their own proprietary building codes. A word of warning\:  
Building codes are updated on a regular or sporadic basis, so it’s always  
necessary to ensure that you’re consulting the edition of the code that  
affects your project. It’s wise to verify the applicable code edition—which  
is not always the most current one—with the client or project architect.  
Standard building codes, which are available in book and, increasingly,  
digital form, can be purchased from the independent councils that develop  
them. Some proprietary city building codes, such as the New York City  
code, are available for purchase through city government channels. Still  
other building codes are available without charge on the Internet.  
As stated at the beginning of this section, local codes pertaining to interior  
signage typically mandate location and message content of life safety  
information for building emergencies. This includes information at elevator  
lobbies that directs people to use the fire stairs instead of elevators to  
exit the building during emergencies. Local codes also typically specify  
information that must be displayed on both the occupancy side and stair  
side of fire stairwells, to orient both evacuees and emergency personnel  
to them. The message wording for such signs may be mandated by  
the code, as well as the size\(s\), color\(s\), and/or style of the typography  
used to display the messages. The code may also mandate the location,  
mounting height, panel material, requirements for any symbols or  
diagrams, and other aspects of such signs. Additionally, because some  
information on these signs can identify permanent spaces, any identifying  
information must also meet ADA provisions.  
Outside the scope of work of EG designers are standard illuminated  
building exit signs and illuminated signs identifying designated areas  
of refuge or areas of rescue assistance. The reason? These signs are  
usually required to be illuminated, often on dedicated circuits with backup  
power, so they are typically the responsibility of electrical engineering  
professionals. In addition to life safety signs typically mandated in the building code,  
other local codes may affect locations, message content, size, and so  
on, of other kinds of interior signs. Examples of such local code–related  
signage abound, but two of the most common are no‐smoking signs  
and maximum occupancy signs for public assembly spaces. The State  
of California, for example, mandates the message content, location,  
size, pictograms, and so on, of restroom identification signs, making its  
restroom signs the most distinctive in the nation.  
With so many codes affecting interior signage, it’s no wonder that  
code conflicts occasionally arise, typically between local and national  
requirements. In such circumstances, strategies must be developed  
to comply with both, and it can be helpful to consult with local building  
officials who will have the final word on whether the interior signage is  
adequate for a Certificate of Occupancy.  
# Local Codes and Exterior Signage  
Exterior signs, too, come under the auspices of various local codes.  
Specifically, state and municipal building codes are typically concerned  
with the safety of exterior signs themselves, such as the structural  
integrity to withstand prescribed wind forces and the soundness of  
electrical systems and connections.  
Other local codes, usually municipal sign or zoning ordinances, are  
concerned with aesthetics—that is, controlling the visual character of a  
community’s signage. Such ordinances, which vary from locale to locale,  
have been enacted in response to the mostly unattractive hodgepodge  
of sign styles that have mushroomed along the commercial strips of so  
many American towns and cities.  
These ordinances typically apply to commercial signs, but also sometimes  
to directional signs, and can range from highly to loosely restrictive,  
depending on the locale or zoning district within the locale. Sign ordinance  
restrictions can include square footage, height, location, quantity, form,  
materials, illumination, and other elements. An example is a community  
whose commercial signs are all small, low‐lying, externally illuminated,  
carved‐wood panels with painted and gilded graphics, sitting on twin  
carved‐wood posts.  
It is not the intent of this book to focus on commercial signage or on  
the ordinances that may control them within any given community, so  
suffice it to say that sign ordinances are definitely well intentioned; but  
they can also be open to interpretation, hence causing contention. More  
to the point of this book is that sign ordinances can pose problems  
for the EG designer, especially when an ordinance places restrictions  
on directional signs. For example, an ordinance that places unrealistic  
Other Factors Affecting the Sign Information Content System  
119 size restrictions on directional signs can limit either the amount of  
informational content that can be displayed on the sign or the size of  
that information, to the point at which the sign fails to carry out its  
communication function.  
Usually, before an exterior sign can be erected, sign ordinances require  
filing a permit application at the local jurisdiction, accompanied by an  
illustration of the sign, to demonstrate that the sign will comply with the  
ordinance. Some communities may additionally require that any proposed  
exterior signage be presented to a local governing body for approval,  
particularly if a variance is being sought for the sign or signs. A variance  
is, basically, an official permission for the sign to vary from the ordinance,  
and they can be difficult to obtain. On certain projects, the EG designer  
may be involved in providing renderings or plan and elevation drawings of  
the exterior signs for local approval, as well as in making presentations to  
local authorities.  
The square‐footage aspect of sign ordinances, in particular, is open to  
interpretation, raising the question of what the square footage applies  
to\: Is it just the message area or the overall sign face? Does it include  
exposed support structures, such as vertical posts, that are unsuitable  
for carrying message content? These are important questions because  
the message area footprint takes up far less than 100 percent of a  
sign’s square footage, and it is almost always surrounded by dead  
space, or white space, in the form of margins and any spaces between  
lines of typography, that contain no message content but are essential  
for good readabilty. The point is, one can make a valid argument that  
dead space—including exposed support structures—should not be  
included in the square‐footage calculation; indeed, many local sign  
ordinances permit square‐footage calculations on just the message  
area. \(See Figure 4.33.\)  
It is useful for EG designers to work with the client’s attorneys,  
engineers, and architects in locales with exterior sign ordinances. There  
are also various resources for additional information about exterior sign  
ordinances, including the United States Sign Council \(www.ussc.org\), and  
the International Sign Association \(www.signs.org\).  
The Information Content System  
4.33 A sign message footprint, or live space,  
always comprises less square footage than the  
entire sign face, which consists of the live space  
plus dead space, such as margins.  
4.33  
120 Bilingual and Multilingual Sign Information  
Undoubtedly most EG designers will become involved in signage projects  
that require bi‐ or multilingual sign information, whether those projects  
are in the United States or in other countries. English, of course, is the  
standard language used on signage in the U.S., but in certain regions,  
cities, and neighborhoods, additional languages may be required on signs  
due to large populations for whom English is not their first language. \(See  
Figure 4.34.\) In the United States, Spanish is the most common second  
language that’s displayed on signage; in many other countries, English  
is widely employed as a second language to the native language of the  
country, particularly on signage at international facilities, such as airports,  
train stations, exposition centers, and so forth.  
Designing sign programs to provide effective wayfinding and orientation in  
environments that serve speakers of multiple languages presents unique  
challenges to EGD professionals. Obviously, the more languages that need  
to be displayed on a sign the larger the sign must be, and this can lead to  
difficulties or trade‐offs at sign locations that present physical constraints  
on sign sizes. Furthermore, in addition to requiring much larger sign faces,  
research has shown that signage displaying more than three languages  
is confusing and ineffective. Another issue is that sign messages in many  
other languages, such as Spanish, French, and German, are lengthier  
than those same messages in English, making it incumbent on the EG  
designer to obtain translations of the sign message content concurrent  
with the development of the English information content system.  
To help address some of these language‐related design issues, the  
SEGD participated in the Hablamos Juntos initiative, which examines  
4.34 Bilingual ceiling‐hung directional signage  
at Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston.  
Other Factors Affecting the Sign Information Content System  
4.34  
121 and presents strategies for effective orientation of multilingual users  
to U.S. healthcare environments. These strategies include use of  
symbols, maps, and human assistants to augment signage in a “total  
communication” package for speakers of languages other than English.  
Although the Hablamos Juntos initiative is geared toward healthcare  
environments, its findings and recommendations can be applied  
to other environments serving speakers of multiple languages. For  
more information, and to access documents from this initiative, go to  
www.segd.org.  
In an integrated communication strategy, applications for mobile  
devices can provide supportive orientation information in languages  
that aren’t displayed on the physical signs. As stated previously, such  
technology continues to evolve, and large organizational structures  
may not support such an integrated strategy across communication  
channels.  
For signage programs in the United States, messages in English are  
almost always displayed above or before their translations into other  
languages. For signage programs in other countries, the opposite is  
usually the case—messages in the country’s native language take  
precedence over their English versions.  
Another language‐specific design issue that EG designers must account  
for is reading direction. Consider that while English and most other  
languages read from left to right, others, such as Hebrew and Arabic, read  
from right to left. \(See Figure 4.35.\) And Chinese, which traditionally read  
vertically from top to bottom, is now also commonly read horizontally from  
left to right.  
Even within the English language there are differences that can cause  
signage dilemmas—specifically, in spelling and nomenclature between  
American and British English. The British version is typically standard  
for signage in countries that historically were in the sphere of British  
influence, such as Singapore and India, as well as for some countries that  
were not, such as Mainland China. Common examples of these variations  
are listed here.

122 Pictorial Information Content  
Thus far, this chapter has focused on word‐based information content, but  
some sign information can be communicated pictorially, without words.  
Pictorial content includes symbols, which are pictures that represent things  
or concepts, and diagrams, such as maps. Note that in this context the  
words symbol, glyph, icon, and pictogram are basically synonymous and are  
used interchangeably, although this book primarily uses the term symbol.  
The intention of this section is to give a general overview of pictorial  
information content for signage; it is not intended as a technical  
dissertation on semiotics.  
# Symbols  
Symbols are used on signs as a shorthand substitute for words, but to be  
effective, they must be easy to understand. For example, the symbol of an  
airplane can substitute for the word Airport, and a symbol in the figure of  
a man can substitute for Men’s Restroom. Directional arrows, too, can be  
considered symbols, in that they serve as a pictorial shorthand for worded  
directions such as Straight Ahead, Turn Left, and the like.  
Symbols are very useful in signage programs for three reasons\:  
• They conserve sign space.  
•  
• Their meaning can transcend language barriers, as the airplane symbol  
•  
does.  
• They can sometimes communicate more clearly and concisely than  
•  
words, as arrows do.  
The meaning of certain symbols, such as directional arrows and the  
airplane symbol, is immediately obvious to most people. The meaning of  
other symbols has to be learned, and can vary by culture. For example,  
consider the symmetrical red cross symbol on signs, which connotes first  
aid in most Western cultures; yet, worldwide, its connection to first aid  
isn’t as obvious as the airplane symbol is to airport. That is because the red  
cross derives its connection to first aid from its use by the International  
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and this is a learned  
connection. In predominantly Muslim cultures, however, the International  
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies uses a red crescent  
symbol on signs to connote first aid. \(Note\: To protect the trademark rights  
of the Red Cross relief organization, the red cross symbol used in signage  
has been replaced recently by a green cross symbol to indicate first aid.\)  
Even the seemingly universal symbols of male and female figures for  
men’s and women’s restrooms don’t transcend all cultures. Typically, these  
symbols are based on Western dress, with the man in slacks and the  
Pictorial Information Content  
123 woman in a skirt; but these depictions are less effective—and can even be  
offensive—in cultures where both men and women wear long robes, such  
as certain countries in the Middle East.  
As useful as symbols are, many concepts are too complex to be readily  
communicated by them. For this reason, it’s almost impossible to design  
a sign information content system that consists entirely of symbols.  
But judiciously used, symbols can streamline communication on signs.  
And because symbols can transcend language barriers, they can be very  
useful on signage at facilities where users of many languages and cultures  
gather, such as airports, medical facilities, and theme parks.  
In some cases, symbols can be used alone, without words, to  
communicate the necessary information, but again, only if they are  
well‐understood and culturally appropriate. In other cases, symbols can  
be used to reinforce the word messages, or to serve in a sense as a  
second language to help users not familiar with the written language  
displayed on the signs. In still other cases, symbols may not be used at  
all to communicate the sign information. And, finally, all three of these  
alternatives are possible within a given sign program. \(See Figure 4.36.\)  
There are several vocabularies of symbols, some of which have been  
adopted for official, standard use by governing and regulatory bodies in  
the United States. A more in‐depth discussion of symbols is contained in  
Chapter 5, “The Graphic System.”  
# Diagrams  
In addition to symbols, diagrams also convey sign information content in a  
pictorial manner. By far, the most common diagrams used in signage are  
maps. The fascinating and deep subject of maps in general, and in signage in  
particular, could comprise a book unto itself. The purpose here is to provide a  
brief overview of the information content role maps play in signage programs.  
Maps are exceptionally useful in communicating the position of places  
and spaces—including transportation links such as train and bus routes—  
in relation to each other, and therefore as wayfinding and navigational  
aids. Maps can visually substitute for a complex series of directions in

124 words, as they do on evacuation route map signs in hotel rooms. As  
stated earlier, however, many people do not understand maps; moreover,  
maps require detailed study because most people cannot interpret them  
quickly. Accordingly, from a design standpoint, maps should generally be  
considered as adjunct information content for a signage program.  
Of course, maps also usually require legends in order to communicate  
effectively, and those legends are in the form of words and/or symbols. To  
prevent confusion, it’s imperative that map legend nomenclature match  
the nomenclature used in a sign program’s overall information content  
system. More in‐depth discussion on maps is presented in Chapter 5,  
“The Graphic System.”  
Another example of diagrammatic sign information is the interstate  
highway signs that depict the positions of the various traffic lanes and  
turnoffs at complex interchanges.  
# Signage Master Plans  
A signage master plan, at least as defined in our office, is often the result of  
the information content development process. It is a document in which sign  
locations and messages are planned for the long term, a plan that is, in many  
cases, adopted in phases over time. The point is that it takes a long‐term  
view, considering the informational needs of a site over time, minimizing  
informational or nomenclature changes as the site itself changes.  
Signage master plans work best for planned environments that have  
predicted growth patterns. The EG designer develops an information  
content system for the planned environment at full buildout, rather  
than taking a piecemeal, reactive approach as each site within it is built.  
Signage master plans take a holistic approach—the big‐picture viewpoint  
regarding informational needs. In this way they are a proactive rather  
than reactive means to predict the informational needs of a site. Simply  
put, signage master plans provide for and predict the future informational  
needs of a site in an effort to minimize changes to the signage as the site  
is developed over time.  
# Chapter Wrap‐Up  
The dedicated purpose of signage is to communicate information;  
therefore, the development of the information content system—what the  
signs say and where they say it—is the foundation of all sign programs.  
You can use the methods and advice in this chapter to plan any program’s  
content infrastructure, after which you’ll be well prepared to jump into  
actual design activity for the program’s graphic and hardware systems, the  
subjects of the next two chapters, respectively.

# The Graphic System  
# Graphics make sign information visible and give the  
# information “voice.”  
The Graphic System  
5.1 The graphic system.  
The word “graphic” has ancient roots in the Greek word graphikos,  
which means “writing.” The evolution of written and visual, or graphic,  
communication—as opposed to spoken communication—is one  
of humankind’s greatest cultural achievements. No doubt humans  
communicated in spoken words before they invented ways to write  
those words, but the world’s great civilizations didn’t really begin to  
advance until humans developed writing systems to record, preserve, and  
accumulate knowledge.  
The graphic system for a signage program is part of this great cultural  
legacy of visual communication. The sign graphic system makes the sign  
information content system tangible, in that it embodies and conveys the  
sign program’s informational content. The graphic system gives structure,  
form, and style to the information that is communicated on signs.  
The EG designer utilizes and manipulates a vocabulary of visual  
communication devices in developing the graphic system for a sign  
program. These include typography, symbols, color, diagrams, and  
other graphic elements such as rules, bars, circles, squares, and other  
geometric and decorative or illustrative elements. \(See Figure 5.1.\) The  
EG designer then arranges these graphic devices into a unified system of  
layouts for the various sign types and messages in the signage program.  
This chapter discusses the vocabulary of graphic devices used for signage  
and how they are arranged into layouts; it also offers an overview of  
methods for applying graphics to signs. The intent here is to introduce  
the basics of graphics as they pertain to signage, not to serve as an  
exhaustive treatise on graphic design. And, while the core principles of  
graphic design apply to signage in both the static and digital realms, this  
chapter is geared toward static signage.  
This chapter also touches on some of the graphic design aspects of  
the ADA’s SAD signage provisions, but it is by no means exhaustive nor  
should be considered technical or legal advice on ADA conformance.  
Indeed, the ADA is not the primary focus of topics covered in this chapter  
126 because they represent centuries of graphic evolution—particularly in the  
typographic domain—and these historically rooted principles are important  
to discuss without the filter of the ADA. Additionally, the ADA signage  
provisions apply only to signage programs within the United States,  
although some other countries also have accessibility guidelines that  
affect signage design.  
EG designers working on signage projects in the United States are  
advised to become thoroughly familiar with the 2010 ADA Standards for  
Accessible Design, available in HTML and PDF formats at www.ada  
.gov and http\://www.access‐board.gov. The SEGD 2012 ADA White Paper  
Update is also an important reference, downloadable at http\://www.segd  
.org/2012‐ada‐white‐paper‐update. ADA technical assistance is available  
by calling the U.S. Access Board at 800–872–2253 or by calling the U.S.  
Department of Justice at 800–514–0301.  
# Typography Overview  
Typography is the backbone of the sign graphic system because, as stated  
in Chapter 4, “The Information Content System,” most of the informational  
content of a sign program is conveyed by words rather than pictorial  
elements. The word “typography” has its roots in a medieval Latin word  
typographia, meaning “letterpress printing,” but also referring to the style,  
arrangement, or appearance of typeset matter. The latter is the subject of  
this section, as it applies to signage.  
The invention of printing from movable type in Western culture is  
credited to Johannes Gutenberg \(1390–1468\), who implemented the  
idea of casting individual letters into metal type. \(See Figure 5.2.\)  
Printers composed these individual metal letters into words, sentences,  
paragraphs, and pages, then locked the composed type into a printing  
press, inked the type, and pressed it into contact with paper to transfer  
the ink to the paper. Gutenberg is also credited with much of the  
typographic measurement and terminology still used today, which has its  
origins in the era of metal type, which spanned close to 600 years, until  
digital type supplanted it in the late twentieth century.  
Every written language has a set of characters that comprise the  
language. In modern Western alphabetical languages, many of which  
are based on the ancient Roman alphabet \(also known as the Latin  
alphabet\), the character set is relatively small, consisting of upper‐ and  
lowercase letters, numerals, special characters, and punctuation and  
diacritical marks. A standard character set for a typical modern Western  
language with a Latin‐based alphabet consists of about 245 characters.  
In nonalphabetical Eastern languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, and  
Korean, the character sets can consist of upward of 20,000 characters.  
5.2 A piece of metal type. Metal type, now  
obsolete after five centuries of use, formed  
the basis for the currently used typographic  
measurement system.  
Typography Overview  
127 5.3 Anatomy of type.  
Whatever the language, these character sets are expressed in typefaces,  
which vary in the way they depict the characters stylistically. Note that,  
today, the terms type font, or just font, are often used interchangeably  
with typeface, but this book uses the more correct term typeface  
when referring to the unique visual characteristics of any given set of  
typographic characters. Think of a typeface in the same way you do a  
human face\: each has its own unique distinguishing stylistic features. In  
contrast, font historically refers to a complete assortment of type of a  
given size, face, and weight, as typified by a drawer of old‐fashioned metal  
type holding the entire character set of the 10‐point size of the typeface  
Bodoni in the bold weight. Today, font refers to the digital file infrastructure  
that defines and supports the display and printing of a given typeface  
in various sizes. Two vernacular explanations of the difference include  
thinking of fonts as the generator of characters in a given typeface, and  
thinking of fonts and typefaces as analogous to MP3 files and the songs  
they encode.  
Also note that there are typically several versions of a typeface\: Straight  
and oblique \(italic\) at the least, often with variations in weight \(light to  
bold\) and character width \(condensed to extended\) in the straight and italic  
versions. Such a grouping of versions of a given typeface is termed a type  
family, and each of these versions within a type family is an individual font.  
A plethora of typefaces exist for those languages that have Roman‐based  
characters, including English, Spanish, French, Italian, and German. There  
are fewer typefaces for Western languages using non‐Latin character sets,  
such as Greek and Russian, or for Middle Eastern alphabetical languages  
such as Arabic. And when it comes to nonalphabetical Asian languages,  
such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, there are even fewer typefaces.  
This is understandable, given the difficulty of designing a unified yet  
distinctive typeface for the thousands of characters that comprise these  
languages. It is for this reason that typography for non‐Western languages  
will only be touched upon in this section; the focus here is primarily on  
Latin‐based typography, as that is used in the United States. The anatomy  
of Roman or Latin type is depicted in Figure 5.3.

128 Keep in mind that with such a wide range of typefaces available,  
particularly for Latin character sets, typically, EG designers use existing  
typefaces for signage programs, rather than designing new ones. There  
are three good reasons for this.  
• Many existing typefaces are highly legible and well‐proven in signage  
•  
applications.  
• Some signage projects, such as those that are part of a larger graphic  
•  
standards program, actually require the use of a specific existing  
typeface\(s\), to create or maintain a consistent graphic or brand identity  
at the client’s various facilities and sites.  
• Use of existing typefaces is standard practice for signage programs  
•  
because typeface design is a complex process, requiring specialized  
skills that are, in most cases, beyond the EG designer’s range of  
expertise. In such cases, engagement of a professional type designer is  
necessary.  
The creation of a new, customized typeface for a given signage program  
is rare, even though custom type design is gaining ground for branding  
programs. Should the client wish to include custom typeface design for  
a signage project, the project design fees must take into account this  
additional, highly specialized outside service. And, of course, any custom  
typeface for signage must be designed for high legibility and stylistic  
longevity, as well as ADA conformance.  
# Choosing a Typeface  
Typeface selection is key to the visual appearance of a sign program’s  
graphic system, particularly as typography is the predominant graphic  
element for communication of sign information. Selecting a typeface can  
seem an overwhelming task, however, because as just noted, typefaces  
abound for Latin character sets. Generally, there are four factors that can  
aid in selecting typefaces for a signage program\:  
• Formal suitability  
•  
• Stylistic longevity  
•  
• Legibility  
•  
• ADA/SAD guidelines  
•  
# Formal Suitability  
Formal suitability refers to how well a typeface suits a given project, both  
in terms of how visually compatible it is with the project environment and  
its stylistic longevity. Regarding visual compatibility, in broad terms, there

129 5.4 Serif letterforms carved into the entablature  
of ancient Rome’s Pantheon.  
The Graphic System  
5.4  
are two basic typographic styles\: serif and sans serif, each of which has  
broad stylistic connotations.  
The primary distinguishing feature of serif letterforms is the presence of  
serifs, or “feet,” the short horizontal strokes at the upper and lower ends  
of the main letterform strokes. Serif letterforms were invented by the  
ancient Romans, and elegant, beautifully carved serif letters still can be  
seen gracing the archaeological sites of the Roman Empire. Most serif  
letters also exhibit varying, thick‐thin stroke widths within each letterform.  
It is thought that both serifs and thick‐thin strokes were the result of the  
acts of carving letters into stone with flat‐nosed chisels, and of calligraphic  
writing on paper or skins using flat‐nosed reeds as pens. Some of the  
earliest serif typefaces, whose design is rooted in ancient Roman carved  
letterforms, date back to the 1570s. \(See Figure 5.4.\)  
Sans serif means without serifs, so it should not be surprising that the primary  
distinguishing feature of these typefaces is the lack of serifs, or “feet.” Most  
sans serif letters also have relatively uniform stroke widths within each  
letterform, so uniform or near‐uniform strokes are another distinguishing  
feature of sans serif letters. Although sans serif letterforms are visually simpler  
than serif letterforms, sans serif typefaces are relative newcomers to the  
typographic scene, with origins in the early 1800s. \(See Figure 5.5.\)  
Given the ancient origins and visual complexity of serif letterforms,  
contrasted with the relative newness and visual simplicity of sans  
serif letterforms, it’s no surprise that serif typefaces have traditional  
connotations and sans serif typefaces have contemporary connotations.  
130 5.5  
Therefore, serif typefaces are generally better suited for use on signage  
projects where a traditional look is desired, whereas sans serif faces  
are better suited for projects where a contemporary look is desired.  
Sometimes, of course, visual contrast or juxtaposition is desired, which  
can be created by using a sans serif typeface in a project with a traditional  
context, by using a serif typeface in a project with a contemporary context,  
or by combining serif and sans serif typefaces in the same program, which  
can be necessary due to the ADA’s SAD requirements. One of the first  
questions we ask at our office when we start designing the graphic system  
for a signage project is\: Is this a serif or sans serif project?  
Typefaces for languages with non‐Latin character sets also fall into serif or  
sans serif styles to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the language.  
Those for the more Western Cyrillic \(Russian\) and Greek languages are  
available in styles that can be clearly identified as serif or sans serif.  
5.5 Examples of serif and sans serif typefaces.  
Choosing a Typeface  
131 Typefaces for languages such as Arabic, Chinese, and Korean are available  
in calligraphically derived thick‐thin styles, as well as in styles with more  
uniform stroke thicknesses. Though the more calligraphically derived  
typefaces do not feature serifs per se, they have the more traditional  
connotations of Western serif type styles, while typefaces with more  
uniform stroke widths have the more contemporary connotations of  
Western sans serif type styles.  
Though there are endless stylistic variations and subcategories of Roman  
letterforms and typefaces, most can be broadly classified as either serif or  
sans serif. This does not, however, include the large number of typefaces  
that are categorized as novelty faces, those that are so distinctive and  
quirky that they can usually be ruled out for use in a signage program.  
\(See Figure 5.6.\) And this brings us to the matter of stylistic longevity.  
# Stylistic Longevity  
While trendy, novelty typefaces may be desirable for advertising and other  
relatively ephemeral, short‐lived graphic campaigns, including temporary  
The Graphic System  
5.6 Examples of novelty typefaces.  
5.6  
132 event signage, permanent signage programs tend to have comparatively  
long life spans. In fact, it’s not at all uncommon for sign programs to endure  
for years, if not decades. For this reason, stylistic longevity of typefaces  
is an important selection factor for permanent signage programs. Trendy  
typefaces often become quickly dated, thereby prematurely dating a sign  
program. The ADA’s SAD also comes into play, requiring that characters  
used in signage be “conventional in form.” This is not to say that novelty  
typefaces can never be used in a signage project, for every project is  
different; nor is it to say that the EG designer has no creative freedom in  
typeface selection. There are several timeless typefaces, serif and sans  
serif—some designed centuries ago, others only a few years ago—that  
have the stylistic longevity suitable for permanent signage programs.  
# Legibility  
Legibility is a crucial factor in typeface selection for sign program graphics,  
and it’s linked to both formal suitability and longevity. Simply put, a legible  
typeface is easy to read, and since the objective of the graphic system  
of a sign program is to communicate information, it must be easy to read  
and understand so that viewers can act upon the information easily and  
seamlessly. Legible typography is essential for clear communication, and  
many novelty typefaces are so stylistically errant that they fail to meet the  
primary purpose of a signage typeface\: to be legible.  
Scientific studies have been conducted on typeface legibility, but it’s not the  
purpose of this book to go into such technical detail. However, there are some  
basic parameters that help to determine the legibility of a typeface. \(See  
Figure 5.7.\) Legible typefaces tend to exhibit the following characteristics\:  
• They have clearly defined, easily recognizable letterforms.  
•  
• They have a large “x‐height.”  
•  
• They are of medium weight, with stroke widths that are neither too  
•  
thick nor too thin.  
• They are of medium or normal character width, with letterforms that  
•  
are neither too condensed nor too expanded.  
There are also considerations regarding the legibility of serif versus  
sans serif type in signage. The horizontal strokes of serif letterforms are  
generally regarded as an aid to reading large blocks of small text, such  
as in a book or a newspaper, whereas serif faces are often considered  
to be too delicate in form for signage graphics in critical communication  
applications such as highway signs. Think about it\: You rarely see book  
or magazine text set in sans serif type and, conversely, you rarely see  
vehicular‐related sign graphics in serif type. This is not to say that serif  
typefaces can’t be used for signage, but that their legibility should be  
carefully studied for vehicular signage applications.

Characteristics of good and poor legibility  
# ADA Conformance  
Typographic conformance to the SAD signage provisions may impact all  
of the above typeface selection factors, particularly in the United States.  
Again, it’s not the intent of this book to provide technical or legal guidance  
on the ADA signage provisions, but the EG designer must be thoroughly  
versed with the SAD’s extensive typographic requirements for both  
tactile/raised and visual characters on signs. These requirements affect  
typeface selection, and the requirements for tactile/raised characters are  
different in most cases from those for visual characters. For example,  
under the SAD, serif typefaces aren’t permitted for tactile/raised  
characters, but are permitted for visual characters. This, in turn, may lead  
to the need to select both serif and sans serif typefaces that are both  
ADA‐conforming and stylistically compatible with each other for use on  
different kinds of signs within a given sign program. Keep in mind that  
this is just one example of the myriad typographic considerations the SAD  
brings to the EG designer’s attention.  
The Graphic System  
# Typographic Treatment  
In addition to the legibility, or lack thereof, intrinsic to the design of  
any given typeface, typographic treatment can also affect legibility.  
Typographic treatment refers to variables that can be manipulated to affect  
how a typeface looks when it is set, such as case and letterspacing.  
Most Roman‐based typefaces are composed of two versions of the same  
characters\: an uppercase \(“capital” or “cap”\) version and a lowercase  
134 Making the Roadscape Understandable\: Development of  
# the Clearview Type System  
# Donald Meeker and James Montalbano  
Road and traffic signs are perhaps the single  
most prominent manifestation of government that  
citizens confront on a daily basis. They often appear  
as an eclectic assembly of panels loosely defined  
by functions to guide, warn, regulate, and identify.  
The result may be cluttered, seemingly ubiquitous,  
outdated displays.  
To accommodate the Interstate Highway System,  
road signs were standardized in the late 1950s.  
A primary focus was to create a uniform system  
of guide signs nationwide. In the following  
years, materials and manufacturing technologies  
changed but the designs and specifications  
for signs did not. When computer systems  
dramatically changed planning, design, and  
production, the same old formats and typefaces  
were applied in adapted forms. Could the status  
quo be challenged?  
In the late 1980s we were contracted to  
design a travel information sign program for  
highways in the State of Oregon. The State  
wanted an added layer of tourist destinations  
for motorists but with less clutter. Existing  
intersections presented a visual cacophony of  
guide signs, route markers, and miscellaneous  
regulatory signs. We concluded that it was not  
possible to add news signs at already cluttered  
intersections.  
After completing the Oregon project, we  
assembled a team and began to study road sign  
typography as an academic pursuit. We wanted  
to aid readability, reduce road sign clutter, and  
positively impact design, planning, and production.  
To do that, we had to improve the typography and  
overall design.  
The landmark 1964 work of Jock Kinneir and  
Margaret Calvert for British Transport was  
instructive. Their typefaces and formats  
created a standard in the United Kingdom  
and many other countries. We studied Adrian  
Frutiger’s typeface for signage at Charles De  
Gaulle airport and the European DIN standard  
that was used on road signs. We looked at  
dozens of sans serif fonts enlarged in both  
positive and negative contrast to compare  
in measured viewing conditions. Still, none  
of the typefaces we evaluated used the  
system of type weights and widths that our  
preliminary study suggested. In the end, we  
needed to design a new typeface that would  
address all the requirements identified in  
our analysis.  
The two primary stroke weights used for existing  
guide signs—FHWA Series E‐modified used  
on freeway signs and Series D for conventional  
road guide signs—were our starting point. The  
new typefaces would optimize the design of the  
lowercase because, as we learned, readability  
is predicated on the clear definition of the word  
pattern—an attribute not afforded by the typical  
uppercase displays.  
Mixed case reduced the size of word footprints.  
Since we did not know if one‐for‐one substitution  
of a new mixed case would work, we tested  
the feasibility of our proposed changes. The  
performance requirements went well beyond basic  
daytime reading and well beyond conventional  
testing methods.  
As the American population was aging, readability  
had to address needs of older drivers. In the  
Typographic Treatment  
135 The Graphic System  
Making the Roadscape Understandable\: Development of the Clearview Type System continued  
early 1990s, the FHWA suggested that all sign  
legends be increased 20 percent in height to  
accommodate older drivers. That increase would  
have made all signs half as large overall. The  
carrying capacity of structures and availability of  
roadside real estate presented incontrovertible  
problems, and didn’t take into account the  
perceptual and visual changes that come with  
aging. For example, older drivers have increased  
contrast sensitivity at night. Effective signage  
had to eliminate or control halation \(overglow\)  
created by headlamps on new high‐brightness  
sign materials. This led us to study letterspacing  
and the space surrounding a word as much as the  
word itself.  
With our research partners at The Larson  
Institute at Penn State University, we undertook  
studies that looked at legibility and readability.  
Beginning in the mid‐1990s our new typeface  
designs tested significantly better than existing  
FHWA standards, but not consistently to our  
goal of a 20 percent improvement for the same  
size sign.  
Our design focused on eliminating needless  
massing in letterforms where strokes converge to  
opening counters and the configuration of terminals  
that closed letter shapes viewed from a distance.  
This was done based on very specific requirements  
for stroke and letter width and became the  
foundation of the design.  
The typeface Clearview was born from a labor of  
field‐testing and research studies. Considering the  
challenges that distance and movement present,  
we needed to optimize letterspacing; as the space  
between letters looks tighter from a distance, and  
to find the widest possible stroke width for guide  
signs without overglow.  
Influenced by two studies we had conducted  
on word footprints, we redesigned the original

Clearview BD55

FHWA Series D  
Clearview BD35  
Clearview-HWY 3-W  
Clearview lowercase alphabet, making  
lowercase letters proportionally taller than  
conventional typefaces. The letters were then  
slightly compressed to have the same width  
but to carry a slightly heavier stroke weight. This  
modification increased the interior shapes of  
the letters, prevented overglow, and improved  
the overall readability of the word. In 2002, the  
refined Clearview was presented to officials from  
PennDOT, TexDOT, and FHWA. The results were  
very persuasive. At that point we felt we had the  
foundation for a typeface design that could be  
central to overall traffic sign design.  
We completed the design of Clearview with  
plans to create a six‐font type system for positive  
contrast. From that we then developed a second  
version for negative contrast applications. The  
136 Making the Roadscape Understandable\: Development of the Clearview Type System continued  
stroke width of dark on light letters for use on retro‐  
reflective materials had to be tuned to equalize the  
apparent size to that of positive contrast formats.  
In the fall of 2004, the FHWA gave state DOTs  
“interim approval” for the use of Clearview on guide  
signs. Based on observation of the guide signs,  
well over half of U.S. state highway departments,  
cities nationwide, and all provincial governments in  
Canada adopted Clearview.  
We then designed a system of mathematically  
proportional guide sign formats for conventional  
roads. Clearview formats provide a way to  
consolidate three sections in the MUTCD into a  
common set of layouts and uniform type standards.  
The Clearview format is easily adaptable to  
computerized layout because there is a consistent  
logic to the relationship of all elements\: type, space,  
border, symbols, and so forth.  
Upon review of nearly 600 regulatory and warning  
signs, each based on different layouts with various  
type weights and sizes, we asked if uniform  
criteria for design could improve readability. A  
team at The Larson Institute is now conducting  
research on the use of Clearview for negative  
contrast applications primarily for use on safety‐  
critical signs. The preliminary results are very  
positive and should allow for continuing upgrades  
to road sign design.  
Clearview is more than road signs. It has been  
applied to designs for parking control and street  
name signs, regulatory postings, guide signs, as  
well as a comprehensive system of signs to aid  
safe cycling. It appears in adapted forms to comply  
with ADA requirements as used for signage in  
airports and other public buildings. An expansive  
text version of Clearview has been developed  
in eight weights in regular, condensed, and  
compressed formats.

version. Case refers to which version or combination of versions is  
used, and this significantly affects both the legibility and appearance of  
typography. Case treatments include\:

Typographic Treatment  
137 Typography  
# TYPOGRAPHY  
5.8 The Title Case treatment of the word  
typography aids legibility because it has a more  
distinct footprint.  
The Graphic System  
The most common, and most legible, case treatment for sign typography  
is Title Case, in which all words, with the exception of so‐called “helper”  
words such as conjunctions and prepositions, have their initial letters set  
in uppercase with all subsequent letters of the word set in lowercase.  
Much like book titles, most sign messages are single words or a short  
series of words—for example, Restrooms and Food Court—therefore, title  
case is the most appropriate treatment.  
Title case treatment may seem counterintuitive to nonpractitioners  
of graphic design, who often have the mistaken notion that all  
capitals are somehow more legible because they’re bolder or simpler.  
The reality is that because lowercase letters have more distinctive  
shapes and greater variation among those shapes than capital letters,  
lowercase letters form a more distinctive word footprint, making  
them easier to read than an all‐caps footprint. \(See Figure 5.8.\) For  
confirmation, consider the difficulty of reading a book or magazine  
with text set in all caps. Such text is set in sentence case, with an  
initial cap on the first word of each sentence, because it’s more legible  
than all caps.  
Sentence case treatment of signage typography is usually reserved for  
detailed information that is in whole sentences, such as operational,  
regulatory, or interpretive text. And all lowercase treatment of sign  
typography, while occasionally seen on sign programs in Europe, is rare in  
the United States.  
Although sign messages in all caps are less legible than messages  
in title case, particularly for the non‐visually impaired, all‐capital  
messages can have a commanding, magisterial, even elegant  
appearance, à la ancient Roman letterforms—which were all capitals—  
carved into the edifices built by that civilization. Indeed, certain sign  
messages, such as STOP and EXIT are mandated by various codes  
to be displayed in all caps. Additionally, the ADA requires tactile/  
raised character identification sign messages in all capitals. So, there’s  
no doubt that all‐caps case treatments can be appropriate for all  
typography in some sign programs, and indeed are required for the  
tactile/raised typography within a program. Keep in mind, however,  
that since the capital letters are larger than the lowercase letters of  
any typeface, messages set in all caps take up more space on the  
sign face than messages set in Title Case at the same type size. \(See  
Figures 5.9 through 5.11.\)  
Letterspacing is another typographic treatment variable that affects the  
legibility and visual appearance of typefaces. Letterspacing, also known  
as tracking, is the manipulation of spacing among all the letters in a word.  
Letterspacing and tracking, which affect spacing throughout a word or  
138 group of words, should not be confused with the term kerning, which  
refers to manipulation of spacing between individual character pairs within  
a word.  
Most type fonts, which are digital files, are engineered to set with  
the default of “normal” letterspacing/tracking, typically indicated as  
zero \(0\), which is the “not too much, not too little” spacing people  
need to comfortably read text. Normal letterspacing can be varied  
by increments on the plus, or positive \(+\), side of zero, to increase  
the space between letters, or on the minus or negative \(–\) side, to  
decrease the space to the point of making the letters touch, or even  
overlap. \(See Figure 5.12.\)  
To aid legibility, signage typography should be set with normal  
or slightly open, positive letterspacing/tracking. Negative or tight  
letterspacing treatments, while they can add drama and immediacy  
to the appearance of typography, impair legibility and so are best  
employed for graphic design applications other than signage. Two  
specific instances in which more open typographic letterspacing  
treatments should be studied are for vehicular‐related signage and  
for internally illuminated signage. Both situations can pose viewing  
condition and human factor issues that can be mediated by increased  
letterspacing. In addition, the ADA’s SAD has letter/character spacing  
requirements—which are different for both tactile/raised and visual  
characters—that support open letterspacing.  
The openness or tightness of normal, default letterspacing varies from  
typeface to typeface. Some type fonts are engineered to “set tight” at

normal letterspacing, while others “set loose.” Therefore, it’s important to  
study letterspacing variables for each typeface considered for a signage  
program to select the appropriate letterspacing treatment for optimum  
legibility and ADA conformance. And, generally, once a letterspacing  
standard is determined for the chosen typeface\(s\), to foster visual  
unity the spacing standard should be used as consistently as possible  
throughout the program, given the different ADA letter/character spacing  
requirements for tactile/raised and visual characters. \(See Figures 5.13  
and 5.14.\)  
It’s important to note that letterspacing increments may vary with different  
computer programs, including increments for normal or zero letterspacing.  
The EG designer should check all typography set by others, such as sign  
fabricators, for letterspacing conformance to the designer’s examples.  
It’s also important to remember that regardless of computer program  
increments, the more open the letterspacing, the more space typography  
will take up on the sign face.  
One typographic treatment is mentioned here only in passing because it  
is considered amateurish by graphic design professionals and, therefore,  
should be strictly forbidden in any sign program’s typography\: horizontal  
or vertical scaling. Most computer graphics programs allow typefaces  
to be scaled more or less than 100 percent in the horizontal or vertical  
axis; but this grossly distorts typeface proportions, and is usually done  
in an effort to cram a too‐long message onto a sign face of limited size  
by reducing the typeface’s standard character width. \(See Figure 5.15.\)  
Some graphic designers consider horizontal or vertical scaling of type to  
be so heinous as to dub it a “type crime.” As we say in our office, just like  
Mr. Whipple in an old TV commercial, “Don’t squeeze the Charmin, and  
don’t squeeze the type.” Additionally, the ADA places limits on character  
width‐to‐height ratios.

# Typographic Considerations in Signage  
# for People Who Read by Touch  
Thus far, we’ve covered typographic treatments for sighted sign users, but  
as discussed in Chapter 4, “The Information Content System,” the ADA  
contains provisions to improve signage accessibility for visually impaired  
people. Again, it’s not the intent of this book to exhaustively delineate  
the ADA’s signage provisions, but to provide highlights of its impact on  
signage design, including sign typography.  
ADA guidelines require that identification signs for all permanent  
rooms and spaces display the room or space name in tactile/raised  
typography, accompanied by Grade 2 Braille. Tactile/raised typography  
and Braille are required for people with no or very limited vision who  
read the identification sign messages by touch rather than sight. For this  
5.14 Helvetica is a typeface that sets tight,  
whereas Univers is a typeface that sets loose.  
5.15 Typeface proportions distort badly if  
character widths are manipulated to fit long  
messages onto signs of limited width.

reason the ADA places other limitations on tactile/raised typography for  
permanent room identification signs. Within the current SAD, limitations  
include the following aspects of typography for permanent room  
identification signs\:  
• Character width \(termed “Character Proportions” in the SAD\) must not  
•  
be too condensed \(narrow\) or too extended \(wide\), and must fit within  
the specified character‐width‐to‐height range.  
• Stroke width \(termed “Stroke Thickness” in the SAD\) must not be too  
•  
bold \(thick\), and must not exceed the maximum stroke‐width‐to‐height  
specification.  
• Typographic style is limited solely to sans serif typefaces. Additionally,  
•  
sans serif letterforms that are italic, oblique, script, highly decorative, or  
of other unusual forms cannot be used.  
• Case is limited to all capitals.  
•  
As explained earlier in this chapter, Title Case is more legible than  
all capitals. So why does the SAD require all capitals, as well as the  
other limitations, for tactile/raised typography? Again, tactile/raised  
typography is for reading by touch rather than sight and the variety of  
form that makes lowercase letters easier for people to read by sight  
makes lowercase letters harder to read by touch than all caps. Similarly,  
straightforward, non‐ornamented letters are easier to read by touch, as  
are letters that don’t deviate much from “normal,” in character width or  
stroke width.  
Typography for signs that aren’t for permanent room identification, such  
as directional signs, is classified as “Visual Characters” in the SAD, with  
a set of requirements introduced in the 2010 SAD. These visual character  
requirements place limitations on various aspects of sign typography and  
differ from the tactile/raised character requirements in important ways, so  
it’s important for EG designers to understand the distinctions between the  
SAD’s requirements for tactile/raised characters and visual characters. The  
ADA also affects other aspects of sign graphics, touched on throughout  
this chapter and book.  
As noted in Chapter 4, “The Information Content System,” the SEGD  
2012 ADA White Paper Update, which provides the SEGD’s current  
interpretation of the ADA as it relates to signage, provides useful  
guidance on sign typography and other aspects of SAD signage  
conformance. The White Paper Update can be downloaded at http\://  
segd.org/2012‐ada‐white‐paper‐update. Just as important is the SAD  
document itself, which is available at www.ada.gov or at www.access‐  
board.gov. It’s also advisable to check the Access Board and SEGD  
websites periodically for updates, clarifications, and webinars on the SAD and signage. Additionally, the SEGD and the International Sign  
Association \(ISA\) have ongoing programs to educate their members  
about the signage aspects of the ADA.  
# Symbols and Arrows  
Recall from Chapter 4, “The Information Content System,” that symbols  
and arrows are graphic devices that communicate information pictorially—  
that is, without words. Also recall that the words symbol, glyph, icon,  
pictograph, and pictogram are all basically synonymous and are used  
interchangeably to refer to a picture that represents a word or concept—  
for example, how a picture of a taxi represents the word taxi, or a picture  
of an airplane represents the concept of airport. As a reminder, this  
book primarily uses the term symbol to refer to these pictorial devices,  
and considers directional arrows as symbols, in that they are pictorial  
representations for directional indicators such as Straight Ahead, Turn Left,  
and the like.  
Humankind’s use of simple pictures to communicate visually predates  
the development of written languages. Some of the earliest examples  
of pictorial communication are the Lascaux cave paintings, circa  
15,000–10,000 BC, in southern France. It is thought that these  
paintings tell hunting stories. As cultures advanced, many early written  
languages were based on the use of pictures in an organized fashion,  
such as the hieroglyphic language of ancient Egypt. The Chinese  
language was, and still is, pictorially based, with each character  
representing a word or concept, as opposed to English, an alphabetical  
language in which words are assembled from alphabetical characters.  
And even the Latin or Roman alphabet, as used in most Western  
European languages, including English, evolved from a series of  
pictorially based characters.  
In signage, symbols can replace typography to communicate  
certain messages, or augment typographic messages. For example,  
an airplane symbol can replace the word airport on a sign, or a  
wheelchair symbol next to a destination name can indicate the  
wheelchair‐accessible route to that destination. Symbols can also  
be paired with typographic messages on signage to reinforce the  
typographic message, such as when the airplane symbol is paired  
with the word airport. This typographic/symbol pairing can be useful  
in multilingual signage environments such as airports, hospitals,  
exposition centers, and theme parks to reduce the need for multiple  
languages on the signs.  
Some symbols, such as the airplane or wheelchair symbols, are almost  
universally understood, because they directly depict relatively simple  
Symbols and Arrows  
143 5.16 Arrow directions.  
concepts, as explained in Chapter 4, “The Information Content System.”  
Other words or concepts, such as outpatient clinic or passenger drop‐  
off are not as easily depicted in a symbol, so the meaning of symbols  
developed for such concepts often needs to be learned for the symbols  
to be understood. And, remember, cultural differences can affect symbol  
recognition and understanding.  
Arrows are symbols that are well understood worldwide as directional  
devices, replacing lengthy verbal indications of direction. For example, an  
arrow pointing left is clearly understood to mean “turn left”; therefore, the  
words turn left are typically replaced by a left arrow in sign graphics. The  
same is the case for other arrow directions, as depicted in Figure 5.16.  
# Symbol Vocabularies  
Just as a given typeface can be considered a vocabulary of characters  
of a given, unified style, EG designers should consider the symbols  
they use for sign graphics as a vocabulary. In order to communicate  
clearly, the vocabulary of a sign program’s symbols and arrows require  
visual unity, clarity, and simplicity in their graphic design. And keep in  
mind that even if other symbols are not used for the graphic system  
of a given sign program, at the very least that program will require a  
vocabulary of arrows.  
The EG designer has two basic sources for symbol vocabularies\:  
• An existing symbol vocabulary or vocabularies adopted for the project  
•  
• A completely new symbol vocabulary created for a specific project  
•  
The second source is far less common than the first. As pointed out  
earlier in this chapter about custom typefaces, there are three reasons  
for this, primarily because developing a new symbol vocabulary is a  
labor‐intensive process, requiring much testing and revision. Second, a  
new symbol vocabulary may not be as readily understood as an existing  
one. Third, use of an existing symbol vocabulary may be required for a  
given signage project. For these reasons, just as it’s not common for EG  
designers to include the design of a new, custom typeface in the design  
services for a signage program, design of a custom symbol vocabulary is

144 typically not part of signage design services. And, remember, should the  
client request the design of a custom symbol vocabulary, the design fee  
must cover the research and development time involved with this task.  
Given that design of a new symbol vocabulary is the exception rather  
than the rule, we’ll turn the focus here to use of existing symbol  
vocabularies. By far the most commonly used symbol vocabulary  
in the United States is the AIGA/DOT symbol system, which was  
developed by the American Institute of Graphic Arts, in conjunction  
with the U.S. Department of Transportation for U.S. transportation  
facilities. Development of this symbol vocabulary, which took place in  
the 1970s, was a major undertaking, involving considerable research  
and development on behalf of several parties, including various teams  
of distinguished graphic designers. Examples of the 50 symbols in the  
AIGA/DOT vocabulary are shown in Figure 5.17; the various display  
formats are shown in Figure 5.18.  
The AIGA/DOT symbols, which have been adopted for signage  
use by various transportation authorities and facilities, are now in  
such widespread use they’re generally well recognized by travelers

AIGA/DOT symbol vocabulary.  
5.19 SEGD symbols for accessibility.  
throughout the United States. Digital artwork for this transportation  
symbol vocabulary is available free of charge at the AIGA and  
SEGD websites.  
In addition to the original AIGA/DOT symbol set, the SEGD developed a  
set of Symbols for Accessibility, which includes four symbols specifically  
developed for signage and graphics associated with the ADA. These SEGD  
accessibility symbols, shown in Figure 5.19, which were designed to be  
stylistically compatible with the AIGA/DOT symbols, are available free  
of charge from the SEGD. We add the caveat that official recognition of  
accessibility symbols has become an open issue that could affect use of  
the SEGD accessibility symbols.  
The most recognized of the SEGD accessibility symbols is the wheelchair  
accessibility symbol, which varies stylistically from the less visually  
sophisticated version depicted as the International Symbol of Accessibility  
\(ISA\) in the SAD guidelines. Both of these symbols are shown in  
Figure 5.20, along with a more active version on the right. Although all  
versions in the figure depict a side view of a person in a wheelchair, only  
the SAD ISA version on the left is currently considered to be the officially  
recognized standard. The other three SEGD accessibility symbols shown  
in Figure 5.19, which also have similar pictorial content but are stylistically  
different from those depicted in the SAD, should also be presumed not to  
be officially recognized.  
In the interest of improving inclusiveness, legibility, and access for all,  
various design professionals and advocacy groups in recent decades have  
The Graphic System  
5.19  
146 5.20  
developed different graphic treatments of the wheelchair accessibility  
symbol. A PDF depicting many of these stylistic variations can be  
downloaded on the SEGD’s Accessibility Symbols page at www.segd  
.org/accessibility‐symbols. Similarly, the informational and visual  
content of the three access symbols represented in Figure 5.20 is the  
same—a wheelchair—and they differ only in the graphic style in which  
they’re treated, just as the dollar sign and the word Dog have the same  
informational content regardless of the stylistic differences among the  
typefaces displaying them. There are ongoing efforts to gain official  
recognition for more inclusive, humanistic, visually evolved versions of the  
access symbol.  
The AIGA/DOT symbol vocabulary is particularly appropriate if you’re  
designing a sign program for a transportation facility. Many of these  
symbols, such as those for restrooms, escalators, and stairs, are not  
specific to transportation and are used on signage for a wide range of  
facilities. \(See Figure 5.21.\) But what about symbol vocabularies that  
venture beyond the transportation focus of the AIGA/DOT symbols? The  
SEGD has developed a vocabulary of 109 symbols for recreation‐related  
facilities, some of which are shown in Figure 5.22 and which were  
designed to be stylistically compatible with the AIGA/DOT symbols.  
The SEGD recreation symbols are available free of charge at the SEGD  
website. Additionally, as noted previously, the SEGD has participated  
in the Hablamos Juntos Universal Symbols in Healthcare initiative,  
sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and headed by  
5.20 The intrinsic meaning of the dollar sign,  
the word dog, and the wheelchair access  
symbol remains the same with different stylistic  
treatments.

There are also commercial sources for symbol vocabularies beyond  
the AIGA/DOT and SEGD transportation, recreation, and healthcare  
vocabularies just discussed. A major source is Official Signs & Icons  
2 by Ultimate Symbol/Mies Hora, which is a compilation of more than  
4,800 EPS vector files on CD‐ROM, accompanied by a 240‐page, four‐  
color hardcover reference book. This definitive resource is the most  
comprehensive compendium of current standard signs, symbols, icons,  
and labels ever assembled, and it includes most of the aforementioned  
symbol vocabularies. Additionally, Ultimate Symbol has converted some  
of the previously discussed symbol vocabularies into Opentype pictorial  
fonts, which are available for purchase at the Ultimate Symbol website.  
Other symbol and arrow sources include type foundries, many of which  
have fonts that are symbol vocabularies, and clip art libraries. Note,  
however, that symbol vocabularies from type foundries and clip art  
libraries are typically not stylistically compatible with the AIGA/DOT and  
SEGD vocabularies.  
# Arrows  
Arrows are specialized, yet quite simple symbols, typically comprising  
a pointed head and a shaft, that are graphic representations of physical  
arrows, such as those used for sport or hunting. The AIGA/DOT symbol  
vocabulary also contains a vocabulary of arrows, as shown in Figure  
5.24, which is one of myriad stylistic treatments for arrows. Several  
arrow treatments are shown in the illustration accompanying the sidebar  
The Graphic System  
5.23  
148 “Navigating the MUTCD Community Wayfinding Sign Guidelines,” by Craig  
Berger, presented later in this chapter.  
EG designers tend to favor arrows with open heads and clear, orderly  
geometrical styles such as the Helvetica parallel, Helvetica perpendicular,  
and Optima perpendicular styles shown in Figure 5.25, or some variation  
thereof. The Helvetica arrows feature uniform stroke widths for the  
head and shaft, which refer to the basically uniform stroke widths of the  
Helvetica typeface. The Optima arrow features slightly curved, thick/  
thin strokes similar to those of the Optima typeface. The Helvetica‐style  
arrows are compatible with sans serif typography, whereas the Optima‐  
style arrow is compatible with serif typography.  
Of course, EG designers don’t limit themselves to using only Helvetica‐  
and Optima‐style arrows, not when such a wide range of stylistic  
treatments is possible. One word of caution in arrow use is in order,  
however\: Arrows without shafts communicate less clearly than those  
with shafts, for the shafts reinforce the directionality of the arrows.  
\(See Figure 5.26.\) Also, some people may interpret a triangular,  
shaftless arrowhead as a geometric sign layout element rather than as  
a directional device. Every project is different, of course, so this is not  
to say that shaftless arrows should never be used; it simply points out  
their shortcomings.  
As with other kinds of symbols, the two primary sources for arrows  
are the creation of a new vocabulary of arrows for a given project and  
the adoption of an existing arrow vocabulary. Unlike an entire typeface,  
an arrow is a relatively simple geometric shape, and it can be easily  
constructed in any kind of vector drawing program and rotated in 45‐  
degree steps for the various directions in the arrow vocabulary. Arrows  
can also be adopted from several existing sources, including\:  
• Arrows in the AIGA/DOT symbol vocabulary  
•  
• Various typefaces that include arrows, such as Zapf Dingbats  
•  
• Symbol and clip art libraries, including the aforementioned Official Signs  
•

# Diagrams  
Diagrams, particularly maps, often comprise another element of a sign  
program’s graphic system. As stated in Chapter 4, “The Information  
Content System,” the subject of maps and diagrams is a deep one,  
particularly when maps on smart phones or other mobile devices are  
included, so this section will only touch on map and diagram design as  
they relate to a sign program’s graphic system.  
Maps used in signage are site‐specific; therefore, they are best  
custom‐designed for the project at hand, either by the EG designer or a  
commissioned specialist such as a cartographer. It’s important to point  
out, however, that maps and diagrams can be difficult and time‐consuming  
to prepare; furthermore, the need for, or extent of, these elements is  
often unknown when a fee proposal is prepared for a signage project. That  
is why EG designers often treat map and diagram design as an additional  
service to the signage program design.  
# Stylistic Treatment of Maps  
Why should maps be custom‐designed for a signage program when  
there are often many kinds of existing maps for a given environment,  
including architectural floor plans, Google maps, and maps available  
from GIS \(Geographic Information System\) sources? The simple  
answer is that most existing maps were developed for purposes other  
than signage and are, therefore, unsuitable for the communication  
purposes of a signage program, or they have a stylistic look that’s  
incompatible with a sign program’s graphic system. Sometimes,  
however, a suitable existing base map can be adapted and customized  
to a sign program’s purposes. At the very least, existing maps and floor  
plans can often be used as a starting point for development of signage‐  
purposed maps.  
Whether designed by the EG designer or an outside specialist, the  
communicative and stylistic treatment of maps and diagrams is as  
unlimited as the communicative and stylistic spectrum of the graphic  
design field. Map design, in particular, can vary from highly realistic and  
geographically accurate to highly diagrammatic and abstract. Several  
examples of different styles of map design are shown in Figures 5.27  
through 5.31, as well as throughout this book. The key to map design  
is for the map and other diagrammatic elements of a sign program to  
be as stylistically unified with the program’s overall graphic system as  
possible.  
Ways to promote visual unity among a sign program’s diagrams and other  
graphic system elements include using typeface\(s\), symbols, and colors  
that are the same as, or at least compatible with, those elements in the 5.27 Route map at Zion National Park in  
southwestern Utah.  
5.27  
program’s overall graphic system. For example, if the Frutiger type family  
is used for the sign program’s typography, it should also be used for map  
legend typography. Obviously, stylistic unity is easier to control when the  
EG designer is preparing the maps or diagrams. If, on the other hand, the  
maps are being prepared by an outside specialist, the EG designer should  
thoroughly brief that person on the graphic system’s stylistic elements, as  
well as review his or her work in progress.

# Map Orientation  
Map orientation is a major issue in any signage program. When the top of  
the map is oriented in the direction the viewer is facing, it’s described as  
a heads‐up orientation. The heads‐up orientation aids map comprehension  
because viewers are facing what’s directly ahead of them on the map.  
Everything else is also logically oriented to the viewer, too\: What’s on the  
right side of the map is on the viewer’s right, what’s on the map’s left is  
on the viewer’s left, and what’s toward the bottom of the map is behind  
the viewer. Paper maps, which are printed with North at the top, are

complex in Guangdong, China, has a bilingual

in Washington, DC, features a heads‐up,  
perspective orientation to enhance user  
comprehension. In a heads‐up orientation, the  
top of the map is positioned in the direction the  
viewer is facing.

The Graphic System

flexible—viewers can easily rotate them into a heads‐up orientation. GPS‐  
based smart phone and mobile device maps set with North at the top can  
be similarly rotated, or they can be set in a heads‐up orientation, plus they  
have a moving locator dot that indicates the user’s position and directional  
movement on the map. Not so with signage maps. They’re fixed to sign  
hardware structures and can’t be rotated in the hands of the viewer like  
paper maps or customized to a user’s position like mobile device maps.  
Although the heads‐up map orientation on signs is best for viewer  
comprehension, it does pose two logistical problems from a design  
standpoint. First, multiple rotations—typically four, with North, South,  
East, and West at the top of the map—are required to orient a map  
heads‐up with the viewer. These multiple rotations of the underlying  
map also require rotation of any legend typography and symbols, so they  
don’t have to be read sideways or upside down, and rotating and refitting  
legend graphics takes more time than one would think. The second  
logistical problem has to do with the proportions of a map’s footprint. If  
the footprint is anything other than a 1\:1 height‐to‐width proportion, the  
map will take up either more vertical or more horizontal space on the sign  
panel, depending on which way the map is rotated to be in the heads‐up  
orientation. This, in turn, can affect sign panel proportions, as well as the  
layout of other graphic elements on the sign. \(See Figure 5.32.\)  
Due to these logistical problems, which definitely make heads‐up map  
orientation more costly, many sign programs must make do with all maps  
oriented with North at the top, regardless of which direction the viewer is  
facing. This is less than optimum, as the viewer has to go through mental  
gymnastics to interpret the map’s orientation relative to which way he or  
she is facing.

Diagrams  
155 Regardless of whether maps on signs have a heads‐up or North  
orientation, it’s essential to have a prominent graphic indicating where the  
viewer’s location is on the map. This is typically an arrow or a triangular  
shape pointing in the direction the viewer is facing, with the legend “You  
Are Here.”  
# Other Graphic Elements  
In addition to the communicative graphic elements of typography,  
symbols, and arrows, all of which purposefully communicate  
5.33, 5.34, and 5.35 Uses of rules, shapes, and  
patterns as organizing and decorative graphic  
elements.

The Graphic System  
5.34 5.35  
156 information, there are other noncommunicative graphic helpers that  
organize and distinguish the graphic presentation of information on  
signs. These include rules, bars, boxes, circles, and other simple or  
ornate shapes and patterns. These various shapes can also be used as  
decorative features.  
With continuing advances in digital imaging, tonal gradients and imagery  
such as photographs and illustrations can also be used for organizational  
and decorative purposes. As with all graphic design projects, photographic  
and illustrative elements should be carefully selected to enhance a sign  
program’s communication function.  
# Color  
We do not live in a black‐and‐white world, so color is as much an element  
of a sign program’s graphic system as it is of the hardware system.  
There are many ways in which color can be used in signage programs, as  
illustrated in the photos throughout this book.  
As with all the other graphic system elements discussed thus far,  
the intent of this section is to give an overview of color selection  
as it relates to a sign program’s graphic system, rather than to  
provide an extensive discussion of the complex and multihued subject  
of color.  
# The Roles of Color in Signage  
Color plays several roles in a sign program’s graphic system, and it can  
play these roles individually or severally\:  
• To stand out from or blend in with the sign environment.  
•  
• To augment the meaning of sign messages.  
•  
• To distinguish messages from one another.  
•  
• To be decorative.  
•  
Before looking at each of these roles of color in sign graphics,  
it’s important to know that the EG designer doesn’t always have  
free rein when it comes to selecting a color vocabulary for a sign  
program. For certain signage programs, use of specific colors may  
be mandated by official bodies, or dictated by brand identity color  
standards. And the EG designer should always investigate cultural  
connotations of color when designing a sign program for overseas  
projects.

# Navigating the MUTCD Community  
# Wayfinding Sign Guidelines  
# Craig Berger  
The last five years have seen a massive shift in  
the way community wayfinding programs are  
developed and regulated. Previous to 2009 there  
were no official guidelines for the development of  
wayfinding signs on public roadways in towns and  
cities. This meant that any wayfinding program  
that deviated from the Manual for Uniform  
Traffic Control Devices \(MUTCD\) standards was  
considered “nonconforming” and potentially  
illegal. State and local officials often permitted  
these programs by using provisions allowing  
for experimentation or by allowing for greater  
flexibility within the guidelines. In some cases,  
systems were installed without official approval,  
figuring it was easier to ask for forgiveness than  
permission.  
The Federal Highway Administration \(FHWA\),  
the federal agency responsible for providing  
guidance on regulatory signs administered by  
the states, worked closely with the planning  
and design community to change this situation  
and create standards that would be easily  
understood by state regulatory officials  
and cities and towns implementing the system.  
These community standards are found in  
section 2D.50 of the MUTCD, which begins  
to use the term wayfinding for the first time  
in the guidelines, marking a radical shift in the  
acceptance and promotion of these programs.  
Since 2009 the number of programs have  
multiplied and even small towns have developed  
programs with the reassurance that they would  
be approved.  
# Community Sign Highlights  
The community wayfinding sign guidelines focus  
on resolving a number of issues that are most  
common in the development of these programs.  
These include\:  
Jurisdiction\: The guidelines make clear  
that community wayfinding signs are meant  
for conventional roads only and should not  
be used on limited access highways and  
expressways. The signs that are used in these  
highway environments can coordinate with  
community sign standards through color  
coordination and destination nomenclature  
consistency. Many state agencies encourage  
the use of gateway signs at the ends of highway  
exit ramps to make clear the transition from the  
highway sign system to the community sign  
system.  
Responsibility\: The guidelines are flexible when  
it comes to the creation of areas of responsibility  
or “sign districts,” where community wayfinding  
design and planning guidelines are created. These  
jurisdictions can consist of a neighborhood,  
municipality, or collection of adjacent  
municipalities. These sign districts can control the  
destinations permitted on the signs, what signs  
can be installed, and the appearance of the signs.  
State regulatory bodies generally need to approve  
these districts.  
Color\: The new guidelines substantially open  
up the color palette for use on signs with a  
wide range of colors permitted except those  
that match the colors designated for highway,  
trailblazer, regulatory, park, or other signs  
outlined in the MUTCD. The guidelines encourage  
colors that provide maximum contrast with the  
sign messages as well as systems that use  
multiple colors to differentiate neighborhoods  
and districts. The guidelines also encourage  
158 Navigating the MUTCD Community Wayfinding Sign Guidelines continued  
\(but do not require\) lines of color to separate  
messages.  
Fonts\: The guidelines open up the use of different  
typefaces beyond the Highway Gothic and  
Clearview fonts permitted on traditional highway  
and trailblazer signs. Community signs can use  
any font as long as an engineering study has  
shown that the font exceeds the legibility standard  
established by Highway Gothic. While this is not an  
insurmountable barrier the cost of these studies  
has limited the number of new fonts being used.  
The few additional approved typefaces include  
Futura \(research was developed as part of the  
Miami Beach sign program\) and NPS Rawlinson  
\(developed for the National Park Service\). Most  
community sign systems use Clearview, which is  
the typeface used on many new highway signs.  
A study developed by Penn State University  
human factors researchers that focused on arrows  
for National Park Service signage showed that a  
wide number of arrow styles surpass the official  
highway arrow legibility standard, so a wide  
diversity of arrows are allowed on community  
wayfinding signs.  
Fonts are expected to be upper‐ and lowercase  
for destinations with all uppercase allowed for  
headers and secondary information \(in addition,  
nonapproved fonts are allowed for this secondary  
information\). Font heights must be selected based  
on standard legibility criteria, such as a minimum of  
4″ letter heights.  
Messages\: The number of messages on a sign is  
limited to three. Destination names are encouraged  
to be written in full with abbreviations used only  
when necessary.  
Symbols\: Symbols \(pictographs\) are permitted on  
signs but cannot be more than twice the height of  
the font being used. The goal of this standard is to  
ensure a balance between the symbols and fonts  
displayed on the signs.  
The community wayfinding guidelines have  
made the development of systems far easier  
and have produced a number of new programs  
that have served as precedents. Most planners  
and regulatory officials use the guidelines as  
a tool, along with best practices and research  
to ensure the most legible signs are approved.  
Color  
159 Navigating the MUTCD Community Wayfinding Sign Guidelines continued  
Many officials still need to be educated about  
the flexibility of the standards, however, and  
designers who develop these projects have to be  
well versed in the MUTCD requirements, as well  
as possible interpretations that allow for design  
innovation.  
When developing a community wayfinding program  
there are three important steps to facilitate system  
approval\:  
Involve state officials before beginning design\:  
It is important for all parties to understand the  
precedents and guideline interpretations before  
starting the design process. Mutual understanding  
will foster a smoother design process.  
Understand the use of precedents\: Not all  
built projects present a correct understanding  
of the guidelines. It is important to use project  
precedents that highlight correct interpretation of  
the guidelines.  
Think about research\: For larger projects research  
may be needed to prove the effectiveness of  
different typefaces. This kind of research has been  
done for the last 20 years and can be part of an  
individual sign project.  
Craig Berger is the Chair of the Exhibition Program at the Fashion  
Institute of Technology and is a national leader in community  
and urban wayfinding programs. He is author of the Urban  
Wayfinding Workbook, available through the International Sign  
Association.  
The Graphic System  
An example of a situation where colors may be mandated by official  
bodies include cases where local codes require the use of red for  
typographic or pictorial sign messages of a warning or emergency  
nature. Another case in which official bodies may be involved in  
color selection is in city signage programs that interface with public  
roadways, referred to as Community Wayfinding Signs in the federal  
Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices \(MUTCD\). The MUTCD is the  
bible of official U.S. traffic and roadway signage, and MUTCD Section  
2D.50 contains provisions for Community Wayfinding Signs that must  
be heeded by any EG designer involved with city or urban signage  
programs. Also, such programs almost invariably involve the participation  
of local Department of Transportation \(DOT\) officials, who may or may  
not insist that the city sign program conform to the color or other  
standards indicated in the MUTCD for various categories of roadway  
signs, including Community Wayfinding Signs. The MUTCD, which is a  
useful but unwieldy document, should be on the reference list of any  
EG designer involved with city or urban signage programs, and can be  
accessed at www.mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov.  
Even when a given sign program isn’t affected by official bodies, the  
EG designer still isn’t necessarily free to explore a rainbow of colors. If  
the client is a large corporation or an institution, such as a university or  
a transportation authority, it likely has a graphic standards program to  
promote a consistent graphic or brand identity. These graphic standards  
160 programs typically dictate specific colors that can be used for sign  
graphics, as well as typefaces and symbol vocabularies.  
One last word about official restrictions on color use\: The current SAD  
recommends a minimum of 70 percent contrast ratio between the  
figure and the ground of sign graphics. Here, the word figure refers  
to the typographic and pictorial graphic elements, and ground refers  
to the background on which they appear. Note that this is currently a  
recommendation, not a requirement. Nevertheless, EG designers should  
use best practices for good legibility of sign graphics by maintaining  
adequate contrast between figure and ground—so it’s best to reserve use  
of subtle, understated color contrast for print and Web graphics.  
Theoretically, white figures on a black ground, or vice versa, have a  
100 percent contrast ratio, even though white never reflects 100 percent  
of the light that hits it and black never reflects zero percent. So, how  
does one determine the contrast of black or white graphics on a color  
background, a given color of graphics on a different‐color background, or  
multiple adjacent colors? Light reflectance values \(LRVs\) are helpful in this  
determination, and are available for most paint color systems, including  
Matthews, a major U.S. manufacturer of sign industry paints. Note that  
LRVs aren’t available for other color systems that many EG designers use,  
such as the Pantone system. Section 4.1 of the SEGD 2012 ADA White  
Paper Update contains a formula for calculating contrast percentages  
based on LRVs.  
# Color Selection Considerations  
Now that we’ve discussed a number of the constraints on color selection  
for sign graphics, it’s time to move on to the color considerations on  
projects for which the EG designer does have some freedom to select  
colors for the sign graphic system.  
Color can play a role in whether signs stand out from or harmonize with  
the sign environment. For those projects where navigation decisions  
must be quickly and easily made, such as transportation facilities, a goal  
may be to make the signs stand out from their surrounding environment  
so that they can be easily distinguished, read, and acted upon. In such  
cases, color can be one of the most obvious factors to set the sign  
program apart from its surrounding environment. For other projects,  
a goal may be to make the sign program blend in more closely with  
its setting, which can be achieved through the use of sign colors that  
harmonize with the environmental setting. In general, depending on  
the overall color palette of a given sign environment, bright, saturated  
colors can enliven and stand out from the environment, and neutral,  
more subtle colors can blend with or recede from the environment. \(See  
Figures 5.36 and 5.37.\)  
Color  
161 5.36 Bright orange letter returns provide  
dramatic contrast with the subdued color palette  
of this Nassau Community College building in  
New York.  
5.37 Brown sign structure harmonizes with the  
urban setting of Mill Pond Park on New York  
City’s East River.  
5.38 Color can be used to augment a message,  
as in this example where the color green  
reinforces the meaning of recycling.  
5.36  
Color can also play roles in augmenting the meaning of sign messages  
and in distinguishing sign messages from one another. Obvious ways  
color can augment the meaning of a message is when the color red  
is used for warning or emergency messages, and yellow is used for  
attention‐getting messages. When color is used to augment or distinguish  
sign messages, the color can be used for either the message graphics  
themselves \(the figure\) or the message background \(the ground\). \(See  
Figure 5.38.\) Sometimes color is used in other graphic elements such as  
squares, bars, or circles to augment or distinguish sign messages.

# Color‐Coding  
The use of color to communicate meaning in sign graphics leads to the  
topic of color‐coding. Color‐coding links a given message with a given  
color to reinforce the message and to distinguish it from other messages.  
For color‐coding to be effective in signage, a message and color must be  
linked, because color by itself is generally too ambiguous to communicate  
a specific message clearly. \(See Figures 5.39 and 5.40.\)  
One of the few instances where color alone communicates a clear  
message is with traffic signals, but that’s because the driving population  
worldwide has been trained over time to stop on red and go on green.  
Yet even this clear‐cut response doesn’t translate to uses of red and  
green in signage. For example, in many countries, green is used for  
exit sign graphics because of its association with the concept of go,  
as in “Go out through this exit.” In other countries, however, exit sign  
graphics are red because of its association with danger, warning, and  
emergency, regardless of the seeming illogic that red is also associated  
with the concept of stop, as in “Do not proceed through this exit.”  
There are two points here\: First, the meanings associated with colors  
are learned and, second, those meanings vary with geographical  
location and culture.  
Most transit systems worldwide use some form of color‐coding—in  
association with numbers, letters, or names—on maps and signage to  
help users distinguish one route from another. Color‐coding can also  
be useful for signage programs for large, complex, nontransit‐related  
Color  
163 5.40 Map for a large high school campus in  
Australia uses color to distinguish buildings,  
functions, and departments.  
5.40  
The Graphic System  
sites, such as in cities, airports, hospital complexes, and arenas and  
stadiums.  
Coming back to the MUTCD and DOTs, color‐coding is also used officially  
for the backgrounds of traffic and roadway signage throughout the United  
States, even though many drivers in this country don’t really realize the  
significance of the background colors. These official road sign background  
colors are listed in the MUTCD.  
Clearly, color‐coded sign graphics can be useful for both transit‐related and  
large nontransit sign programs, but they should be used thoughtfully and  
judiciously, for excessive or inappropriate use of color‐coding can actually  
impair rather than enhance the communication effectiveness of a sign  
program. Color‐coding is not a panacea for unclear message nomenclature  
and should never be relied on to substitute for a poorly formulated sign  
information content system. Keep in mind, too, that many people have  
impaired color perception and cannot distinguish between certain colors.  
And, of course, the more colors that are used in a color‐coding vocabulary,  
the more visually complex the vocabulary becomes, making it difficult for  
people to distinguish among the various colors and to learn the meaning  
associated with each color.  
In addition to aiding communication and helping sign programs contrast  
or blend with their environments, color in sign graphics can also play a  
decorative role. Sign graphic color schemes can range from bold and  
playful to subtle and sophisticated. As always, every project is different  
so the key is to select a color palette that meshes with the goals of the  
project at hand, while aiming for the recommended 70 percent SAD  
contrast ratio.  
164 Color Palette Sources  
There are several sources for the selection and specification of the color  
palette for a sign program’s graphic system. One source commonly used by  
EG designers is the Pantone Matching System \(PMS\), which offers a large  
range of color swatches, each coded by a number for specification use.  
The Pantone system was developed as a color standardization and mixing  
guide for inks used on presses in the commercial printing industry, and is  
therefore perhaps not the best source for color palettes used in the sign  
industry. However, most EG designers with a graphic design background  
are familiar with the PMS system and it resides in the color swatch libraries  
of the vector drawing programs typically used by EG designers. Most  
manufacturers of sign coating materials such as paint and vinyl can analyze  
a Pantone color swatch and create a dead‐on or acceptably accurate match  
for it in paint and other coating media. Additionally, some standard vinyl  
colors are cross‐matched to commonly specified Pantone colors.  
Although the Pantone system does contain a seemingly mind‐boggling  
range of color swatches, it sometimes just doesn’t offer the exact color that  
you, the EG designer, are searching for. In these situations, the color libraries  
of paint companies offer more options, including metallic, metalflake,  
iridescent, pearlescent, and other exotic colors. As with the Pantone system,  
each paint swatch in these libraries is identified by a number and/or name.  
Many companies manufacture paint in the United States, but only a few  
manufacture paint formulated for sign applications, and the U.S. sign  
paint manufacturing industry is rapidly consolidating. Regardless, it’s best  
to start with the color libraries from manufacturers of paints for the sign  
industry, such as Matthews and AkzoNobel. If the must‐have color is in  
the library of a nonsign paint company, such as Benjamin Moore or Pratt  
& Lambert, the EG designer can provide a swatch of the desired color for  
matching by a sign paint manufacturer.  
Keep in mind that the gloss level of paint and other sign coatings affects how  
a given color is perceived. If a paint or coating has a high gloss level, its color  
will appear deeper and richer than the same color with a matte gloss level.  
Also keep in mind that the ADA comes into play on paint and other sign  
coatings and finishes, requiring a “non‐glare finish.” Coatings, gloss levels,  
and finishes are discussed further in Chapter 6, “The Hardware System.”  
# Layout  
Thus far we’ve covered typography, symbols and arrows, color, and other  
graphic elements, which can be considered the ingredients, so to speak, of  
the graphic system recipe. Layout is the process part of the recipe, during  
which the EG designer sizes and arranges these graphic ingredients into  
Layout  
165 The Graphic System  
166  
formats that determine the visual unity, clarity, and style of the graphic  
system. Just like cooking, designing layouts is a highly creative process with  
almost limitless options, just a few of which are explored in this section.  
Sign layout expresses the visual character of a sign program’s graphic  
system. Layouts can be bold and flashy or quiet and subtle; they can be  
contemporary or traditional; they can be clean and straightforward or  
complex and rich. Accordingly, the visual appearance of the sign graphic  
system should be considered in conjunction with the appearance of the  
hardware system, for the appearance of each system affects the other,  
particularly in terms of size and proportion of sign faces.  
Layout cannot meaningfully take place until the sign information content  
system is finalized—that is, the message content for every sign in the  
program is known. The message content, along with the size and layout  
of sign graphics, affects the size of each sign object in a program, thereby  
ultimately affecting the program’s hardware system. Accordingly, one  
of the key tasks in the layout process is determining the size of the  
graphics for each sign type. Viewing distance is the chief determinant of  
typographic size for signage programs, although typographic size can also  
be mandated by local codes and the ADA.  
# Sizing Typography for Viewing Distance  
As stated in Chapter 4, “The Information Content System,” effective  
signage must have adequately sized graphics so users have enough time  
to read a sign message, understand it, and act on it safely by the time they  
reach the decision point. Other factors, such as the hierarchical rank of a  
sign message \(primary, secondary, etc.\), whether the sign is exterior or  
interior, whether the sign is for pedestrian or vehicular users, sign viewing  
angle and setback, the ADA, and more, all interact with viewing distance to  
determine the size of sign typography. \(See Figure 5.41.\)  
As a starting point for sizing sign typography, an informal rule of thumb is  
that 1″ of character height, as measured on a nonrounded capital character  
such as an E, H, or I should be allowed for every 50′ of viewing distance.  
According to this ratio, sign typography to be viewed from a distance of  
500′ should theoretically have a 10″ cap height; sign typography that’s to  
be viewed from 50′ should theoretically have a 1″ cap height.  
We use the word theoretically here because this 1\:50 rule of thumb is not  
hard and fast, as is no rule of thumb. And it’s not without challengers. In  
fact, some experts advocate a more conservative ratio of 1″ of cap height  
for every 25′ of viewing distance. Another challenger of the 1\:50 formula  
is the ADA, which mandates minimum and maximum cap heights for  
tactile/raised characters, and the new SAD, which has a complex table for  
determining the cap height of visual characters in interior environments  
based on character mounting height zones and horizontal proximity 5.41  
distance. Message hierarchy also raises a challenge to this formula, in that  
primary messages should be larger than secondary messages on a given  
sign. Additionally, local codes sometimes mandate specific cap heights for  
certain sign messages.  
A word about cap height is in order here. The use of cap height is key to the  
graphic system for signage. In signage graphics, capital letter height is used  
as the measurement standard, instead of typographic point size, which  
is used for print and Web graphics. In the U.S., cap height is expressed in  
inches or fractions thereof, usually in units no smaller than 1/16“. Cap height  
standards use nonrounded letters, typically a capital I, because they’re  
more easily measured, and because rounded letters such as C, O, and S,  
are larger than nonrounded letters, to maintain optical balance in typeface  
design. \(See Figure 5.42.\) Similarly, rounded lowercase letters are also  
larger than nonrounded ones. Keep in mind that lowercase letters also have  
descenders, which fall below the baseline of capital letters; and ascenders,  
which, in many typefaces, rise above the cap height line.  
The dynamics of reading, understanding, and acting on sign information  
are compounded and more critical in driving situations; consequently,  
more complex formulas are needed as starting points for determining  
vehicular signage cap heights. As an example, the formula shown in  
# AIZ COS

5.41 Primary and secondary sign information on  
a directional sign at the Ohio State University.  
5.42 Always measure cap height on flat  
or squared‐off characters, because round  
characters are larger than the cap height  
to provide optical balance among different  
character shapes.

the variables of speed, setback, and message  
quantity.  
5.44 and 5.45 Whether on an informal or  
more formalized basis, typographic legibility  
and sizing should be tested with mockups and  
prototypes of sign faces.

Figure 5.43 accommodates such dynamics as speed, setback, and other  
vital factors for vehicular signage. The MUTCD’s companion volume,  
Standard Highway Signs, also provides guidance on cap heights for  
various kinds of vehicular signs.  
Certainly, formulas and reference guides are useful starting points  
for determining cap heights, but the only sure way to confirm that  
typographic sizing is adequate is to test it with mockups and prototypes,  
optimally under the actual conditions that the signs will be viewed. The  
degree and formality of such testing varies with each project and design  
budget, but some form or another of testing and confirming cap heights  
is highly recommended for every signage project, especially those with a  
vehicular signage component. \(See Figures 5.44 and 5.45.\)  
5.44 5.45  
# Other Factors Affecting Layouts  
Sizing sign typography to viewing distance, or to code‐ or ADA‐mandated  
sizes, is a fundamental aspect of developing sign layouts, but there are  
other aspects that influence the ultimate design and overall size and  
proportion of layouts. These include\:  
• Proportion of symbols and arrows in relation to typography  
•  
• Position of symbols and arrows in relation to typography  
•  
• Spacing around and between graphic elements  
•  
• Layout format proportions  
•  
• ADA/SAD guidelines  
•  
# Proportions of Graphic Elements  
There is no “one way” to proportion symbols and arrows in relation to  
typography, but suffice it to say that symbols and arrows should be large  
enough relative to the typography to ensure they are clearly visible in  
directional sign layouts.  
With arrows, which are relatively clear‐cut shapes, a common method  
is to size either the width or height of the arrow to the cap height of  
the typography. Symbols are more difficult because they can be more  
visually complex than arrows, and are often too small to be legible  
Layout  
169 5.46  
5.46 When arrows and symbols are sized to  
typographic cap height, symbols may be too  
small to be legible.  
5.47 Arrows and symbols sized at 120 and  
150 percent of cap height.  
when sized to the cap height of the typography, particularly if they are  
enclosed by a square or circular surround. In such instances, symbols  
can be sized to a multiple of the cap height\: for example, at 1.2 times  
the cap height, which makes the symbols 20 percent larger than the  
cap height; or at 1.5 times, which is 50 percent larger. Of course,  
arrows can be sized to the same proportions as symbols in relation  
to the typography. Once proportional relationships are established  
between symbols, arrows, and typography, those relationships should  
be maintained as consistently as possible for all typographic cap heights  
displayed on the signs. \(See Figures 5.46 through 5.48.\)  
# Positions of Graphic Elements  
As with the proportional relationships of typography, symbols, and arrows,  
there are several options for the way they are positioned in relation to  
each other in directional sign layouts. Two of these options, shown in  
Figures 5.49 and 5.50, include\:  
• Side‐by‐side positioning \(arrows and symbols positioned in line with  
•  
typography\)  
• Stacked positioning \(arrows and symbols positioned above \[or below\]  
•  
typography\)  
As can be seen from the simple examples in Figure 5.51, the proportions  
of the sign face can vary depending on whether the graphic elements are  
positioned side‐by‐side or stacked.  
When arrows and symbols are positioned in line with the typography,  
there are several options for aligning them horizontally. A commonly  
The Graphic System

5.48 Once established, proportional  
relationships among graphic elements should be  
maintained at various sizes.  
5.49 Arrows and symbols positioned side‐by‐  
side, or in line, with typography. In this example,  
bottoms of arrows and symbols align with the  
typographic baseline.  
5.50 Arrows and symbols positioned above,  
or stacked, with typography. In this example,  
the vertical space separating them is .5 of the  
typography’s cap height.  
5.51 Sign face proportions can vary with  
side‐by‐side or stacked positioning of arrows/  
symbols and typography.

171 Typography  
5.52  
5.52 Horizontal centerlines of arrows, symbols,  
and typography aligned.  
The Graphic System  
used method is to align the horizontal centerlines of the symbols and  
arrows with the horizontal centerline of the typographic cap height.  
\(See Figure 5.52.\) Similarly, if the arrows and symbols are positioned  
above or below the typography, their alignment in relation to each other  
and their distance from the typography need to be established.  
To compound the two positioning options just described for layouts—  
and their creative possibilities—arrows and symbols can be placed to  
the left or right of the typography, or be centered with the typography,  
if the arrows/symbols are positioned above or below the typography.  
But this is not to say that symbols and arrows are necessarily always  
paired with each other; for example, arrows may be set off from the  
typography, whereas the symbols may be placed at the end of a line of  
typography.  
Note that it’s fairly common to place arrows at the left side of a  
sign layout regardless of which direction the arrows are pointing, or  
whether the arrows are positioned in line with or above/below the  
typography. Considering that most languages are read from left to  
right, left placement of arrows makes sense, as it fixes the arrows at  
the beginning of each sign message. It also organizes all the arrows on  
the left side of the sign layout. Of course, there are also valid reasons,  
such as MUTCD standards, to place arrows on the same side of the  
typography in which the arrow is pointing—for example, placing right‐  
pointing arrows to the right side of the message typography. Again,  
the possibilities for positioning and aligning typography, symbols, and  
arrows in sign layouts are endless, but once a positioning scheme is  
determined, it should generally be employed across the entire range  
of sign types in a program, to enhance visual consistency. The Gallery  
section at the end of this book shows graphic element alignment  
schemes within a variety of sign programs.  
# Spacing of Graphic Elements  
Spacing around and between graphic elements also affects sign  
layout proportions and sizes. The terms figure and ground, which were  
introduced earlier in this chapter, can be linked to the discussion in  
Chapter 4, “The Information Content System”; specifically, the figure is  
the message footprint, consisting of the typographic and other graphic  
172 elements, and the ground is the background area, or sign face perimeter,  
consisting of dead space in which the figure is displayed. The space taken  
up by the figure graphics is termed the live space or live area, so a sign  
face consists of both live and dead space.  
Recall from Chapter 4 that the live space consumes significantly less than  
100 percent of a sign face’s area. The rest of the sign face is taken up by  
dead space, which includes\:  
• Margins around the perimeter of the sign face  
•  
• Horizontal letter and word spacing within lines of typography  
•  
• Horizontal spacing between side‐by‐side graphic elements, such as  
•  
gutters between arrows, symbols, and typography  
• Vertical spacing between lines of typography  
•  
• Vertical spacing between stacked graphic elements, such as spacing  
•  
between typography and other graphic elements  
Dead space is essential for the legibility, clarity, and organized appearance  
of the sign graphic system, so this section explores each of the dead  
space elements.  
Margins are the dead space around the perimeter of a sign face, and  
each sign has a top, bottom, left, and right margin. As with most other  
aspects of layout development, there’s no magic rule for determining  
how large or small margins should be. Needless to say, however,  
margins should not be so small that the graphics appear too close to  
the sign perimeter, nor so large that the graphics appear dwarfed by  
the margins. A good starting place is to look at margins that equal  
the cap height of the primary message in the layout; for example,  
1″ margins for typography with a 1″ cap height. This relationship can  
then be enlarged or reduced by multiples of the cap height, such as  
by 1.2 times cap height for a larger margin or by .8 times cap height  
for smaller margins. And here’s a visual balance tip for horizontally  
centered layouts\: Bottom margins should always be slightly larger than  
top margins to make them appear equal, as shown in Figure 5.53. This  
trick is borrowed from picture‐framing professionals, who cut picture  
mattes with the bottom matte border slightly larger than the top. It  
makes sense for arranging type, too, because descenders hang below  
the typographic baseline.  
Horizontal spacing within lines of typography includes letterspacing and  
word spacing, both of which are essential for good type legibility.  
• Letterspacing or tracking, the space that separates the letters within  
•  
words, was covered earlier in this chapter.  
Layout  
173 5.53 To achieve visual balance on horizontally  
centered layouts, make the bottom margin  
slightly larger than the top margin.  
5.53  
The Graphic System  
• Word spacing is the space that separates words, and it typically  
•  
automatically adjusts with the letterspacing, or tracking, that is  
specified when type is set on computer programs used by EG  
designers and sign fabricators.  
Horizontal spacing is also necessary between side‐by‐side graphic  
elements, such as gutters between arrows, symbols, and typography. The  
term gutter, which comes from print graphic design, refers to the space  
between columns of text on a page. Similarly, in signage graphics, gutter  
can refer to the space between columns of arrows and typography, or the  
space between columns of arrows and symbols. A good starting point  
is to use half \(.5\) the cap height as the unit for gutter spacing, and then  
adjust it by a greater or lesser multiple, if desired. The same is the case for  
horizontal spacing of symbols or arrows that are placed at the end of lines  
of typography. The key to effective horizontal spacing of graphic elements  
is to space them closely enough so that they appear to belong together  
and to conserve sign space, but not so tight that the elements appear too  
crowded. \(See Figure 5.54.\)  
As shown in Figure 5.55, typographic line spacing is an important vertical  
spacing element, and can be expressed in two ways\:  
• As the unit between the baseline of one line of typography to the  
•  
baseline of the next line of typography \(baseline to baseline spacing\),  
which is the open space between the lines plus the cap height.  
• As the unit between the baseline of one line of typography to the cap  
•  
height of the next line of typography \(baseline to cap height spacing\),  
which is the open space itself between the lines.  
A starting place for determining the amount of vertical line spacing on  
a baseline‐to‐cap height basis is to allow half \(.5\) the cap height, which  
translates to 1.5 cap height from baseline to baseline. This ratio can then  
be adjusted up or down depending on the typeface being used and other  
factors. For example, the ratio may have to be increased for typefaces  
with ascenders that rise above the cap height, or decreased if the  
174 Typography  
# Typography

typography is set in all capitals. Note that for both tactile/raised and visual  
characters, the SAD has specific requirements for baseline‐to‐baseline  
spacing of multiple‐lined messages.  
The line spacing starting‐place ratio discussed above is fine for a single  
message that continues on multiple lines of typography. But another  
consideration when determining line spacing is how to separate multiple  
messages, which can each be single or multiple lines, on a given sign  
layout. Obviously, if all the messages have the same line spacing, it’s hard  
to distinguish one message from another. In such cases, a larger line‐  
spacing ratio is needed between messages than within each message.  
\(See Figure 5.56.\)  
Vertical spacing between stacked graphic elements, such as between  
typography and symbols and/or arrows, is also a layout consideration,  
as when symbols or arrows are placed above or below typography  
or each other, as shown earlier in Figure 5.50. Again, a good starting  
point is to use half the cap height as the open‐space ratio between  
the stacked elements, then adjust it up or down to visually balance  
the layout.  
Note that in addition to the ADA line spacing requirements mentioned  
above, the SAD has specific requirements affecting the size,  
positioning, and spacing of graphic elements on permanent room  
identification signs.  
# Layout Format Proportions  
Layout format proportions pertain to the perimeters of the various sign  
types/faces within a program. The proportions of layout formats ultimately  
translate into the proportions of sign faces or panels, as expressed in the  
sign hardware system. Layout format proportions need to account for  
the maximum quantity of information that is programmed for any given  
5.54 Gutter spacing between arrows, symbols,  
and typography should not be too tight or too  
open.

sign type, and the formats can be imposed by site conditions, by the EG  
designer, or by a combination of both.  
An example of a layout format being imposed by site conditions is  
when low ceiling heights require horizontally formatted overhead  
signs to fit the programmed messages, typically arranged in multiple  
columns across the sign face. An example of a designer‐imposed  
layout format is when the EG designer decides that all the signs  
in a program will have a square format. Usually, the layout format  
proportions for comprehensive sign programs end up being determined  
by both site conditions and the EG designer. Obviously, the fewer  
different format proportions a sign program has, the more visually  
unified the program will be.  
Once formats have been established, the EG designer has many ways to  
place the typography and other graphic elements, both horizontally and  
vertically, onto the formats.  
• Regarding horizontal alignment, the graphic elements can be arranged  
•  
to align flush left, centered, or flush right.  
• Regarding vertical placement, the graphic elements can be arranged at  
•  
the top, center, or bottom of the sign format.  
Figure 5.57 contains a matrix showing these various basic placement  
options.  
Because both single‐ and multiple‐line messages may be programmed  
for a given sign format, the EG designer also has options for vertical  
placement of single‐ and multiple‐line messages on the same format.

# Message Content and Layout  
As noted, any variety of messages can appear on a given sign type,  
which is a critical factor when designing layouts. Since the quantity of  
message content and the size of the graphics determine the final size  
and proportional format of a sign type, it is imperative to design layouts  
for the worst case—meaning the longest—message or set of messages  
that is to appear on that sign type. Consider a simple example of a  
theoretical Sign Type A programmed to display a variety of messages,  
ranging from Women to Electrical Equipment Room—No Storage. If a  
Sign Type A layout is sized to accommodate only the short message,  
then longer messages will not fit in the sign format, which can lead to  
costly design or fabrication changes after the sign design package has  
been finalized.  
The importance of designing layouts to accommodate the longest  
message or messages cannot be overstated. The problem is not  
fitting less information at a readable or mandated size onto a sign

of a given size; the problem is fitting more information than planned  
for. Remember that a sign can always display less information but  
that more can’t be crammed onto it—at least not at functional or  
ADA‐ or code‐mandated sizes. This is the single most important  
reason that it is imperative to develop the sign program’s information  
content system\: so that the EG designer can identify the largest  
message content a layout must accommodate before designing the  
graphic system. To ignore worst‐case scenarios in layout development  
is to invite costly design and/or fabrication changes further on in the  
design process.  
Another important point to keep in mind is that—again, depending on  
message content—multiple layouts can be designed for a given sign  
format. For example, a theoretical Sign Type B could display directional  
information on one unit and identification information on another, and  
different layouts would be required for each of these kinds of messages.  
And as stated in Chapter 4, “The Information Content System,” the fewer  
the sign types, the more economical and ecological the sign program is to  
fabricate, and the more unified its appearance. Therefore, it makes sense  
to display different kinds of information on a given sign type and develop  
corresponding layouts, rather than to develop a different sign type for each  
kind of information. \(See Figure 5.59.\) In Case of Fire,

# Destination Arrangement on Directional Signs  
More often than not, directional signs display multiple destinations, with  
arrows pointing in several different directions. This raises the question of  
how to arrange these destinations and the arrows linked to them in the  
sign layout. There is no standard method for destination arrangement, but  
there are several options, including the following\:  
• Arrange by arrow direction, whereby all destinations in each given  
•  
direction are listed together in the layout. But we read from left to  
right and top to bottom, so the question then arises as to which  
direction should start the destination listing at the top of the sign  
layout. Some EG designers start by listing destinations to the left  
at the top of the sign, as left turns are typically the most difficult  
to negotiate, and then list directions moving increasingly to the  
right—for example, listing left destinations first, then destinations  
straight ahead, then destinations to the right. Other EG designers  
will list straight‐ahead destinations first, as they’re in the clearest  
line of movement. Regardless of the starting point, the directional  
arrangement order should be consistent for all signs in the program.  
One advantage of arranging by arrow direction is that it’s more  
visually organized—all destinations in a given direction are listed  
together rather than being dispersed throughout the listing. Another  
potential advantage is that one arrow in a given direction can serve  
for multiple destinations, rather than having to pair an arrow with  
each destination.  
• Arrange in alphabetical order, whereby destinations are listed  
•  
alphabetically. The argument for this method is that people look  
for places by name rather than direction, which is a valid premise.  
Its disadvantages are that an arrow must be paired with each  
destination and that directions be interspersed throughout the  
5.59 Different information content and layouts  
displayed on the same format and/or sign type  
promotes visual unity of a sign program.

destination listing—that is, the first destination may be to the  
right, the second to the left, the third to the right, and the fourth  
straight ahead.  
• Arrange by proximity, whereby destinations are listed from the  
•  
nearest to the farthest. The argument for this method is that  
destinations should be listed in the order in which people will  
encounter them, which also has some validity. This method has  
the same disadvantages as the alphabetical arrangement; in  
addition, it requires that the proximity to each destination be  
ascertained from each sign location, to ensure the proper list  
order on each sign.  
• Arrange by importance, whereby someone determines which  
•  
are the primary destinations in an environment, and those  
destinations are always listed at the top of the layout. This method  
gets into message ranking and hierarchy, which was discussed  
in Chapter 4, “The Information Content System,” and it does  
make some sense in certain settings. It does, however, have the  
same disadvantages as the alphabetical arrangement method. An  
additional disadvantage is that it may cause political bickering over  
which destinations are the top‐ranked ones, and this, obviously, can  
cause project delays.  
As noted, there are pros and cons to each of these arrangement  
methods, and since each project is different the EG designer and  
client should agree on which method suits the project at hand  
and use that method consistently throughout the project. Also note  
that these methods can be combined to some extent. For example,  
destinations can be arranged by arrow direction first, and then  
alphabetically within each directional category, as shown in Figure  
5.60\. An example of destinations arranged in alphabetical order is  
shown in Figure 5.61.

5.61 Overview of Sign Graphic Application  
# Processes  
This discussion of the sign graphic system wouldn’t be complete without  
an overview of the basic ways in which graphics can be applied to signs,  
especially because, in addition to layout, graphic application processes  
greatly affect the appearance of a sign program’s graphic system.  
Generally, graphics are applied to a sign in one of three ways\: flat, raised,  
or incised. Basic techniques for each are discussed here, but keep in mind  
that every year many new, proprietary graphic application techniques and  
materials are developed for the sign industry, and that existing techniques  
are being constantly improved. Ways for EG designers to keep abreast of  
these technological developments are to attend the industry expos of the  
International Sign Association \(ISA\) or the SEGD, or to ask sign fabricators  
what new technologies they’re adopting. Also keep in mind that the basic  
techniques described here can be combined with each other and/or with  
lighting treatments \(discussed in Chapter 6, “The Hardware System”\) to  
create truly unique sign graphics.  
As with sign hardware materials and techniques, various sign graphic  
application techniques have various degrees of environmental impact  
regarding resource and energy consumption, solvent release, hazmat use,  
wastestream consequences, and others. EG designers can find helpful  
information on the SEGD website at www.segd.org/green‐resources.  
# Flat Graphics  
Flat graphics are essentially applied to the same plane as the sign surface  
itself. Five common techniques for applying flat graphics to just about any  
sign material include\:  
• Full‐color digital imaging. This is large‐format imprinting, typically by  
•  
inkjet, on any number of opaque or translucent, flexible or rigid substrate  
materials, ranging from cloth to paper to self‐adhesive vinyl films to rigid  
panels up to 2″ thick, with a photographic range of color and continuous  
tone. Digital imaging onto rigid substrates is often called direct imaging  
because it doesn’t involve the application of digitally imaged vinyl film  
to the rigid substrate. Digital imaging for the sign industry is a four‐color  
\(CMYK\) process, typically with the addition of at least two other colors  
such as opaque white, metallic silver, and even gloss or matte spot clear  
coats. Reproduction quality varies with the resolution of digital output, and  
is constantly improving. Other characteristics\: fair to excellent durability,  
depending on substrate, top coatings \(including UV inhibitors\), and in‐  
line ink curing techniques; unlimited color and tonal ranges; and low to  
medium expense. There are several proprietary products in which the  
digitally imaged substrate, typically paper, is laminated or embedded in

translucent, transparent, or reflective vinyl film cut by computer into  
letterforms and other graphic elements. Other characteristics include\:  
excellent reproduction; fair to good durability; limited colors and no tonal  
ranges unless digitally printed; and low expense. Vinyl film manufacturers  
offer a range of grades for various applications and are constantly  
introducing new product lines, colors \(including metallics\), textures, and  
gloss levels; custom color films can be produced if certain minimum  
quantity requirements are met. White or clear vinyl films are a common  
substrate for digitally imaged graphics; less widely available polyolefin  
films offer a greener alternative to vinyl. \(See Figures 5.65 and 5.66.\)

5.68 Porcelain enamel provides excellent  
durability for exterior signs, such as this sign on  
the National Mall in Washington, DC.  
• Screen printing uses thick, opaque inks applied with a silkscreen,  
•  
which is a sophisticated, computer cut or photographically produced  
stencil adhered to a fine mesh material stretched on a frame.  
Silkscreening is also used to apply the adhesive to which metal leaf  
is applied for gilded graphics. Other characteristics include excellent  
reproduction; good to excellent durability; unlimited colors; some limits  
on tonal ranges; and medium to high expense. Frisket painting is a  
similar technique that uses a strippable computer‐cut vinyl stencil, sans  
silkscreen, which is positioned directly on the sign panel or architectural  
surface for application of painted graphics. \(See Figure 5.67.\)  
• Porcelain enamel. This glass‐based coating is typically applied  
•  
to steel or aluminum by silkscreening and then fired to melt  
the coating into a hard, smooth, glossy surface. Reproduction  
quality is generally excellent depending on supplier. Other  
characteristics include\: excellent durability—it’s almost  
indestructible; some limits on colors and tonal ranges; and high  
expense. \(See Figure 5.68.\)  
• Handpainting. Using this technique, sign paints are applied by  
•  
hand with a brush, so reproduction quality depends on the skill of  
the painter. Other characteristics include fair to good durability;  
unlimited color and tonal ranges; and low to high expense. In this era  
of increasingly sophisticated computerized sign graphics imaging,  
the almost‐lost art of handpainting is gaining appreciation for its  
humanistic qualities.  
184 Raised Graphics  
Raised graphics are dimensional in that they are raised from a sign or  
architectural surface. Raised graphic applications are important in part  
because, as you’ll recall, tactile/raised Latin and Braille characters are  
required by the ADA for permanent room identification signs.  
Common techniques for raised graphics include\:  
• Cut solid graphics. These are solid letterforms or other graphic  
•  
elements cut from metal, plastic, wood, glass, or stone, and mounted  
to a sign face or an architectural surface. Cutting devices are typically  
computer‐controlled, and include mechanical routers, waterjets,  
and lasers; but these graphics can also be produced by a band saw  
controlled by skilled human hands. Cut solid graphics tend to be  
more suited for smaller, thinner graphic elements, including tactile/  
raised characters, than fabricated graphics \(described next\). Other  
characteristics include generally excellent reproduction; good to  
excellent durability, depending on material; and medium to high  
expense. Also, color availability depends on material or applied paint,  
and tonal range is possible with the application of direct digital imaging  
or digitally imaged self‐adhesive vinyl film. \(See Figure 5.69.\)  
• Fabricated graphics. These are hollow graphics, typically letterforms,  
•  
with faces and sides \(returns\) cut separately and joined together.  
Commonly used materials are metal and plastic, which can be used  
singly or in combination, such as an all‐metal letter or a letter with  
metal returns and a plastic face. Fabricated graphics are mounted  
to a sign face or an architectural surface and are better suited for  
larger, thicker graphics than cut solid graphics. Other characteristics  
include generally excellent reproduction; good to excellent durability;  
and medium to high expense. Also, color availability depends on  
materials or applied paints and films, and tonal range is possible with  
direct imaging or the application of digitally imaged self‐adhesive  
vinyl film. Translucent plastic faces and/or returns can be backlit.  
\(See Figure 5.70.\)  
• Cast metal graphics. These are solid or semi‐hollow letterforms or  
•  
plaques such as medallions, for which metal is melted and cast into a  
mold typically prepared by a craftsperson, with or without digital tools.  
Reproduction quality depends on the skill of the mold maker and/or  
quality of digital tools. Other characteristics include excellent durability;  
possibility of bas relief sculptural effects; colors limited based on metal  
used and/or any paint applied to recessed areas of plaques; no color  
tonal range; and high expense. \(See Figure 5.71.\)  
• Cast plastic graphics. For these graphics, liquid plastic resins are  
•  
cast into letterforms or plaques, with molds made by computer or

logo field at ABC Broadcasting’s New York City  
headquarters.

characteristics include good to excellent reproduction quality;

Opaque photopolymer sheet colors vary with applied paints; tonal  
range is possible with digital imaging. Clear photopolymer sheets  
can have colored paint or digital imaging applied to the back  
\(second\) surface of the material, or can be backed with various  
other materials, including digitally printed paper inserts. \(See  
Figure 5.73.\)  
• Rasters. These are small spheres of metal or plastic partially inset  
•  
into a sign plaque to form Braille characters. Other characteristics  
include\: good to excellent reproduction quality; good to excellent  
durability; colors limited to materials used or can vary with applied  
paints; tonal range not applicable; and medium to high expense.  
\(See Figure 5.74.\)  
• 3D printing is beginning to find applications in signage, particularly  
•  
for graphics raised from a flat background. 3D printing is an additive  
manufacturing \(AM\) process, which builds up layers of fusible material,  
typically plastic, into three‐dimensional shapes from a digital model;  
this high‐tech process is somewhat akin to the centuries‐old technology

of building coils of clay into three‐dimensional vessels. 3D printing can  
create highly complex shapes, which could lead to dimensional patterns  
and bas relief images on signage. Although 3D printing is not yet in  
wide use in the signage industry, EG designers and sign fabricators  
alike can begin to embrace this exciting technology and its creative  
potential for dimensional sign graphics.  
# Incised Graphics  
Incised graphics are dimensional, in that they go into the sign’s surface.  
There are several techniques for incising graphics, and many of them can  
also be used for raised graphics.  
• Sandblasted graphics are formed when sand‐based grit is blasted  
•  
with compressed air through a heavy rubber computer‐cut stencil  
mask to carve graphics into the sign surface, which is typically stone  
or glass, but can also include metal. Reproduction quality depends  
on the skill of the sandblaster and/or quality of the digital tools used.  
Other characteristics include excellent durability, unlimited range of  
colors to fill the incised graphics, and medium to high expense. \(See  
Figure 5.75.\)  
• Acid etched graphics are limited to metal and glass, which are  
•  
covered with an acid‐resistant mask in nongraphic areas and then  
exposed to acid, which eats away the base material in graphic areas.  
Other characteristics include excellent reproduction quality, excellent  
durability, unlimited range of fill colors, and medium to high expense.  
\(See Figure 5.76.\)  
188 5.75  
• Engraved or routed graphics are graphics cut into the sign surface with  
•  
mechanical routers, waterjets, and lasers. Higher-end applications are  
computer‐driven; older processes use metal lettering templates in cheap,  
low‐tech applications. Devices can cut partially through the sign surface  
or completely through \(stencil cutting\). Stencil-cut surfaces can be open,  
or can be backed or inlaid with other material; backed and inlaid graphics  
can be internally illuminated. Reproduction quality ranges from very low  
to excellent, depending on technology used. Other characteristics include  
good to excellent durability, color range that varies with technology used,  
and low to high expense. \(See Figures 5.77 through 5.79.\)

# Chapter Wrap‐Up  
This chapter itemized the elemental building blocks of a sign program’s  
graphic system\: typography, symbols and arrows, color, and other graphic  
elements. It then covered the basics of how all these elements are  
“cooked” together to form a cohesive whole in the layout process. And  
just as endless variations on recipes make cooking so creative, there are  
endless variations possible for developing graphic layouts, which frees  
the EG designer’s creative instincts to set the appearance of the sign  
program’s graphic system.  
The chapter also reiterated the importance of developing the information  
content system so that the graphic system can accommodate the worst‐  
case \(i.e., longest\) messages, as well as different kinds of information  
content. The chapter concluded with basic methods for applying graphics  
to signs, which, like layout, play a major role in the appearance of the sign  
program’s graphic system. This chapter also showed how layout affects  
the size and proportion of signs, which sets the stage for designing  
the sign program’s hardware system, as discussed in Chapter 6, “The  
Hardware System.”

# The Hardware System  
# Sign hardware is the physical embodiment of  
# signage—the environmental objects that display the  
# sign information, as conveyed via the sign graphics.  
The Hardware System  
6.1 The sign hardware system.  
The hardware system of a sign program is all the physical “stuff” you  
can actually touch or bump into; it’s the tangible, three‐dimensional \(3D\)  
component of a sign program. The hardware system is also the vocabulary  
of shapes, structures, materials, finishes, mounting, and lighting, as well  
as the method\(s\) the EG designer uses to unify all these elements into a  
family of sign objects. \(See Figure 6.1.\)  
It is the three‐dimensional, sculptural aspect of signage that  
distinguishes it from other forms of graphic design, an aspect that is  
more grounded in industrial and architectural design than graphic design.  
And its intrinsic three‐dimensionality is what makes signage such an  
exciting design challenge. Many people think of signs as basically flat  
objects that display graphics—which they certainly can be—but as this  
chapter will show, a sign program’s hardware system can be far more  
visually rich and exciting than a series of flat panels. In our office, we  
approach the design of a sign program’s hardware system by asking a  
question\: Since signage is inherently three‐dimensional, how can we  
exploit that third dimension?  
This chapter examines the three‐dimensional elements the EG designer  
manipulates in designing the hardware system of a signage program.  
It also provides an overview of basic materials, finishes, coatings, and  
lighting techniques that the EG designer fashions into physical sign  
objects.  
While the focus of this chapter is on fundamental concepts of the 3D  
attributes of signage, keep in mind that aspects of the sign hardware  
system are affected by the ADA and local codes. As with Chapter 5,  
“The Graphic System,” this chapter touches only on some of those  
aspects, and it is not intended to be an exhaustive guide to, nor should  
be considered technical or legal advice on, ADA conformance. See  
Chapters 4 and 5 for sources that provide ADA information, including the  
2010 SAD document itself.  
192  
192 Shape  
Shape, or form, is probably the most obvious expression of a sign  
program’s hardware system. The shapes used in a signage program give  
the program its visual unity and distinctiveness in three‐dimensional  
form. Shapes are virtually limitless for the sign hardware system, and  
basic shapes can be combined and synthesized into even more distinctive  
shapes. This section looks at the vocabularies of basic sign shapes the EG  
designer can manipulate in hardware system design.  
# Basic Sign Shapes Based on Mounting  
Signs do not magically float in space; they must be mounted on or into  
something else, and what they are mounted to is a major determinant of  
the intrinsic form a given sign will take. Basically, signs are mounted on  
horizontal surfaces—such as floors or ceilings—from above or below, or  
on vertical surfaces—such as walls—from the back or side. This leads to  
the following four basic types of mounting\:  
• Freestanding or ground‐mounted, in which the bottom of the sign is  
•  
fixed to a horizontal mounting surface, such as a floor. \(See Figure 6.2.\)  
• Suspended or ceiling‐hung, in which the top of the sign is fixed to a  
•  
horizontal mounting surface, such as a ceiling. \(See Figure 6.3.\)  
• Projecting or flag‐mounted, in which the side of the sign is fixed  
•  
perpendicular to a vertical mounting surface, such as a wall. \(See  
Figure 6.4.\)  
• Flush or flat wall‐mounted, in which the back of the sign is fixed  
•  
parallel to a vertical mounting surface, such as a wall. \(See Figure 6.5.\)

Mamaroneck Public Library, New York.  
The mounting or support structure for each of these types of mounting  
can be either hidden or expressed, leading to the following overall sign  
forms listed below and shown in Figure 6.6.  
Note that all of these types of sign mounting can occur at various heights  
and that the ADA and local codes can affect those heights, as well as  
other sign dimensions, as touched on in Chapter 5, “The Graphic System,”  
and later in this chapter.

or underhang  
• Suspended pendant, in which a sign panel on a single post hangs from  
•  
a ceiling or underhang  
• Suspended multiple‐posted, in which a sign panel on two or more  
•  
posts hangs from a ceiling or underhang  
Projecting Sign Forms  
• Projecting monolith, in which the entire sign body projects from a wall  
•  
or other vertical surface  
• Projecting lollipop, in which a sign panel on a single post projects from  
•  
a wall or other vertical surface  
• Projecting multiple‐posted, in which a sign panel on two or more posts  
•  
projects from a wall or other vertical surface  
Flush‐Mounted Sign Forms  
• Wall plaque, in which the back of the sign is attached to a wall or other  
•  
vertical surface, such as a soffit or transom  
Monolithic sign forms typically have hidden, internal support structures,  
and wall plaques typically don’t require expressed, or visible, mounting  
structures. The support structures are expressed, however, in the other  
sign forms just outlined.  
All of these sign forms, except relatively thin, flush‐mounted ones, can  
be viewed “in the round,” providing opportunities for expression of three‐  
dimensional details, as well as providing faces for graphics on more than one  
side. All non‐flush‐mounted sign forms can have a minimum of two sides for  
graphics, if graphics on two or more sides are appropriate and useful.  
Given the basic sign forms dictated by mounting factors, sign shapes can  
be generated based on geometry in elevation, plan, and sectional views,  
as shown in Figures 6.7 and 6.8.  
• Elevation views depict the vertical surfaces of an object—front, sides  
•  
\(profiles\), and back.  
• Plan views depict the lateral footprint or perimeter of an object as  
•  
viewed from the top.  
• Sectional views expose the internal parts of an object, depicting  
•  
slices cut through an object, either lengthwise \(longitudinal\) or across 6.7 Plan and elevation views of a freestanding  
sign.

The key views of sign shapes are elevation and plan, and they are  
examined in the following sections of this chapter.  
# Vocabulary of Basic Sign Shapes Based on  
# Geometry in Front Elevation  
An unlimited number of sign shapes, as viewed straight‐on in front  
elevation, can be generated from elements of the most basic geometric  
forms\: the circle, square, and triangle. Hence, sign shapes in front  
elevation can be composed of curved, rectilinear, or angled elements, or  
combinations of these elements. Keep in mind that these shapes can be  
used for a sign panel on posts, or can be used monolithically. Also keep in  
mind that graphics are typically most efficiently fitted onto sign shapes that  
are overall rectilinear in front elevation. See Figure 6.9 for a basic vocabulary  
of front elevation shapes. These shapes can also be layered over each other  
to create different plane levels in front elevation, as shown in Figure 6.10.

elevation shape, can also provide a limitless number of plan shapes.  
As with front elevation shapes, plan shapes are composed of curved,  
rectilinear, and angled elements, as well as combinations of them.  
Keep in mind that plan shapes can be used for a sign panel on posts,  
for the posts themselves, and for monolithic sign bodies. Figure 6.11  
shows a basic vocabulary of plan shapes, and Figures 6.12a and 6.12b  
show a sign program with sign panels curved in plan. Also keep in  
mind that some plan shapes, or variations thereof, can be rotated 90  
degrees to the vertical and be used for the side elevations or profiles  
of signs. And to further compound shape generation possibilities,  
different plan shapes can be combined with different front elevation  
shapes, as shown in Figure 6.7, in which a wedge‐shaped plan view is  
combined with a trapezoidal front view to create a distinctive sculptural  
form. A sign combining different plan and elevation shapes is shown in  
Figure 6.13.

# Connotations of Form  
While 3D sign shape and form do not literally communicate information  
in a denotative way as sign graphics do, the 3D aspect of signage has  
powerful stylistic connotations. Three‐dimensional sign forms, and the  
ways the EG designer synthesizes them into sign hardware objects,  
have stylistic connotations in the same way the shapes of typographic  
letterforms do. The key, then, to designing a sign program’s hardware  
system is to determine the appropriate 3D formal qualities for the project  
at hand.  
As an example of some of the formal aspects the EG designer mediates  
in a sign program’s hardware system design, consider the myriad styles of  
that common everyday object we call a chair. Does the chair have a high or  
low seating height? Is it on four legs, a pedestal, or is it cantilevered? Is it  
mobile or stationary? Is it all one material, such as wood, or a combination  
of materials such as steel and leather? Is it upholstered? Is it simple or  
complex? Is it traditional or contemporary? Similar stylistic questions  
come into play when designing a sign program’s hardware system.  
It is beyond the scope of this book to delve into a lengthy examination  
of the connotations of 3D form, as it is a very complex subject, but it’s  
important to highlight a few very basic pointers on signage hardware  
system form\:  
• Some front elevation sign shapes are inherently traditional or  
•  
contemporary. For example, tombstones and horizontal oval shapes  
have more traditional connotations, whereas more basic shapes such  
as squares and circles have more contemporary connotations. \(See  
Figure 6.14.\)  
• Sign objects are often a synthesis of many formal elements—  
•  
particularly those signs with exposed fasteners or exposed structures  
such as posts—and each element has its own formal connotations.  
How these elements fit with and transition to one another is a key to  
the stylistic appearance of the sign object.  
• Generally, the simpler and sleeker the sign objects, the more  
•  
contemporary the appearance of the hardware system. Conversely,  
6.14 6.15  
the more complex and ornate the sign objects, the more traditional the  
appearance of the hardware system. \(See Figure 6.15.\)  
• The stylistic characteristics of the graphic system affect the stylistic  
•  
characteristics of the hardware system, and generally speaking the  
two should mesh. For example, a crisp, contemporary graphic system  
is better suited to a contemporary hardware system. Of course, there  
are some projects in which juxtaposing contemporary graphics with  
traditional hardware is entirely appropriate, even if difficult to pull off.  
• Just as the appearance of the sign graphic system can be quiet and  
•  
elegant or bold and flashy, so can the appearance of the hardware  
system. The key is determining which stylistic approach is most  
appropriate to a given project. For example, clean, simple, almost  
utilitarian hardware forms may be appropriate for a subway system’s  
signage, but not for a grand hotel’s signage. \(See Figures 6.16 and 6.17.\)  
6.15 Complex, elaborate sign shapes tend to  
be more traditional in appearance, in contrast  
to simpler, sleeker shapes, which tend to be  
contemporary in appearance.

The Hardware System  
At our office, we discuss whether a sign program’s hardware system  
should fade away or stand out from the project environment, which has  
some correlation to the concepts of harmony and imposition discussed  
in Chapter 1, “What Is Environmental Graphic Design?”  
# Unity of Form  
It’s relatively easy to develop shape or form for a single sign or type of  
sign, but signage programs are typically composed of several types of  
signs, which can range from small wall plaques to large freestanding  
and suspended units and everything in between. In other words, the EG  
designer must design a whole family of signs for a given project, and  
this family must be unified in appearance to enhance the sign program’s  
cohesiveness and effectiveness. And just as a human family is composed  
of individuals, each of whom usually shares some visual similarities that  
identify them as a related family unit, so too a well‐designed sign program  
is composed of different sign types that share common visual features  
that identify them as related to each other. You can see examples of  
projects with unity of form within sign families in the Gallery section at  
the end of this book.  
A sign program’s graphic system contributes to its two‐dimensional unity,  
and a program’s hardware system contributes to its three‐dimensional  
unity, primarily expressed via shape and form, and supported by materials,  
colors, and finishes. Maintaining unity of 3D form across a broad range of  
sign mounting conditions and sizes is one of the great design challenges  
in signage program development, one that really gets the creative juices  
going. In contrast to architectural design, which typically embraces  
the design of a singular object—albeit a highly complex one, a building—  
design of a signage program’s hardware system is more akin to industrial  
design, in which several different individual objects are often designed  
as part of a larger line of related products, such as cookware or furniture  
ensembles.  
It’s difficult to pin down how an EG designer creates unity of form within  
a sign family’s hardware system, but it typically relies on consistent use  
of a common or similar 3D detail, or combination of details, throughout  
all the sign types, regardless of size or mounting condition, in a program.  
\(See Figures 6.18a, b, and c.\) Simple examples of common details and  
detail combinations include designing all the sign panels in a program to  
be curved, or designing all the sign panels in a program to be curved and  
then overlaid on partially exposed flat background panels.  
Commonalities in mounting structures, such as ground‐mounted posts  
and ceiling‐suspension hangers, are details that can also lend formal  
unity to a sign program’s hardware system. See the Gallery section for  
examples of formal details that unify sign programs.  
202 6.18a 6.18b  
EG designers don’t need to be slavish in adhering to a common 3D  
detail or details, but they do need to employ some sort of consistency  
to visually relate all of the hardware elements of a sign program to each  
other. Continuing with the curved panel example just given, within a  
specific sign program, sign panels that are curved in plan may be more  
appropriate for the vertically formatted signs, while panels that are curved  
in side elevation may be more appropriate for the horizontally formatted  
signs. The key common detail feature is the curved panels, not whether  
they’re bowing out on the horizontal or vertical axis.  
The EG designer can use sketches, drawings, simple study models, and  
3D computer modeling applications to develop 3D formal unity among all  
the sign units in the program. It’s always useful to look at the entire sign  
family together and at one scale to see how the units formally relate to  
one another in the program’s range of mounting conditions, as well as in  
the program’s range of sizes.  
# Sign Mounting Considerations  
As stated earlier in this chapter, how signs are mounted is a key  
determinant of a sign’s form, and this section of the chapter explores the  
factors the EG designer must consider for sign mounting.  
# Overhead and Eye‐Level Mounting Zones  
A sign’s location, viewing distance, and hierarchy help determine  
mounting heights and methods. There are two basic zones for placement  
6.18c  
6.18 a, b, c Monumental, ceiling‐suspended,  
and projecting signs for the Suzhou International  
Expo Centre in China share related design traits  
to create three‐dimensional formal unity.  
Sign Mounting Considerations  
203 The Hardware System  
6.19 Eye‐level and overhead sign viewing/  
mounting zones. Signs mounted in the eye‐level  
zone are generally for close‐up reading; those in  
the overhead zone are for distance reading.  
6.20 Directional pylons at the Dallas/Fort Worth  
airport display large graphics in the overhead  
zone for quick reading at a distance. Smaller,  
more detailed graphics are displayed in the eye‐  
level zone for close‐up reading.  
204  
of sign information and, therefore, for mounting the sign panels that carry  
that information\: an overhead zone and an eye‐level zone.  
Generally, for interior environments, signs that convey primary and,  
sometimes, secondary information are mounted in the overhead zone;  
signs that convey detailed and/or lower‐hierarchy information are  
mounted at eye level. The reason for this rule of thumb makes sense\:  
Important primary sign information needs to be located high enough  
so that it’s not obstructed by people, vehicles, plants, or other objects  
in the environment. Less important sign information doesn’t need to  
be—and, in fact, shouldn’t be—so prominently placed, and detailed sign  
information has to be placed at eye level for close study. \(See Figure 6.19.\)  
For example, in an airport, primary directional signs and identification  
signs such as gate identification numbers are typically mounted overhead,  
whereas signs conveying less important information, such as office  
identification, or detailed information, such as an airport orientation map,  
are placed at eye level. \(See Figure 6.20.\)  
Of course, many environments, such as museums and hotels, are often  
more subdued and low‐key than those of airports, and in these more  
subdued environments overhead signs may be completely inappropriate.  
There are also situations where it’s useful to repeat the same information  
in both the overhead and eye‐level zones. A good example of this is a  
signage program for a retail store in a mall, where an overhead primary  
identification sign is installed for viewing across the expanse of the mall,  
and a secondary identification sign is placed at eye level to enable people  
6.20 walking along the storefronts, and underneath the primary sign, to read  
the same information.  
The zone for displaying eye‐level sign information is roughly between 3′-0″  
and 6′-8″ above the finished floor \(AFF\); the zone for displaying overhead  
information is anywhere above 6′-8″ AFF. Keep in mind that if detailed sign  
information is displayed below 3′-0″, many people would have to stoop  
to read it; and if it’s displayed above 6′-8″, many people would have to  
crane their necks to read it. Also keep in mind that overhead information is  
often displayed on tall, ground‐mounted signs, not only on suspended or  
projecting signs.  
In the midst of this book’s discussion of the overhead and eye‐level  
zones, it’s important to remember that the ADA has specific provisions  
related to sign mounting heights. For example, the SAD requires a specific  
mounting zone for baselines of tactile/raised characters on identification  
signs for permanent room, which is within the eye‐level zone defined  
here. The SAD also has a table that specifies character cap height based  
on three specific visual character mounting height zones, as well as  
lateral proximity distances. This table spans both the overhead and  
eye‐level zones defined here and does not permit baselines of interior  
visual characters to be mounted as low as the lower limit of the eye‐level  
zone discussed in this section. Additionally, the ADA also has a general  
requirement for a minimum overhead vertical clearance, which affects all  
interior and exterior overhead signs on pedestrian circulation paths, such  
as ceiling‐suspended, post‐mounted, and projecting overhead signs. Keep  
in mind that these are but a few examples of how the ADA relates to the  
overhead and eye‐level zones discussed here. As stated in Chapters 4 and  
5, EG designers need to thoroughly familiarize themselves with the ADA/  
SAD. Refer to those chapters for ADA/SAD information sources.  
The concept of overhead and eye‐level zones is somewhat different for  
exterior signage programs. Generally, for pedestrian‐oriented exterior  
signage, these zones are the same as previously discussed. For example,  
detailed pedestrian information such as neighborhood maps or bus  
schedules should be placed in the eye‐level zone for comfortable reading,  
and directional information should be placed in the overhead zone so it’s  
above most obstructions in the exterior environment. Wear and vandalism  
are also considerations for exterior pedestrian signage\: The lower sign  
panels are placed, the more prone they are to being hit by moving objects,  
covered with graffiti and stickers, or degraded by other kinds of wear and  
tampering.  
Although the eye‐level zone is applicable to exterior pedestrian signage,  
it has little applicability to vehicular‐oriented signage, beyond drive‐up  
windows at banks and fast‐food purveyors where drivers are not moving  
and can study detailed information such as a menu. Vehicular sign

information, by necessity, must be succinct for rapid assimilation by  
drivers moving at speeds up to 70‐plus miles per hour. Because of the  
speed factor, the information on the vast majority of exterior vehicular  
signs is not, and cannot be, studied in great detail, as can eye‐level interior  
and exterior pedestrian signs. The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control  
Devices \(MUTCD\), as discussed in Chapter 5, “The Graphic System,” is a  
valuable reference when designing vehicular signs.  
Generally speaking, when it comes to designing vehicular signage, the  
slower the speed, the more detailed and lower the sign information can  
be placed. Moreover, the level of detail of vehicular sign information  
rarely approaches that which is feasible for pedestrian signage—that  
is, although vehicular sign information can range from less to more  
detailed, it can rarely be as detailed as pedestrian signage information.  
For example, on high‐speed roadways such as freeways, primary  
information must be limited to as few words or lines of text as possible  
to communicate the message—many, in fact, comprise only one or  
two words. At lower speeds, drivers can absorb more information, such  
as when they approach an intersection with a stop sign or traffic light  
and slow down long enough to read directional information for several  
destinations.  
Vehicular signage can be literally overhead, in that drivers pass underneath  
the sign information—for example, signs mounted on overpasses, above  
garage entrances, and on freestanding sign support structures spanning  
the roadway. While these pull‐through or pass‐under signs are fairly  
common in vehicular signage, more common are pass‐by vehicular signs,  
which are mounted adjacent to the roadway and often require far less  
complex support structures than freestanding pass‐under signs. Pass‐by  
sign panels are typically mounted lower than pass‐under signs, but still  
need to be high enough to minimize obstruction by vehicles, trees, and  
other objects in the roadway environment.  
Another important factor is that the human eye has a limited range or  
angle of vision—unlike the Google Street View cameras, we do not  
have 360‐degree horizontal vision. And we don’t typically rotate our  
eyes and our heads and necks unless absolutely necessary, such as  
when backing out of a parking space. Accordingly, signs should be  
mounted within normal/natural lines of vision when people are looking  
straight ahead.  
Horizontally, the angle of vision extends 20 to 30 degrees \(40 to  
60 degrees total\) from the vertical centerline of the eyes when looking  
straight ahead. Figure 6.21 depicts a sign mounted perpendicular to the  
line of sight within a 60‐degree field of vision. Note, however, that other  
diagrams may indicate a more dynamic horizontal vision field for people  
moving in cars based on proximity to the sign. 13.9’

Vertically, the angle of vision extends 10 to 15 degrees up and down from  
the horizontal centerline of the eye. Figure 6.22 shows a 10‐degree angle  
up from the centerline. It doesn’t show a downward angle because other  
objects tend to obscure sign information placed below the horizontal  
centerline, unless the viewer is within relatively close range of the sign.  
As noted above, people typically will not rotate their heads to read sign  
information beyond their horizontal angle of vision; likewise, they generally  
will not crane their necks to read signs in the overhead zone. Figure 6.22  
illustrates how signs mounted in the overhead zone should be primarily  
for distance reading. It also illustrates how the top height of a sign can  
increase with viewing distance, as well as how the size of a sign, along  
with its graphics, should increase with viewing distance.  
This information about sign‐mounting zones and viewing angles and  
distances can be useful to EG designers, but it is fungible and therefore  
should not be considered immutable fact. Sign viewing is a dynamic  
process with many variables, particularly regarding whether the viewer  
is moving forward on foot or on wheels. As with many other aspects  
of EG design, such as typographic size, the designer should conduct  
some degree of testing, formal or informal, to determine sign mounting  
positions suitable for the conditions of the project at hand. Three‐  
dimensional computer modeling applications can be helpful to informally  
test sign mounting positions. And, as always, the EG designer must keep  
in mind conformance with local codes and the ADA signage provisions,  
which in many cases are more stringent than the general mounting zone  
dimensions discussed above.  
# Architectural and Site Factors Affecting Mounting  
As clearly stated throughout this book, signage programs exist within an  
environmental context, be it interior, exterior, or both, and the EG designer  
6.22 Signs mounted within a 10‐degree vertical  
field of vision.  
Sign Mounting Considerations  
207 The Hardware System  
208  
needs to consider the physical characteristics of the environment within  
which the signs are to be mounted. Ceiling clearances, wall and corridor  
widths, obstructions such as columns or trees, and other elements  
all affect sign mounting decisions. For example, a given building may  
have ceilings that are too low for ceiling‐suspended signs to provide  
the minimum ADA clearance, given the sign information content at the  
minimum visual character cap heights per the SAD table. In such cases,  
ceiling‐suspended signs may not be a design option, so the EG designer  
must consider other types of mounting, which will in turn affect the formal  
qualities of the sign hardware system.  
Another architectural/site factor is whether the environment provides  
adequate opportunities to mount signs on existing structures, such  
as walls, columns, and ceilings for interior signs, or light poles and  
overpasses for exterior signs. In situations where there are no  
appropriately located existing structures for sign mounting, such as in the  
middle of a shopping mall’s atrium or an open urban plaza, freestanding  
signs will be necessary, which naturally has formal consequences for the  
hardware system. It’s also possible that the EG designer may find that  
freestanding mounting is completely appropriate for certain sign types  
even when existing structures are available for sign mounting. In an urban  
signage example, the EG designer may determine that freestanding signs  
will provide clearer sightlines and encounter less visual competition than  
sign panels mounted on existing structures such as light poles.  
Sign mounting must be structurally stable; therefore, it must be  
coordinated with architectural or site conditions, whether the sign  
program is for an existing environment or new construction. In new  
construction, the EG designer can coordinate sign mounting with the  
project architect, structural engineers, and/or sign fabricator. In existing  
environments, the EG designer can coordinate sign mounting with the  
sign fabricator and/or a structural engineer if an architect isn’t involved.  
Exterior, ground‐mounted signs require footings or foundations, which  
are concrete legs or pads that penetrate deep into the soil to anchor the  
sign. The aboveground sign structure can be directly buried into the fresh  
concrete footer\(s\) or can be attached at a later time by anchor bolts to  
the structure laid with the footing\(s\). In either case, the ground must be  
dug to lay the footings, which means that below‐grade utility lines may  
be breached during the digging. To avoid interfering with local services  
such as water, electric, data, or sewer, the sign fabricator should call for  
a markout of utility lines in the installation locale. Indeed, in many locales  
digging without a utilities markout is against the law.  
As you’ll learn later in this chapter, there are myriad ways to join sign parts  
together and to join signs to their mounting surfaces. But, as stated in  
Chapter 2, “The Design Process,” EG designers are not trained or licensed to practice structural engineering or architecture, and should therefore  
specify that all engineering of sign structures and attachments be  
performed by professionals in those fields or by the sign fabricator.  
# Sign Size Considerations  
Many of the same factors that must be considered regarding sign  
mounting must also be considered regarding sign size. Certainly, the  
relationship of viewing angle, viewing distance, and mounting height is a  
key determinant of the size of any given sign type, as are architectural and  
site factors, such as a low ceiling or limited wall space. And, as stated in  
Chapters 4 and 5, sign hierarchy and the quantity of message content are  
two other key size determinants for any given sign type. So important are  
they, in fact, that it bears repeating that it is imperative to design for the  
worst‐case \(longest\) message or set of messages programmed for each  
sign type.  
For vehicular signage, road speed and the number of lanes affect the  
amount of time and the distance that drivers have to react to a sign.  
These factors, in turn, affect the letter height of a sign message and the  
total area of the sign panels that display the messages, as shown in  
Figure 6.23. The information in Figure 6.23 is a starting point only, and as  
with sign mounting, some degree of testing is necessary to determine  
the letter heights and panel sizes most suitable for the project at hand.  
Recall from Chapters 4 and 5 that local codes may dictate message  
content and the cap heights of messages for certain interior signs,

sizes for vehicular signs.

typically those with life safety messages. Although not all codes mandate  
a specific size for the actual sign panels on which such messages appear,  
some do, so it’s always important to check the local codes applicable to  
the project at hand to see if certain panel sizes are mandated. And even  
when panel sizes for such signs aren’t specifically mandated in a code, the  
message content and graphic sizes dictated by the code will play a role  
in determining panel sizes. This is also the case with the ADA; although  
the SAD doesn’t require specific sign panel sizes, its requirements for  
attributes of sign graphics, such as sizes, positions, spacing, and others,  
affect the panel sizes on which graphics are displayed.  
Also note that the SAD section on protruding objects, which is separate from  
the SAD’s signage section, places dimensional limits on 3D objects, including  
signs, in pedestrian circulation paths. Generally, these ADA limits include  
depth of objects protruding from walls, overhang of single post–mounted  
objects, vertical clearances of double post–mounted objects, and vertical  
clearance of overhead objects—most within specific vertical or horizontal  
ranges. Both interior and exterior sign dimensions can be affected by the  
requirements of the SAD’s protruding objects section, and the EG designer is  
advised to become familiar with all the specifics of its requirements. Sources  
for ADA/SAD requirements are provided in Chapters 4 and 5.  
Chapter 4, “The Information Content System,” explained how local sign  
ordinances may restrict the size of exterior signs, usually expressed in  
terms of square footage. Other sign ordinance restrictions may include  
other aspects of the hardware system for exterior signs, such as height,  
form or shape, materials, illumination, and other factors.  
# Overall Size  
Thus far this section has focused on the size of sign panels, the part of  
a sign that displays messages, as opposed to the overall size of a sign,  
including its mounting structures. In the case of flush wall‐mounted signs,  
where the back of the sign panel is mounted directly to a wall, there is  
no visible ancillary structure to support the sign panel, so the overall size  
of this kind of sign is the sign panel itself. In the case of freestanding,  
suspended, and projecting signs, however, there is some sort of support  
structure for the sign panel, and this structure contributes to the overall  
size of the sign. As noted earlier in this chapter, the support structure  
may be exposed, as in the single vertical post of a lollipop sign, or may be  
hidden, as in a monolithic pylon.  
This discussion of the overall size of a sign is germane to local sign  
ordinances as they may restrict two aspects of size\: actual height from the  
ground to the top of the sign \(height restriction\) and the square footage  
of the sign \(area restriction\). Refer back to Chapter 4, “The Information  
Content System,” for more on local exterior sign ordinances. Depth  
Another important sign hardware size consideration is depth. We can’t  
forget that signs, even flush‐mounted wall plaques, are three‐dimensional  
objects and that depth is that added third dimension! Depth of a sign can  
range from negligible—essentially two‐dimensional or planar—to deeper  
than its length or width. Factors that contribute to determining depth  
include\:  
• The depth required of mounting structures to adequately secure the  
•  
sign.  
• Informational requirements\: Signs with messages on one or two sides  
•  
can be relatively thin, but signs that have information on three or more  
sides need to be deeper, to provide an adequate message area on each  
sign face.  
• ADA/SAD limitations on depth of objects, including signs, protruding  
•  
or projecting from walls into circulation paths. As stated previously in  
this section, the SAD also places other dimensional limits on signs on  
circulation paths.  
• The visual effect sought by the EG designer.  
•  
# Proportion and Scale  
Proportion and scale are related to size in the sign hardware system. The  
rule of thumb for proportion is to trust your gut; that is, if a freestanding  
sign looks too thin depth‐wise to stand up, it probably won’t unless it has  
major foundational support. Conversely, excess depth can make signs  
appear too bulky. Accordingly, to achieve three‐dimensional proportional  
harmony, it’s important, at the very least, to study the front and side  
views of all the sign types in a sign program; quick study models and 3D  
computer rendering programs can be even more helpful for visualizing and  
refining sign program forms and proportions. Always consult with a sign  
fabricator or engineer if you have any questions about structural matters.  
The EG designer can also manipulate the scale of the sign hardware  
system in relation to the program’s environment. The scale of the various  
sign types can be just right for their surroundings, or the scale of certain  
or all the sign types in a program can be enlarged to create a bigger, more  
dramatic visual impact. In certain environments, smaller-scaled signs  
may be appropriate to create a sense of subdued elegance, but they  
should never be so small that they cannot be easily read at the intended  
viewing distance or that they do not conform with any ADA or local code  
requirements for typographic or panel sizes.  
A final word about size in the sign hardware system\: The fewer sign sizes  
there are in a program, the more visually unified the program will be.  
Sign Size Considerations  
211 The Hardware System  
212  
Keep in mind that a sign of a given size can display variable quantities of  
information content, from a little to a lot—although never so much as to  
cause information overload—depending on how the various kinds of sign  
messages are laid out in the graphic system.  
# Sign Lighting Overview  
Just as lighting adds interest and drama to stage productions, lighting  
can add interest and drama, as well as visibility, to signage. Lighting  
components are physical objects, making sign illumination part of the  
sign hardware system. Basically, there are three options for lighting  
signs\: external, internal, or nonillumination. This section presents a basic  
overview of sign lighting techniques in relation to each of these sign  
illumination options.  
Decisions on whether to light and how to light some or all the sign  
types in a program depend on many factors, among them whether  
a sign is in an interior or exterior environment, ambient light levels  
within the sign program’s environment, a sign’s hierarchical rank  
\(primary, secondary, tertiary\) within the program, cost considerations,  
local sign ordinances, the desired visual effect, and others. In  
addition, new technologies and products for lighting signs are always  
being developed, so the EG designer may want to engage a lighting  
consultant, electrical engineer, or sign fabricator for more technical  
information on sign illumination.  
Electrical power is required for both external and internal illumination.  
Typically, electrical power from the grid must be brought to the sign  
location, which is a cost factor that requires coordination between the  
EG designer and the project architect or electrical engineer, as well as  
between the sign fabricator and other construction trades. Ongoing  
electrical consumption is another cost factor. Sign illumination may be  
on around the clock, or be controlled with an automatic timer to save  
energy. The latter is the case in particular for exterior signs or interior signs  
in high‐daylight environments. Maintenance is also a consideration, as  
most illuminated signs must be checked periodically to replace burned-  
out lamps and to ensure that other electrical components are in good  
condition. Due to these cost and maintenance factors, lower‐hierarchy  
signs within a program, such as room identification plaques in a hotel,  
are rarely illuminated. It’s also important to remember that local sign  
ordinances may place limitations on the illumination of exterior signs,  
such as “dark sky” requirements to reduce glare and light pollution from a  
variety of lighting sources.  
In signage programs for new construction, the earlier the EG designer  
can identify the locations of illuminated signs, the easier it will be for the project’s engineers to coordinate sending power to those locations  
without change orders or ripping out finished surfaces to lay electrical  
conduit. Even if it’s still undecided as to whether a given sign type may be  
illuminated, it’s wise to have power run to the appropriate sign locations  
so that the power is there when or if needed. Of course, the EG designer  
should be judicious and not have power run to hundreds of sign locations  
where it’s unlikely to ever be needed.  
The previous paragraphs apply to traditional sign lighting and electrical  
delivery methods. That said, white light emitting diode \(LED\) lighting has  
revolutionized sign illumination and to a certain extent, electrical power  
delivery to signs. LED lamps have longer life, consume less power, and  
have fewer hazmat disposal consequences than the former workhorse  
of the sign industry, fluorescent lamps. In some cases, the power  
consumption of LEDs can be low enough that the sign power source can  
be solar, which does not require wired connection to the electric grid or  
consume power from it. Solar power does require collection and storage  
devices, and is a rapidly developing technology, so it can be useful  
for the EG designer to consult with a sign fabricator or sign lighting  
manufacturer who has knowledge of current solar energy technology  
and components.  
Whether signs are grid‐wired or solar‐powered, or externally or internally  
illuminated, at the minimum, the EG designer should be aware of  
the items noted below. Keep in mind that sign fabricators, lighting  
consultants, and lighting manufacturers can be useful sources of technical  
assistance on sign illumination.

• Externally and internally illuminated signs must be fabricated so that  
•  
they are evenly illuminated with no so‐called hot or cold spots.  
• All electrical components must be Underwriters Laboratory \(UL\) approved  
•  
and in conformance with any applicable safety or energy codes.  
• All electrical engineering for a sign program should be performed by  
•  
other parties with the proper credentials, such as an electrical engineer  
or a sign fabricator.  
# External Illumination  
The term external illumination refers to lighting that is outside of a  
sign but specifically dedicated to and aimed at the sign for purposes  
of illuminating it. \(See Figure 6.24.\) This definition does not include  
ambient lighting, which is lighting dedicated to other purposes in the sign  
environment, such as general room or street lighting. External lighting  
reflects off a sign’s surface and is achieved with floodlights or spotlights  
directed onto either the entire sign face or just the sign graphics. External  
illumination is more commonly used for signs in exterior environments  
than interior environments, although it can make for very dramatic effects  
in interior settings.  
External light sources include LED, fluorescent, halogen, mercury  
or sodium vapor, incandescent, and other kinds of lamps. Although  
all these sources emit what is generally considered white light, the  
color temperature of the light varies with the source, and the color  
temperature of the light source can tinge the color of the sign itself. For  
example, sodium vapor lighting has an orangey cast and mercury vapor  
has a bluish cast; even white LEDs and common tubular fluorescent  
lamps are available in various color temperatures, ranging from cool to  
warm. The fixtures housing external light sources can be mounted below  
or above the sign, and can vary from sleek and minimalist to highly  
noticeable, so the look of the lamp fixtures must always be considered  
in external sign illumination, as must their position, to reduce glare and  
light spillage.  
One external sign illumination technique that doesn’t require electrical  
power is specially engineered reflective vinyl films that capture, intensify,  
and reflect light from car headlights. These retroreflective vinyl films are  
available in white, black, and a limited range of bright colors. They can be  
used for reflective sign graphics, reflective sign backgrounds, or both.  
But a word of caution here\: Never use reflective black film on reflective  
white film or vice versa, because both reflect white light, resulting in  
disappearing graphics! Retroreflective vinyl films are manufactured in a  
variety of grades and are typically used for traffic control and roadway  
directional signs at sites where there is little or no ambient lighting at  
night. \(See Figure 6.25.\) 6.25  
# Internal Illumination  
Internal illumination refers to light that is transmitted from within a sign.  
\(See Figures 6.26 through 6.32.\) It is commonly used for signs in both  
exterior and interior environments; as such, internally illuminated signs  
can take several forms, the most common being a rectangular sign box  
with a translucent plastic face on which the graphics and background are  
completely backlit—increasingly by white LED lamps, which are rapidly

vinyl graphics, which can be illuminated simply  
by car headlights without light fixtures or  
electrical power.  
6.26 A sign structure at Brooklyn’s Atlantic Terminal  
incorporates two kinds of internal illumination  
effects\: the opaque stainless steel side panel,  
where only the graphics are backlit, and the  
advertising panel, where the entire image is backlit.

Singapore; prismatic, dichroic acrylic letters  
inset into a stone wall are backlit with white  
LEDs to create a changing spectrum of color as  
viewers pass the sign.  
overtaking fluorescent lamps as the light source. This entirely backlit  
box form is typified in signs for big‐box stores, gas stations, and other  
commercial establishments. Some internally illuminated sign boxes have  
just the graphics backlit on opaque backgrounds, which is less commercial  
in appearance, while others have only the backgrounds backlit with  
opaque graphics.  
Typically, the light source in an internally illuminated sign is completely  
hidden, although sometimes the glowing light source itself is the sign,  
as in those made of exposed neon or other luminous tubing. Some  
internally illuminated signs aren’t even rectangular boxes; instead, they’re  
individually fabricated letters that can be lit in three ways\: with light  
coming through the face of each letter, with light coming through the  
face and returns \(sides\) of each letter, or with light spilling out around the  
returns of an opaque letter in a halo or silhouette effect. Another form of  
internal illumination is edge lighting, where a light source is aligned on  
the edge of a transparent glass or plastic sheet and is conducted through  
the transparent sheet to illuminate graphics etched or sandblasted into it;  
translucent vinyl is also often used for graphics on edge‐lit signs.  
There are many light sources for internal sign illumination, with new forms  
and technologies being developed and refined on a regular basis. White  
LEDs have largely overtaken the tubular fluorescent lamps which were  
the workhorses used to backlight most sign boxes. Similarly, LEDs have  
largely replaced custom‐bent neon‐type lamps for backlighting individually  
fabricated letters. This LED sign lighting revolution, which continues to

evolve, has allowed thinner sign boxes and smaller backlit letters, with the  
added benefits of energy savings and longer lamp life. Another benefit—  
or detriment, depending on your viewpoint—is that certain LED lamps  
can sequentially change color from white to any number of colors. EG  
designers should be aware of poor LED sign lighting applications, which  
include hot spots on backlit signs, and any application that reveals the  
point sources of the individual LED lamps, unless the goal is to emulate  
strings of holiday lights.  
Typically, internally illuminated signs must be thicker than other  
types of signs, to accommodate lamps and their mounts, the space  
Sign Lighting Overview  
6.31 6.32  
217 The Hardware System  
218  
required between the lamps and the sign face, plus wiring and other  
electrical components. Providing access to the interior of sign boxes,  
for servicing lamps and electrical equipment, is also an important  
consideration when designing internally illuminated signs. The EG  
designer should take care to specify that all internally illuminated signs  
be fabricated to prevent leakage of light at seams and joints, and with  
adequate venting to dissipate any heat that can build up within the sign.  
Additionally, the EG designer should specify that all illumination is to be  
even, with no hot or cold spots.  
# Nonillumination  
Nonillumination of signs is a perfectly viable option for signs in  
exterior or interior environments with high enough ambient light levels  
\(whether from artificial or natural sources\) for signs to be seen and  
read without dedicated sign lighting. Entire sign programs have been  
developed with no illumination at all for many environments, and  
function perfectly well.  
Nonillumination also makes sense if the site doesn’t operate at night or if  
an overly commercial look is not desired. Nonillumination is, obviously, the  
least expensive option, requiring no electrical installation, no ongoing on‐  
grid energy‐consumption costs, and no costs for solar energy collection  
and storage devices.  
# Sign Materials Overview  
Sign materials are just that—raw materials, such as pallets of aluminum  
sheets or steel I‐beams. It’s the EG designer’s creative mind and  
the sign fabricator’s skills that give materials form and life as three‐  
dimensional sign objects. And that is one of the truly magical aspects of  
EG design.  
Materials are the essence of a sign program’s hardware system—  
they are the very stuff from which signs are fabricated. As such,  
they have a significant bearing on the visual appearance of the sign  
hardware system. The EG designer has a virtually endless range of  
materials from which to compose a sign program’s hardware system,  
and fascinating new materials are introduced on a regular basis. An  
entire book could be written on sign materials, so by necessity this  
section highlights only the basic materials that can be used in the sign  
hardware system.  
Some sign materials are used as purely structural components,  
either expressed or hidden, while others are used as exposed finish  
components, such as sign faces, plaques, and cladding over internal structures. And some sign materials, such as wood and aluminum, are  
used as both structural and finish components.  
# Materials as Your Muse  
The guideline here is\: Let the materials be your muse. Certain sign  
materials that are inherently attractive are rarely covered up with  
paints or other opaque coatings, although they may require a clear coating  
for protection. Other sign materials are covered up with opaque coatings  
because they need to be a specific color, they need to be protected  
from the elements, or they’re inherently unattractive. Most materials  
can take a variety of finishes—smooth, rough, grained, and so on—that  
either come from the material’s manufacturer or are added in the sign  
fabricator’s shop. \(More on this later, in the “Overview of Sign Coatings  
and Finishes” section.\)  
Each basic type of sign material has inherent qualities, such as the  
transparency of glass, the flexibility of fabric, or the shininess of metal,  
and each of these qualities can and should be exploited by the EG  
designer. Plastics are perhaps the ultimate material chameleon, in that  
they can mimic glass, metals, or even wood and stone. Plastics also  
have inherent qualities that are valuable unto themselves, such as  
ease of formability, break resistance, and their relatively light weight.  
Several examples of the various sign materials available are shown in  
Figure 6.33.  
6.33 Endless material options are available for  
sign programs\: a collection of material, pattern,  
and color samples.

6.34 A metal panel is rolled into a simple,  
graceful curve on this sign for the Palms Casino  
in Las Vegas.  
# Unity of Materials  
Unity of materials is just as important to the visual coherence of  
a sign program’s hardware system as unity of form. As with sign  
form, the point is to use a unified materials palette to create a family  
resemblance among all the various types of signs within the program.  
This doesn’t mean that all the materials within the program’s palette  
need to be used on each and every sign type, but that perhaps one or  
two materials are featured in all the sign types in the program. See the  
Gallery section at the end of this book for examples of sign programs  
with unified materials.  
# Materials and Processes  
Materials for exposed sign finish components are available in a variety  
of forms, most commonly in flat sheets, plates, or slabs of various  
thicknesses, and can be processed in various ways, depending on the  
specific kind of material. All flat finish materials can be cut into various  
shapes or drilled with holes by various processes. Aside from cutting and  
drilling, workability diverges with the inherent physical properties of each  
basic material. For example, as shown in Figure 6.34, sheets of metal  
can be bent at an acute angle or rolled into a curve relatively easily, but  
stone can’t be bent or rolled because it’s brittle and will break. In another  
example, plastic is the only sign material that can be readily vacuum‐  
formed into a specific shape by heating the plastic sheet and drawing  
it down over the shape with a vacuum pump; after the plastic cools, it  
retains the shape.  
It is apparent from just these two examples that there are many workshop  
processes for even basic sign materials, and that new processes such  
as 3D printing \(discussed in Chapter 5\) are becoming available, so a  
comprehensive discussion of them is beyond the scope of this book.  
There’s no doubt, however, that EG design is facilitated by a basic  
knowledge of the techniques by which various sign materials can be  
processed in a shop, and there are several sources for gaining that  
knowledge.  
The SEGD website provides a message board for its members,  
where both professional \(designers\) and industry \(fabricators and  
manufacturers\) members share information about sign materials  
and fabrication processes, among other topics. Most SEGD industry  
members are willing to meet with EG designers to discuss materials  
and production techniques for a given project, and are often willing to  
conduct shop tours for EG designers, which can be very illuminating to  
both newcomers and seasoned professionals in the field. Additionally,  
SEGD industry members hold a trade exposition at the SEGD’s annual  
conference, which is a wonderful source of information on materials  
220 and fabrication processes, including several that are cutting‐edge. EG  
designers can also access technical information at www.signweb.  
com, which is geared toward sign fabricators, or by attending the  
International Sign Association’s annual Expo, which showcases  
both cutting‐edge and traditional sign materials and manufacturing  
processes.  
Materials for sign structural components, whether expressed  
or hidden, are available in a variety of forms. Wood structural  
components are typically solid, and available in several cross‐sectional  
shapes, such as square, rectangular, round, and sometimes more  
elaborate shapes, such as fluted columns or turned spindles. Metal  
structural components are typically hollow or open extrusions or  
forgings. Many of these shapes are used for general construction  
industry applications and are available in a variety of basic cross‐  
sectional shapes, such as round, square, and rectangular tubing,  
as well as L‐shaped angles, C‐shaped channels, and the classic I‐  
beam. There are also manufacturers of extruded aluminum support  
components with more varied sectional shapes geared specifically to  
signage applications.  
# Size Does Matter  
It’s important to keep in mind that both finish and structural signage  
materials are manufactured in certain standard sizes, as this will  
have consequences for the appearance of a sign program’s hardware  
system. Not only can material size be a design constraint, but so can  
the size of equipment for working, finishing, or applying graphics to the  
material. Size is generally less of a problem with the smaller sign types  
within a program, but it can become a major challenge when working  
with the larger sign types, where seams and joints can become a  
design factor.  
Seams and joints can generally be minimized or hidden on opaque or  
painted‐over materials such as metal, wood, and opaque plastics, but they  
cannot be hidden on fabrics or transparent materials such as glass or clear  
plastics. When faced with material or processing size constraints, the EG  
designer will often press the “reveal” technique into service, which is  
a neat design trick that actually exposes and plays up a seam or a joint.  
This can often look better than trying to hide a joint that can’t be hidden  
successfully.  
From a green standpoint, size can come into play with smaller sign types  
cut from larger material stock. The goal in such cases is to size the signs  
cut from the larger stock in such a way as to minimize the amount of  
unused material that’s left over \(see Figure 6.35\); sign fabricators can  
provide guidance to EG designers on this consideration.

# Basic Sign Materials  
While reading about the basic sign materials described in this section  
keep in mind that there are many proprietary products with their own  
unique qualities and properties within these broad categories of sign  
materials. Additionally, there are many products that are composites of  
these materials, capitalizing on properties of each constituent material  
to create a new set of properties—for example, an aluminum‐plastic  
“sandwich” that’s as flat as a solid sheet of aluminum of the same  
thickness but with substantially reduced weight. And, of course, new sign  
materials are constantly under development.  
Sources for information on materials and products used in signage include  
manufacturers’ and suppliers’ catalogs, design and architecture magazines,  
and companies that provide compendia of manufacturers, such as Sweets  
and the Thomas Register. Most of these sources, as well as others can  
be found on the Internet \(e.g., www.materialconnexion.com\), which is  
invaluable for conducting materials research. Also note that EG designers  
should always obtain samples of materials they’re considering for use  
and that most materials manufacturers are happy to provide samples to  
designers. Most EGD offices maintain a library of materials information,  
ranging from catalogs and swatch books to samples and mock‐ups.  
A word about sustainable design and materials\: It is beyond the scope of  
this book to examine the environmental factors relating to materials and  
processes for a sign program’s hardware system or for application of sign  
graphics. Suffice it to say that EG designers should always consider the  
environmental impact—from sourcing, to manufacture and processing, to  
222 How Green Is Green?\*  
# Life Cycle Assessment can shed light on signage design and fabrication processes.  
# Naomi Pearson  
What do we mean when we say “green” or  
“sustainable”? Everything we make takes a toll  
on our environment and health. Even sustainable,  
green solutions impact our environment. It’s those  
environmental and health impacts—starting from  
how we source raw materials through how the  
results of our designs are used and disposed of—  
that determine how sustainable our solutions are.  
Life Cycle Assessment \(LCA\) analyzes the  
environmental impacts of a product or process by  
compiling and evaluating energy and material inputs  
and environmental outputs during five phases\:  
Phase 1\: Raw Material Acquisition  
Phase 2\: Manufacturing  
Phase 3\: Fabrication and Distribution  
Phase 4\: Energy Use/Maintenance  
Phase 5\: Waste Management; Reuse, Recycling,  
Landfill, Incineration  
# Who Is Using LCA, and How?  
In the 1960s, when concerns over limited raw  
materials and energy first became widespread,  
LCA models were created to assess energy  
use and to project future resource supplies and  
use. Fast‐forward to the present, and LCA is  
increasingly being adopted by designers and  
promoted by organizations and companies  
galvanized by heightened environmental  
awareness.  
The U.S. Green Building Council has incorporated  
Life Cycle Assessment credits into the LEED rating  
system and offers courses on using LCA as a tool  
to measure sustainability.  
“Tally,” an Autodesk Revit LCA plug‐in that tracks  
environmental impacts of entire buildings  
in real time was launched at the Greenbuild  
conference in November 2013. This tool was  
developed by architects working with LCA  
experts.  
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has  
defined a standard for using LCA to assess the  
environmental aspects and potential impacts  
associated with a product, process, or service.  
Apple Computer uses what it calls a “Life Cycle  
Impact” calculation to illustrate how Apple holds  
itself accountable to LCA phases.  
The International Organization for Standardization  
recommends LCA principles for environmental  
management. And for print design, ISO 14000  
Certified printers offer compliance with LCA  
principles set by the ISO.  
# Using LCA in EGD  
During the past several years, the SEGD’s  
Sustainability Forum has issued a Green Paper,  
supplied green audits, covered sustainable lighting  
methods, discussed EGD’s relationship to LEED,  
and provided Material Guides, among other  
sustainable strategy initiatives.  
LCA principles can build on the groundwork  
laid by the SEGD Green Committee, providing  
a comprehensive approach to considering the  
environmental impacts of graphics in the built  
environment. This approach begins by plugging  
sets of EGD variables into the five LCA phases  
early in the design process. By looking at how the  
environmental impacts of each phase contribute to  
the project’s overall sustainability, EGD practitioners  
can make decisions and trade‐offs to achieve the  
best results overall.  
Basic Sign Materials  
223 The Hardware System  
How Green Is Green? continued  
Listed below are some examples of how typical  
EGD variables can be applied to the five LCA phases.  
Phase 1\: Sustainable Strategies for Raw  
Material Acquisition  
• Reuse of existing panels, posts, or hardware  
•  
conserves material and energy that would  
otherwise be used for processing and  
manufacturing new material. Reuse also  
eliminates environmental outputs such as  
manufacturing by‐products.  
• Natural resources can be preserved by choosing  
•  
products containing raw materials that have  
been sustainably harvested by, for example, the  
Rainforest Alliance and certified by the Forest  
Stewardship Council.  
• Bioplastics made from renewable, nonedible  
•  
plant substances like castor oil are on the rise as  
healthy alternatives to petroleum‐based plastics  
derived from fossil fuels. Biobased inks and  
bioresins are also options gaining traction.  
Phase 2\: Sustainable Strategies for  
Manufacturing  
• Use of a closed‐loop process that reuses by‐  
•  
products rather than outputting by‐products into  
the waste stream as toxic effluents.  
• Where economically and technically feasible,  
•  
use of deployed dynamic media such as digital  
displays or mobile devices such as smart phones,  
to help eliminate the manufacture of static  
signage updates.  
• Transparency allows access to manufacturing  
•  
information direct from product makers. One  
source is Architecture firm Perkins + Will’s  
online Precautionary List \(www.transparency.  
perkinswill.com/PrecautionaryList\), which  
offers help by detailing the health effects of  
some of the most toxic materials produced,  
such as PVC \(polyvinyl chloride\). Healthier  
224  
alternatives suitable for signage such as  
polyofelin are also shown.  
Phase 3\: Sustainable Strategies for Fabrication  
and Distribution  
• Mechanical installation and mounting without  
•  
toxic adhesives, or specification of water‐based  
adhesives.  
• Keeping material dimensions in mind early in  
•  
the design process enables the maximization  
of sheet sizes, print media widths, and so forth.  
The end result is less wasted material.  
• Fabricating locally, and shipping the shortest  
•  
distance possible with green packing materials  
is ideal.  
Phase 4\: Sustainable Strategies for Energy Use/  
Maintenance  
• Installation of timers and dimmers encourage  
•  
energy savings.  
• Energy used by electronic displays is weighed  
•  
against the benefits of updating messaging  
without replacing static sign components.  
Consideration of environmental pros and cons  
determines the best outcome.  
• Emphasis on durability for long‐term installations  
•  
minimizes the amount of energy and resources  
required for maintenance over time.  
Phase 5\: Sustainable Strategies for Waste  
Management  
• A design with a short life span is best served  
•  
by a sustainable plan for disposal, reuse, or  
recycling of signage components.  
• Minimizing the amount of material that ends up  
•  
in a landfill is best.  
• Many materials marketed as “biodegradable” do  
•  
not typically decompose because they are not  
exposed to oxygen. Instead, methane is generated  
as waste decomposes under anaerobic conditions. How Green Is Green? continued  
# Time, Accountability, and  
# Measuring Sustainability  
Finding time to research materials and  
processes, making sense of the growing  
number of sustainability claims, and breaking  
through proprietary information roadblocks can  
be major challenges for anyone attempting  
to adopt more sustainable design practices.  
Third‐party rating systems have been a  
longstanding, reliable way to quickly evaluate  
environmental factors that play a part in Life  
Cycle Assessment.  
Searchable libraries of products pre‐vetted for health  
and environmental impacts offer immediate product  
transparency, and help find innovative products and  
newly developed bio‐based materials. The Pharos  
Chemical & Material Library rates products based  
on health and ecological impacts using comparative  
chemical hazard lists identified by GreenScreen for  
Safer Chemicals as well as product reporting and  
metrics systematized by the customer‐led Health  
Product Declaration Collaborative \(HPDC\).

delivery, to disposal and recycling—of the materials and processes they  
specify. Good, solid design that’s not overly trendy—and therefore not  
quickly dated—also contributes to environmental sustainability. The SEGD  
Green Paper on Sustainability, available at the SEGD website, is a good  
source of information on green practices in EGD.  
# Metals  
Metals, in both structural and sheet forms, are among the most highly  
utilized sign materials. Additionally, certain metals can be melted and cast  
into complex forms, including hardware components such as sign bases  
and as medallions and plaques.  
All metals have good to excellent structural properties, although they all  
oxidize or corrode to a greater or lesser extent. Metals can take a range of  
surface finishes, from a mirror polish to a coarse‐brushed grain. Metals can  
also be painted, although stainless steel, bronze, and brass are so attractive  
in their natural state they rarely are. Typical metals used for signage include\:  
Aluminum. Used for sign faces, plaques, cladding, trim, and lightweight  
to medium‐weight structures, as well as for castings. Considered one of  
the “white” metals, aluminum is a lighter shade of gray than stainless  
steel. Other characteristics include\: good appearance; good durability; light  
weight; and medium to high expense. Aluminum also typically benefits  
from clear or opaque protective coatings, although such coatings are not  
necessarily required. \(See Figure 6.36.\)  
Carbon steel. This metal is typically used for concealed medium‐weight  
to heavyweight sign structures, not for appearance. Other characteristics

include\: high durability; heavy weight; and medium to high expense.  
Carbon steel also requires rust‐inhibiting paints or coatings.  
Stainless steel. Stainless steel is typically used for sign faces, plaques,  
cladding, and trim \(it’s generally too expensive for structures\). Another  
of the “white” metals, stainless steel is a darker shade of gray than  
aluminum. Other characteristics include\: excellent appearance \(it’s rarely  
painted\); excellent durability; heavy weight; and high expense. Because it  
does not rust, or rusts minimally, \(hence the name “stainless”\) protective  
coatings are not usually required. \(See Figure 6.37.\)  
Bronze, brass, and copper. These copper alloys \(also called the “yellow”  
or “red” metals\) are typically used for sign faces, plaques, trim, and  
castings. Like stainless steel, they’re too expensive for structures.  
Other characteristics include\: excellent appearance; good to excellent  
durability; heavy weight; and high expense. These alloys also require a  
protective coating to maintain their metallic shine—although often they’re  
intentionally oxidized to a rich brown or green patina before coating, or  
allowed to weather naturally without coating. \(See Figures 6.38 and 6.39.\)  
# Plastics  
Plastics have a number of unique properties that can be exploited for  
signage, such as transparency, formability, break resistance, and relatively  
low weight compared to other sign materials. As such, plastics are  
another commonly used sign material, although they’re used primarily  
for exposed finish components, not structural components. And because  
certain plastics allow light to pass through them and are shatter‐resistant,  
they are almost always used for internally illuminated sign faces. Plastics  
6.38 6.39  
and plastic resins are also moldable by various processes into an infinite  
variety of shapes, an invaluable feature in signage design and production.  
Plastics in sheet form are most commonly used in signage, although  
plastic resin liquids and pellets can also be cast into various sculptural  
forms. \(See Figure 6.40.\)

and painted areas that reveal a window for  
changeable information at a Stony Brook  
University medical building, New York.  
The two primary sign plastics are acrylic and polycarbonate \(commonly  
called polycarb\), both of which have the glasslike properties of  
transparency and translucency; but, unlike glass, they don’t chip and  
shatter. In fact, polycarbonate is the clear, bulletproof material used to  
shield bank tellers and presidential limousines.  
There are some technical differences between acrylic and polycarbonate,  
but they are both used for sign faces, plaques, cladding, and trim. Due  
to their capability to be transparent or translucent, they are widely used  
for the faces of internally illuminated sign boxes and letters. They’re also  
widely used for vacuum‐formed sign faces that have graphics in relief, as  
well as for clear protective lenses on signs such as directories and menu  
boards. \(See Figures 6.41 and 6.42.\)  
Acrylic sheet, in particular, is available in a fairly wide range of colors and  
textures, from completely transparent to completely opaque, and both  
acrylic and polycarbonate can be painted to a custom color. There are  
several manufacturers of acrylic and polycarbonate sheet, each with its  
own trade name and line of colors, textures, and other features. Grades  
with UV inhibitors should be used for exterior signage, as both acrylic  
and polycarb tend to yellow with exposure to the sun. Both feature a  
good appearance, medium to high durability, light to medium weight,  
and medium to high expense. Most plastics, including acrylics and  
228 polycarbonates, do not require any applied protective coatings, but they  
do tend to scratch more readily than other sign materials.  
Other plastics used in signage include styrenes, vinyls, phenolics, and  
photopolymers, all of which have their own unique properties. There  
are several manufacturers of signage materials \(which typically come  
in sheet form, some of which are flexible\) made from these types  
of plastics. Many are sold under trade names and use proprietary  
manufacturing techniques that result in unique products, such as  
expanded polyvinyl chloride \(PVC\) sheet that’s half the weight of solid  
PVC sheet, but is very strong for sign panel use. Other specialized  
plastics used for signage include metallized or holographic films and  
sheets; photosensitive plastic sheets, which yield tactile/raised and  
Braille graphics when exposed to light and are chemically processed;  
and plastic resin sheets embedded with all kinds of decorative materials  
or with glass fibers for strength.  
The list of proprietary plastic products that can be used for signage is  
virtually unlimited, and new products are constantly being introduced. A  
word of warning, though\: Some of these plastic products look downright  
cheap and tacky, whereas others are very attractive.  
# Glass  
Glass was invented centuries before plastics, and because of its inherent  
transparency, glass has long been used as a signage material, particularly  
as clear protective lenses on sign cabinets such as directories. Glass has  
also long been used for edge‐lighting applications and as the tubing that  
encases neon and other luminous gases used for signage. Glass sheet  
is used for sign panels, lenses, and plaques, typically in transparent form  
with the familiar slightly greenish tint; a completely colorless low‐iron  
content glass sheet is also available, but at greater expense. Additionally,  
glass sheet is available in a wide variety of colors, levels of transparency  
or opacity, and surface textures, typically from specialized art glass  
suppliers.  
Glass sheet is very hard and scratch‐resistant, but with a great enough  
impact, it will shatter or chip. For this reason, glass is often tempered  
or laminated or both. Tempered glass sheet is treated after manufacture  
so that it will crumble into rectangular clumps rather than shatter into  
sharp shards on impact. Tempered glass, however, cannot be cut, drilled,  
sandblasted, or otherwise mechanically processed without risk of  
breaking, so any tooling or incised graphic application processes should be  
performed before a glass sign is tempered.  
Laminated glass can be tempered or not, and consists of two or more  
sheets of glass that are permanently laminated together with a plastic

interlayer that holds the glass fragments together if the laminated  
sheet is impacted. The lamination interlayer is quite strong; in fact, the  
most common application of laminated glass is in car windshields,  
which deform little even if riddled with cracks from an impact. Large  
freestanding glass signs can be self‐supporting if made from several  
sheets of glass that are laminated together, although laminated edges  
should be protected from the elements on exterior signs. Also, many  
glass suppliers can provide graphics on the lamination interlayer, as  
well as manipulate the interlayer’s color, texture, and opacity. Ceramic  
frit, which is applied to a glass surface and baked to become integral  
with it, is a very durable graphic application technique for glass. \(See  
Figures 6.43 through 6.47.\)  
Glass sign panels typically need a support structure, which is usually  
visible due to the transparency of glass. Supports can include a  
continuous frame that surrounds the sign perimeter, or individual supports  
at strategic points, although opaque glass panels can be supported by  
hidden structures. Frameless glass signs should always have eased  
edges, which are very slightly beveled at a 45‐degree angle to prevent  
chipping and ease the sharpness of 90‐degree cuts.  
Other characteristics of glass include\: excellent appearance; good to  
excellent durability; heavy weight; and medium to high expense. It does  
not require protective coatings, but it must be cleaned periodically to  
maintain transparency.

# Wood  
As sign materials, wood and wood products are less commonly used today  
than they were a few decades ago, having been replaced to a great extent  
by new materials on the plastics front. Nevertheless, wood and products  
made from wood, such as particleboard, are still used for some signage,  
including sign faces and plaques, as well as for lightweight structures.  
Wood products come in both structural and sheet forms, from cheap  
pine 2‐by‐4s and plywood to fancy lathe‐turned posts and exotic solid  
hardwood or veneered panels. All wood products can be painted or

clear‐coated, and can take a range of surface textures, from smooth  
to highly textured. Typically, the more lowly and unattractive the wood  
product, such as medium‐density fiberboard \(MDF\), the more likely it is  
to be used simply as substrate panel, to be covered up with paint and  
graphics. On the other hand, richly grained hardwood can be exploited for  
its attractive appearance in signage design, as it is in fine furniture and  
cabinetry. In many cases, surfaces of lower‐quality wood products are  
laminated with a veneer, which is a thin layer of high‐quality wood, often  
with unusual graining. \(See Figures 6.48 and 6.49.\)  
Other characteristics of wood products range from poor to excellent  
appearance; low to high durability; light to medium weight; and low to

6.49 high expense. Wood products, particularly in exterior applications, must be  
protected with opaque paint or clear sealer.  
# Fabrics  
Fabric is a sign material that has the unique property of flexibility;  
consequently, it is typically used for exterior signage applications such  
as awnings, billboards, banners, and flags. In the case of awnings and  
billboards, the fabric is stretched over a rigid frame; fabric banners and  
flags are freer to move with the wind, so they can lend animation and a  
festive quality to a site. \(See Figures 6.50 and 6.51.\)  
Typical sign fabrics are made of natural fibers, such as cotton, or synthetic  
fibers, and can be opaque, translucent, or open‐mesh. Certain sign fabrics  
are available under trade names in a fairly wide range of colors, including  
some metallics. Translucent vinyl‐coated sign fabrics are commonly used  
for internally illuminated awnings and sign faces, and opaque vinyl‐coated  
sign fabrics are used for billboards and other large outdoor signs. A  
reinforcement netting is often woven into these vinyl‐coated fabrics, which  
can be visually objectionable when viewed at close range.  
Obviously, sign fabrics cannot be used structurally, and all fabric signs have  
limited life spans. When necessary they should be coated with UV inhibitors  
to reduce degradation from sun exposure. Most fabric signs have a good  
to excellent appearance and low to medium durability; they are lightweight,  
and their expense is low to medium. Keep in mind, however, that fabrication  
and installation of structures to hold fabric signs involve additional expense.  
# Masonry  
Masonry is a somewhat uncommon material for signage, but thanks  
to its inherent monumentality, it can be used to great effect. Masonry  
materials for signage include stone, brick, and precast concrete varieties  
that are typically used in architectural applications. Masonry can be used  
for sign faces and plaques, and masonry signs can be either solid and self‐  
supporting or supported by an internal steel structure.  
Stone, the most prestigious of the masonry materials, includes marble,  
granite, slate, limestone, sandstone, and others; and many textural and  
color varieties of each of these types of stone are also available. Stone  
can be used for both exterior and interior signage, although many marble  
varieties are too soft for exterior use. Stone surface textures can vary,  
from a mirror polish to a rough natural texture, depending on the type  
of stone used. Like glass, exposed edges of certain types of stone may  
require easing to reduce chipping and sharpness. Other characteristics of  
masonry sign materials are\: very good to excellent appearance; very high  
durability; heavy weight; and high to very high expense. \(See Figures  
6.52 to 6.54.\)

# Adhesives and Fasteners  
Adhesives and fasteners are literally the glue and tape and nuts and bolts  
that hold signage hardware units together and signage hardware units  
to their mounting surfaces. Adhesives used for sign hardware are far  
more sophisticated than ordinary household glues and tapes, and include  
liquids, gels, and tapes that can establish extremely powerful bonds  
between surfaces of sign components without physically penetrating the  
components. In fact, some of the adhesives used in the sign industry  
come from the aircraft industry, where they’re used to bond aircraft skins to  
airframes. Indeed some adhesives are considered to create chemical welds.  
Adhesives are typically used to join finish sign materials to each other or to  
structural components, as well as to secure signs to mounting surfaces.  
Fasteners include nuts, bolts, screws, clips, and other devices typically  
made of metal that penetrate sign components to form strong mechanical  
connections within sign units, and between sign units and mounting  
structures or surfaces. Mechanical connections are very strong and are  
usually necessary for securing sign structures together, for securing sign  
bodies to their structures, and, in the case of heavier sign units, for securing  
sign units to mounting surfaces. Unlike adhesives, which form an effectively  
permanent bond, mechanical fasteners have the advantage of being  
removable, which allows access to the interiors of sign units for servicing,  
such as to replace burned‐out lamps or to update directory listings.  
6.53  
6.54  
234 Fasteners are manufactured from a variety of metals, including stainless  
steel, galvanized steel, aluminum, brass, and chrome‐plated brass. When  
attractiveness and corrosion resistance are considerations, stainless steel  
fasteners are often employed. But because fasteners often join dissimilar  
metals, such as aluminum and stainless steel, they and the metals they  
join must be protected against corrosion that results from a weak galvanic  
or electrical reaction that occurs when dissimilar metals come in contact  
with one another.  
Many mechanical fasteners and connections are not terribly attractive in  
appearance, but often they can be concealed—sometimes with ease,  
sometimes with difficulty, depending on the application. But there are  
times when there’s no choice but to leave the fasteners exposed to  
view. In such situations, the EG designer may choose to minimize the  
appearance of the exposed fasteners by hiding them in a reveal or painting  
them the same color as the sign panel; alternatively, the designer may  
choose to accentuate the appearance of the exposed fasteners, thereby  
making them a design asset rather than a liability. Fortunately, there are  
several types of fasteners that are quite attractive and thereby suitable for  
exploitation as a design feature.  
Some designed objects, such as the Eiffel Tower, revel in their exposed  
mechanics. Others, such as the Statue of Liberty, also engineered by  
Gustav Eiffel, intentionally hide their nuts and bolts. The choice boils down  
to what is the appropriate aesthetic for the project at hand. Examples  
of signs and sign programs with purposefully exposed fasteners can be  
found throughout this book.  
Welding is another form of mechanical connection, in which two pieces  
of the same metal are essentially melted together along a joint by heat or  
electricity. Welding forms very strong connections and is often used for  
connecting hidden structural components. Welding can also join together  
finish sign components, when the raised bead formed by the welding  
process is ground smooth.  
Regarding sign mounting, lighter sign units such as wall plaques can  
be readily secured to mounting surfaces with just adhesives, typically  
double‐sided foam tape, which is often used in conjunction with silicone  
gel adhesive. Adhesive mounting is often combined with mechanical  
fasteners, such as when a foam tape/silicone bond is augmented with  
mechanical fasteners for extra mounting support, a combination known  
as screw and glue. And mounting pins for individual cut or fabricated  
letters, or for heavier sign plaques, are often secured with adhesives  
or mechanical parts into pockets drilled into a wall. Large and/or heavy  
sign units often require connection into a building’s underlying structural  
system, which can be inches—or sometimes feet—beyond a ceiling or  
wall surface.  
Basic Sign Materials  
235 The Hardware System  
236  
In cases where ease of changeability is a consideration, there are several  
methods and products, many proprietary, for attaching signs together or  
to mounting surfaces while discouraging tampering and allowing relatively  
easy changeability. These methods and products provide connections that  
make it possible to remove sign panels or other components; they range  
from magnetized sheeting to slide‐in windows and lenses to hook‐and‐loop  
fasteners, commonly known as Velcro, a trademarked product, and more.  
In a sustainability note, fasteners are considered more environmentally  
friendly than adhesives for two primary reasons. First, fasteners don’t  
release noxious solvents or fumes like many adhesives do; second,  
fasteners allow easier disassembly of materials for reuse or recycling  
when the signs have ended their useful life. Joining in sustainability  
efforts, manufacturers of adhesives used in the sign industry are  
developing more eco‐friendly products, which is welcome since adhesives  
are useful in historical projects, which often prohibit mechanical fastening  
to historical building materials.  
# Electronic Digital Display Units  
Electronic digital displays, also called dynamic digital displays or variable  
message systems, draw the human eye like a flame draws a moth.  
These glowing, often animated devices are digitally controlled screens  
that display changeable and updatable sign messages, such as the flight  
information display systems \(FIDS\) at airports. Other applications of  
electronic digital displays include menu boards, hotel events, interactive  
building and campus directories, time and temperature displays, train  
departure/arrival information, scoreboards, stock tickers, marquees, and  
countless others. The EGD communication possibilities of electronic digital  
displays are endless, as is the need for changeable, updatable information.  
Chapter 1 has an overview of the relationship of digital communication  
devices to more traditional EGD media, particularly static signage, and  
basic definitions of types of digital devices currently in use, these being  
digital signage, interactive kiosks, and mobile devices. Chapter 1 also  
distinguishes digital signage and interactive kiosks, which use electronic or  
dynamic digital display screens deployed in a permanent location to display  
preprogrammed information, from mobile devices, which have portable  
screens that the phone or tablet owners carry with them to select any  
personalized information they want or need. That said, tablet devices are  
being increasingly deployed in fixed locations to display preprogrammed  
information, which may or may not be interactive. \(See Figure 6.55.\)  
This section of the chapter provides an overview of the electronic display  
units that are deployed in fixed positions for the display of dynamic or  
changeable information on digital signage and interactive kiosks. The 6.55 Fixed deployment of mobile devices  
delivers product information at the New York  
Auto Show.  
6.55  
electronic display units that are used on mobile devices are developed by  
the phone or tablet manufacturer and then selected by the buyer of the  
mobile unit; the EG designer—and the mobile device’s owner, for that  
matter—has little or no control over what display screen technology is used  
on mobile devices. There are situations, however, in which the EG designer  
may have some control over the display units selected for deployed digital  
signage and interactive kiosk applications. One of these situations includes  
the fixed deployment of mobile tablets that deliver preprogrammed  
information, such as hotel meeting room schedules or product information,  
in a manner similar to digital signage or interactive kiosks.  
There are several hardware and software components used in the process  
of generating, delivering, and displaying changeable electronic information  
on digital signage and interactive kiosks. As discussed in Chapter 1, the  
process and components are complex and expensive, and often involve  
several areas of technical expertise beyond the EG designer’s milieu. As  
stated previously, this book’s focus is on static signage programs, but  
since digital devices are becoming more a part of an overall environmental  
communication or branding strategy, an overview of the actual deployed  
units that display digital information is in order.  
Since digital information technology is changing so rapidly, this overview  
is not intended to be an exhaustive treatise on how to become an expert  
in all aspects of that technology, but merely to familiarize EG designers  
with the basic types of display unit technology currently used in deployed  
scenarios. Since these display units are the physical objects people most

associate with deployed digital information displays, they are included in  
this chapter on the sign hardware system, but keep in mind that other  
physical components, typically not visible to the sign user, are also part of  
the digital information delivery system. Nonphysical components such as  
software and content are also essential for digital information delivery.  
At the time of this writing, two of the most common digital display units  
are light‐emitting diode \(LED\) matrices and liquid crystal display \(LCD\)  
screens. With LED and LCD devices, the sign message or image is  
displayed on the unit itself, and can range from static words or images  
that update periodically to full motion video. Projection mapping is a  
different technology that can project spatially mapped images and video  
onto remote three‐dimensional surfaces or objects, such as walls, building  
facades, bridges, and other large‐scale environmental objects.  
LEDs are light‐emitting diodes that generate their own light and have  
no need for supplemental lighting to be seen. LED matrices are orderly  
assemblages of the tiny LEDs into columns and rows, and can consist  
of a single color, such as the familiar monochrome amber or red LED  
displays, or they can be combined into RGB groups to display a full  
color range. LED matrix modules can be seamlessly assembled into  
very large screens of more or less customary proportions \(think rock  
concert or sporting event screens\), or into horizontal linear ribbons \(think  
Times Square “zippers”\). The resolution of conventional LED matrices  
tends to be fairly coarse, but is constantly improving. The rather large  
depth of conventional LED modules can be a design consideration. \(See  
Figures 6.56 through 6.58.\)  
6.57  
6.58  
238 Organic LEDs \(OLEDs\) have a much finer resolution than conventional  
LED matrices, and are much thinner and can even be flexible and  
transparent. Due to their relatively high expense, OLEDs are currently  
being adopted primarily for small‐scale displays, such as on some  
mobile phones and tablets. It’s likely only a matter of time before OLED  
technology becomes more cost effective for use in large‐scale deployed  
digital display units.  
LCD screen technology is too complex to describe without several  
paragraphs and even then you’d scratch your head. Suffice to say that they  
provide full color and good resolution within limited screen proportions,  
also known as aspect ratios \(think the flat screen television or the  
computer monitor in your home or office\). LCD screens do not produce  
their own light, so are backlit, originally by fluorescent lamps but now  
primarily by white LED lamps, hence the misnomer “LED screen,” which  
is probably intentional because it sounds ultra‐high‐tech but actually just  
describes how the LCD screen is backlit, not how the screen images are  
generated. Large LCD screens are used as deployed digital display units;  
small LCD screens are used for mobile phone and tablet displays.  
Like everything else in the digital realm, LCD screens are evolving rapidly  
with bigger sizes, higher resolution, smaller bezels \(the enclosing frame  
surrounding the screen\), and thinner depth profiles being developed  
every day. While LCD screens have fixed aspect ratios, screens can be  
ganged up into unlimited configurations to create video walls or towers;  
smaller bezel sizes reduce the “window pane” effects of ganged LCD  
screens to create an almost seamless digital display surface in large‐scale  
deployments. \(See Figures 6.59 through 6.61.\) 6.59 LCD flat‐screen technology displays train  
information in branded layouts, typefaces, and  
colors at Washington Union Station.

239 The Hardware System  
240  
When considering the use of LED and LCD display components  
for deployed digital devices, the EG designer should be aware  
of the following hardware system design considerations for  
these units\:  
• Size and proportional limitations of active display area, bezel  
•  
size, display unit depth, and dimensions of any other associated  
hardware components that may need to be located adjacent to  
the display unit  
• Resolution and viewing angle limitations  
•  
• Need for electrical and datacom feeds; electrical is typically hard wired;  
•  
data can be delivered via hard‐wired or wireless technology  
• Venting, heating, cooling, and weather protection constraints  
•  
• Brightness of viewing environment, which is increasingly mitigated  
•  
by sensors that automatically adjust screen brightness to changes in  
ambient light conditions  
In addition to the above, the use of mobile tablets in deployed situations  
has other considerations for the EG designer\:  
• Securing the tablet from theft  
•  
• Need to recharge tablet batteries  
•  
• Prohibiting user selection of non‐preprogrammed information, for  
•  
example using a deployed tablet to surf the Internet or check the  
weather in Shanghai  
Other considerations for dynamic display units are control and content,  
which are typically beyond the skills base of most EG designers. As  
discussed in Chapter 1, electronic digital display units are basically empty  
canvases, waiting to be filled with text, image, and/or video content. How  
that content is delivered to the display devices is the control component.  
What that content is composed of and how it’s presented is the content  
component.  
All dynamic digital display units are computer‐controlled, with varying  
degrees of scale and sophistication. The display units can be tied  
into a larger computer or communications network maintained  
by the client, can be on their own dedicated network, or can be  
individually controlled—all via wired or wireless connections. The  
point is, each installation is different, hence requires information  
technology \(IT\) experts to create or tailor control software to  
each specific display application; some basic applications, such  
as electronic menu boards, are available as packages that require  
relatively little technical support. Content for dynamic display devices can range from simple generic  
text messages to sharp typeface and graphics rendition to full  
streaming video, depending on the display technology and resolution.  
Even nonvideo text and image content can be animated with flashes,  
crawls, dissolves, wipes, zooms, and other simple techniques.  
Although EG designers don’t often have the opportunity to become  
involved in the actual production of content for deployed dynamic  
display devices, the appearance and quality of that content are  
concerns because, more often than not, both are lacking. At our office  
we always advise our clients to consider carefully the nature of the  
content that will be displayed, who will generate that content, how  
that content will be sequenced and presented, who will update and  
manage the content over time, and other similar concerns. Keep in  
mind that digital content nature, mix, sequencing, action, and other  
aspects may be limited by local codes or authorities, particularly in  
large public deployments where aesthetic, distraction, safety, and  
other factors are concerns.  
The best sources for information about dynamic display units are their  
manufacturers, as they tend to have the most up‐to‐date technical  
information about their display products. Some display manufacturers  
can also provide control systems, including computer hardware and  
software, engineered for their units and the client’s needs, along with  
training for the end users on the client side. Some IT consultants and  
A/V integrators draw from a number of sources to assemble complete  
turnkey systems for the delivery and display of digital information,  
which include cabinetry for the display units, content management  
and sometimes development, all controlling systems and equipment,  
installation, and end‐user training.  
Due to the diverse and developing skills set relating to deployed  
digital information systems, the static signage industry has not been  
the leading force in this arena, but that is evolving with knowledge  
expansion, technological development, and client demand. To a certain  
extent, the same can be said for EG designers. As stated in Chapter  
1, the digital information field is changing rapidly, and partnerships and  
shared knowledge can help clarify and harness this rapid change. Once  
again, it isn’t the point of this book to go into deep technical detail  
about digital information systems, so designers and sign fabricators  
can learn more and stay abreast of developments by tapping the  
resources of the SEGD, the International Sign Association, the  
Digital Screenmedia Association, the Digital Signage Federation, and  
DigitalSignageToday.com.

# Digital Trends in EGD  
# Leslie Wolke  
Digital screens are our ubiquitous companions, our  
gateways to information and entertainment, and  
our window to virtual communities. Neilson tells  
us that we spend more than a third of our 24‐hour  
days looking at screens\: the screens on our smart  
phones, computers, TVs, and those embedded in  
the environment.  
Manufacturers strive for the slimmest, sharpest,  
and most immersive—from 5‐inch smart phones  
to 15,000‐square‐foot digital billboards. But what  
do these digital canvases and portals mean within  
the realm of EGD and wayfinding?  
# Digital Signage  
Digital screens can provide ambient  
architectural cues and enliven interior and  
exterior spaces. The immense collection of  
digital screens at LAX Tom Bradley International  
Airport welcomes arriving passengers, celebrates  
local culture, and guides passengers down the  
concourses.  
In complicated environments, digital signs  
can deliver contextual and multilingual  
wayfinding information to passersby. From  
hotel conference room identification signs that  
display the day’s meeting schedule to directional  
signs that show destinations in the visiting  
population’s major languages, digital signs can  
give EG designers a medium to deliver more  
relevant, complex, or time‐sensitive messages  
than static signs afford.  
When incorporated into traditional sign  
forms, digital screens add a platform for  
changeable messaging. A donor recognition  
installation may feature the names of major  
donors inscribed in marble with less substantial,  
but more numerous donors animated on an  
adjacent digital screen. The most successful  
242  
digital/static compositions are designed as a  
single, unified experience.  
Digital screens have broken free of the confines  
of the black rectangle. Fabricators and designers  
are experimenting with kinetic and engaging use of  
screen technology. Designers can compose LEDs  
into sculptural forms such as ribbons, mosaics, and  
spires.  
Resolution is not always a virtue. Not every  
application of digital technology requires—or  
even benefits from—the highest resolution  
display system that money can buy. Flip‐dot  
boards, LED sticks, LCD projection, and digital  
tickers add engaging and playful vivacity to EGD  
projects.  
# Interactive Kiosks  
The most successful kiosk systems are built  
to serve a single, concise function that can be  
completed in under two minutes. Touch‐screen  
kiosks such as ATMs, airport check‐in, and gas  
station pay‐pumps are part of daily life. In most  
circumstances, people prefer not to linger in front  
of a kiosk or to enter personal information. Kiosks  
are tools for quick exchanges, such as getting  
directions or purchasing tickets.  
The most intuitive touch screens work like our  
smart phones. There is a learning curve associated  
with every first interaction with a new kiosk. There  
are no standards in the user interface design for  
kiosks, so we must look to smart phone interfaces  
for familiar gestures and interaction models to  
ensure maximum usability. This means large  
buttons, short text, and a minimal number of steps  
to complete a task.  
Inside complicated buildings, interactive  
kiosks are better orientation devices than our Digital Trends in EGD continued  
smart phones. Because kiosks can be designed  
to be location‐aware \(to “know” where they are  
stationed\), visitors can see their exact location on  
a map in the context of the building or campus and  
get directions to their destination. While indoor  
positioning and mapping is in its early stages,  
kiosks currently offer more relevant wayfinding  
tools for the widest audience.  
In museums and cultural centers, interactive  
screens offer the opportunity to further  
engage with the subject matter. Most  
museums only offer a bit of wall text to define  
the object at hand. Companion kiosks present an  
opportunity for visitors to immerse themselves  
in the history, context, and significance of the  
object, making the object—and the visit—more  
memorable.  
Designers can harness the best attributes  
of interactive kiosks and smart phones to  
deliver seamless experiences to visitors. As  
mentioned above, kiosks excel at delivering  
location‐specific information, while smart  
phones are our personal navigation devices. For  
example, a visitor can generate directions on a  
wayfinding kiosk and then send them via text to  
their smart phone, so they can refer to them on  
their journey.  
# Mobile Devices  
Mobile has emerged as the primary wayfinding  
platform. While digital signs and interactive kiosks  
play important roles in the situations discussed  
above, the smart phone is our trusty wayfinding  
companion and the tool most used to explore and  
comprehend the world around us.  
Indoor positioning and mapping are the  
final frontiers of mobile navigation. Indoor  
positioning technology offers the ability to locate  
the position of a user’s smart phone indoors  
and deliver relevant information to that user  
based on his or her position. While the battle of  
supporting technology wages \(Wi‐Fi, beacons,  
etc.\), consumer expectations are growing—and  
it is critical that EG designers of complicated  
environments monitor market adoption and  
experiments in usability.  
In most cases, the efforts to develop a specialty  
wayfinding app outweigh its potential use.  
There are a number of formidable hurdles\:  
delivering more relevant features than Google  
Maps \(the leading navigation app and the standard  
on the majority of mobile devices\); promoting  
the app to your intended audience; convincing  
them to download it; and reminding them to  
use it. Mobile‐optimized websites can offer the  
same functionality of an app, with less friction for  
adoption and use.  
Navigating by listening to directions—like  
in‐car GPS—is much easier than following  
step‐by‐step directions or a map. As indoor  
positioning matures, the best way to direct  
visitors will be auditory directions via smart  
phone. No more squinting at small screens  
while walking.  
Developments in wearable technology have  
enormous potential for enhanced wayfinding  
and contextual information. From Google  
Glass and smart watches to smart clothing, we  
will discover ways to orient and guide people  
in unfamiliar places. With their expertise in the  
physical and visual aspects of wayfinding, EG  
designers can play a leading role in how this next  
generation of devices elevates and eases the  
wayfinding experience.

243 Stock Sign Hardware Systems  
Back in the static signage realm, there are several manufacturers of  
proprietary “stock” sign hardware systems in several different styles—  
some quite attractive—for both interior and exterior use. Each of these  
stock systems, typically patented, offers a unique hardware system, often  
with specially interlocking and/or changeable parts. Most stock systems  
are kits of hardware parts that can be configured in many different ways  
by the EG designer. Manufacturers of stock systems also offer a range of  
techniques for applying graphics to their hardware systems, which also  
provides creative opportunities to the EG designer. \(See Figures 6.62  
and 6.63.\)  
Although this book is geared toward custom‐designed sign programs,  
including the hardware system, we mention stock hardware systems  
because they can sometimes play a useful role in sign programs that are  
primarily custom‐designed. A strategy of adopting stylistically compatible  
stock systems, or components of them, can make good sense for certain  
sign types within a custom‐designed program. Such situations include when  
ease of changeability, maintenance, and cost savings are critical factors.  
Stock systems have both pros and cons. Pros include\:  
• Ease of changeability and maintenance. This feature is particularly  
•  
useful for static building or mall directories that feature several strips  
listing tenant names, which change on an ongoing basis. Many  
stock directory manufacturers offer convenient strip reorder services  
The Hardware System  
6.62 This stock sign hardware system, designed  
by EG designer Roger Whitehouse, features a  
variety of changeable components common to  
most stock systems.  
6.62  
244 6.63 This stock sign hardware system features  
curved aluminum panel extrusions with flat end  
caps. In this example, a flexible plastic insert  
displays custom‐designed graphics.  
6.63  
that provide new strips that match the originals in size, color, and  
material, as well as in typeface, type size, and type position. This ease  
of changeability is also useful for employee name and other signs  
requiring regular updating. Additionally, many stock manufacturers offer  
software and templates so that end users of their products can print  
their own new inserts in‐house. Other stock sign components are also  
easily replaced.  
• Design cost savings. Because the hardware system is already  
•  
designed in a stock system, EG designers don’t need to spend as  
much time as they would on custom design of the hardware aspect  
of a sign program. Note, however, that even with stock systems, the  
EG designer still must spend time researching the various available  
systems, evaluating and selecting one, and configuring and specifying  
it for the project at hand. Of course, the EG designer must also develop  
the graphic system for a stock hardware system, which is important  
to keep in mind because a unique graphic system can customize the  
appearance of a stock hardware system.  
• Manufacturing cost savings. These should accrue due to the fact  
•  
that sign fabricators don’t have to completely reinvent the wheel when  
using stock systems. However, to make a finished sign, many stock  
systems still need to be worked by cutting, painting, assembling,  
applying graphics, and so on, in the manufacturer’s or fabricator’s shop.  
Nevertheless, the manufacturing costs for a stock system can be lower  
than for a custom‐designed, custom‐built one.  
Stock Sign Hardware Systems  
245 The Hardware System  
246  
Cons of stock hardware systems include the following\:  
• Stylistic limitations. Because each stock hardware system is  
•  
predesigned, each has its own three‐dimensional appearance, which  
often doesn’t lend itself to much manipulation by the EG designer,  
thereby locking the designer into a given style that is undistinguishable  
from that of another project using the same system.  
• Size limitations. These tend to be more of a problem with exterior  
•  
stock systems than interior ones, because exterior systems often  
are not large enough to carry typographic sizes adequate for good  
readability by drivers, unless they’re used in lower‐speed environments  
such as service drives and parking areas. Even interior stock systems  
may not be available in sizes or proportions that suit the necessary  
message content or viewing conditions.  
• Quality. Some stock systems have materials that look downright cheap,  
•  
and/or have parts that fit together badly. In this regard, be aware that the  
photos in stock system catalogs can be deceiving, so the EG designer  
should always obtain actual samples of any stock systems under  
evaluation to assess their quality and suitability for the project at hand.  
Most stock systems are available “to the trade,” meaning that they can be  
purchased by custom sign fabricators for use in larger overall sign programs  
that are primarily custom. A few stock systems, however, are still available  
only directly from the system manufacturer, which makes them difficult  
for the EG designer to incorporate into a larger program involving custom  
fabrication, as this situation requires two different sources for the program’s  
signs\: the stock system manufacturer and the custom sign fabricator.  
# Sign Materials and Codes  
From the preceding discussion of sign materials, it would seem an  
endless palette of materials is available for the EG designer to manipulate  
on a formal basis. It’s important to know, however, that the use of certain  
sign materials may be prescribed by both local sign ordinances and  
building codes. For example, a local sign ordinance for a historical district  
may require that all exterior signs be made of painted, carved wood, or at  
least have the appearance of being made of such materials, to maintain  
the district’s historical quality. Sign ordinances for other districts may favor  
the use of fabric banners, or masonry signs, or metal signs accented with  
neon; or there may be no restrictions on sign materials. Sign ordinances  
also may prohibit certain materials, such as metal sign boxes with  
internally illuminated plastic faces, or electronic digital display units.  
Building codes can also prescribe certain sign materials, usually for life  
safety reasons. These codes typically concern flammability and durability of  
sign materials, as well as the integrity of structural and electrical systems. Overview of Sign Coatings and Finishes  
Just as there is a wide array of materials used for a signage program’s  
hardware system, there is a wide range of coatings and finishes that provide  
decorative or protective surface treatments for sign materials. As in the earlier  
section of this chapter on materials, this section provides an overview of  
basic coatings and finishes for basic sign materials. And, as with materials,  
samples and swatches of coatings and finishes under consideration should  
be obtained whenever possible. Finally, like materials, coatings in particular  
have characteristics that warrant consideration in sustainability strategies.  
The meaning of the term coating is fairly clear\: It’s a dissimilar substance,  
such as paint, that’s applied to the surface of another material, thereby  
creating a new final, outer surface. The term finish, however, can be more  
confusing because it’s often used to refer to two slightly different things.  
On one hand, it can refer to the gloss level of an applied coating, such  
as matte finish paint; on the other hand, it can refer to a surface texture  
created on a material, such as brushed finish aluminum. In both senses,  
the word finish refers to surface treatments, but the former meaning  
involves a substance applied to the material, while the latter involves the  
material itself. To minimize this confusion, this chapter will use gloss level  
instead of finish when referring to coatings. Note that the SAD requires a  
“non‐glare finish,” or low gloss level, on sign surfaces.  
# Coatings  
Coatings for sign hardware components include paints and clear coatings,  
powder coatings, porcelain enamel, patinas and oxide coatings, and vinyl  
or other plastic films. Each of these basic coating categories is described  
in more detail here.  
# Paints and Clear Coatings  
Paints and clear coatings, often referred to as liquid or organic coatings,  
are probably the most common and well‐known coatings for signs. These  
coatings are typically applied as liquids and dry to a thin solid film.  
Extremely versatile, paints and clear coatings can be applied to virtually  
any material on the planet, and can easily conform to complex three‐  
dimensional shapes. Not your ordinary roller‐applied latex wall paint,  
exterior sign paints are specifically formulated to withstand the ravages of  
continuous exposure to the elements—sun, rain, ice, snow, and sand—  
just as automotive paints are.  
Manufacturers of sign paints offer a wide range of colors, including  
metallics and pearlescents, and gloss levels, from high gloss to dead  
matte. Each sign paint manufacturer offers its own range of colors, and  
most sign paint systems can provide custom matching of colors from  
Overview of Sign Coatings and Finishes  
247 6.64 Paint swatch books from two sign paint  
manufacturers. Manufacturers are continually  
adding new colors, finishes, and formulas,  
including low VOC formulas.  
The Hardware System  
6.64  
another color system, providing the EG designer with a virtually unlimited  
palette of colors from which to choose. \(See Figure 6.64.\)  
Sign paints typically require a primer or base coat that’s applied directly  
to the sign material before application of the topcoat, which contains the  
selected color. Sign paints are usually applied by spray gun to achieve a  
smooth, even surface, and are baked in a large oven after application to  
“cure” the paint, which dries and hardens it.  
In addition to opaque sign paints, there are also liquid clear coatings, which  
typically perform a protective function while allowing the base material  
to show through, just as clear polyurethane varnish protects a wood floor  
while allowing the beauty of the wood’s grain to show. In signage, clear  
coats are commonly used to prevent the darkening and discoloring that  
oxidation causes on the “yellow” and “red” metals, such as brass or  
copper. Aluminum is also often clear‐coated to reduce oxidation, although  
this is not strictly required since oxidation doesn’t substantially affect the  
appearance or strength of aluminum. In addition to their use on unpainted  
materials, clear coats are often applied over painted sign materials, just as  
they are on many of today’s automotive body components. As with opaque  
paints, clear coats are available in a wide range of gloss levels.  
For many years, sign paints and clear coatings were formulated with a  
relatively high level of harmful volatile organic compounds \(VOCs\) as solvents.  
Sustainability concerns have led many paint manufacturers to develop low or  
zero VOC coatings suitable for sign industry applications; ongoing research  
and development continue to expand and improve these more eco‐friendly  
choices. Most full‐service sign fabricators have in‐house equipment for  
applying conventional and low/no VOC paints and clear coats to signs.  
248Powder Coatings  
Powder coatings, like paints, are dissimilar coatings applied over sign  
materials, and are generally considered more durable than paint coatings.  
Also like paints, powder coatings can easily conform to complex shapes.  
But unlike liquid paints, powder coatings are finely ground, electrically  
charged particles that are sprayed dry onto the sign material; the particles  
are held in place by an electrostatic charge until the coated material is  
heated in a curing oven to fuse the particles together into a uniform coating.  
Due to the relatively high heat involved in powder coat curing, it was  
originally used only on metals, but technological developments are making  
it increasingly possible to use powder coats on plastic and wood materials.  
Powder coating is a newer process than liquid coating, so it’s not as  
widely used as other coatings in the sign or other industries, particularly  
in the United States, but it is gaining ground and becoming more widely  
available as a coating option. However, because it’s not as widely used  
as liquid coating, color palettes for powder coating are generally more  
limited than those of paints, but custom colors can be developed. Powder  
coats can also be metallic or clear, and can range from high to low gloss.  
Additionally, powder coat textures can range from smooth to wrinkled to  
rough. And, since powder coating doesn’t involve use of VOC solvents, it’s  
considered a more sustainable coating process than painting. Few sign  
fabricators have in‐house powder coating equipment, so most powder  
coating is subcontracted to outside suppliers.  
# Porcelain Enamel  
Porcelain enamel is an extremely durable coating in which finely ground  
glass particles are applied to a metal base \(typically, aluminum or steel  
in the sign industry\) and heated to a very high temperature to fuse the  
particles into a smooth glass coating, which is noticeably thicker and richer  
than most other coatings used in the sign industry. Porcelain enameling  
has ancient roots in both Eastern and Western cultures, as can be seen on  
jewelry and other decorative objects, such as intricate Chinese cloisonné  
vases and lavish French Fabergé eggs.  
In signs with porcelain enamel coatings, the graphics are typically fused  
into the coating, rather than being applied later by a different process,  
resulting in very durable, surface‐integrated graphics. For this reason,  
porcelain enameling is an ideal coating for signs in high‐wear environments  
such as subway stations and exterior exhibits. In fact, the porcelain enamel  
signs of the London Underground are so emblematic of that system that  
miniature enameled signs are sold as souvenirs of London.  
Recent developments in signage applications of porcelain enameling allow  
graphics with an improved degree of resolution and tonal range, as well as  
wider color ranges—although exact color matching isn’t always possible.  
Overview of Sign Coatings and Finishes  
249 Porcelain enamel coatings can range from transparent to opaque, but  
opaque colors are typically used for signage. The gloss level of porcelain  
coatings can range from high to low. Porcelain enamel coatings are  
generally used on flat sign panels, as these coatings don’t readily conform  
to complex three‐dimensional shapes. Few sign fabricators have porcelain‐  
enameling equipment, so most porcelain work is subcontracted to specialty  
suppliers. A porcelain enameled sign is shown in Figure 5.68 of Chapter 5.  
# Patinas and Oxide Coatings  
Patinas and oxide coatings occur only on metals and are the result of  
corrosion, a chemical reaction between metals and elements, such  
as oxygen or sulfur, in the environment. The term patina refers to the  
coatings that form on the yellow and red metals, such as bronze, brass,  
and copper. When exposed to weather, these metals will naturally turn  
brown, and then greenish, just as a copper penny does over time. This  
process can be hastened, and the resulting colors somewhat controlled,  
by the application of different chemicals to the copper alloy metals, and  
then sealing the surface to prevent further oxidation. \(See Figure 6.65.\)  
Verdigris, a green or greenish‐blue coating, such as that on the Statue of  
Liberty, is a common patina, as is a dark brown patina.  
Anodizing is a process by which the oxide layer that naturally forms on the  
surface of aluminum is thickened by an electrochemical process, forming  
a very hard, integral, almost glasslike surface coating. The resulting  
aluminum oxide coating is effectively clear, although slightly cloudy,  
making clear anodized aluminum slightly less shiny than unanodized  
aluminum. Anodized aluminum can be colored in bright or subtle  
tones using various dyes, and relatively new processes allow full‐color,  
photographic‐quality graphics to be integral to a clear anodized coating.  
The Hardware System  
6.65 Metal patina coatings can occur naturally  
over time or can be applied, as with this  
chemically accelerated green patina on an  
oxidized bronze sign at Rockefeller University in  
New York.  
250  
6.65 Aluminum sheet can be anodized by the sheet manufacturer, or aluminum  
components can be anodized on a batch basis after assembly. Most sign  
fabricators don’t have anodizing facilities so they either use pre‐anodized  
sheets or send aluminum sign components to an outside anodizing  
supplier.  
Rust is an oxide layer that develops on the surface of all iron and steel,  
except for stainless steel. Unlike the aluminum oxide coating that  
strengthens the surface of anodized aluminum, the iron oxide or rust that  
forms on steel typically weakens it and detracts from its appearance. For  
this reason, steel used in signage is almost always painted to prevent  
rust. That said, an iron oxide coating can lend a certain rustic appearance,  
and Cor‐Ten and other weathering steels are specifically manufactured  
to oxidize to a reddish brown naturally over time in exterior environments  
without losing their strength and without extensive surface flaking.  
All patinas and oxide coatings conform to complex shapes, particularly if  
applied under controlled versus natural conditions. Gloss levels vary with  
the base material, process, and any additional top‐coating used over the  
oxidized coating.  
# Plastic and Vinyl Films  
Plastic and vinyl films are thin, flexible self‐adhesive sheets that can  
be applied to a range of sign materials. There are clear protective films,  
including antigraffiti films, that are applied to materials with or without  
other coatings, as well as translucent and opaque films in a fairly limited  
range of integral colors. Other plastic films simulate metal, wood, and  
stone surfaces with varying degrees of success—some are very realistic,  
others aren’t. High resolutions and unlimited colors and tonal ranges  
are available when white vinyl films are digitally imaged with graphics.  
Several examples of signs with plastic and vinyl firms are pictured  
throughout this book.  
Vinyl and plastic films with a high gloss level are widely available, and  
some films have semigloss or matte surfaces. The self‐adhesive films  
used in signage are suitable for application to primarily flat surfaces, as  
they typically don’t conform to complex shapes, although stretchable  
films have been developed to wrap objects with complex curves, such as  
automobile bodies and train car interiors.  
# Finishes  
In an effort to reduce the confusion between the terms finishes and  
coatings, as used in this book, the term finishes refers to textures created  
directly on the surfaces of certain sign materials. Finish textures can be  
imparted to the material’s surface either during the material manufacturing  
process or after manufacturing, typically in the sign fabricator’s shop after  
the sign material has been worked or assembled by the shop personnel.  
Overview of Sign Coatings and Finishes  
251 6.66 Random finish applied to aluminum panels  
provides visual interest and hides scratches on  
exterior signs at the University of Pennsylvania  
in Philadelphia.  
Most post‐manufacturing‐imparted finishes are created by mechanical devices  
using abrasives such as belt sanders and sandblasting guns, although some  
are created by chemical etching. The texture of mechanical finishes varies  
with the texture of the abrasive used—the smaller the abrasive particles,  
the smoother the finish, and vice versa. Although there is a wide range of  
both manufacturing‐imparted and post‐manufacturing‐imparted finishes, this  
section will focus on the basic finishes for most of the essential sign materials.  
# Metal Finishes  
Metal finishes can range from a completely smooth, mirrorlike polish to  
coarser textures consisting of scratches to the metal surface. One of the  
most common examples of the latter is a grained, directional texture,  
often called a brushed or satin finish. Another type of scratched finish  
is a nondirectional, or random, finish, in which the scratches have no  
discernable grain direction. \(See Figure 6.66.\)  
Other mechanical finishes for metals include sandblasting and bead  
blasting, which produce a uniform blanket of pits rather than scratches  
in the metal surface, giving the surface a more frosted look than  
scratch finishes. Metal surfaces are also sometimes acid‐etched, which  
creates a finely frosted surface. Some metals are available with unique  
manufacturing‐imparted finishes, such as embossed textures; but in the  
sign industry, most metal finishes are imparted in the sign fabricator’s  
shop. \(See Figures 6.67 through 6.69.\)

6.67 6.68  
# Plastic Finishes  
Plastic finishes are typically imparted in the manufacturing process  
and are rarely altered in the sign fabricator’s shop. The most common  
factory‐imparted finish for acrylic and polycarbonate sheet is a completely  
smooth, mirrorlike polish, although some frosted and other textured  
finishes are available for these commonly used sign plastics. Other 6.68 Examples of various finishes on

available from glass manufacturers and  
suppliers.  
The Hardware System  
6.70  
plastics used in the sign industry have factory‐imparted finishes that range  
from completely mirrorlike smooth to pebbled to directionally grained.  
# Glass Finishes  
Glass finishes can be imparted by the glass manufacturer or a glass  
supplier \(see Figure 6.70\); the most common is the typical completely  
smooth polish. A wide range of glass surface textures and patterns can  
be created in the manufacturing process, while others are imparted by  
mechanical or chemical processes after manufacturing. Chemical etching  
and sandblasting are used to create frosted‐glass finishes, with chemical  
etching producing a finer frosted texture than sandblasting; note that there  
are some considerations in applying frosted finishes to tempered glass.  
Mechanically produced scratch finishes are not typical for glass.  
# Stone Finishes  
Stone finishes are typically created by the stone quarry or stone supplier.  
Stone finishes range from completely smooth, mirror‐like polishes to  
rough‐hewn textures. Honed stone finishes are produced mechanically  
and are smooth, but nonreflective, effectively similar to a frosted finish on  
glass or metal. Thermal stone finishes are more roughly textured, created  
by heating the stone surface, causing it to break along the crystalline

structures inherent to certain granular stones such as granite. Cleft  
finishes are also rough‐textured, imparted along natural layers inherent to  
certain sedimentary stones such as slate. \(See Figure 6.71.\)  
# Chapter Wrap‐Up  
This chapter has explored the many facets of designing the three‐  
dimensional hardware objects of a sign program. This examination included  
development of sign shape or form, mounting, and size, as well as an  
overview of the basic lighting techniques, materials, coatings, and finishes  
the EG designer manipulates in the design of a sign program’s hardware  
system. A basic overview of digital display units has also been included.  
The hardware system, because it is the three‐dimensional embodiment  
of signage, is often considered the most complex design challenge, but  
it is that inherent complexity that also makes it the richest for creative  
manipulation. The hardware system is where signs come to life as  
physical objects in the built environment, and this chapter has provided  
the EG designer with a sampling of the basic tips and tools for creating  
those objects. There’s a whole world of forms, materials, processes, and  
techniques for the EG designer to exploit in developing a sign program’s  
hardware system. We encourage you to tap into it!

# Gallery  
The projects shown in this section are examples of completed,  
comprehensive signage and wayfinding programs. For each program,  
you’ll see how the various sign types relate to each other visually to form  
a unified sign family across a range of sign communication functions,  
sizes, and mounting methods.  
These projects illustrate how a sign program’s graphic and hardware  
systems—the visual expressions of the Signage Pyramid—relate to  
each other in creating a related series of environmental communication  
objects. Since the information content system of the Signage Pyramid  
is an intangible element, it isn’t as evident in the selected project photos  
as the graphic and hardware systems. Keep in mind, however, that the  
information content system is the foundation of the Signage Pyramid, and  
that the role of the graphic and hardware systems is to convey and display  
that information in the physical environment.  
The project images in this gallery represent a diversity of signage  
programs for a wide variety of settings and have been contributed by EG  
design consulting firms primarily based in the United States, including our  
office. Some of the projects in this gallery are newer and some are older,  
illustrating the stylistic longevity—and sustainability—of well-designed  
signage programs. These projects also show how visually unified signage  
programs create distinctive, powerful brand statements within the built  
environment.
