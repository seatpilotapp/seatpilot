199 Page Intentionally Left Blank Preface  
This book and its accompanying volume, Special Event Production\: The Process, were first published in 2008  
in response to a need for a compilation of knowledge that could span the gap between information that  
was too technical and thus suitable only for technicians, and information that was too general to provide  
enough useful material to make a student “job-ready,” or to provide a handy reference for mid-career  
professionals. By all reports, the books have achieved what was intended of them; in fact they have achieved  
it internationally.  
When Routledge approached me to write revised editions, I quickly realized just how much had changed  
in not only special events, but also the world in the years since 2006 when I was in the process of writing  
those original books. Indeed, at that time there were no smartphones or tablets and the mobile environ-  
ment we take for granted today was still the stuff of science fiction. Climate change and sustainability were  
barely beginning to be of concern in the planning of events. The digitization of most technical areas of  
events was starting slowly, but digital audio and lighting consoles were far too expensive for most industry  
suppliers to acquire. Most video was still on tape and too complex for individuals to edit.  
Most of the changes have been positive for the industry. At the same time, though, there have been some  
rough spots. Competition has increased dramatically. Questionable ethics still abound. Risk management  
has improved but still not to the level it should be, as witnessed by the far too numerous serious acci-  
dents that have occurred around the world at events of all sizes. Last but not least, the very feasibility  
of many government and corporate events has been called into question because of the lack of perceived  
return-on-investment, particularly in tight economic times. We as event producers need to be able to  
defend our purpose and we can only do that by keeping abreast of all changes as they pertain to our  
industry.  
The changes, both the positive and negative ones, were strong enough reasons to make me realize that  
an update was definitely required. In this second book, Special Event Production\: The Resources, as before the  
emphasis is on the technical aspects of event production and those resources that are at the very heart of a  
successful event. While things have not changed to any great extent in areas such as entertainment, there  
have been orders of magnitude advances in visual presentation technology such as ultra-high-definition  
video and projection mapping, LED technology in lighting, mobile applications in everything, and the  
list goes on. There are no new chapters in this volume, but there are extensive updates to bring all these  
advances into the knowledge base of producers and would-be producers in specific areas.  
As I said in the original versions of the books, they are purposely not intended to duplicate the many excel-  
lent references that have already been written about the field of event management and event planning, **xx** Preface  
where details of the basic responsibility areas may be found. Instead, they concentrate solely on event  
production. They are not entry-level “how-to manuals” for those who are still trying to decide whether  
this industry is the right career path; they are for those who have already made that decision and are some  
years along the path. The emphasis in these books is on reality\: real-life war stories that prove that even  
the best producers make mistakes and that is just part of the learning process; real-life production chal-  
lenges that are intended to place the reader in the position of an actual producer; and a continuous stress  
throughout on the importance of compliance with safety standards and best practices of risk management.  
Whenever possible, reference is made to not only North American standards and regulations, but also to  
those in the United Kingdom \(UK\), Europe, and Australia, with the occasional reference to those in other  
countries. Finally, one new feature has been added in every chapter in response to a call for an even greater  
international flavor to the books, called the “Voice of the Industry.” These voices constitute interviews I  
have conducted with some of the most respected and experienced event producers and specialists in the  
world, in which they explain and opine about the current and future state of affairs of the industry through  
their own eyes.  
I hope you enjoy the learning experience and continue to invent ever more creative, astounding, and  
memorable special events.

# Entertainment

After reading this chapter, you will be able to\:  
**1.** Understand and describe the different forms of entertainment.  
**2.** Understand the primary reasons why entertainment is used in special events.  
**3.** Understand what comprises content in entertainment, from both the audience and performer  
points of view.  
**4.** Describe and analyze what makes a good performance in the five main genres of entertainment.  
**5.** Plan an effective entertainment program.  
**6.** Understand how to work with performers.  
If man is a sapient animal, a tool making animal, a self-making animal, a symbol-using animal, he is, no  
less, a performing animal, Homo performans, not in the sense, perhaps that a circus animal may be a  
performing animal, but in the sense that a man is a self-performing animal—his performances are, in a  
way, reflexive, in performing he reveals himself to himself. This can be in two ways\: the actor may come  
to know himself better through acting or enactment; or one set of human beings may come to know  
themselves better through observing and/or participating in performances generated and presented by  
another set of human beings.  
\(Turner, 1988, p. 81\)  
This statement by renowned anthropologist Victor Turner succinctly summarizes what special event  
entertainment is all about\: communication. It is about live performers understanding their craft well  
enough to be able to communicate powerful messages, be they subtle or obvious, to their audiences. The  
successful delivery of a well-designed entertainment program can evoke strong feelings, emotions, and  
memories, and can affect many of our senses. Indeed, it is the one part of an event people may remember  
long after the event is over. In that sense, it is arguably the one resource that can make or break the event. **2** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
Although many event producers purport to be experts in the field of entertainment \(are we not all critics?\),  
it is a complex field. Our goal in this chapter is to make it easier to understand. In doing so, we will explore\:  
how entertainment is defined; how to effectively stage an entertainment program; and finally, how to work  
with performers. Along the way, we will delve into physiology, psychology, and creativity. By the end, all  
the pieces should fit together, making it easier for producers to create, plan, and execute a successful and  
exciting program, and more than anything, to understand why they are doing it.  
# 1.1 Defining entertainment  
Properly defining entertainment requires us to understand the whole package, the sum of the various  
components that go into making up a complete presentation. Any given entertainment, whether a single  
performer or a multi-act extravaganza, can be fully defined by an analysis of three components or  
characteristics\: form, reason \(or “use” by another definition\), and content. We will examine each of these  
defining characteristics separately.  
# 1.1.1 Form in entertainment  
To really define form, we need to first briefly contemplate the origins of performance. Although it would  
be nice to have foolproof evidence of the beginnings of human performance, such may never be the case.  
What we do have, based on current research, is a general knowledge of past eras or time periods during  
which the archaeological evidence strongly suggests that certain genres of performance were either just  
beginning or were clearly fully developed.  
To start at the true beginning, physiologically, it is not hard to understand that humans were capable of  
utilizing two basic modes of communication\: vocalization and physical movement. These were not always  
present. It is believed that one of our related ancestors, Homo heidelbergensis, had developed a hypoglossal  
canal of sufficient size and construction to be able to create actual speech by at least 500,000 years ago  
\(Tattersall, 2006\).  
On the physical side, the best evidence for movement resembling modern humans lies with early footprints  
found in Laeotoli, Africa, of a much more distant relative, Australopithecus, who seemed to walk with a  
bipedal gait similar to today’s version of humans. Those preserved footprints are 3.5 million years old  
\(Feder, 1996\).  
We now must take a leap of faith based on logic and posit that at some point in the unrecorded distant  
past, these basic communication skills, vocalization and physical movement, further developed into the  
beginnings of entertainment, as illustrated in Figure 1.1.

Whether these all occurred at the same time is both unknown and unlikely; however, we have to start  
somewhere, and lacking prehistoric archaeological evidence, this is the best place. It is also not illogical to  
speculate that this process was taken a step further over time, so that each of the basic forms of entertainment  
in Figure 1.1 probably evolved into the more complex forms outlined in Figure 1.2, to which has also been  
added technological entertainment from the modern era.  
This, then, can be the starting point for defining form in entertainment. Form is actually another word for  
genre, but with the addition of sub-genres and categories. The use of form helps us understand the makeup  
of the entertainment itself and allows for ease of cataloguing. The proposed classification system outlined  
below is not necessarily the only one or the right one, but it is one that allows for easier understanding of  
how genres are related to each other, and it is the only one that follows most logically from the origins of  
each form of entertainment.  
# 1.1.1.1 Genres and categories  
Again, it seems logical to follow the original evolution of entertainment as outlined in Figure 1.2 and base  
form on that. We thus arrive at the following primary genres and sub-genres\:  
● Music. Music in general can be considered a primary entertainment genre with sub-genres of vocal and  
instrumental.  
● Theater. Beeman \(1993, pp. 381–383\), among others, has attempted to codify theater itself into a  
number of different genres based on the type of media used, the performers, and the content. However,  
his approach does not look at all entertainment genres together, thus making it difficult to arrive at any  
sort of common classification. I propose here that theater include the sub-genres of comedy, tragedy,  
and general speech. This allows for the inclusion of keynote speakers and similar spoken theatrical  
presentations that we use in special events. **4** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
● Dance. Throughout my own experience of working with every type of dance in special events, the sub-  
genres break down easily into cultural \(e.g. folk, ethnic, traditional by other names\), ballet, and modern  
or contemporary \(e.g. tap, jazz, hip-hop, ballroom\).  
● Other athletic entertainment. This primary genre covers all other physical entertainment and includes  
the two sub-genres of sports and physical entertainment \(e.g. acrobats, jugglers, magicians, stunt  
people, and stilt walkers\). It thus includes most modern variety acts.  
● Technology. The expanding use of mobile devices plus the development of increasingly sophisticated  
lighting, touchscreens, visual presentation technology, and music have led to the creation of unique  
forms of entertainment with technology as the “performer” or “performance medium.” See Section  
1.1.3.3.5 for more information.  
In order to further define any given form of entertainment, we need to add non-performative classifications  
that allow the form to be specified exactly. These we can term categories, as follows\:  
● Size. Size places the entertainment form in the context of a group performance. The sub-categories of  
size are large group \(i.e. more than ten\), small group \(i.e. less than ten\), and solo.  
● Prop-assisted. This covers a wide range of possibilities and breaks down into sub-categories of large  
props and small props. Examples could be stilts \(i.e. large props\) for a stilt walker, balls and knives \(i.e.  
small props\) for a juggler, roller blades \(i.e. small props\) for a roller blade demo team, and even mobile  
devices such as smartphones or tablets \(i.e. small props\). It could even include human-controlled  
electronic or technological displays \(e.g. lighting, lasers, music\).  
# 1.1.1.2 Classifying and cataloguing entertainment forms  
Of course, any of the genres, sub-genres, categories, or sub-categories can be combined with any  
others to arrive at a specific entertainment form. This can work in reverse as well, taking an entertain-  
ment form and tracing it back to its primary genre, sub-genres, and categories. Let us look at  
some examples\:  
● A juggler. The primary genre is other athletic entertainment, sub-genre physical entertainment, size  
category solo, and prop-assisted category small props.  
● Rock band with a vocalist. The primary genre is music, sub-genres instrumental and vocal, size category  
small group.  
● Musical comedian. This would be a combination primary genre of music with sub-genre instrumental  
and theater with sub-genre comedy, size category solo.  
● A steel drum band accompanying limbo dancers. This would also be a combination of dance as the  
primary genre with sub-genre cultural and music with sub-genre instrumental, size category small  
group, and finally prop-assisted category of small props \(e.g. the limbo bar\).  
● A keynote motivational speaker using a laptop computer onstage. The primary genre would be theater,  
sub-genre general speech, size category solo, prop-assisted category small props.  
Using this system, any given entertainment form can be defined and, if need be, catalogued. Many  
entertainment agencies and event producers use their own system of cataloguing entertainment using  
slightly more familiar terms, although the end result is still the same. All the acts available somehow need  
to be catalogued in order to be retrieved easily when needed. Some of the more common categories used  
by producers and agents are\:  
● Celebrity talent. This includes nationally and internationally known performers, who can be singers,  
musicians, comedians, speakers, or any of the other genres. ENTERTAINMENT **5**  
● Musical variety. This includes comedy music, background music such as instrumentalists and soloists,  
symphony orchestras, and marching bands.  
● Dance bands. This can be everything from duos to big bands.  
● Variety. These are the unusual types of entertainers such as jugglers, magicians, ventriloquists,  
clowns, stilt walkers, and Cirque-type acrobatic acts. Comedians are sometimes categorized with  
this group.  
● Cultural or ethnic. This group includes Native Indian, Asian, Latin, and all other cultural performances  
that stress heritage.  
● Interactive. This covers anything in which the main goal is for people to participate such as virtual reality  
games, teambuilding activities, table acts \(e.g. fortune tellers, caricaturists, handwriting analysts\), and  
strolling acts who interact with people.  
Rutherford-Silvers \(2012\) has an extensive list of entertainment resources, most of which can be categorized  
according to the genre and category system proposed above.  
It is really only by classifying and cataloguing entertainment forms that entertainment as a resource  
can be useful. Most event producers and entertainment agents have enormous databases of performers  
of every conceivable form. Without a cataloguing system, easy retrieval is almost impossible, but it  
is invariably required when an event proposal must be prepared on short notice. Although most pro-  
ducers devise their own system for cataloguing, the genres and categories outlined above may be a good  
starting point.  
As discussed in Chapter 11 of Special Event Production\: The Process, most producers will probably use a  
relational database of some sort, either web-based or on their desktop. These programs are very sophisticated  
and are customizable to suit individual company needs. An alphanumeric cataloguing system of some sort  
\(like any library\) can be set up to catalogue entertainment genres for easy retrieval. The system proposed  
above easily lends itself to that. For example, a dance band with a vocalist might have the initial letters  
“MIVSS” for “music instrumental and vocal, small group size.” After that could come the name of the  
group \(possibly abbreviated\) and/or a number that might indicate the date they were posted in the  
database. A combination entertainment form may have two or more catalogue numbers to allow them to  
be part of different lists. This is useful when, say, a comedy act is also a musical act, and both may be called  
upon for different events, so they need to be listed as both genres. These are only very rough examples but  
the concept is that a catalogue number is what permits easy retrieval using the search function of the  
database program. Of course, other necessary information for the performers must be included, such as  
contact information \(e.g. name, phone, email, and address\) and details of the act itself \(e.g. what it  
includes, length of normal show, standard cost, rider requirements, and promotional material\). Considering  
that this is at the heart of what makes entertainment resources effective, it is well worth spending time to  
develop an effective system.  
# 1.1.2 reasons for entertainment  
The reason for any given entertainment concerns the overall message delivered by a performance. It is the  
“why” question answered. The performance must satisfy the audience and client and deliver the promised  
results based on the original reason for the entertainment. For special event production purposes, the  
audience’s interests are usually represented by a single person \(e.g. a client or event manager\) or a small  
number of persons \(e.g. an organizing committee\) during the planning process, and it is this person or  
these persons who must articulate the reason for the entertainment to the producer. Here, then, are the  
main reasons we produce entertainment shows for special events\: **6** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 1.1.2.1 Education  
A powerful reason is the imparting of knowledge to an audience; it may be based entirely on learning or  
may be a small part of a larger show with multiple goals. Here are some typical examples that have proven  
successful in my own and my colleagues’ experiences\:  
● Scripted show. This occurs when entertainment is used with the main goal of providing—or helping to  
provide—knowledge to the audience. I have done this for a scripted variety show format in which we  
created a show that told part of the history of Canada through segments that incorporated singing,  
dancing, comedy, and acting, thus telling the audience in an interesting way about the country’s history.  
Another way is to partially script a show to augment a corporate presentation and to thereby explain  
more about the company goals, such as for a sales meeting, or for the explanation of a complicated  
concept. I have done this through the use of improvisational comedians who performed semi-scripted,  
humorous problem scenarios for an audience of financial planners who then had to workshop solutions  
for the scenarios presented. To do this successfully requires a talented scriptwriter and quite likely a  
good theatrical director as well, so it may not come cheap.  
● Existing act. Knowledge may also be imparted through the inclusion of performers who use  
education as part of their act, such as cultural dance groups who explain the origins of their dances \(e.g.  
Chinese, Native American, African\), storytellers, or handwriting analysts \(personal knowledge\), among  
many. My company frequently used a world champion gold panner who would not only teach guests  
how to gold pan, but would also teach the history of gold panning and gold rushes while they were  
doing it.  
# 1.1.2.2 Physically moving people  
There is no more impressive method of physically moving crowds than to have them follow highly visual  
and loud performers. Using a marching band or other noisy entertainment to lead people can save  
considerable time, especially with a large audience, and can be a nice segue from a reception to dinner or  
between event segments. In my career I have used marching bands, Swiss alpine horns, drum groups, color  
guards, cowboys on horses, fanfare trumpets, a town crier, stilt walkers, a Chinese lion, Dixieland bands,  
dancers of various types, clowns, old cars, and more I can’t remember. In almost all cases, guests  
automatically followed the entertainment without having to be told what to do, thus making my job as a  
producer a little easier \(not to mention negating the need for a costly add-on audio system in a remote  
location\).  
Following musical performers or noisy acts is not the only way to move people. Also possible is  
creative hosting. For example, we once designed an Evening in Paris night for an important client at  
which we used a dozen male and a dozen female dancers dressed in traditional French attire and all very  
outgoing. They greeted and cheered guests as they arrived and individually escorted each guest to their  
table, then appeared later to perform a can-can dance routine after which they went into the room full of  
seated guests to bring them up to the dance floor. Don’t forget that these are all just different ways to  
create that “experiential event” that has become popular, as described in Chapter 2 of Special Event Production\:  
The Process.  
# 1.1.2.3 Emotionally moving people  
Psychologists define the primary emotions as fear, anger, sadness, joy, surprise, disgust, and contempt. An  
emotion is considered a response to stimuli that involves characteristic physiological changes—such as  
increase in pulse rate, rise in body temperature, greater or less activity of certain glands, change in the rate  
of breathing—and tends in itself to motivate the individual toward further activity \(Emotion, 2004\). People ENTERTAINMENT **7**  
tend to confuse emotions with feelings and even psychologists are not united in definitions\: “By one  
estimate, more than 90 definitions of ‘emotion’ were proposed over the course of the 20th century”  
\(Plutchik, 2001, p. 344\). For simplification, we will assume that emotions are the primary ones stated  
above and feelings are what emanate from these. For example, one might feel guilty about not contributing  
to a charity for starving children as a result of watching a movie that stirs the emotion of anger in the  
observer because so much food is being wasted due to corruption in poor countries. One might feel  
exhilarated and proud because of the emotion of joy experienced when hearing one’s national anthem  
played as an Olympic champion stands on the podium. Any performance that is able to trigger strong  
emotions and subsequent feelings, to stir the audience inside, will be memorable, no matter what the  
performance genre \(e.g. music, dance, comedy, acting\). Emotional content is a direct reflection of the skill  
of the performers in choosing appropriate material, combined with their abilities to deliver it. We will  
explore this in depth in the next section.  
I was once given the task of providing after-dinner entertainment for a black-tie gala of a national  
association. The organizer and her committee were not too happy with my suggestion of a harmonica  
player as they thought it was not befitting the occasion; however, because they were longstanding clients,  
they allowed me to proceed. The show went very well and after it, several people came up to me and  
thanked me profusely because they were moved to tears by the performance, which had managed to hit  
them deep inside. The choice of performer was purposeful, in that he had a tremendous ability to deliver  
emotionally charged songs \(his own\) that I knew would work. He was also adept at playing over 20  
different mouth instruments and had won numerous awards.  
# 1.1.2.4 Motivating and inspiring people  
Motivating an audience is distinctly different from emotionally moving them, although they will  
undoubtedly experience some strong feelings when being motivated. As opposed to only trying to stir inner  
feelings, motivation’s goal is to give the audience a reason to take some action. This might be to buy a  
product, to improve one’s life, to become closer to God, to work harder, to give to charity, to sell more  
cars, or a host of other reasons. Motivational entertainment takes emotional performances and adds a  
specific message and call to action. For example, if one is producing a fundraising event for special needs  
children, the entertainment might incorporate a moving song performed live by an onstage celebrity with  
video clips of the special needs kids in the background. At the end, a request is made for donations. For  
more excellent examples of this type of persuasive entertainment, one only has to watch the many charity  
telethons that raise millions of dollars annually. Almost any form of entertainment can achieve motivation  
if the content and timing are correct. Other examples of when it might be used are for incentive groups  
and teambuilding activities \(e.g. with drum circles\), for sporting events \(e.g. with cheerleaders or loud  
rock music\), and for conference opening and closing sessions \(e.g. with motivational speakers\). Inspirational  
entertainment differs from motivational entertainment primarily by the fact that there is not necessarily  
any call to action, only a general uplifting of the spirit.  
# 1.1.2.5 Decoration  
A novel and frequent use of entertainment in events is as decoration. The performer\(s\) take on the  
persona of decorations that can be either stationary or moving, interactive or inactive. Costumed  
living statues, interactive entertainers \(e.g. stilt walkers, mimes, dancers, and others in themed  
costumes who move amongst guests anywhere but on a stage\), and look-alikes are typical of decorative  
entertainment.  
My company produced many events using this form of entertainment. At some, we placed dancers in  
spotlighted statuesque poses amongst tables as guests entered an event space. Once all were seated, the **8** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 1.3** example of strolling performers as decoration  
Courtesy of Designs by Sean, www.designsbysean.com  
dancers then gradually came out of their poses and began an introductory dance routine. At another beach  
party event, we actually hired bodybuilders to pose and lift weights as if on “Muscle Beach.” Many examples  
exist of this type of reason for entertainment. See also Section 2.2.7 of Chapter 2, and Figure 1.3.  
# 1.1.2.6 Announcing, introducing, or advertising  
For this use, performers may announce, introduce, and advertise people, products, services, and activities.  
These reasons are lumped together because the concept for each is similar. Some examples best illustrate  
this concept\:  
● Celebrities as masters of ceremonies.  
● Herald trumpets to sound a call to dinner, to introduce another segment in an event, or to draw attention  
to a speaker.  
● A personalized video greeting from a celebrity as part of a product introduction.  
● Strolling robots used at a trade show to draw attention to a particular booth or product.  
● A magical reveal created by a magician for introducing a product or person.  
● Fireworks at midnight used to introduce the New Year.  
Perhaps the best results occur when producers get creative with off-the-wall concepts. Here are some  
examples from my own personal experience, and hundreds more are being devised by many of today’s  
event companies\:  
● We once introduced a new Vancouver to Boston airline service by photographing a Paul Revere character  
riding a horse in front of a taxiing 747 while holding a huge banner announcing the service. ENTERTAINMENT **9**  
● One of our clients \(a gas company\) made the front page of the local newspaper when we dressed up  
two actors as a new baby and Father Time and had them lighting a giant 15 ft tall gas torch like an  
Olympic flame \(it was an Olympic year\), just before New Year’s.  
● For the introduction of a simulator computer game near Christmas one year, we provided about a dozen  
Santa Clauses all playing the game at a bank of computers, an advertising gimmick that successfully  
drew a lot of attention and garnered press coverage.  
● A new dollar coin was introduced using an 18 ft diameter helium flying saucer inside a convention center  
ballroom that made a surprise entry flying over the heads of assembled guests and dropping a giant  
replica of the coin onstage to a VIP speaker who proceeded to make a speech about the occasion.  
# 1.1.2.7 Creating ambience  
Particularly in theme events, establishing the right ambience for the event is one of the first considerations  
producers have. The ambience can be so much more than static décor or lighting, even if the lighting is  
automated. Adding other sensory input in the form of live entertainment helps to set a living mood. This  
can be done for any number of reasons, such as providing an atmosphere for easy discussion, for conducting  
business, or for relaxing. The proper choice of music can accomplish this with perhaps a jazz trio that  
enables unstrained conversation. As a side note, the importance of establishing and maintaining this  
relatively quiet ambience should not be passed over lightly. At far too many special events, the background  
noise level is excessively high, caused by poor room acoustics but exacerbated by music that is supposed  
to be background but is too loud. Some event managers tend to believe that volume equates to having a  
good time which in turn equates to a successful event and they could not be more wrong. In the majority  
of corporate events, guests attend because they want to dialogue with long-lost colleagues, and in many  
such events, to consummate business deals. This cannot be done if talking is uncomfortable.  
At the other extreme, atmosphere can be high energy. For example, a group of paparazzi greeting guests  
at the event entrance sets a lively ambience. One prime example from my own experience was adding to  
a beach party ambience by having a surf band enter the party in an authentic “Woodie” complete with  
honking horn, surfboards, and girls in bikinis.  
# 1.1.2.8 Rewarding performance and for image purposes  
Frequently, producers are called upon by clients to “just give me something really good.” This would seem  
to yield the conclusion that not all entertainment needs to have a deep reason. Realistically, there usually  
is one if the event manager or client is asked the right questions. For example, an incentive client may  
make just that statement, although the real reason for the entertainment is as a reward for top sales people  
\(i.e. meaning motivational content\). Likewise, a client may not state a reason but in reality wants to  
impress his or her clients by providing great entertainment.  
If budget presents a problem, producers may have to find performers or perhaps a single act, who can  
deliver an all-round package at a reasonable price. Such performers tend to exhibit three key characteristics.  
First, they are absolutely perfect at their craft \(entertainment form\) whether it is music, comedy, dance,  
athletics, or any combination. Second, they incorporate a component of comedy into their act and make it  
seem natural and spontaneous, not forced. Typically, though, it has been rehearsed, proven, and refined  
over the course of time. Third, they incorporate a component of audience participation into their act, again  
making it seem unrehearsed and spontaneous, and again it will have been proven to work over the course  
of dozens or hundreds of performances. Such acts, in my experience, regularly receive standing ovations  
and make producers and clients look good.  
Celebrity performers can also be ideal as rewards or as image enhancers, especially for a corporate image.  
For clients with good budgets, this is undeniably the best way to gain prestige. **10** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
Once the reasons for entertainment are known, as expressed by the client, it is time to turn attention to  
the chosen performers and allow them to develop the content necessary to achieve the goals set by the  
client and producer.  
# 1.1.3 content in entertainment  
Content is the last of the three characteristics \(form, reason, content\) that define entertainment.  
Beeman \(2002\) states,  
performance is the means—perhaps the principal means—through which people come to under-  
stand their world, reinforce their view of it and transform it on both small scale and large  
scale. It can be employed for conservative and for revolutionary uses. As a conservative force, it  
reinforces the truth of the world and enacts and verifies social order .  
.  
. As a transformational  
force, performance behavior has the power to restructure social order through the persuasive  
power of rhetoric, and through the power of redefinition of both audience and context.  
What he is saying is that it is content that drives the success of the performance.  
It is in the content of entertainment programs that special events—particularly private corporate events—  
and the relationship of performer\(s\) to audience differ from most other platforms for performers \(e.g.  
concerts, TV\). First, in many cases, performances are restricted to short segments for any individual  
performers or acts, often 15 min or less, necessitating an informed selection of material on the part of the  
performer\(s\) that will provide the desired content and will meet the goals of the client. Second, audiences  
are captive in that they have paid for their attendance at the event, the primary purpose of which may very  
well not be to observe entertainment. Third, they are watching the performances with no prior knowledge  
of the performers or content and have not had any previous opportunities for evaluation \(i.e. they must  
rely on the skills of the main client or event producer to make informed choices on their behalf\). Fourth,  
audiences have often been subjected, in a positive or negative manner, to lengthy proceedings prior to the  
entertainment program, including the use of alcohol, which can inhibit their objective appreciation of the  
performance. Finally, the performance setting in terms of acoustics, visibility for all audience members,  
staging, rehearsal opportunities, and timing is not always as ideal as in other platforms for performers,  
which can, in turn, place undue stress on the performers. It is under these constraints that performers  
must operate with their advertised and expected skill and aplomb.  
Success all boils down to this. The performer must deliver the expected content to an audience that is  
presumably untrained in the art form, under the constraints explained above. Whether this is achievable  
will depend on the choice of material and the manner in which it is delivered. It is the producer’s job to  
act on behalf of the client to ensure that this is done effectively. Therefore, it behooves the producer to  
understand what makes a good or bad performance, to become in essence an entertainment critic. We begin  
by trying to “get into the head” of a performer, looking at why one would choose this profession, and then  
looking at the general ways that performers connect with audiences. We finish this section by actually  
becoming performance critics and analyzing what makes a good performance in the different genres.  
# 1.1.3.1 Why performers perform  
Loosely interpreting the pioneering work of Turner \(1988\) and later of Schechner \(2002\), performance in  
complex societies is a three-phase process consisting of a rehearsal period \(proto-performance, from  
Schechner\), a performance period, and a cooling-down or post-performance period \(aftermath, from  
Schechner\). These periods form the core of performers’ existences, and although they move occasionally  
outside the phases, they inhabit them most of the time if performing is their chosen profession. It is a ENTERTAINMENT **11**  
lonely place to be, especially during the rehearsal period, a place where the only feedback may be a mirror,  
a director’s or choreographer’s comments, the playing back of a recorded song, or a spouse’s friendly  
encouragement. Validation comes with group rehearsals and eventually from a real audience. Why, then,  
would anyone choose such an existence? There are several reasons\:  
● To enter flow. Czikszentmihalyi \(1974, pp. 35–36\) and later Turner \(1988, p. 54\) are credited with  
bringing the term flow into the lexicon of psychology. Flow refers to “an interior state which can be  
described as the merging of action and awareness, the holistic sensation present when we act with total  
involvement, a state in which action follows action according to an internal logic, with no apparent need  
for conscious intervention on our part.” Most performers at some point in their careers will experience  
this. If they are highly trained, it will undoubtedly occur on a regular basis. For the performer, it is  
a very desirable mental state, somewhat metaphysical and even transcendental. For them, it is a feeling  
of wanting to remain in the moment. It happens particularly with group performances and  
only when members are completely in synch and performing together, each sensing what the others  
are doing as if they were a single, totally blended unit. It does not happen for every performance and  
it does not necessarily happen for an entire performance. When it does, however, it is magical for  
the performer.  
● To connect with the audience. Connecting with an audience is the ultimate validation for their existence  
that performers seek. It means that first, the audience has indeed received the message, and second, the  
art form and method of delivery are appreciated. Most of the time, this will be either sensed by, or  
obvious to, the performers \(e.g. through the audience’s rapt attention or applause/laughter at appropriate  
times\). Of course, negative connection is also possible and if it is obvious to them, the performer must  
make immediate changes to try to re-establish a positive connection.  
● To receive recognition. What better job satisfaction can there be than the instantaneous gratification  
obtained by sustained applause or a standing ovation? For performers, this beats the endless pushing  
of paper in an office, the constant struggle to climb the corporate ladder, and the frustrations of company  
personality clashes. The occasional accolade letter or annual corporate personnel reviews do not come  
close to the ecstatic screams of an adoring audience. Why else would aging rockers like the Rolling  
Stones still be performing after 50 years? They certainly do not need the money!  
● To receive remuneration. Unfortunately, performers have to live and, unlike the Rolling Stones, most of  
those who work in special events are not highly paid, contrary to the opinion of some uninformed clients  
and the general public. While the psychology of performing may be their main reason for choosing this  
career path, they do need to be compensated for doing it.  
# 1.1.3.2 Connecting with the audience  
Beeman’s statement about performance being the means “through which people come to understand . . .  
and transform \[their world\]” \(Beeman, 2002\) can only happen if the performer can connect with the  
audience. Although performance strategies vary amongst genres and amongst individual performers, there  
appears to be a more or less universal set of criteria that combine to define the skill set necessary for an  
effective performance\: charisma or stage presence, technical proficiency, and choice and interpretation of  
material. We will explain these in detail.  
1.1.3.2.1 Charisma  
Webster’s dictionary defines charisma as “a special charm or allure that inspires fascination or devotion.”  
Beeman \(2002\) suggests it is “the ability to engage and hold the attention of an audience.” In other words,  
it is stage presence. It is not necessarily a gift performers are born with, but more often a skill that must  
be nurtured and developed. How, then, can good stage presence be achieved? Most top performers with **12** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
charisma use one or more of the following techniques. For simplicity, we will use a single performer for  
explanations but the same information applies to group performances.  
● Placement. Being close to the front edge of the stage \(downstage\) brings the performer into a seemingly  
more intimate relationship with the audience. Likewise, working the entire downstage area  
including both corners ensures that as much of the audience will be brought into this relationship as  
possible.  
● Eye contact. Periodic direct eye contact with audience members is considered very positive and enhances  
the feeling of intimacy. Again, this should not always be front and center but vary from side to side as  
well. Done too much, however, eye contact can get distracting, so the default look should be slightly  
over the heads of the audience.  
● Facial expressions. This is one of the more difficult skills to master for good stage presence. Basically,  
the facial expression of a performer should mirror the material that is being performed\: sad song = sad  
expression, upbeat song = smile, and so on. Of course, in comedy this theory falls apart as it is often  
the incongruity of mixed emotions that wins the laugh. However, even in this situation it is necessary  
to master the correct expression \(think the exaggeration of Jim Carrey\). Usually the expression of choice  
is the smile, especially in special events where the audience must almost always leave with a feeling of  
having had a good time.  
● Costuming. No matter what the circumstances of the performance, good costuming is essential in  
helping to establish a professional look. Too often this is the last thing that performers—and producers—  
think about. Even if the trite, all-black ensemble must be used, it should be made clear to performers  
that shoes must be polished, dresses and pants must be pressed, and everything must be immaculately  
clean. Costuming is all about first impressions, just as it is in job interviews, and poor costuming  
onstage is magnified a hundred-fold thanks to lighting and the fact that the performer is the focus of  
all attention. If possible, something bright, unusual, or attention-grabbing should be used rather than  
black, within the bounds of good taste dictated by the event. Liberace, Michael Jackson, Elton John,  
Cher, Prince, Madonna, Kiss, Empire of the Sun, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, and many others were and are  
masters of this aspect of performing.  
● Interaction with other performers. In some situations that do not include group interaction as a  
choreographed or rehearsed part of the performance, onstage performer interaction can signal to the  
audience that the performers are having a good time and help to transfer that feeling to the audience.  
Examples might be when two guest singers work spontaneously together or when musical band  
members interact.  
● Audience participation. This is one of the most powerful and effective ways to gain audience support  
and enhance charisma. It is not, however, only a simple matter of asking the audience “how they are  
doing.” The more rehearsed and controlled the situation, the more effective it will be. Participation can  
take place in the audience \(i.e. offstage\) or it can take place on the stage. By going into the audience, a  
performer is in the audience’s territory and had better be well prepared for anything that may happen.  
Therefore, for this type of situation, all circumstances should be covered. That means that a set routine  
should be rehearsed \(e.g. exact dialogue and participation actions\), with escape plans for any eventuality,  
be it vocal inappropriateness \(e.g. audience member swearing at the performer or no reaction at all\), or  
physical abuse \(e.g. audience member grabbing or touching the performer inappropriately\). Proper  
technical preparation must be in place as well \(e.g. adequate audio and lighting\). Just “winging it” when  
a performer is in the audience makes the performance appear amateurish.  
Audience participation onstage brings the audience into the performer’s territory and puts the performer  
more in control of the situation, although removing some of the intimacy of direct contact with a larger  
portion of the audience. Onstage participation can take several forms\: rehearsed, unrehearsed, controlled,  
and uncontrolled. Once again, the more rehearsed and controlled, generally the better will be the ENTERTAINMENT **13**  
performance. By rehearsed is meant that the routine is tested and perfected over the course of many  
performances \(including all jokes, questions, and dialogue\) so that the outcome is more or less standard,  
thus defining what may be considered a controlled situation. This type of routine might include anything  
from a set of questions and answers between performer and audience members \(still in their seats\) to  
an entire onstage performance by a group of audience members \(e.g. dance number, hypnotism show,  
victims of a pickpocket, ventriloquist’s dummy\). At the other extreme is the completely unrehearsed  
and uncontrolled situation. Someone is invited to the stage to sing a song or to be interviewed by the  
performer. Because the routine has not been rehearsed and never been done before, or perhaps tried  
once successfully \(without rehearsal\), the performer assumes that it will be successful again.  
Unfortunately, human nature often turns ordinary people into caricatures once they get on a stage and  
they suddenly want to take over a microphone or act up for their friends \(one of the basic rules  
of performing is never give the microphone to someone else unless it is rehearsed\). This is not a  
situation that engenders a performer to the audience, but rather it makes the performer look even  
more inexperienced. I once employed a celebrity performer before he became famous who thought it  
would be a good idea to invite a friendly guest to the stage. The guest was drunk and refused to leave  
the stage, resulting in our having to find several very burly guests to remove him physically from the  
stage. It was embarrassing for the performer and undoubtedly became a valuable lesson for him on his  
road to the top.  
See Figure 1.4 for an example of good audience interaction, people cheering at an open-air concert at  
the Usadba Jazz Festival in Moscow.

1.1.3.2.2 Technical proficiency  
We will deal with this aspect of performing in much more detail in Section 1.3.3. when we analyze the  
different entertainment genres. However, let us look here at some of the universal considerations for  
technical proficiency. To some extent, technical proficiency is a reflection of the audience’s knowledge of  
the genre. If a violin virtuoso is hired for a corporate dinner, will the audience appreciate the performer’s  
virtuosity because of only the performance or because of the association of the performance with the name  
of the performer? Will a performance by a Beatles clone band receive a standing ovation only because of  
the perfect delivery of the material or because of the stage presence of the performers and the fact that  
everyone in the audience likes Beatles songs? These are difficult questions to answer, and the results are  
never consistent. Perhaps rather than trying to analyze what makes a technically proficient performance,  
it is easier to analyze the universal difficulties encountered by performers in striving to achieve proficiency,  
as postulated by Beeman \(2002\).  
● Pushing. This is the obvious effort shown in the interpretation of symbolic materials. This effort can be  
seen by the audience and can distract them from finding the message of the performance. An example  
might be the exaggerated facial expression and body movements of a singer trying to interpret a love  
song, or a jazz musician trying too hard to impress by overplaying.  
● Losing concentration. If the performer is not totally engaged with the task of performing, it can also  
provide a distraction. Examples here might include the distracting glances of dancers at each other that  
are not part of a performance, unnecessary dialogue between band members, or inappropriate facial  
expressions as part of the material presented.  
● Underpreparation. The lack of adequate preparation and rehearsal makes it impossible to present  
material in a smooth and spontaneous way. This is usually obvious and takes the form of forgotten lines  
in scripts, incorrect dance moves, wrong notes in music, and such.  
● Overpreparation. Similarly, too much rehearsal or preparation de-humanizes the performance, and makes  
it less believable. Many seasoned performers believe that once they stop feeling the butterflies and  
nervousness before a performance, they will no longer be good at their craft. There is some truth to this  
in that experienced performers can sometimes appear to be performing by rote and without feeling.  
1.1.3.2.3 Choice and interpretation of material  
How well material for a show is chosen and interpreted will be partly determined by how successfully the  
producer has conveyed to the performer the goals of the event—especially the message to be delivered \(see  
Chapter 2 of Special Event Production\: The Process\)—and the demographics of the audience. At one end of  
the spectrum, as noted by Beeman \(2002\),  
the performance may fail due to miscalculation of context, resulting from several causes. The  
performer may misread the audience, and present something that they already know and will  
be bored with, or that is so esoteric that they cannot comprehend it. Another possibility is pre-  
senting offensive material, or material that is insulting to persons of importance. The performer  
may also misread the circumstances of the performance and present material that is inappropri-  
ate, although the same material might be effective on other occasions \[e.g. off-color comedy that  
works in a club but not in a corporate environment—author\].  
At the other extreme, the successful choice and interpretation of material may lead the audience to mutually  
share the experience of flow that the performer is feeling. This is the ideal situation and it often results in  
the standing ovation so sought by performers. An audience member might experience this physically as a  
lump in the throat or a shiver down the spine, both indications that the performance has touched very  
deep emotions and feelings. ENTERTAINMENT **15**  
Armed with adequate knowledge of the event and the audience, the performer can make informed decisions  
on content and interpretation based on several considerations\:  
● Relationship of the material to audience demographics. Demographics, of course, refer to age, sex,  
language, occupation, and special interests. Appealing to only one or two aspects of demographics rather  
than their totality can mean choosing incorrect material. For example, assuming that anyone over 50  
only likes big band era music is an incorrect assumption because that demographic grew up in the rock  
and roll era. Assuming that because another culture may not be as demonstrative as North Americans  
they will not like audience participation is incorrect because they may enjoy it as much as anyone. It  
helps in this regard to determine what sort of entertainment has worked for a particular audience in the  
past so that this can be integrated with knowledge of their demographics.  
● Relationship of the material to the reasons for the event and the message to be delivered. Although this  
may seem obvious, it is not. Often, a client may tell a producer that they only want a great show. It may  
be necessary to read between the lines of this statement. It may mean that because the event is an  
incentive for sales persons, there should be some subtle inclusion of the company products in the show.  
Perhaps it becomes a customization of comedy material, a slight changing of song lyrics or the dedication  
of a song to the company president, or a small sign, logo, or corporate colors that become part of an act.  
This simple gesture of going beyond expectations can turn the show into a success, based purely on a  
knowledgeable interpretation of the event’s goals.  
● Universality of material. If evoking emotions is desired, nothing does it better than using subject matter  
that has universal appeal. This includes good versus evil, family values, love and honesty, striving to  
improve, and patriotism. Music or stories with any of these as their main theme will almost always be  
greeted with positive audience reaction. For example, a performance my company once gave for Canadian  
troops serving the United Nations in Cambodia climaxed with a series of patriotic songs that turned  
the audience into a screaming and ecstatic mass of fans totally at one with the performers.  
● Suitability for the genre. This essentially means that a performer should exercise caution if choosing  
material that may cross genres. For example, if a popular song evokes memories of teen love, will a  
satirical, comedic form of the same song be successful? Can dance be turned into theater, can dramatic  
theater be turned into physical comedy, can serious subject matter be made humorous, and so on?  
Examples of this include\: West Side Story, a Broadway musical form of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet;  
Wicked, a Broadway musical about the witches of Oz; and Life is Beautiful, an Oscar-winning film that  
played the holocaust for laughs.  
● External enhancement of the performance. Any performance can usually be enhanced by technical  
wizardry. Proper lighting cues \(e.g. fading stage lights to black after a routine or performance segment  
and waiting exactly the right amount of time before fading back up\), proper audio \(e.g. using the correct  
microphones and speaker placement\), special effects \(e.g. pyrotechnics, confetti cannons, fire, performer-  
controlled lasers\), or augmenting the show with dramatic visuals on large screens can add to the  
effectiveness of the performance. Experienced performers know this and usually have certain audio and  
lighting requirements for their shows. For those who do not, a producer should consider adding them  
to a show whenever possible. Figure 1.5 illustrates a performer interacting with laser beams.  
● Interpretation. Also sometimes considered as the style of the performer, this involves many factors and  
its success is often governed by the audience’s personal tastes. Successful interpretation usually means  
that the audience empathizes with the performer or performance situation. Zillman \(2006b, p. 154\)  
states, “With regard to the type of presentation, it seems likely that the effective impact on an observer  
increases with the fidelity of the portrayal of the circumstances that foster emotion in a model.” In other  
words, the more realistic the performance, the more an audience will empathize and so take on the same  
emotions as the performer. A life story dramatically told, a piece of music played from the heart with a  
story that the audience relates to \(e.g. teenage angst\), a dance with a story line using a protagonist and **16** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 1.5** Extreme beam

antagonist, will all bring the audience to more strongly empathize. Timing also plays a role in  
interpretation. Beeman \(2002, p. 90\) defines it as “the ability to display symbolic elements precisely at  
a time when they will most effectively convey an intended meaning.” This can mean minutely pushing  
\(i.e. coming in a fraction of a second early\) or holding back \(i.e. coming in a fraction of a second late\)  
on such things as musical phrasing, dance moves, or dramatic statements, or even the very slightest but  
subtle change in facial expression. Finally, freshness and spontaneity or the ability to “display symbolic  
materials in novel and unexpected ways” as Beeman \(2002, p. 90\) says, are additional means by which  
the audience’s attention may be captured. Playing a song in a style not used before \(e.g. turning a ballad  
into an upbeat reggae piece\) or creating a musical about the tearing down of the Berlin Wall are two  
examples of such new approaches.  
# 1.1.3.3 Analyzing performance  
Before performers are chosen for special event entertainment, someone must decide which act is right for  
the particular event \(i.e. it matches the reasons and goals for the event, the audience demographics, etc.\).  
This task invariably falls to the event producer who must make an informed decision about the quality and ENTERTAINMENT **17**  
value of the act and their ability to deliver on advertised promises. The key phrase here is “informed  
decision.” This means that the producer must understand what makes a good or bad performance and  
further extrapolate that performance into a successful—perhaps modified—performance for the special  
event being planned. It has been my experience that although many producers come from entertainment  
backgrounds, many do not, and as a group, producers are ill-informed and under-educated about what  
constitutes a good or bad performance in entertainment of all genres. It is hoped that this section will help  
to ameliorate this situation, albeit even if only in a small way. In Figure 1.2 we postulated that entertainment  
has evolved into four main forms, namely music, theater, dance, and other athletic performance, plus more  
recently technology as performance. Now we must become critics of these forms and learn how to properly  
analyze performance within each one.  
1.1.3.3.1 music  
At the risk of oversimplifying a complex subject, we will attempt to review the most important aspects of  
musical performance as they pertain to special events. These can loosely be divided into technique,  
psychology, and presentation\:  
● Technique. Whether vocal or instrumental, good technique is necessary for good performance. Music  
schools and competitions abound that critique technique, but not too many producers are aware of it.  
Here is a list of the important evaluation criteria\:  
● Pitch and harmony. For instrumentalists, this begins with a well-tuned instrument. For vocalists, it  
refers to their vocal range \(typically soprano and alto for females, and tenor, baritone, and bass for  
males\), and whether they can move effortlessly though their range. It further refers to the ability of  
the musician or vocalist to hit the correct notes within musical phrases without wavering to one side  
or the other of the target note’s pitch. For vocalists, the ability to harmonize or correctly sing different  
notes of a chord when in a group situation is essential to a smooth-sounding performance. Note that  
this analysis refers to our Western major and minor scales and not to the many other scales with  
differing intervals that exist in other cultures.  
● Rhythm and tempo. This refers to the appropriateness of the rhythmic interpretation of the piece,  
and how well the musician, group, or vocalist sustains the rhythm through complex passages. For  
example, if it is a samba, can the group and vocalist keep to the rhythm even when the words to the  
song get complicated and may not be right on the beat? Tempo refers to the ability of the musicians  
and vocalists to keep time. In other words, do they speed up or slow down when playing or singing,  
rather than maintaining constant timing?  
● Dynamics. Dynamics means relative loudness. Good technique is reflected in a wide range of dynamics  
from very soft to very loud, which leads to an improved interpretation of the music.  
● Tone quality. By tone is meant the clarity and quality of an instrument’s sound or the quality of a  
voice. Good tone is generally smooth throughout an instrument’s or a voice’s entire range with no  
harshness anywhere. For vocalists, this can also be affected by the type of resonance used \(i.e. does  
the voice seem to come from the head, chest, or throat and which is most effective?\).  
● Practical technique. For musicians, this refers to manual dexterity and flexibility and how well  
difficult passages appear to be played. If they are played with ease, then dexterity is good. For vocalists,  
practical technique also involves proper breath control and diction. For proper breath control, the  
vocalist uses the abdominal muscles and diaphragm to control breath and push out air from the very  
bottom of the lungs rather than using the throat muscles and only the top part of the lungs. Proper  
diction means that the words to a song are clear and easily understandable. If they are not, poor  
diction is likely the cause \(in spite of some vocalists claiming that the audio system is to blame\).  
Jones \(2001\) has a good review of damaging vocal techniques for those interested. Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**18** ● Style. Style refers to the style of music and how well a musician or vocalist can consistently interpret  
it. For example, can they give a consistent and non-mechanical rendition of New Orleans jazz, reggae,  
country and western, baroque, big band, rock, or other styles? Not all professional musicians can  
effectively interpret all styles of music equally. More importantly, interpretation in the case of vocalists  
refers to their sensitivity to the words.  
● Psychology. It is well known that music profoundly affects human beings on a deep, emotional level.  
How it does this is studied in the vast field of music psychology. We will be limiting discussion to only  
a few pertinent concepts that may help in the analysis of musical performance at special events\:  
● Sonic entrainment. Goldman \(2000, p. 218\) explains entrainment as “an aspect of sound that is  
closely related to rhythms and the way these rhythms affect us. It is a phenomenon of sound in which  
the powerful rhythmic vibrations of one object \[e.g. a dance band—author\] will cause the less  
powerful vibrations of another object \[e.g. an audience member—author\] to lock in step and oscillate  
at the first object’s rate.” Furthermore, within our own bodies, “our heart rate, respiration and brain  
waves all entrain to each other.” To make a long story short, it is possible, although not proven  
conclusively through rigorous scientific research, that playing music at certain frequencies may  
induce entrainment of an audience’s brain waves. In other words, the comment that “this music is  
hypnotic” may not be far from the truth. It is also a plausible—but not completely proven—explanation  
for the popularity of music with a particularly good beat \(e.g. techno dance music, rap, reggae, etc.\).  
Musical performers who understand this concept can construct their programs to take advantage of  
it \(e.g. techno dance music with the same rhythm or heavy beat\). One very popular example of sonic  
entrainment at work is a participative drum circle.  
● Excitation transfer. As postulated by Zillman \(2006a, pp. 222–223\), this concept basically translates  
into the fact that there is residual excitation created whenever a realistic portrayal or situation occurs  
that generates an arousing emotional response in an audience. Although studies have been done  
mostly for cinematic presentations, it is not unreasonable to make a logical leap to music and  
theatrical drama or comedy. Some examples that have been found by Zillman are that residual arousal  
from scenes of distress can facilitate subsequent sexual excitement, and residue from fearful scenes  
can intensify feelings of sympathy and support. Transferring this to music could lead to residual  
strong emotions after a powerful song about death which in turn could heighten the effect of a  
subsequent song that might be about love, or an upbeat rock song. Generally, excitation transfer is  
best the closer together the two scenes, or supposedly in the case of music, the songs. In other words,  
the more unarousing the songs that are placed in between the emotionally strong ones, the less will  
be the residual effect. In summary, it is best to keep music strongly emotional and the stronger are  
the emotions generated, the closer together the music should be for maximum effect.  
● Tonal sensitivity. Campbell \(2000, p. 91\) uses this term when he states, “With the introduction of  
electronic sounds, our tonal sensitivity is evolving. We are learning not to judge new sounds as evil  
and uncharged.” In the same article, he also makes the point that other cultures such as Chinese,  
Indian, and Balinese have music that uses quartertones and microtones \(i.e. sounds that are not in  
our Western scale and which our Western ears are unaccustomed to hearing\), and that these have  
been entering Western music for the last few decades. In short, with new cross-cultural music and  
new electronic music, we had better be aware of these new sounds and learn to adapt to them. Astute  
musicians are already creating new music with them. Thus, producers should be aware of such new  
sounds and not be too quick to judge them as inappropriate for events or simply as poor musicianship.  
● Presentation. Our earlier discussion of charisma did not fully explore the totality of musical presentation,  
especially in a group situation. For musical groups used in special events, there are other criteria to  
consider. Here are some pertinent questions\:  
● Is the group one that relies on reading music \(e.g. a symphony orchestra\)? If not, as in the case of a  
dance band, is the group off-book? In other words, have they committed their entire stage presentation ENTERTAINMENT **19**  
musical repertoire to memory? Usually, the best dance bands for special events will have been  
together long enough to have done this. It makes for a more professional, spontaneous presentation  
and removes unsightly music stands from the stage. It also enables the group to make sudden changes  
to their set lists without any problems. In addition, all vocalists must know their material by memory.  
● Is the group capable of moving directly from one song into the next \(with no pauses\) in a logical  
sequence that builds to a climax at the end of their set or program? This is in keeping with our  
previous discussion about excitation transfer and sonic entrainment.  
● Does the group or musical show successfully set up an inviting and exciting environment around  
them or in the total event space? An exciting environment means that they themselves, rather than  
the producer, have considered costumes, staging, backdrops and room décor, audio, specialized  
lighting, special effects, and choreography.  
● Is the group capable of changing direction in their material based on audience reaction? As a simple  
example, if nobody is dancing to a band, can they switch gears and play slower or faster music?  
● Do all members of the group buy into the show? In other words, are they all smiling—or frowning—at  
the same time, do they all project charisma, do they all make coordinated moves, do they know exactly  
when and where to play for solos or group parts, and are they obviously having fun? If any of these  
things are absent, they may have to change members, rehearse more, or reconsider their approach  
to the show.  
1.1.3.3.2 Theater  
In this section, we are concerned with dramatic acting, comedy, and speaking \(e.g. keynote speakers\), as  
well as the effective use of the stage for them. For special events, pure acting and full theatrical presentations  
are rare, but smaller scripted acting and speaking segments are often worked into a larger variety or musical  
stage show. Again, because this is such an extensive field, we will attempt to only mention the parts most  
relevant to special events\:  
● Theatrical direction. There are some fundamental elements to watch out for when evaluating the  
presentation of a play or any staged entertainment. They include\:  
● The use of props. Clutter in the form of too many props should be avoided and the strategic center  
stage position should never be occupied by large props. Props should be varied in color, theme, and  
material in order to avoid monotony. Set pieces should be placed in at least three horizontal planes  
\(e.g. foreground, middle, and background\) to create the illusion of depth. Finally, the rules of good  
design should apply to the overall arrangement of props so that the entire composition is visually  
pleasing \(Bloom, 2001; Pollick, 2002\).  
● Blocking. Blocking is the choreography of actors’ movements throughout a play. It is the job of  
the play’s director to determine where the actors should go, or in the case of special event  
entertainment, where the performers should go, actors or otherwise. Some key points to note from  
Bloom \(2001\) are\:  
– the upstage \(toward the back\) position is always the strongest when two or more actors are  
working;  
– a downstage actor looking at the audience is also in a strong position;  
– standing is a stronger position than sitting;  
– intimate moments require closeness of the actors and if they are shared moments, they are best  
done with the actors in profile to the audience;  
– powerful actions require more stage space;  
– movement should be minimized when complex language or difficult concepts are being presented; **20** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
– the eye attaches more importance to the center of the stage and so any movement away from here  
should be deliberate and express change or it will be purposeless;  
– Western audiences read the stage from left to right so entrances and exits should follow that  
pattern;  
– compositionally, when more than a single actor are onstage, diagonals or any arrangement other  
than a straight line works best; and  
– as a rule of thumb, every audience member should be able to see at least one actor’s face at all  
times.  
As mentioned, these guidelines can also apply to any staged presentation of entertainment whether  
actors, comedians, variety acts, or musical shows.  
● Drama and acting. There are many schools of acting and even kinds of acting. Schechner \(2002, p. 148\),  
for example, has broken acting into five kinds\: realistic, Brechtian, codified, trance, and objects \(masks,  
puppets\). In our daily lives in North America, we are subjected to a bombardment of realistic acting in  
movies and television, so that is the type we will concentrate on in this section. Again, we are most  
concerned with analyzing performances so are interested in what constitutes a good performance. In  
special events, this will likely manifest itself on a regular basis as keynote speaker presentations. Here  
are some things to watch for in good actors and presenters \(note that where referenced to Stevenson,

1-719-573-6195\. \(All Rights Reserved. Printed with permission from author\)\).  
● They do not become distracted by the audience or let the audience’s body language keep them from  
staying centered. All their concentration is on playing the part. In other words, they “own the role”  
\(Stevenson, October 2004\).  
● They understand the importance of language and use it to evoke imagery and emotion. The language  
is in complete congruence with the topic and what is being said. It is first about communicating, not  
about actual words or their meanings. This understanding includes the use of verbal language \(i.e.  
the words\), vocal language \(i.e. rhythm, tempo, volume, inflection, attitude, silence\), physical  
language \(i.e. physical movement and non-verbal cues\), and emotional language \(i.e. the actor’s  
feelings and emotions\) \(Stevenson, June 2005\).  
● They know how to use their voice. The most effective speaking pitch range is in the 2,000 to 4,000  
cycles per second frequency band. Anything lower tends to “discharge” the listener and detracts from  
the presentation \(Wilson, 2000\). The voice must also be clear and easily heard with good breath  
control \(see Section 1.1.3.3.1\).  
● They use tempo to illustrate anxiety or tension by speeding up their speaking, and to illustrate shock  
or confusion by slowing down.  
● They understand how silence speaks by using it after delivering a profound or thought-provoking  
statement to allow the audience to process the concept and hopefully learn or be transformed.  
Stevenson \(January 2005\) makes the following comments when teaching speakers, “You must  
determine in advance where in your presentation you are going to say something powerful, profound  
or stimulating. After you say it, pause and let it sink in. Let your audience speak. Give them time to  
talk to themselves. You’ve just made a powerful or provocative statement. Hopefully  
you were standing still when you said it. Movement during powerful statements distracts from their  
power. After you make the statement, stand still for three seconds. Let the words hang in the air.  
Then, as if to gather your thoughts, turn and walk slowly to the right or left four or five steps. You  
may keep your eyes on the audience or bring them down into a private rumination. This movement  
fills another three to five seconds. Keep in mind, you must fill all silences with thought and/or  
emotion.” ENTERTAINMENT **21**  
● They are good storytellers. They use “in and out” \(i.e. in and out of first person character\) moments  
of personal stories to illustrate their presentations. The “in” moments are short bursts of first person  
acting out of a story \(Stevenson, January and June 2005\).  
● Their presentations are precise and replicable. Although there may be some spontaneity due to  
changing audiences, their presentations are precisely honed and rehearsed when it comes to delivering  
the key points. This replicability includes full content, jokes, gestures, tempo, volume, moments of  
silence, spirit, and emotion. The speech can be given anywhere at any time and it will remain the  
same. “Winging it” and “ad libbing” are never options \(Stevenson, 1999\).  
● Comedy. Before being able to analyze comedy, one has to understand its structure and the importance  
of delivery. According to Beeman \(2000\), the structure of humor involves four stages, “the setup, the  
paradox, the dénouement, and the release. The setup involves the presentation of the original content  
material and the first interpretive frame. The paradox involves the creation of the additional frame or  
frames. The dénouement is the point at which the initial and subsequent frames are shown to coexist,  
creating tension. The release is the enjoyment registered by the audience in the process of realization  
and the release resulting therefrom.” Here is a simple joke to illustrate, told by famous comedian Red  
Skelton, from Raymond \(2015\)\:  
A fellow told me he was going to hang-glider school. He said, “I’ve been going for three months.”  
I said “How many successful jumps do you need to make before you graduate?” He said, “All  
of them.”  
In this case, the setup is the first two sentences, which establish a situation. The third sentence is the  
paradox, which helps to fix a set of assumptions in the minds of the audience \(i.e. that a certain number  
of hang-glider flights would be required to pass the course\). The fourth sentence is the dénouement  
\(the punch line\), and the one that is the surprise, that points out the incongruity of the whole situation.  
The release is the expected laughter of the audience. By laughing, the tension created by the paradox is  
released. Generally speaking, setup lines should be short \(i.e. no more than one or two short sentences\)  
and punch lines should end with a punch word if at all possible. In the case above, the punch word is  
actually a short but very effective phrase, “All of them,” which makes this a strong joke.  
Of course, part of the structure of comedy is the subject matter, the concept. Typical comedians will  
spend many hours making notes of life’s situations and making lists of funny ideas and phrases that  
can be further refined through ridiculous combinations. For comedy at special events, subject matter is  
often extremely important because audiences may be cross-cultural or from specialized occupations.  
Obviously, different cultures may not understand certain jokes and specialized occupations may prefer  
tailor-made material. Off-color material is normally not part of special event comedy unless specifically  
requested. Most good standup comedians will go into their show with jokes loosely based on subject  
matter. If one set does not work, they may switch to another. The first part of their show is usually  
devoted to ascertaining how the audience will react to certain jokes based on subject matter.  
Delivery is what makes comedy successful. It involves rhythm, tempo, volume, inflection, and timing,  
besides all of the traits we examined earlier on charisma and stage presence. Similar to the excitation  
transfer we discussed in music psychology, comedians may try to build on successful jokes by either  
adding more incongruities and further punch lines to a good joke or by adding more jokes at a faster  
pace. In doing so, they may incorporate higher or lower volume in their voices, different facial  
expressions, and body movements. Timing, though, is the key to delivery. A short pause before the  
punch word or line can make the joke.  
In delivering jokes, comedians may also use different types of comedy. According to Stevenson  
\(September 2005\), there are 29 disciplines of comedy, including self-deprecating humor, hyperbole  
\(extravagant exaggeration\), the tongue-tie, physical comedy, alliteration, plays on words, characterizations,  
and many more. Most good comedians use at least one of these disciplines in their acts. **22** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
The best judge of any given comedy show is the audience, and as with all of the entertainment genres,  
watching them rather than the stage will give the biggest clue as to how successful a comedy show  
will be.  
1.1.3.3.3 dance  
There are numerous sub-genres of dance and we could fill several books trying to analyze all of them. The  
sub-genre most often encountered in special events is contemporary jazz dance and for the sake of brevity,  
that is the one on which we will concentrate. Analysis of jazz dance involves an understanding of  
choreography and technique.  
● Choreography. Choreography uses the three basic elements of dance\: space, time, and energy \(Roston,  
2000\). Space includes both vertical and horizontal planes. In the vertical plane, choreographers will  
use low level moves \(i.e. on the floor\) to lower the energy level, medium level moves \(i.e. standing\) to  
travel in the horizontal plane and to work in different patterns, and high level to add energy and  
more spectacular moves such as leaps and lifts \(Roston, 2000\). All choreographers have different styles  
and will use space in different ways, but most will vary all three levels for variety and to match the mood  
or energy level of the music. Cooper \(1998\) discusses how the changes and shifts in vertical and  
horizontal planes are like “moving sculptures,” some of which emphasize the individual line of the  
dancers through symmetrical and asymmetrical patterns \(i.e. different placement of group shapes  
and sizes in the horizontal plane\). She suggests the need for artistic variation in the number of  
dancers onstage, noting that too many dancers too often can look tedious. Obviously, in any group  
patterns or movements, all dancers must be precisely and exactly placed and move precisely together  
as a single unit.  
Time, according to Roston \(2000\), “encompasses speed, rhythm, and syncopation of movements. For  
example, when dancers freeze in a position, they ‘stop’ time.” For variety, some sections can be performed  
in half time \(twice as slow\) or in double-time \(twice as fast\). Also, canons can be used. Roston \(2000\)  
explains how\: “A choreographic canon requires dancers to perform an identical phrase at specific  
intervals – 8, 12, or 16 counts apart, for example. Canons work best when the movement changes levels,  
remaining at each level for a while.” Generally, the more variety, the more interesting will be the routine.  
Energy “relates to the quality of the movement” \(Roston, 2000\). For example, leaps and lifts add energy,  
funky and upbeat jazz or hip-hop demands explosive energy, and rapid movement from upstage to  
downstage can add energy. Slower music \(e.g. ballads, blues\) usually requires soft and expansive  
qualities \(Roston, 2000\). Again, variety will always be perceived as more interesting. Any routine should  
have a beginning, middle, and end and should build toward a climax, while always reflecting the lyrics  
and energy level of the accompanying music.  
Powers \(2011\) also suggests considering contrast and musicality in choreography\: “Contrast the  
numbers of dancers onstage. Use tension/resolution dynamics. Use space, silence, freeze-frames and  
voids for contrast.” Likewise, from a musicality standpoint, the suggestion is to “match musical breaks,  
accents, lyrics and crescendos/diminuendos with physical versions of the same.”  
Figure 1.6 is a fine example of contemporary choreography making use of space and energy.  
● Technique. Diane Buirs—a creative director, production supervisor, and choreographer with extensive  
experience in England and Canada, including several Royal Command performances—offers some  
enlightening comments on dance technique. She breaks down technique into essentially four  
components\: flexibility, strength, focus, and placement.  
Although probably not noticeable by the audience, poorly developed flexibility and strength can cause  
a dancer to be unable to make the necessary moves. Lack of flexibility, for example, can result in  
improper foot placement or limb movement. Underdeveloped strength can result in an inability to gain ENTERTAINMENT **23**  
**Figure 1.6** Example of contemporary choreography  
Copyright\: evdoha / 123RF Stock Photo  
the elevation required for good leaps and lifts since leg strength and deep knee bends \(pliés\) control  
takeoff and landing.  
Focus is both psychological and physical. Psychologically, a dancer must want to leap. In addition, when  
physically leaping the dancer must lead the leap with an eye line that indicates the direction of the leap,  
by placing the head in a slightly higher position. Likewise, in turns or spins, the dancer must properly  
head spot to maintain balance and proper limb position.  
Finally, placement necessitates that the dancer knows exactly where and how to position his/her body  
at all times.  
Although not critical parts of technique per se, both endurance and overall appearance also play a part  
in successful dance. Endurance can only be gained by constant practice but can be assisted by alternative  
forms of physical activity including other forms of dance, getting proper rest, and maintaining a good  
diet. Appearance dictates that costumes, hair, and makeup must be perfect so that there are no  
distractions to the performance \(D. Buirs, personal communication, June 10, 2014\).  
Varsity \(2014\) contains a lot more on technique, including information on body alignment, leaps, jumps,  
and turns. However, it should be noted that good technique is an extensive subject and can also depend  
on the type of dance involved.  
1.1.3.3.4 other athletic entertainment  
This genre includes so much variety that specific analysis is virtually impossible. Some examples of athletic  
or physical entertainment, besides sports, include stilt walkers, acrobats, trampoline artists, illusionists,  
clowns, mimes, face and body painting, fire eaters, hypnotists, jugglers, knife throwers, living statues,  
mascots and costumed walkaround characters, motorcycle and bicycle trick acts, pickpocket artists, **24** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
puppeteers, rollerbladers, stuntmen, and many others. For most of these, their success is dependent on  
several key criteria\:  
● Originality. Many of these acts have intense competition in their particular sub-genre. To stand out, they  
must be very original. Jugglers, for example, cannot just get by with juggling three or four balls; now  
they have to juggle chain saws, lamps, handkerchiefs, bottles and other unusual items all at the same  
time. Illusionists can no longer amaze an audience by using Houdini’s trunk illusion; they have to do it  
with a completely new twist \(e.g. escaping from the trunk while underwater or some such idea\). Living  
statues can no longer just stand or sit; they have to incorporate some unique movement or audience  
interaction into their performance.  
● Costuming. Outrageous and “over-the-top” are the new guidelines for costuming in this genre. Flashy,  
creative, and colorful costuming is becoming normal, and is one of the few ways that performers can  
stand out from the crowd.  
● Audience interaction. A lot of these types of acts have managed to get by in previous times by just doing  
their act. An example might be stilt walkers who may have been well costumed but really had no other  
skills with an audience other than walking around looking pretty. Now, it is almost required that most  
of the acts have good personal interaction with an audience. This is often not only the ability to speak  
to them in a friendly manner, but also to incorporate other skills such as comedy, balloon sculpting, or  
magic. Again, an example might be stilt walkers who can also deliver creative comedy routines in their  
interaction with the audience. Furthermore, acts that can do both roving sets and stage shows are more  
valuable and stretch a client’s entertainment dollar.  
● Skill. Fortunately, in this genre most audiences have seen so many examples in their lives that formal  
analysis of skill is not necessary. They know what is good and bad just by their experiences. Acts that  
do not measure up in terms of advanced skill simply do not get the business. Acrobats have to jump,  
contort, fly, twist, and maneuver themselves in ever more intricate ways, puppets have to be more  
outrageous, stuntmen have to perform as if they were in a Jackie Chan movie, bicycle trick acts have to  
balance on more bikes going faster, and so on. Before any such acts are hired, they should be seen ideally  
before another audience so the audience’s reaction can be observed. Again, watching the audience and  
not the act is the best way to analyze their capabilities.  
1.1.3.3.5 Technology as entertainment  
In Chapter 11 of Special Event Production\: The Process, we discussed the future of technology and how it might  
affect the world of special events. That future is now upon us, as technology begins to fuse with  
entertainment and other previously separate specialties. I believe this has come about as a result of three  
phenomena\: the popularity of experiential events, gamification, and crowdsourcing. One other technological  
advancement will also have enormous implications for special events and that is robotics.  
Experiential events are those that emphasize immersing event attendees in the moment. Rather than being  
passive onlookers, they become active participants, and in some cases help to control the outcome of the  
event. Gamification is “the use of \[video\] game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to  
engage users in solving problems. Gamification techniques strive to leverage people’s natural desires for  
competition, achievement, status, self-expression, altruism, and closure” \(Gamification, 2014\). This is  
usually done through rewards like points or achievement badges. Most studies on gamification find positive  
effects from it \(Hamari et al., 2014\). Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or  
content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people, and especially from an online community,  
rather than from traditional employees or suppliers. In special events, this group of people can be considered  
the audience or event attendees.  
When these three phenomena are put together, what emerges are mobile and other unique applications  
for special event entertainment. While the field is barely in its infancy, there are developments on several ENTERTAINMENT **25**  
fronts and they appear to fall into three categories\: individual mobile device-based games, group mobile  
device-based games, and non-mobile device-based activities. Note that these terms and categories are my  
own and may very well be displaced in the future by others.  
● Individual mobile device-based games. In these games, the platform \(e.g. smartphone or tablet\) acts as  
the participant along with the individual or very small group. Minimal input is contributed to the larger  
group of which the individual or very small group may be a part. Examples include\:  
● ice-breaker apps for meetings and events in which individuals take photos of themselves and share  
them with each other;  
● individuals draw their own visions of the conference’s key message;  
● individuals draw one another and answer questions about each other \(see www.magencydigital.com  
for more examples of the last three types of games\);  
● Global Positioning System \(GPS\) scavenger or treasure hunts. These types of games use the built-in  
GPS receiver in cell phones and tablets to help guide and navigate participants on a pre-determined  
geographical route. Typically, individual participants or teams are given tablets pre-loaded with  
software to use in the game as opposed to using their own devices. Challenges may involve a search  
for objects or places outdoors, answering questions, creating photo or video reports along the way,  
drawing pictures, interacting with people, etc. They are often used as teambuilding activities. Prizes  
may be awarded for the top teams in various categories. Examples may be found at www.  
wildgoosescotland.co.uk and http\://eventplatform.ru/en/.  
● Group mobile device-based games. These games or activities tend to be crowdsourced applications in  
that the wisdom of the entire audience is encapsulated in the outcome. Individuals contribute to the  
larger group. This is the form that is the most experiential and no doubt where most growth will occur  
because it offers more social interaction. Some examples include\:  
● live audience voting in answer to group questions;  
● quiz and buzzer audience games \(i.e. like a TV game show\);  
● creative team collaboration much like the old flip chart concept but instead using tablets and phones;  
● multi-player gaming in which all attendees participate simultaneously in a game projected on a large  
wall or screen using their smartphones \(http\://buzzy.io\);  
● DJ dance songs chosen ahead of time by guests using mobile devices and an app called Rockbot  
\(https\://rockbot.com\). At an event, Rockbot screens provide even more social engagement, so guests  
can see what other partygoers have selected, and vote up their songs and even try to play similar  
music choices. They can easily share the songs and interactivity through social media, too, with  
instant links to their accounts and pages \(Rosenbaum, 2014\);  
● attendees using their smartphones as event lighting by downloading an app before the event and at  
the event the phones’ lighting is synchronized to performed music through “audio calibration tones”  
received by the smartphones \(Bailly, 2013 and http\://whamcitylights.com\);  
● audience members using their mobile devices to control part of a musical performance, actually the  
opposite of the music controlling the phones \(Hödl et al., 2012\); and  
● creation of original group music using smartphones and/or tablets as actual instruments \(Wang,  
2009; Wang et al., 2010; and http\://mopho.stanford.edu\).  
● Non-mobile device-based activities. There is an increasing number of ingenious developments in which  
the physical dynamics—gestures—of audience members rather than mobile devices can control a  
performance outcome. Here are some examples\:  
● the popular Angry Birds game on a large scale in which the audience controls the game \(on a large  
screen\) using their voices, first done at a Formula 1 race in Singapore \(Vilpponen, 2011\); **26** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 1.7** Example of large touchscreen technology  
Courtesy of Molly Galler  
● a technological version of the old “choose your own adventure” stories in which the audience controls  
the outcome of a movie using hand waving gestures \(www.audienceentertainment.com\);  
● stage lighting controlled by how hard an audience dances on the dance floor \(Jagadeesh, 2013\);  
● future concepts using large touchscreen technology combined with touch, gestural interaction, and  
maybe device interaction hold great promise for amazing special event entertainment, using wall-  
sized—and possibly flexible—touchscreens \(A. Scott, personal communication, May 27, 2014; Wong,  
2011; Bourzac, 2014\). Not only walls, but floors and dining tables will become interactive  
entertainment centers \(CSE1, 2013\) \(see Figure 1.7 showing a large touchscreen display in which  
the roses had to be wiped away to reveal the castle\); and  
● holographic projection, while not dependent on human gestures, represents great potential for event  
entertainment \(CSE2, 2013\) in the form of actual stage presentations from stars both alive and dead.  
Finally, robotics is beginning to be noticed as more than a novelty. For example, Amazon is using thousands  
of robots in warehouses, self-driving vehicles will soon be the norm, and robots now deliver fresh towels  
at the Aloft Hotel in Cupertino, California. As if that’s not enough, an entertainment robot named Sopo  
can play games with you, dance, collect trash, and serve drinks \(Sinha, 2014\). The implications for using  
such robots in special events are mind-boggling.  
Since this section deals with the analysis of content in entertainment, at present there is precious little  
experience and history available to judge the quality of any performance or game based on technology. It  
appears that the concept may end up as a specific niche in the events industry in which companies provide ENTERTAINMENT **27**  
these games as their sole raison d’être, because the technology is both expensive and theoretically complex.  
For example, in the case of team games using GPS, there is often the need to provide teams or individuals  
with pre-loaded tablets, which necessitates a large outlay of capital. Second, and as an example, it may be  
too large a task for a company that currently specializes in A-V to also handle the programming of a group-  
based game, as well as possibly providing the expensive surface\(s\) that the game must be played on. Thus,  
only a caution can be expressed at this time and that caution is for producers to work with specialist  
companies in these types of gaming. Indeed, several have already been referenced in this section.  
# P r od u c t i o n Wa r S t o ry  
# Love those cats  
I had a friend whose talent we often bought. His name was Gary and he supplied animals of every  
description for the movies. Out of the blue one day, he came to our office.  
“Doug, Doug, I’ve got some big cats in town for a movie.” He could barely contain his excitement.  
“They’re only here for three weeks. If you want, I could bring them to one of your events. Do you  
have anything on the go?”  
I thought for a moment. “Yeah, I might have. A big convention in Whistler in two weeks. Tell me  
about the cats.”  
Gary had a bushy, handlebar moustache that bounced when he talked and blue eyes that twinkled  
when he was excited. Everything was bouncing and twinkling today. “Oh, you won’t believe this,”  
he said. He showed me some fuzzy Polaroid photos. “Aren’t they beautiful? The little tiger cub’s  
only two months old. The panther’s a juvenile, still not full grown. I have handlers who can stay  
with them. Your clients will love them. They can even pet them. Think of it. It’ll blow them away.”  
His timing couldn’t have been better. We were in the middle of putting the finishing touches on  
the entertainment for a convention with the theme “Around the World in Eighty Hours,” a takeoff  
on the Jules Verne classic, *Around the World in 80 Days*. The last night was to be a wildly creative  
offering of entertainment from the various countries Phileas Fogg and Passepartout visited on their  
trip. The animals would be perfect for India.  
“Let’s do it,” I said. “The handlers will have to dress up as Hindus and stay at their post for about  
four hours. It’s a reception and buffet, so the guests will be circulating.” I knew my client would  
like the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  
It was 10 min to doors opening for the Around the World extravaganza. I waited with the handlers  
and cats, who sat docilely on the floor. The handlers were stroking them. Gary was right. They  
really were beautiful. The baby tiger was perhaps 3 ft long. He had enormous paws. The panther  
was about 4 or 5 ft long with silky black fur and gleaming eyes. The night was going to be an  
unforgettable experience.  
The tiger’s handler was a young guy. He looked fairly strong. The panther’s handler was a petite  
blonde. I had to ask her the question.  
“Are you sure you can manage him?”  
“Oh, yeah, no problem,” she said. “He knows me. We’re buddies.”  
Stop worrying, I thought. Everything will be fine. **28** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
We sat in silence for a few more minutes, admiring the animals and watching the wait staff bring  
their final loads of fresh food to buffet tables around the room. Then it happened.  
A waiter with a tall cart full of dishes bumped the cart over a power cable taped across the floor.  
The rattling dishes broke the stillness.  
I used to watch Tarzan movies as a kid and often wondered what it would be like to be jumped  
by a jungle cat in the wild. At that moment, I was given a pretty good idea. You wouldn’t stand a  
chance. The panther could have been a rocket. I’d never seen any living thing move so fast. In less  
than a breath he was on top of the cart and accelerating toward a table. He pounced. The table  
crashed to the floor, breaking dishes and spreading linens and cutlery all over.  
His handler said in a high-pitched, childlike voice, “Oh my god! He’s never done that before.” She  
started to sprint across the room, losing ground to the cat’s Mach 2 slink.  
The panther reached the stage at the far end of the room and slowed down. She caught up, grabbed  
his leash, and dragged him back, speaking softly to him, “Bad kitty. You be good from now on.”  
I wasn’t entirely convinced that would be enough to keep him calm for the whole night.  
Luckily, nothing else was damaged, but by now, everybody was in panic mode. The wait staff  
were running all over, gathering up broken dishes and resetting the smashed table. The catering  
manager shouted at me, “This could be a disaster.” His eyes were wide. He looked terrified. “You  
can’t keep the animals here.”  
I took a deep breath. “Listen,” I said, “the client’s been looking forward to this. Let me just tell him  
there’s a slight delay and the doors will open in five minutes.”  
“I don’t know,” he said. “It could still be dangerous.”  
“The handlers tell me what happened was really unusual. They’re convinced the cats will be fine,”  
I lied.  
He reluctantly agreed, and five minutes later the doors opened.  
The cats were the hit of the party. Everybody got to pet them. Thousands of photos were taken.  
My client was ecstatic. He never knew what happened.  
I sweated bullets for 4 h.

# 1.2 Staging entertainment  
Having defined the entertainment to be used, we now turn our attention to its effective presentation. In  
Section 1.1.3, we discussed the content of a performance from the standpoint of the performer in isolation.  
To now use this content effectively in a show, we must consider it in the context of other event parameters,  
namely the audience, the layout of the event space, the staging available or possible, the scheduling and  
timing, including length of the performance, technical support, and any required interaction with other  
acts or performers.  
# 1.2.1 number of performers or acts  
Special event entertainment can be simple in presentation, such as a single act that has no requirements  
for rehearsals or special technical support. There is a fixed show length, a certain start time, and the show ENTERTAINMENT **29**  
proceeds with little fanfare, particularly if the event is being held indoors. For example, a dance troupe  
might come fully prepared for their performance with costumes and backing music on a CD or flash drive.  
They may not even require a rehearsal. Likewise, an outdoor event, such as a festival, may have a series of  
simple acts between which there is little or no interaction. They arrive, they set up and sound check at the  
appointed time, and no rehearsals are required. More often than not, however, special event shows involve  
more than a single act and frequently include scripts, complex rehearsals, technical support, and unique  
staging. In these cases, considerably more preparation and planning is needed to stage a successful show.  
For a show with multiple acts, it is possible to create the illusion of a coordinated presentation through  
the use of common theatrical elements such as costuming or music. For example, if a show—let us say an  
80s show—is being presented that consists of a comedian, a dance troupe, and a dance band, all scheduled  
to perform at different times in the event schedule, they can be tied together by common costumes  
and music from the 80s. The comedian can be linked by a costume and some reference to the 80s in  
his material.  
For most other shows with a number of acts, there may be a requirement for a full script, rehearsals with  
all performers and technical support, and the need to integrate the show into a larger program of speeches  
and/or awards.  
Given all the event parameters \(e.g. schedule, location, budget, demographics of audience\), at some point  
during initial event planning, the producer and client will have to decide whether a single act, multiple  
acts, or a scripted show format works the best in achieving the event’s goals and translating the reason  
for, and message of, the event into a meaningful entertainment program.  
# 1.2.2 Scheduling and timing  
For stage presentations, in terms of timing there are typically two options\: one is a single continuous show  
and the other is a show divided into multiple segments.  
# 1.2.2.1 Single continuous show format  
A single show, particularly for corporate events, rarely exceeds 50 or 60 min in duration. This is  
because the audience has often been subjected to prior extended and unrelated event segments,  
namely reception, dinner, speeches, or award presentations, and lacks the necessary stamina for a  
longer show. Shows containing overly esoteric material should also be avoided in the interests of  
keeping the audience’s attention. If a single continuous show has multiple acts of short duration, there is  
a much better chance of success due to the variety presented, in that more of the audience is likely to enjoy  
at least one of the acts. With a single act, there is a greater possibility of some of the audience not  
appreciating it.  
# 1.2.2.2 Segmented show format  
Fortunately, the problem of sustained audience attention can be minimized in several ways. Rather than  
having a single continuous show after dinner at the end of a long event, dividing the entire show into  
short segments performed between meal courses works well. A show of this type can be divided up yet  
still maintain a story line providing that there is a simple link or explanation between segments, such as  
a script with a Master of Ceremonies \(MC\) voiceover that can tie them together. The duration of such  
segments should be no longer than 5–10 min during which the event space must be completely clear of  
wait staff and food. This requires close coordination between the producer and catering or banquet  
manager in order to ensure all tables are cleared from the previous course and the following course is not **30** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
served until the entertainment segment is complete. The other advantage this method of presentation  
has is that it permits an extended period for stage changeovers without the audience having to wait. This  
further enables all presentations to take place from a single stage instead of multiple ones if required.  
All presentations do not necessarily have to take place between all the courses. The timing is entirely  
at the discretion of the producer and the client. Perhaps one at the very beginning of the event as  
guests arrive or as they sit down to dinner followed by only one more after dinner is all that is needed for  
a varied program.  
This method also is an excellent means to inject interest into a lengthy standup reception event at which  
guests might otherwise only stay for a short time. Given periodic and unique entertainment segments at  
15 or 20 min intervals throughout a reception can add an element of surprise that will make guests want  
to stay.  
A segmented show has another dimension to it when a performance is sustained for a longer period of  
time. By this is meant a form of entertainment that is not used for a stage show per se, but rather strolls  
around or is stationary for a long period. Examples include solo musicians or a group of musicians \(e.g. a  
dance band\) who are hired either to provide background music during dinner and/or a reception, or to  
provide continuous dance music, or other performers with sustained performances. Examples here include  
table acts such as caricaturists, graphologists \(handwriting analysts\), tattoo artists, and fortune tellers, or  
strolling physical performers such as sleight-of-hand magicians, jugglers, mimes, stilt walkers, costumed  
characters, and such. At some point, all these types of performers will need breaks, so they should be built  
into the schedule in such a way that not all are taking breaks at the same time. We will deal more with  
this aspect in the next section about working with performers.  
# 1.2.2.3 Show setup and sound checks  
The last but by no means least critical aspect of scheduling and timing, excluding the show content  
itself, is the time and method of setup, sound checks, and rehearsals for performers. If the show is at  
all complex and involves several acts that are dependent on each other \(e.g. a live musical group  
backing up dancers, a musical group playing stings or musical play-ons and offs for awards, a comedian  
interacting with an MC, or a multimedia show as a component of the entire presentation\), then at least  
one full technical rehearsal with audio, lighting, A-V, and complete performance, should be scheduled.  
Without one, the show has an increased likelihood of failure and an amateurish appearance. In special  
events, there is only one chance to get it right and for a complex entertainment show, that one rehearsal  
is critical.  
For shows with unconnected entertainment presentations, a full rehearsal is usually not required;  
however, full setup and sound checks are still needed. If performances are to take place from a single stage  
and there are multiple acts sharing the stage during the course of the show, then there is a correct and  
efficient way to execute the setups and rehearsals for all the groups, and that is to work in backward  
performance order. This means that the last act scheduled to perform will set up and sound check first,  
followed by the second to last act, and so on down to the first act which sets up and sound checks last in  
the production schedule. When the last act has completed setup and sound check, the stage is spiked or  
taped with small “Xs” that indicate the correct placement for pieces of equipment \(e.g. amplifiers,  
microphones, monitors\), and then their equipment is struck and stored, usually beside the stage on one  
side in reverse order to their scheduled performance so that their equipment is farther from the stage  
than the act before them. This same procedure is followed until all acts have completed setup and sound  
check. The last act to set up and sound check is thus the first act to perform and when their sound check  
is complete, their equipment remains onstage. When the actual performance time comes, and the first  
act’s performance is over, the equipment is removed, usually to the other side of the stage. The next act’s ENTERTAINMENT 31

equipment is then setup, the group performs and exits in the same manner, and so on until the final act.  
In the same way, the performers themselves will enter from one side of the stage and exit from the other  
in order to avoid confusion, usually from stage right to stage left. Figure 1.8 illustrates what this  
coordinated approach to setup and sound check looks like, with locations indicated for pre-show  
equipment storage after setup and sound check. Note the group numbers refer to the order in which the  
groups will perform in the program.  
The length of time that setups and sound checks take is invariably underestimated by producers and  
especially by clients. Here are some considerations for each of the primary genres of entertainment\:  
• Theatrical presentations. For most standup comedians, all that is required is a microphone sound check,  
as they normally come prepared with their material. This will take about 5 min. An improvisational  
comedy troupe may require wireless lavalier or wireless headset microphones that will have to be  
individually tested and equalized, which will take somewhat longer, approximately 10 min per person.  
Other theatrical presentations and speeches such as for keynote or motivational speakers or MCs  
may take longer as they typically require a check of their PowerPoint presentations or scripts either  
with their own laptop computer at a lectern onstage, with another remotely controlled computer,  
or with a teleprompter. As well, their microphones-which again may be wireless lavalier, wireless  
headset, wireless handheld, or wired-will have to be equalized and set up as discussed in Chapter 3.  
This can take up to 30 min or more per speaker if the speaker insists on a full run-through of their  
presentation.  
• Dance. Most dance troupes come with their music on CDs or flash drives and may require a short  
rehearsal to the music so they can become accustomed to the event staging. This may be one song or  
routine rehearsed one or more times, or their entire dance program, depending on\: the quality of the  
stage surface and the ease with which they can maneuver; their ability to adequately hear their music  
\(i.e. how well audio monitors have been placed on or near the stage\); and how much their choreography  
must be changed to match the staging situation \(e.g. the ease of their entrances and exits, the distance  
to the green room, the route to travel undetected by the audience from one side of the stage to the other,  
usually backstage\). Sometimes this can take as little as 5 or 6 min for a single dance routine with an  
uncomplicated stage setup, to over 60 min for a complex dance program in which the dancers must  
perform several routines one after the other, complete with costume changes and travel between stage  
sides backstage, or must enter and exit through the audience. It can become even more complicated if Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**32** the dancers are performing to live music and/or backing up singers, because then the entire show must  
be rehearsed onstage. Whenever this type of show is being performed, it is preferable to allow at least  
2 to 3 h for rehearsal.  
● Music. Whenever live music is a part of a show, especially if the musical group is a large one or if  
they are accompanying other performers, sufficient time must be allowed for setup and sound check.  
As discussed in Chapter 3, the audio needs of a musical group can be quite complex. In addition to the  
main audio system, there is also the full monitor system that must be balanced and equalized for all  
musicians. It is the monitor system that often takes the most time to check as it is critical that each  
musician be able to hear exactly what he or she must in their individual monitors, whether in-ear or  
onstage, as there is no other way for them to tell if they are playing correctly for the other musicians.  
As well as the sound check, the preceding setup itself may take a long time due to the need for the  
musicians to be conveniently positioned onstage for audience visibility and for visual connection with  
each other. A minimum of 30 min and ideally 60 min should be allowed per musical group for complete  
setup and sound check.  
● Other athletic and variety performers. Most other acts will have unique setup and sound check  
requirements. Hypnotists, jugglers, physical comedians, magicians, acrobats, and similar acts all must  
be given time to become accustomed to the stage and the space in which they will be working. Stage  
magicians, often called illusionists, may need considerable preparation time to construct their illusions  
and place them in exact positions onstage. Acrobatic and Cirque-type performers may need time to  
check the rigging for their act and to rehearse their act in its entirety. Jugglers and hypnotists may need  
to try out the stage and ensure there is sufficient space for their act. The list goes on. Usually, an average  
of 30 min should be allowed for this type of act, longer if it is known to be complicated, such as a magic  
show with large illusions.  
● Technological entertainment. This is so new that there are no standards or suggested methodologies  
for pre-show preparation. Suffice it to say that equipment should be tested in its entirety to ensure  
that all connections and cues for music or lighting are working. Acts incorporating some form  
of technology are expected to increase dramatically in the near future, not just because the technology  
is there, but because most modern audiences have now seen all the different forms of traditional  
entertainment.  
Figure 1.9 shows a unique and quite technical act of “dancing fabrics” that requires a fairly extensive setup,  
including special lighting and fans. They would need sufficient setup and rehearsal time to ensure that  
everything worked properly.  
With any show, no matter how many acts or how complex, there should also be an opportunity made to  
review lighting during the rehearsal time, as this enhances any show in terms of establishing a mood and  
assisting in segues between acts \(e.g. fading to black after an act ends\). It may also be critical if actors must  
hit marks onstage within a certain focused light’s beam, or if performers will be moving around the  
audience—or offstage as with aerial acts—and need to be seen with followspots.  
# 1.2.3 using the event space  
Considering that an event space is three-dimensional, it makes logical sense to stage as much of the  
entertainment in as much of the space as possible. After all, the audience occupies a considerable amount  
of that space, so why should they not all be given equal opportunity to have an optimum view of the show,  
rather than place it all on a single main stage that only those close enough can see well? Indeed, if space  
and budget permit, it is preferable to use one or more auxiliary stages for short segments of entertainment.  
This has several advantages. First, it permits more of the audience to feel included, thus endearing the  
performers to them. Second, it permits easier main stage changeovers without undue attention so that the ENTERTAINMENT **33**  
**Figure 1.9** Example of a technical act requiring detailed setup—Pas de Deux  
Courtesy of Contraband International Ltd., www.contrabandevents.com/  
show in its entirety becomes more seamless. Just as with stages, so too can doors play into the show.  
Having performers enter and exit from many doors rather than the same one all the time, allows the  
audience more opportunities to feel part of the show by being close to the performers. This can be done  
with any of the stage setups below. **34** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 1.2.3.1 One main stage against a wall  
We begin this discussion by assuming that there is always the option of a single stage against a wall with  
no other stages. This is still the most common method of presenting entertainment. The advantages  
include\: lower costs for staging, audio, and lighting; one central focal point; lower costs for stage décor;  
and generally easier coordination of stage presenters and entertainment. However, adding auxiliary stages  
greatly improves the performer–audience connection and adds an exciting and more professional approach  
to the entire show. Figure 1.10 illustrates some optional locations that may be used in addition to a main  
stage in a typical hotel or conference center ballroom for an event. One or more of these stages can be  
used in the course of a single show. For example, a large act requiring a lot of stage area can be confined  
to the main stage while other smaller acts may be interspersed on one or more of the auxiliary stages.  
This works particularly well in a situation such as an event in which there is a dinner followed by a main  
stage presentation \(e.g. speeches, awards, or show\) followed by a dance band. It allows for the dance band  
to set up and prepare silently while the main stage activities are still ongoing, but allows for an  
instantaneous, seamless transition to dancing once the main stage activities are complete. Of course,  
there must be a dance floor already in place in front of or near the auxiliary band stage. This also brings  
up a second advantage to using two stages in a main stage/dance band situation, and that is it prevents  
a large gap between audience and performers if there is only a main stage that must be used for a show  
preceding a dance. This is a deadly situation for any performer because it disconnects the audience  
from the performer and sometimes this disconnection cannot be repaired sufficiently, causing the  
main stage show to “bomb.” This setup is especially bad for comedy. Note that in any case where there  
**Figure 1.10** Possible auxiliary stage locations in a typical hotel ballroom situation  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews ENTERTAINMENT **35**  
is more than one main stage, each of the auxiliary stages requires a separate technical setup for audio and  
lighting, although both systems may be tied into and operated from their respective main consoles and  
console location.  
# 1.2.3.2 One main stage centrally positioned  
Although a little awkward for technical setup in that lighting and audio must be multi-directional, a  
centrally located stage can be very impressive for focusing audience attention. Its big advantage is that it  
puts most of the audience on more of an equal footing than a stage against a wall. Technically, the multi-  
directionality can best be handled using flown audio and lighting systems or a box trussing system around  
and over the main stage. Some of the extra work involved in the setup of the lighting, in particular, may  
soon be overcome through the use of wireless lighting \(see Chapter 5\). The disadvantage of a central stage  
is that any stage changeovers as part of a continuous show are viewable by the audience unless there is  
some intervening or distracting activity such as a meal course or unless there are auxiliary stages, thereby  
making the show a little less seamless. Figure 1.11 diagrammatically illustrates a central stage with some  
possible options for auxiliary stages. Of course, with a central stage, if the event is a sit-down dinner then  
dining tables have to be placed around the outside of the stage. Interestingly, this situation can also be  
achieved by having the dining tables and hence the audience on risers around the outside of the space with  
the central stage replaced by a central floor space as the performing area, although this requires considerable  
time, effort, and expense for renting and setting up risers of differing heights with safety railings installed.  
This setup resembles the old Greek amphitheater setting.  
**Figure 1.11** Central main stage with auxiliary stages  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews **36** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 1.2.3.3 Floor space as a performing area  
Entertainment need not be confined to a stage. Often, for greater visibility and audience interaction, it is  
preferable to use floor space. This situation arises for performers who find stage work awkward, such as  
large processions with giant puppets and stilt walkers, and costumed characters, marching bands, and  
certain types of athletic acts \(e.g. bicycle stunt riders, roller bladers, gymnasts\). For these acts, space can  
be designed in and amongst tables or around the periphery of a room. Of course, this can also be combined  
with one or more stages for even more variety in presentation. When performers are moving about a larger  
area, however, they require adequate lighting and this usually takes the form of one or more followspots  
so that they may be lit equally on all sides and the entire audience may see them clearly. They might also  
require wireless microphones if there is any spoken or sung component to their performance. Figure 1.12  
illustrates some possible options for the use of floor space for performing. Almost any combination of floor  
areas and staging is possible and really a matter of how creative producers wish to be.  
**Figure 1.12** Possible options for using floor space as a performing area  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
# 1.2.3.4 Vertical space as a performing area  
Although theater productions have used vertical space for literally hundreds of years, it has only been since  
Cirque-type acts started being used in special events in the late 1990s that performances using the third  
dimension have become increasingly popular. This has necessitated more emphasis on proper risk  
assessment and proper rigging. We discuss these topics in detail in Chapter 8 of Special Event Production\:  
The Process and Chapter 9 of this book respectively. Acts of this genre include aerial silks, bungee, ropes,  
hoops, and trapeze, among others, and all require rigging plus a circular safety area beneath the performing ENTERTAINMENT **37**  
location that is clear of people and objects. This may be on the floor or on a stage. The one consideration  
that always presents a creative challenge is finding a way to place performers in position prior to their act  
without drawing undue attention from the audience. This can often be done by using a distraction at  
another stage or with a roving performer to keep audience focus away from the aerial act. As with any  
roving performers, aerial acts require special lighting consideration. Usually followspots work well for  
these acts, but at least two may be needed to adequately light all sides unless the act takes place over a  
stage that is being viewed from only one direction.  
# 1.2.4 Building the show  
Although a show relies on talented performers and exciting acts to be successful, it needs the loving,  
guiding hand of a masterful choreographer or director to pull them together into a finished product.  
Lynnette Barkley, of event production company Barkley Kalpak Associates in New York, has staged over  
200 musicals and plays as an award-winning choreographer and director. About this process, she advises,  
Piece by piece the materials are pulled together, as scripts, arrangements, designs, floor plans,  
and costumes are developed. The show is rehearsed, tweaked, massaged, and adjusted to create  
a theatrical arc. Within that arc, you want balance, flow, pace, build, and surprises. Balance – a  
variety within the music and staging so that it is never monotonous. Flow – seamless transitions  
and segues from one moment to the next. Pace – keep it moving, even within a beautiful ballad,  
there is an underlying energy that must be maintained. Build – making sure each moment is  
enhanced from the moment before it. Surprises – never allow the audience to anticipate the next  
moment – keep their interest with variety and the unexpected.  
\(Barkley, 2004, p. 10\)  
Let us briefly examine each of these\:  
It does not matter if the show consists of a single act or multiple acts in a variety format; all these elements  
can and should be used. As Vancouver-based choreographer Diane Buirs states, “The audience needs to  
have a relationship with the performers as soon as possible from the outset of a show” \(D. Buirs, personal  
communication, June 10, 2014\). This can be done by having balance in subject matter \(e.g. a comedian  
who can discuss multiple topics\); in repeat small appearances by the same performers but in different  
costumes or roles \(e.g. dancers returning with different styles of dances and costumes\); in different musical  
styles \(e.g. an a cappella vocal group that varies singing styles among barbershop, Gregorian chant, and  
R&B\); and in working different parts of the stage and the event space \(e.g. using the entire stage or  
different stages, corners of the room, or different entrances\).  
We discuss flow in Section 1.2.5 in the context of beginnings, endings, and segues \(different from the  
psychological interpretation discussed in Section 1.1.3.1\). The key to flow is not to have any “pregnant  
pauses” in a show. As soon as one act or performer finishes, the next is already coming onstage to perform,  
or indeed becomes part of the preceding act and moves directly into their performance with no abrupt start  
and end. This can be done by using different parts of a stage for one act and another part for the next act,  
or by using entirely different stages or parts of the room. It can also be done by musical transitions. These  
are often especially written for a live orchestra or band and can involve no more than several bars of  
modulated key changes that correspond to stage changeovers. It can also be done by using audio effects  
operated by the audio engineer in the form of pre-recorded sound tracks such as fanfares or short musical  
interludes. Lighting can help to effect the changes and the flow of the show by changing colors, light levels  
\(e.g. fading to black at the end of a dance number\), direction, or focus \(see Chapter 5\).  
Surprises are what help to keep audience interest and connection with performers. Sometimes,  
surprises can be very endearing to an audience. A wacky character that only appears for a minute, a wild **38** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
costume, an entrance from a totally unexpected location, a prop or object that becomes part of the  
show, or a waiter who turns into a performer are all surprises that are beyond the audience’s concept  
and expectations. Special effects also fall into this category and we will be explaining them in detail in  
Chapter 6.  
Pace and build tend to work together in that they represent the overall energy level of the show. Pace is  
concerned with timing and the ability of the performers to sustain the audience’s attention throughout  
the show. For example, it can be a fast-paced or slow show. For most special events, the overall pace must  
generally be fast. There can be short periods when it slows down, but no more than about two in a typical  
short 45 min show. Fast-paced does not necessarily mean that all songs have to be up-tempo or that all  
gags have to be delivered in rapid-fire mode. What it does mean, however, is that changeovers, performance  
styles, the number of performers onstage, the lighting levels, colors, and amount of automation all cannot  
be static for too long but must be efficiently and purposefully changed. Any slowing down is for an audience  
breather and only serves to bring them back refreshed and ready for even more. Likewise, build refers to  
being able to consciously relate to and improve upon what went before this point in the show. This is  
particularly significant toward the end of the show. There cannot be any “down time” very close to the end,  
as Diane Buirs cautions, but rather a gradual build in energy level so that the show finishes on a high note  
that might incorporate all the performers, complete with special effects, all backed up by the strongest  
song of the show and/or the delivery of the key message of the event.  
As an example to illustrate pace and build, Figure 1.13 depicts a hypothetical plot of the energy levels from  
one to ten of a typical 45 min corporate event stage show. Let us assume that this show includes a  
contemporary dance troupe, a comedy variety act, and a small musical group with three lead vocalists that  
is also used to back up the dancers. The dancers would open the show strongly, backed by the band with  
what is called a production number in which all dancers and perhaps one or two of the vocalists are onstage  
**Figure 1.13** Pacing\: sample show energy level over time  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews ENTERTAINMENT **39**  
\(minute 0\:00 to about 5\:30\). The singers and band might stay onstage for another one or two songs  
\(minute 5\:30 to 10\:00\). The comedy variety act could then take over, perhaps entering through the audience  
while the band exits the stage, and they perform for about 20 min \(minute 10\:00 to 30\:00\). The band  
returns with perhaps one vocalist or alternatively a single dancer for a solo routine \(this is the breather  
number for the audience before a final build, minute 30\:00 to 33\:00\). The remaining vocalists then return  
for perhaps two or three songs \(minute 33\:00 to 42\:00\) before the final, high-energy production number  
with the entire dance troupe, full band, vocalists, and perhaps even the variety act if they can be  
choreographed into the routine \(minute 42\:00 to 45\:00\). This would be a show with relatively fast pacing,  
variety, and a good build to the finale.  
Being cognizant of how a show should be structured is the first step to success. The second is knowing  
the right people to make this happen. Although producers may decide to tackle this on their own if they  
feel they have the talent, it is never a bad idea to seek out exceptional choreographers or directors with  
theater experience to help the process. Now we will turn our attention to what really makes the difference\:  
beginnings, segues, and endings.  
# 1.2.5 Beginnings, segues, and endings  
“Visualize this thing you want. See it, feel it, believe in it. Make your mental blueprint and begin.” So said  
Robert Collier \(2015\), and nothing could be truer when it comes to staging entertainment. A good producer  
will coordinate acts. A great producer will coordinate a concept. It takes effort on the beginning, the segues  
\(smooth transitions\) between acts, and the ending to coordinate a concept. It is more than simply throwing  
acts onstage one after the other in the right order. A method of introduction is required to begin, a method  
of acknowledgement is required to end, and a method to tie all the acts together with segues is required  
to produce a show that exudes professional finesse.  
# 1.2.5.1 Beginnings  
The question of how to introduce a show or individual acts is always a challenge for any type of  
entertainment. The beginning of the show is the first impression and sets the tone for what will follow.  
Let us look at the possible options for beginning a show, whether it is a single act or scripted show  
comprising many acts\:  
● Live introduction. This comes in two forms\: professional or amateur MC, the amateur form often  
being the client or a client representative. Although it saves money, using an amateur MC, even  
with the insistence of a client, can be a disastrous way to start a show. Why is this? First, the amateur  
usually has no formal training and very little public speaking experience, thereby making a  
demonstrative, expressive, showbiz-type introduction highly unlikely, rather more likely very  
stilted. Second, there is a good possibility that, because the amateur is not familiar with the act, the  
introduction will probably be read, making it sound completely unnatural. Third, invariably a name is  
mispronounced or left out entirely. Professional MCs, on the other hand, will ensure none of these  
happen because they will check scripting and voice intonation, and will ensure that all names are  
pronounced correctly.  
● Onstage introduction or voiceover. Onstage introductions have their place and seem to work well if the  
MC is familiar with the audience or if the event is not too formal. Otherwise, it can appear to be  
unnatural and outdated, resembling the old vaudeville days and the stiffness of Ed Sullivan. It may work  
if there is only a single act and no need to continually keep popping up to the stage to introduce multiple  
acts. Otherwise, a voiceover or God-voice using the house audio system and a microphone set up at the  
front-of-house \(FOH\) position \(audio control console position\) gives a very professional feel to Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**40** introductions and can allow for proper voice inflection and intonation by a professional MC reading a  
script. In fact, it is the best form of introduction when a script must be read. It also allows for clean  
stage changeovers and segues between acts when there are multiple acts, eliminating messy entrances  
and exits of performers and MC at the same time. For example, it permits the stage to go dark while  
one act exits and the next act takes the stage, during which time the MC can read the scripted intro at  
a speed suitable to allow the stage changeover. Thus once the intro is finished, the act is completely  
ready to begin on the last word of introduction, with no pauses.  
● No introduction at all. With the advent of more theatrical-style shows in special events that incorporate  
multiple acts and a story line, a beginning fashioned after the theater can lend a professional feel to the  
production. House and stage lights can be dimmed or ballyhooed \(i.e. moved excitingly\), a musical  
introduction can be employed, and the event can begin with no spoken introduction, thereafter just  
being allowed to flow one act into the other, with lights and/or music being used for scene or act  
changeovers. The success of this approach usually depends on the strength and understandability of the  
story line in combination with the strength of the overall presentation of the acts and how well they  
relate to the storyline and reason for holding the event. If there is no obvious connection or if the  
connection is too esoteric, there is a chance that the point of the show will be lost on an audience with  
other distractions \(e.g. alcohol, conversation\), so the totality of the show should be considered before  
deciding that no spoken introductions are required.  
# 1.2.5.2 Segues  
Segues or transitions between acts are what glue the show together. As producers like to say, they are what  
make the show “seamless.” They depend on a number of factors, including where the stage\(s\) and  
performance spaces are located, where doors are located for entrances and exits, where the green rooms  
are located, what lighting is available, whether there will be act introductions \(e.g. onstage or voiceover\),  
what other event programming may be before or after the act \(e.g. another act and what type it is—  
speeches, meal course, awards, auction, and such\). Sometimes, exact segues cannot be finalized until the  
entire event setup is complete and the producer has a chance to check where and how acts will get to and  
from the stage\(s\). Here are some possibilities for segues\:  
● Verbal introductions and acknowledgements by a live onstage MC or by a voiceover. As explained, a live  
onstage MC tends to make for a disjointed show due to the need for him or her to continually take to  
the stage for short periods. It also means that any exits or entrances by performers are seen by the  
audience and, if they are not clean, will give the show an amateurish appearance. A voiceover allows for  
lighting to be used to hide stage transitions so they can be done in the dark. In the end, it depends on  
personal preference. It may also depend on whether the live MC is a celebrity, in which case it makes  
sense to have that person seen as much as possible, or if the MC is a comedian who can continue with  
an act as part of the transition.  
● Changing audience focus. This requires that the producer employ a method to distract the audience  
while acts are in transition. It often is used when there are not going to be any verbal introductions. If  
there is only one stage used for performances, it may mean that acts enter the event from a door at the  
farthest end of the venue and make their way up to the stage through the audience, either interacting  
with them \(the audience\) or performing in some way as they move, thus allowing sufficient time for  
the previous act to exit cleanly and unseen from the main stage. It may also mean changing focus to an  
auxiliary stage or performance area \(e.g. a section of floor, an aerial act suspended from the ceiling\) if  
there is more than one stage so that the main stage may be changed over.  
● Interaction of acts. This is the most theatrical of any method of transition. It means that either the  
producer or the acts in the show must devise a short, scripted interplay that will, in itself, become the ENTERTAINMENT **41**  
transition between them. For example, comedians might call on a dancer to join them onstage for some  
simple banter, which in turn leads to the start of a dance routine that enables the comedy act to exit. A  
band playing an opening overture might be stopped midstream by a comedy musical performer who  
then joins the band and begins his act accompanied by them. There are endless possibilities, with the  
only requirement being the willingness of the acts to cooperate and take the time to rehearse together.  
Of course, this often necessitates extra remuneration to them.  
# 1.2.5.3 Endings  
The ending is what leaves a lasting impression and will be the strongest memory the audience carries away.  
Much like the beginning, it cannot be simply allowed to happen on its own with no forethought. Whether  
the show is a single act or multiple acts, there must be an acknowledgement of them, ideally as a voiceover  
or an onstage acknowledgement. This is the opportunity to bring all the performers back onstage in a  
professionally choreographed ending with properly rehearsed bows. It is worth taking the time to gather  
all acts together at the sound check and have a short rehearsal of this ending so it appears rehearsed and  
planned. The audience will always appreciate that a little extra effort above and beyond the call of duty has  
been given to the show. If it is too awkward to acknowledge each individual act after they complete their  
portion of the show, then this final bow is that opportunity.  
What about encores? They present a unique and unpredictable case in that every show is different. It is  
usually the producer’s call whether an act or acts return to the stage for an encore performance. This can  
depend on several factors. The most important one is obviously audience reaction. An extended standing  
ovation is the best thanks that any performers can be given and usually means an automatic encore if they  
have the material. At least one strong song or routine should be kept at the ready for this. However, if  
applause is sustained but there is no standing ovation, the decision is a little harder. I used to watch for  
signs such as shouts of “More!” or rhythmic clapping before I would bring an act back. Another factor is  
show length and how long the show—and the event \(e.g. dinner, speeches, awards, etc.\)—have already  
lasted. If it has been a marathon of 4–6 h, it may not be worth extending the show, no matter how good it  
has been. It is best to “leave them wanting more.” How long should an encore be? Not long is the best  
answer. If it is for a musical act ideally one song, with two at most if the show has been fairly short \(e.g.  
30 to 45 min\). Anything longer has a negative effect on the audience and they sense they are being “milked”  
or forced to enjoy against their will.  
Beginnings, endings, and segues are all a matter of timing, of knowing the exact second when to begin  
to act or play, and the exact second when to stop. It means that as the applause is just starting to die  
out for the previous act, the next act begins \(or is introduced\), not after the applause is over and not  
too soon during it, but just at the moment that “feels right.” It follows from this statement that for  
great segues, all performers must know where to be and when to be there so that there is no last-minute  
panic before taking the stage. This is covered in more detail in Chapter 9 of Special Event Production\:  
The Process.

# An interview with Ms. Archie Archer  
Founder and Managing Director, Contraband International Ltd.  
London, United Kingdom  
www.contrabandevents.com **42** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
In ten short years, Archie Archer has grown her company from a single employee operating out  
of a North London flat to an entertainment agency with global reach, and one of Britain’s most  
successful event businesses. Contraband International Ltd. now provides over 6,000 performers for  
over 1,500 events each year all over the world. They employ 11 full-time staff and annually gross  
in excess of £2 million. Archie has been named as one of the top 100 most influential people in  
the uk events industry by *Event Magazine* in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.

Courtesy of Contraband International Ltd., www.contrabandevents.com/  
**DM**\: You have an amazingly large and varied roster of acts. How do you scout out new acts and  
how do you determine if you will represent them?  
**aa**\: Most acts now approach us as a result of referrals from other performers or because of our  
reputation. We receive about 20 emails per day from acts wanting us to represent them, and  
the calls come from all over the world. We are very discerning about who we represent and only  
accept top-quality, highly original acts. They must have at least ten corporate clients already, many  
testimonials, and high-quality videos or CDs. When possible, we also review them live in a special  
performance area of our office.  
**DM**\: How do you catalogue your talent roster?  
**aa**\: We actually use our web site as our main roster. It has all the details about each act, including  
still images, videos, and technical riders. We keep the confidential information about them on an  
Excel spreadsheet. ENTERTAINMENT **43**  
**DM**\: How do you charge for your services?  
**aa**\: We contract separately with clients and with performers and charge a markup on the  
performers.  
**DM**\: How extensively do you customize an entertainment program or show for clients?  
**aa**\: Although some of our shows are booked as complete packages, we do not customize shows.  
Everything is off the shelf and our business model is strictly on volume. If a show needs more,  
we will pass it to business colleagues who provide that service. We are almost never asked for  
complete custom shows.  
**DM**\: Do you or your staff attend all events at which you have booked entertainment? If not, how  
do you decide which ones to attend?  
**aa**\: It is physically impossible for us to attend all events. There are just too many. If there are  
multiple acts at an event, we may send a manager to look after them.  
**DM**\: Do you have any suggestions about how to treat performers and acts before, during, and  
following their performance?  
**aa**\: The main thing to remember is that performers are people. I have had clients who won’t even  
consider giving performers a glass of water, but others who will offer them a full meal. We have had  
enough experience that we now include a section in all our client contracts about what is required  
for performers, including green room details and food.  
**DM**\: Do you also subcontract and coordinate other event components such as audio, lighting, A-V,  
décor, staging, or special effects?  
**aa**\: No, we spell out in client contracts what is required for tech and the client is then responsible  
for obtaining it.  
**DM**\: What are some of your most popular acts for events such as teambuilding \(corporate\),  
conferences, award ceremonies, weddings, and festivals?  
**aa**\: The big trend right now is technology—for example, led acts such as The Sparklers and the  
Pas de Deux dancing fabrics. Also, we have found that the popular Cirque-type acts of the recent  
past have now moved toward other performance sporting acts such as 3 Run, three guys who do  
parkour, free running, and martial arts.  
**DM**\: How—and why—do you see the entertainment industry in the uk, especially as it pertains to  
special events, changing over the next five to ten years?  
**aa**\: Our events industry is affected by the economy. When the recession started, spending dried  
up and events were canceled as clients like the banks couldn’t be seen to be spending the money.  
In 2014 we’ve seen great growth in the market and the economy feels back to pre-recession  
confidence. For us personally we’ve never been busier in the history of the company and I see this  
on a huge upward trend due to our growth in international business. **44** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 1.3 Working with performers  
It is amazing how many clients I have encountered in my career who treat performers like lower class hired  
help. They wonder why they are so expensive \(e.g. “Why is so-and-so charging \$1,000 for 30 minutes. I’m  
in the wrong profession.”\), they wonder why they need two hours to set up and sound check \(e.g. “It’s  
only a dance band with some singers. Why all the fuss?”\), they wonder why they need coffee and sandwiches  
and a comfortable changing room \(e.g. “That is going to cost \$300 extra and it is not in my budget. You  
will have to cover it.”\), and then they wonder why the show was not very good! I am hoping that producers  
and their clients of the future will read this section and reconsider this way of thinking. The reasons should  
become obvious as we progress through the section and consider the key points in working with performers  
from their perspective.  
# 1.3.1 mindset  
Mindset—zone—headspace. These terms describe a utopian psychological state inhabited by performers,  
elite athletes, motivational speakers, and anyone who must be at their absolute peak of ability performing  
before a live audience. It is a place where their body, mind, and spirit meet in harmony in readiness for the  
task at hand. Only those who have visited this place can understand how necessary it is to find it in order  
to give a successful performance.  
Different performers have different ways of achieving this state. Some pace, some pray, some joke, some  
drink coffee, some intently review scripts, some practice, some stretch or do exercises, some just talk, but  
everyone does it, either consciously or subconsciously. Indeed, some performers have onstage personalities  
completely different from their offstage personalities and people are often astonished by this. Really, it is  
only their inhabitation of a performing mindset that is happening. If the two personalities are extremely  
different, then performers may need some extra time to get into that performing mindset.  
Anthropologist Turner \(1988, pp. 54–55\) understood what is happening. Any performance, as he noted,  
involves “frame, flow, and reflection.” By “frame” he was referring to “that often invisible boundary around  
activity which defines participants, their roles, the ‘sense’ or ‘meaning’ ascribed to those things included  
within the boundary, and the elements within the environment of the activity.” In other words, for our  
purposes, this frame is an event entertainment show. Performers recognize that the show is a distinct  
activity outside the norm of everyday life, and can be treated as such, so that they are free to be who they  
want or need to be. They can only get to this state by being given time to be on their own away from  
distractions.  
What does this mean for producers? It means that performers, no matter who they are, must be given quiet  
time before their performance, on their own, to find the right frame of mind. Therefore, it behooves the  
producer to provide such an environment. This topic is listed at the very top of this section because it is  
considered the most important aspect of working with performers.  
# 1.3.2 creature comforts  
Along with the need to provide a welcoming environment is a need to provide creature comforts for  
performers. This will mean some standard amenities in the form of\:  
● Changing rooms. Also called green rooms, these are areas or actual rooms in a venue—or perhaps a tent  
at an outdoor event—set aside for the use of the performers only. They can take many forms. I have had  
to put performers in everything from presidential suites to tiny washrooms. Ideally, they should be  
heated, well lit, and large enough to comfortably contain all the performers. They should also be close  
to the performing areas or stage\(s\). If possible, washrooms should be close by and not require performers ENTERTAINMENT **45**  
to be seen by the public or the audience when visiting them. Finally, if there are multiple performing  
groups, or single groups with both sexes, different rooms should be assigned to each group or to each  
sex, out of respect. At the very least, if separate rooms are not possible, a single large room can be  
divided using pipe and drape. Occasionally, some groups such as dance troupes require secondary quick-  
change or preparation areas close to the stage where they will be performing. This can be a small  
curtained area behind or beside the stage, which should be well lit and invisible to the audience.  
● Other amenities. Common sense dictates that if it is a changing room, then performers will need  
something to hang their clothes on, as well as other amenities to assist them in preparing to go onstage.  
This means that sufficient chairs, tables, movable clothes racks, coat hangers, mirrors, and electrical  
outlets for hair dryers, razors, and other appliances will be needed for all the performers.  
● Refreshments. Although refreshments are not always a necessity, they are especially appreciated if  
performers must remain onsite at an event for a period of 2 h or more, including their performance time,  
but are virtually a necessity if this period extends over a meal hour. Although they do not have to eat  
the same six-course meal that the event guests will be fed, they will expect and appreciate at minimum  
a substantial sandwich tray, along with perhaps crudités and cookies, plus a selection of water, soft  
drinks, juice, and coffee. They should not expect any alcoholic beverages although occasionally one drink  
may be allowed after their performance as long as they will not be driving and consumption takes place  
out of sight of the event guests. Food or drinks should never be consumed by performers in front of  
event guests or by taking food or drinks prepared for the guests, without the very clear and express  
permission of the client or event producer.  
It should be noted that all the amenities listed, particularly refreshments, also apply to technical personnel  
working onsite at the event \(e.g. audio, lighting, A-V technicians, and stage managers\) if they will be there  
over meal hours, which is often more likely to happen for them than for performers. They will also need  
the changing space as they must change from their work clothes into more formal attire for the event itself  
and may need to change back to work clothes after the event for the strike.  
# 1.3.3 unique preparations and performance needs  
Inexperienced producers cannot always understand why performers prepare in certain ways. To understand  
this, one first has to understand that a special event is a temporary and shifting performance situation. It  
is one that has unusual demands for performers, including\: the need to often shorten or rearrange their  
performance to suit the length of the overall show, sometimes at a moment’s notice; the need to wait for  
extended periods of time, often well past the stated performance start time; and the need to begin their  
performance immediately when called, having prepared themselves completely notwithstanding any  
lengthy wait. Because of this, every performance genre has unique needs.  
# 1.3.3.1 Musicians and vocalists  
Musicians and vocalists anywhere in the world have common needs because music is a universal language.  
As well, many instruments have their own quirks to deal with. Here are some of the common considerations,  
not including technical needs \(e.g. audio and lighting\), for musical performers\:  
● Vocalists. Vocalists need to warm up their voices alone and together and can only do this in a room  
where they and others will not be disturbed. They also need water onstage, normally in individual  
glasses and without ice in order to keep lubricated and hydrated. Water can be delivered to the stage  
and placed in an inconspicuous location before the performance begins.  
● Musicians. Many musicians—and vocalists—belong to the American Federation of Musicians \(AFM\) or  
“union” and must abide by their regulations, which stipulate maximum play times and minimum fees Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**46** for contracted types and lengths of performances. For example, technically the union maximum time  
that a musician or group can play is 90 min before taking a break. This must be borne in mind when  
the event is planned, especially if a client expects a continuous performance of a dance band or musician  
playing background music. Most breaks should last no longer then 15–20 min, often depending on the  
length and energy level of the preceding performance. Typical dance band or background music sets last  
from 45 to 60 minutes.  
● Equipment and instruments. Musicians also require time to perform last-minute tuning of their  
instruments \(guitars, violins, other stringed instruments, and woodwinds are particularly susceptible  
to going out of tune when the ambient temperature varies even slightly\) before taking the stage or  
beginning their performance. Some instruments require a lot of warming up, such as bagpipes, and  
pipers or pipe bands will expect an area out of audible range of any guests to warm up, tune, and  
practice. Acoustic pianos \(e.g. uprights, baby grands, or full grands\) need to be tuned after extensive  
moving \(slight moving is acceptable without tuning\) such as being lifted onto a stage, and this should  
be done prior to a sound check. It usually takes about 2 h. Musicians, especially symphony musicians,  
require music stands and lights for these stands, and they do not always bring their own, so this  
question has to be settled prior to contracting.  
# 1.3.3.2 Actors, comedians, and speakers  
The biggest concern for this group is remembering their lines, so they need a quiet area to reflect and  
review. Their second concern is getting into character and this also requires a quiet space away from  
distractions. Occasionally, they may have special props that are used as part of their performance and that  
must be pre-placed on the stage prior to the performance.  
# 1.3.3.3 Dancers  
Dancers must have their bodies in perfect working order to perform. Hence, they need a green room or  
area large enough to warm up with stretching exercises and perhaps to do last-minute run-throughs of  
their routines. This might be extremely important if their performance space \(i.e. stage area\) is not as  
planned or not the size that they were initially told, and they have to make last-minute adjustments to  
choreography onsite. To the chagrin of choreographers everywhere, this happens far too often in special  
events due to lack of communications between producers and performers. Dance troupes will often bring  
CD players to their events to do these run-throughs. Dancers will also need to adjust their routines for  
entrances and exits and may have to make several unobtrusive visits to the stage area to determine how  
to do this once all dancers are onsite prior to their performance.  
# 1.3.3.4 Other athletic and variety entertainment  
This group encompasses all other variety-type entertainment and their needs run a broad gamut. Some of  
the more common ones used in special events are jugglers, magicians, hypnotists and mind readers, stilt  
walkers, acrobatic acts, table acts, fire performers, a variety of cultural performers, occasionally animal  
acts, and more recently, acts depending on technology. Many of these have props \(e.g. jugglers, fire  
performers, magicians\) that may need pre-placing onstage prior to their performance. Some such as fire  
performers or magicians using flash pots and indoor pyrotechnics \(see Chapter 6\), need fire extinguishers  
close by with operators at the ready, as well as a safety zone clearly demarcated. Stilt walkers need assistance  
negotiating doorways and stairs \(some can use them, some cannot, but they should be avoided if possible\).  
Table acts \(caricaturists, body massage, graphologists, temporary tattoo artists, fortune tellers, cardsharps,  
and others\) normally only need an area with good lighting but may also require their own tables and chairs  
for guests, plus some water for themselves. Acrobatic acts are similar to dancers in that their bodies are ENTERTAINMENT **47**  
their performing instruments and they must stretch and warm up, often immediately before taking the  
stage, so a heated space near the stage may be needed \(this is important for contortionists especially\). In  
the occasional jurisdictions that still permit animal acts at special events, special care and thorough risk  
management assessments are required, as well as safety enclosures and areas for the animals to heed the  
call of nature, preferably not inside on a carpet! In my career, some of the funniest and scariest moments  
have involved animals and they have invariably been the hit of any show, but they also must be treated  
humanely and with the utmost respect. Technological acts such as musicians interacting with an audience’s  
mobile devices may need to pre-place equipment and run through its operation. Others such as sand artists  
may require special light tables to be pre-placed and checked. These types of acts are becoming more  
prevalent and all have unique requirements.  
Those athletic and variety acts that perform onstage have varying average lengths of shows\: 5–6 min for  
acrobatic acts and fire performers; 5–15 min for animal acts; 15–30 min for jugglers; 30–45 min for  
magicians if using large illusions; 60–90 min for hypnotists; and up to 60 min for large cultural performances.  
Those that are roving or table acts have average performance durations that are more a function of their  
physical and mental stamina than anything else\: 20–30 min for jugglers or stilt walkers; 30–40 min for  
sleight-of-hand magicians; and up to 2 h for table acts. For most, a break of 15–20 min is expected after  
these performances and then they are able to perform another set of the same length.  
# 1.3.4 communications  
Regular communication with performers is critical for optimum performances. This begins with the first  
phone call, moves to a contract, and ends with the performance.  
# 1.3.4.1 General  
From the very first request to use their services, performers will be expecting to know\: the time, date,  
venue, and address of the performance; duration of the performance\(s\); type and theme of the event; who  
or what precedes and follows them in the show or event program; audience size; and audience demographics  
\(ages, genders, nationality, languages, type of business or organization\). Of course, remuneration will also  
be discussed and tentatively agreed upon. From this information, the performers will be able to adjust and  
mold their shows to relate to the audience and event parameters. They may also want to know, prior to  
contracting, what amenities will be provided, including green rooms with their own needs considered as  
outlined above, costume or attire requirements, where and how load-in will take place, rehearsal and/or  
sound check details, and whether parking fees will be covered. There may also be a number of other  
considerations that need to be confirmed such as eating and drinking policies, book-back policies, whether  
performers’ guests are allowed at the event, and such.  
# 1.3.4.2 Contracting and followup  
We discuss contracting at length in Chapter 6 of Special Event Production\: The Process, and Sonder \(2004\)  
goes into some detail about it, as does Rutherford-Silvers \(2012\). Suffice it to say, all the performance  
details discussed during initial contact and any leading up to the contract need to be put into the contract  
with the performer, including such things as overtime performance and remuneration policies, payment  
schedules, and cancellation policies. Along with the contract, a tentative event schedule and show running  
order, plus a floor plan and stage plot, should be sent to the performer or act so that they have the latest  
information.  
The time between the contract date and performance date can be lengthy, often months. Producers  
sometimes forget that they need to keep performers informed of changes to a show. Start times, rehearsal **48** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
and setup times, and show length changes can all affect an individual act’s ability to give an optimum  
performance. Therefore, any changes to the event that impact on the show should be given to all performers  
whenever they occur, right up to the performance date. A day or two out from the event itself, all performers  
should be called and all performance details re-confirmed. It is at this time that the load-in information,  
green room assignments, parking details, meal arrangements, and setup and sound check expectations are  
provided in their final form.  
# 1.3.4.3 At the event  
As we have alluded to throughout this section, performers must be treated with courtesy and respect.  
Nothing can undermine this more than having them frustrated on arrival at an event site by a locked door  
and no visible way to enter the event space. They must be given exact directions about how to load-in and  
enter the venue, or navigate through an outdoor event and fencing. Sometimes this entails getting though  
security barriers such as doors with pass codes or live security guards. If it is impossible to give them codes  
to enter a venue, then someone must be assigned to meet them at a specific location on arrival. Otherwise,  
there is a chance that they will be late for setup, sound check, or rehearsal. Luckily, cell phones can help  
to prevent this possibly embarrassing situation. Once onsite, they should be escorted to their green room,  
or if it is not ready, at least to a location where they can temporarily leave valuables and equipment safely.  
From the moment they arrive onsite to the time they perform, they must be kept fully informed of what  
is happening at the event, including any changes to their start time or to the length of their show. As they  
will undoubtedly be confined to the green room once setup, sound check, and rehearsals are over, this  
means regular updating of their estimated performance time. I personally like to give approximately 60,  
30, 15, five, and one min warnings. At the 15 min mark prior to their performance, they should be moved  
to their standby location at or near the stage or other performing area, such as an entrance door, to await  
their cue to enter.  
After their performance, they should be personally thanked and paid. If the show was great, they should  
be told, but if it was not, this is not the time to dwell on the negative. This can be saved for later discussion  
as they will usually clearly understand what went wrong without being told.  
# 1.3.5 the special case\: celebrities  
Celebrities draw people to events. However, while they are wonderful as a draw, they can be expensive to  
accommodate and sometimes come with complex contract riders outlining technical and personal  
requirements. These last may extend to the type of transportation, accommodations, and meal arrangements  
that are acceptable, but may go much farther and detail green room requirements, some of which can get  
into the ridiculous. Often, fulfilling riders costs as much or more than the basic contract. However, most  
are quite reasonable and result from years of experience and often inadequate treatment at the hands of  
inexperienced show producers and promoters. See www.thesmokinggun.com/backstage for some examples,  
both reasonable and extreme. Sonder \(2004, pp. 183–184\) also discusses this topic. McGarey \(2004\),  
formerly of Axtell Productions in Atlanta, USA, has spent many wonderful hours and days working with  
celebrities. She offers the following advice\:  
● Determine your client’s budget up front. You simply must know whether you are buying a Cadillac or  
a Ford before you start shopping!  
● Determine whether a meet and greet is key to the success of the event. If so, you will need to do your  
homework to see which artists are gracious and eager to accommodate. Much better than to find out  
the day of the show that they will only meet for five min and permit five photographs! Yes, this has  
actually happened. ENTERTAINMENT **49**  
● Determine the type of act that will best suit your client.  
● Obtain a list of available acts in the price range desired. Remember the cost can easily double or even  
triple when rider requirements and expenses are added in.  
● Present the list to your client asking them to narrow their choices to the top three \(in order please\) so  
that you can do your homework to nail down exact bottom line prices \(including production at the  
intended location\). I normally do a line item cost analysis for each of the three acts.  
● Be sure your client understands that availability is good “at this writing” since most celebrity acts will  
not hold dates until a written offer is in their hands! This way, if the client procrastinates and loses their  
first choice, you cannot be held responsible.  
● Be sure that your client understands that once the written offer is made, they are committed! I’ve had  
to demand a minimum 50 percent payment on more than one date where the client changed their mind  
after the written offer was made. In some cases, a full 100 percent payment was made after a decision  
to cancel the order. When you play with the big boys, there is very little room for mind changing without  
penalty!  
● Be sure that you have access to the venue no later than the morning of an evening event. Better yet, if  
possible, try to negotiate a setup time the night before. This can give you the breathing room you need  
in case of technical difficulty the day of the show.  
● Be sure to schedule a production meeting the day before your celebrity event with all the key players  
including hotel or venue contacts, sound and lighting contractors, A-V supplier, decorators, caterers,  
and ground arrangements personnel. Provide each of them with a contact list so that in case you are not  
available at a critical time, they can call the person needed to address the problem.  
● Stay calm. The day of the screaming, out-of-control producer is past! You will gain much more respect  
from your client and your co-workers if you work through each challenge without throwing around a  
lot of attitude. Delegate responsibility from the beginning so that you will not be inundated with trivial  
questions on event day. Once sound checks are done, you should be able to relax and enjoy the event  
along with everybody else!  
We have spent a lot of time in this chapter discussing entertainment from the performer’s perspective, and  
that has been on purpose, because so many books and articles consider only the entertainment consumer’s  
perspective. In summary then, given that the performers for a special event have been treated well, that  
they have been fully informed of the reason for the event and the content they must deliver, and that all  
other preparatory concerns have been satisfied, what can the event producer or manager expect in return?  
First, because the vast majority of performers follow this calling out of sheer love for their craft, they can  
be expected to deliver a professional performance filled with emotion and passion. In more practical terms,  
it should be delivered on time, be of the correct length, and communicate the messages and content  
discussed and contracted prior to the event. Stage attire and costuming should be of the highest quality,  
deportment should be respectful at all times before, during, and after the show, and language and content  
should be above reproach. Any performer who is incapable of fulfilling and meeting these minimum  
expectations should not be seriously considered for future employment in special event entertainment.  
# 1.3.6 risk and safety  
Most of the risk associated with performers and entertainment in general, assuming that all the technical  
equipment is correctly used, surrounds their being where they should be at the right time, and performing  
according to their contract for the length of show promised. Therefore, as discussed throughout this chapter,  
if contracts are followed and performers treated appropriately, there should normally be no risk involved  
from their side. From my personal experience, the most risk has been associated with having performers  
arrive on time and knowing where to go. Even with the best directions and allowing enough time for getting **50** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
lost, traffic jams, or parking problems, there were still instances when fate intervened and a performer was  
late. Producers sometimes have to accept that probabilities tell you that this is inevitable. However, having  
a backup plan such as rearranging the order of performances, or calling an alternate performer is always a  
good idea, as is keeping a list of performer contact information at the ready while onsite.  
The physical safety of performers and the audience is paramount as well. Ignoring the obvious crowd  
management problems of large concerts, which we deal with to some degree in Chapter 9, there may be  
potential for harm depending on the performance content. For example, I once became an onstage volunteer  
for a strong man act and ended up standing on his shoulders thinking to myself, “I sure hope you have  
liability insurance, my friend.” Usually, these types of audience participation routines are relatively  
harmless but just in case, producers should ensure that such an act has a contract holding the producer  
harmless for any injuries incurred to audience members, that the act carries sufficient commercial and  
general liability \(CGL\) insurance, and that the act names the producer as an additional insured. On the other  
side of the coin, performers may get injured just moving through an audience or venue or by an audience  
member. These cases are covered by Workers’ Compensation and producers should again ensure that all  
acts and performers are registered for coverage by providing copies of their certificate of registration.  
Double-checking routes that performers will use in getting to or from a stage or in performing their act is  
critical, especially with respect to trip hazards and proper lighting, as is the safety of any overhead rigging  
for performance. Other risks are covered in the applicable technical chapters of this book.

**1.** Briefly describe the different forms of entertainment.  
**2.** Name six reasons for entertainment. Give examples of an event that might be organized for  
each reason.  
**3.** You have a client who would like to motivate and educate his company’s sales force by means of  
cutting-edge, experiential entertainment. Research online and suggest four different options for  
mobile device-based entertainment that would achieve this and explain how it could be done.  
**4.** You are to produce an entertainment show for a standup reception for 3,000 convention  
attendees in a large convention center ballroom. The event lasts 3 h and your client would like  
to keep the attendees there for as long as possible. Plan a show that will be exciting and highly  
visual and that will keep attention for the full event. Suggest at least three different layouts for  
stages or performance areas and how the entertainment could be staged for maximum effect.  
**5.** An awards show for which you are the producer will have periodic entertainment segments  
throughout the event, including performances by a standup comedian, a backup band for the  
awards program, a three-member female vocal group, and a keynote speaker. Detail the con-  
cerns that must be addressed in looking after these performers and suggest ways to take care  
of them throughout the event, which will last for 5 h \(6\:00–11\:00 pm\). They will all have had to  
be at a rehearsal at 4\:00 pm and will need to stay on the premises from then until the end of  
the event at 11\:00 pm.

# Décor  
# l e a r n i n g o u t c o m es  
After reading this chapter, you will be able to\:  
**1.** Understand and explain design theory, specifically the elements and principles of design, and  
how they relate to event décor design in a three-dimensional space.  
**2.** Describe the different categories of décor and how they can be used in a special event.  
**3.** Understand the importance of correctly planning for the setup and strike of décor at an event.  
Special events are emotional and sensory experiences. The more an event can appeal to the emotions and  
the five senses, the more memorable and successful it will be. People attend events to be transported into  
an environment that is different from their everyday life, whether it is a concert, a championship football  
game, or a formal dinner. Frequently, these events are held in what would ordinarily be venues that are  
not conducive to such a fantasy environment unless they are transformed through the magic of well-  
designed décor. Successful event décor design takes talent and considerable thought to be effective. It has  
become a specialty in itself and the designer is a key member of the production team, with the producer  
and designer working together to bring the wow factor of décor into the event.  
This wow factor often takes the form of a theme event. This chapter is intended to provide knowledge of  
the resources that may be used to create such an event without detailing what might go into any specific  
theme, as several other authors \(Malouf, 1999; Monroe, 2006; Goldblatt, 2014\) have given excellent  
interpretations of the process.  
In this chapter, we will review design theory and how good event décor designers use it, we will explore  
the main categories of décor that designers use for events, and finally, we will discuss the myriad details  
that a designer and a producer must consider when integrating a décor setup into the event production  
schedule. This is not intended to be an exhaustive treatment of this subject, but only enough to acquaint  
producers with the essentials. **54** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 2.1 Design theory  
Design theory crosses all artistic boundaries. Whether it is interior decorating for a home, planning for a  
store window display, landscaping, creating a web page, or conceiving a stage set for a rock star’s world  
tour, similar theory comes into play. Design theory incorporates elements of design and principles of design.  
# 2.1.1 elements of design  
These are the raw ingredients of design. They are very general but form the basis of the design in that  
different functional or visual effects can be achieved by working with them. Although they are sometimes  
called by other names in different artistic disciplines, we will examine each one and how it relates  
specifically to event décor. Several excellent resources explain most of these in detail \(Gatto et al., 2000;  
Lovett, 1999; Saw, 2001; and Skaalid, 1999\).  
# 2.1.1.1 Space  
Three-dimensional space is the most obvious element of design that one notices when first walking into  
a large room such as a convention center hall or a hotel ballroom with nothing in it. Space is something  
we cannot touch but it touches us. It surrounds us and envelops us, and any other object in it. Luckily, we  
are able to sculpt it and change its appearance, and therein lies one of the secrets of good décor design.  
That cold, cavernous hall can be changed from an empty, echoing void into a warm, intimate dining room  
and theater. The challenges faced by an event designer, unlike artists in other disciplines, are that this  
transformation must be temporary, it must be accomplished relatively quickly, and it must make use of all  
three dimensions in the most effective manner.  
Making use of space effectively means being aware of negative and positive space. Positive space is where  
shapes and forms occur within the three dimensions. Negative space is where they are absent. For the  
designer, this necessitates striking a balance between the amount of negative and positive space. Novice  
event designers often mistake three-dimensional décor as being a combination of wall coverings \(the two  
dimensions of height and length or width\) and tables, chairs, and centerpieces \(the two dimensions of  
length and width with minimal height\). They neglect to extend into the third dimension in both cases,  
thus leaving too much negative space in one dimension. For example, the vertical plane can be better filled  
by using very high table centers extending up from the tables, or by using ceiling-mounted, matching décor  
pieces extending down from the ceiling above the tables. Likewise, extending themed props outward into  
the room from murals or wall coverings can fill the horizontal plane. In this way, all three dimensions are  
more effectively utilized.  
One key point must be made that is well known by good designers, and that is that in any event space  
indoors or outdoors \(where the vertical dimension is infinity!\), people quickly fill the bottom 6 ft \(1.8 m\)  
of the vertical dimension. That means any décor placed below this level is virtually ineffective and will not  
be noticed. The general rule of thumb is to place all essential décor above eye level \(i.e. above approximately  
5–6 ft from the floor or ground\).  
Accomplishing quick three-dimensional event space transformation necessitates the designer being aware  
of the raw materials available that can be set up easily. Some of the latest décor pieces that enable this to  
happen will be discussed in Section 2.2, and include large inflatables, tensile fabric structures, banners,  
and murals or backdrops.  
Having reviewed what can be done with a space, it is also necessary when first analyzing an event space  
to be aware of what is already there. Three-dimensional architectural or other elements, such as columns,  
obstructive corners, overhanging balconies, unmovable furniture or practical fixtures \(e.g. bars, fixed seats, Décor **55**  
tables, or open kitchen\), might require some sort of work-around, as may doors and windows. The key  
point here is that the designer wants to avoid any extra costly construction or time-consuming cover-ups  
of these elements in order to achieve the desired design. Rather, it is better to work with them and  
incorporate them into the design. Likewise, unsuitably patterned or colored wallpaper, carpets, and lighting  
can clash with a designer’s concept and may have to be brought into the design to be successful.  
# 2.1.1.2 Form  
Form is the basic tangible element of design. In two-dimensional disciplines such as painting, it is known  
as shape and is made up of combinations of basic rectangles, triangles, and circles. In three-dimensional  
design, such as event décor design, the forms take on volume and mass, and the combinations of shapes  
are limitless. Geometric forms such as boxes, cones, balls, tubes, and many others are used to create event  
décor. By combining the basic geometrical forms in different ways, new free form or abstract shapes emerge.  
With the advent of new materials in recent years, designers have realized that event décor can be  
revolutionized by incorporating unique design forms that can be erected and taken down easily,  
inexpensively, and efficiently. Examples include tensile fabric décor, air tubes, and the integration of  
structural-type forms such as scaffolding or trussing, with fabrics and lighting. These are often used to  
transform mundane shapes into attention-grabbing, colorful sculptures.  
In terms of the practical use of forms for events, if they are intended to be functional, forms should be  
appropriate for their intended use. In terms of the use of forms for pure design, varying shapes adds  
excitement to the overall design, such as combining new table and stool shapes with other forms \(e.g.  
perhaps wildly shaped inflatables\), but still keeping within the event’s color scheme and theme in all the  
forms. We will be exploring color and themes later in this chapter.  
Form can be truly spectacular. See Figure 2.1.  
**Figure 2.1** Example of an unusual form

# 2.1.1.3 Line  
As a design element, line has two meanings. The first and most obvious is that it serves to outline form  
and separates it from the surrounding space. For example, one might say that an automobile, a dress, and  
a piece of furniture have nice lines, meaning that their shapes, as defined by their outlines, are well designed.  
The second meaning of line is an abstract one. It describes the separation between areas of change, when  
objects are aligned, or when the repetition of objects creates visual movement. The line leads our eye from  
one point in the overall design to another, and thus helps to unify the design by bringing various objects  
together. Furthermore, the direction of the abstract line has more subtle, inherent meanings. Horizontal  
lines suggest calmness, vertical lines suggest a potential for movement, and diagonal lines suggest actual  
movement, giving vitality to the design.  
# 2.1.1.4 Texture  
Texture is the surface quality of form. It is always present in three-dimensional space because everything  
has a surface. The term is often misused to refer only to rough surfaces, but it can mean smooth like the  
surface of a mirror, coarse and rough like burlap, or variations in between. Actually, texture can be either  
tactile \(i.e. the actual physical feeling of an object’s surface\) or visual \(i.e. the illusion of a surface’s texture  
in two dimensions, exemplified by the angle of light falling on a surface in a photo\). In special events, we  
deal primarily with tactile texture.  
Two other terms are related to texture. The first is ornament. Ornament is an extension of texture and gives  
visual interest to the form. For example, an ornament may be a single logo on a plate or cup, it may be the  
chrome bumpers on an old 1950s car, or it may be the decorative top of a Corinthian column. If ornament  
is repeated on a surface, it becomes a pattern. It should be noted that an ornament is normally physically  
attached to, and part of, a surface.  
The second term associated with texture is accessory. An accessory is an addition to a form, and is physically  
separate from it, although it could appear to be part of it. For example, it may be a napkin ring, a chair tie,  
or in the case of our 1950s car, simulated leopard skin seat covers.  
In designing events with texture in mind, it is considered good practice to vary textures and hard goods,  
while still keeping within the event color scheme and theme, as with variations in forms. For example,  
variations in linens and soft goods could encompass mixing crushed velvet table covers with smooth  
spandex chair covers. Variations in hard goods could mean using a mixture of metal, wood, stone, and  
plastic, all in the same event.  
# 2.1.1.5 Value and light  
Value is considered to be one of the main elements of design, even though it is related to color. It refers  
to the relative lightness or darkness of a certain area within a space. For an event, this is also related to  
the amount of light in that certain area. Variations in value \(value contrast\) can be used for emphasis \(a  
principle of design\) to create a focal point in a room. Depending on the color and texture of a form in an  
event space, the amount of light thrown on it can also highlight the color contrast of the object against its  
background.  
# 2.1.1.6 Color  
Color, like space, is all around us. It is unquestionably the most powerful design element for event décor.  
Because we deal extensively with color theory in Chapter 5 on Lighting, we will focus our attention in this Décor **57**  
chapter on color meaning and the various color schemes that may be used with décor to create an event  
environment. In doing so, we will demonstrate how color may be used to dramatize an effect, tie a variety  
of objects together, create a subtle understated look, or create a mood.  
2.1.1.6.1 Color meaning  
To fully understand how important color is in event design, one should have a basic knowledge of  
how color affects us as human beings. This enters the realm of design psychology. It affects our bodies  
and it affects our minds, but our culture and sex determine how we interpret it. An examination of  
the meaning of color will assist us in making the correct choices for event color schemes. Here is a  
review of how we interpret colors, courtesy of Color Wheel Pro \(www.color-wheel-pro.com/\), which  
is a software tool that helps one create harmonious color schemes based on color theory \(QSX Software  
Group, 2014\).  
● Red. Red is the color of fire and blood, so it is associated with energy, war, danger, strength, power,  
determination as well as passion, desire, and love. Red is a very emotionally intense color. It enhances  
human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has very high visibility,  
which is why stop signs, stoplights, and fire equipment are usually painted red. This color is also  
commonly associated with energy, so it can be used when an event involves games, cars, items related  
to sports, and high physical activity.  
● Orange. Orange combines the energy of red and the happiness of yellow. It is associated with joy,  
sunshine, and the tropics. Orange represents enthusiasm, fascination, happiness, creativity,  
determination, attraction, success, encouragement, and stimulation. To the human eye, orange is a very  
hot color, so it gives the sensation of heat. Nevertheless, orange is not as aggressive as red. Orange  
increases oxygen supply to the brain, produces an invigorating effect, and stimulates mental activity.  
Orange is the color of fall and harvest. Orange has very high visibility, so it can be used to catch attention  
and highlight the most important elements of design.  
● Yellow. Yellow is the color of sunshine. It is associated with joy, happiness, intellect, and energy. Yellow  
produces a warming effect, arouses cheerfulness, stimulates mental activity, and generates muscle  
energy. Yellow is often associated with food. Bright, pure yellow is an attention-getter, which is  
the reason taxicabs are painted this color. When overused, yellow may have a disturbing effect; it  
is known that babies cry more in yellow rooms. Yellow is seen before other colors when placed  
against black; this combination is often used to issue a warning. Yellow can be used to evoke pleasant,  
cheerful feelings. Yellow is very effective for attracting attention, so it can be used to highlight the most  
important elements of a design. Light yellow tends to disappear into white, so it usually needs a dark  
color to highlight it. Shades of yellow are visually unappealing because they lose cheerfulness and  
become dingy.  
● Green. Green is the color of nature. It symbolizes growth, harmony, freshness, and fertility. Green  
has strong emotional correspondence with safety. Dark green is also commonly associated  
with money. Green has great healing power. It is the most restful color for the human eye; it  
can improve vision. Green suggests stability and endurance. Sometimes green denotes lack of  
experience; for example, a greenhorn is a novice. Green, as opposed to red, means safety; it is the  
color of free passage in road traffic. Green can be used in any event that has a component of nature  
as part of the theme, or with any component that concerns money or wealth, such as the color of  
gaming tables.  
● Blue. Blue is the color of the sky and sea. It is often associated with depth and stability. It symbolizes  
trust, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence, faith, truth, and heaven. Blue is considered  
beneficial to the mind and body. It slows human metabolism and produces a calming effect. Blue is Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**58** strongly associated with tranquility and calmness. It can be used in any event that involves air, sky,  
water, or sea. As opposed to emotionally warm colors like red, orange, and yellow, blue is linked  
to consciousness and intellect. Dark blue is associated with depth, expertise, and stability; it is a  
preferred color for the corporate world. When used together with warm colors like yellow or red, blue  
can create high-impact, vibrant designs; for example, blue-yellow-red is a perfect color scheme for a  
superhero.  
● Purple. Purple combines the stability of blue and the energy of red. Purple is associated with royalty.  
It symbolizes power, nobility, luxury, and ambition. It conveys wealth and extravagance. Purple is  
associated with wisdom, dignity, independence, creativity, mystery, and magic. Purple is a very rare  
color in nature; some people consider it to be artificial. Light purple is a good choice for a feminine  
design in events.  
● White. White is associated with light, goodness, innocence, purity, and virginity. It is considered to be  
the color of perfection. White means safety, purity, and cleanliness. As opposed to black, white usually  
has a positive connotation. White can represent a successful beginning. It can be used for events using  
high-tech or futuristic themes. White is an appropriate color for charitable organizations and hence,  
non-profit events; angels are usually imagined wearing white clothes. It can also be used as a neutral  
color to offset others in an event color scheme. White has a negative connotation in some Asian cultures,  
as it is associated with death.  
● Black. Black is associated with power, elegance, formality, death, evil, and mystery. Black is also  
associated with fear and the unknown \(e.g. black holes\). It usually has a negative connotation \(e.g.  
blacklist, black humor, Black Death\). Black denotes strength and authority; it is considered to be a very  
formal, elegant, and prestigious color \(e.g. black tie, black limousine\). Black gives the feeling of  
perspective and depth, but a black background diminishes readability. Black contrasts well with bright  
colors. Combined with red or orange, other very powerful colors, black gives a very aggressive color  
scheme for an event.  
2.1.1.6.2 Color schemes  
In Chapter 5, we explore color theory in detail, specifically how colors are mixed in the visual color  
wheel \(also called the lighting or RGB \[red, green, and blue\] color wheel\). In this chapter, we will examine  
the pigment color wheel \(also called the mixing color wheel\), and how the colors in it can be used alone  
or in combination to create attractive event color schemes, because most décor is constructed of pigment-  
based materials.  
In traditional color theory, there are three pigment colors \(i.e. colors found in paint and fabrics\)  
that cannot be mixed or formed by any combination of other colors. These are red, yellow, and  
blue, known as primary colors. All other colors are derived from these. Secondary colors are  
formed by mixing the primary colors, and are green, orange, and purple. Tertiary colors are formed  
by mixing the secondary colors and are yellow-orange, red-orange, red-purple, blue-purple, blue-  
green, and yellow-green. All these colors can be represented in a color wheel for pigments, as in  
Figure 2.2 \(left\).  
As opposed to the pigment color wheel, the visual color wheel is based on the primary colors red,  
green, and blue \(RGB\). The RGB primaries are used for computer monitors, cameras, scanners, and  
such. The secondary triad of the visual \(RGB\) wheel is cyan, magenta, and yellow \(CMY\), which is a  
standard in printing. Also, the human eye contains RGB receptors \(QSX Software Group, 2014\), hence  
the name “visual.” Because of this fact, many artists believe that the visual RGB color wheel should  
be used instead of the traditional pigment \(RYB\) wheel to create visual complements, and indeed they Décor **59**  
**Figure 2.2** Color and color schemes  
Images courtesy of\: left—Doug Matthews; right—Blueprint Studios, www.blueprintstudios.com  
are occasionally used in events. However, for the purposes of this chapter we will stick to the pigment  
color wheel.  
Given the color wheel and the meaning of color, we can now proceed to develop specific event color  
schemes. There are six classic color schemes\: monochromatic, analogous, complementary, split  
complementary, triadic, and tetradic \(QSX Software Group, 2014\)\:  
● Monochromatic. In this scheme, one hue is dominant and variations in lightness and darkness of the  
single hue are used. The scheme looks clean and elegant but lacks contrast. It is relatively easy to  
manage, and works well with neutrals such as white or black.  
● Analogous. These are related colors from a pie-shaped section of the color wheel, usually colors  
adjacent to each other. It is always a good idea to strive for one color to be the dominant one and  
allow the others to enrich it. This scheme is relatively easy to create but lacks contrast, although it is  
very rich.  
● Complementary. This scheme uses colors that are complementary or directly opposite each other on the  
color wheel. It offers the highest contrast of any of the color schemes, but is harder to balance than  
others. The best results are achieved by placing warm colors against cool ones.  
● Split complementary. This is a variation of the complementary scheme and uses a single color combined  
with the colors adjacent to its complementary. It provides high contrast but is harder to balance than  
the monochromatic or analogous schemes. It is best to choose a single warm color and place it against  
cool colors. Figure 2.2 \(right\) shows such a scheme using lighting, linens, and chairs. It features gold-  
yellow against magenta and blue-purple.  
● Triadic. Any three hues equally spaced on the color wheel can form a triadic color scheme. This scheme  
looks very balanced and offers strong visual contrast and richness. It is best to choose one color to be  
used in larger amounts than the others and to subdue the use of gaudy colors.  
● Tetradic. This is the richest of all the color schemes. It brings together two pairs of complementary  
colors. While offering more variety, it also is the hardest scheme to balance and for this reason, it is  
recommended that one color be chosen as the dominant one and set against the others. This is about  
as far as most event designers will go in working with color schemes, as anything more can easily  
become an unattractive jumble. **60** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 2.1.2 Principles of design  
While the elements of design are the raw ingredients, the principles of design provide flexible guidelines  
for the effective combination of these elements. Once again, they transcend all artistic disciplines. They  
include proportion, balance, rhythm, emphasis, and harmony.  
# 2.1.2.1 Proportion  
Proportion is the relationship between size and scale. Size is absolute. It is how large—or small—an object  
\(form\) is and is a measurable quantity. Scale is relative. It refers to how small or large an object seems to be  
in relation to the space it occupies. For example, for an event in a large room or outdoors, the décor will need  
to be of very large “size” because the “scale” of the event space is very large. If the ceiling is 50 ft \(15 m\)  
from the floor, a 4 ft \(1.2 m\) high banner will be lost \(i.e. out of proportion\) when suspended from it. This  
vertical height will demand a banner of at least one-third of the total height \(16.7 ft or 5 m, a ratio of 1\:2\)  
to be in good proportion and aesthetically pleasing. Likewise, an overly large décor piece in a very small room  
will be out of proportion because the size of the piece does not match the scale of the event space.  
One interesting aspect of proportion is the golden or divine proportion. This refers to a ratio of sizes between  
two objects that is 1\:1.62. It is represented by the 21st letter of the Greek alphabet, Phi \(Ø\). Although  
adequate explanations are scarce, it turns out to be the most pleasing ratio of sizes used not only in human  
designs but also in the natural world. For example, the ratio of a violin’s neck to the length of the violin  
body is 1\:1.62. The distance between the edge of some butterflies’ wings to the first colored mark compared  
to the distance to the center of its body is 1\:1.62. Figure 2.3 demonstrates this ratio in a comparison of  
simple gray bars. The most aesthetically pleasing one is the one with a ratio of light to dark of 1\:1.62. Good  
art, photography, interior design, and advertising, among others, all recognize this ratio, although  
sometimes not overtly. There is no reason why it cannot be applied to the three-dimensional space of an  
event. Hence, the ideal height for the banner in our example would probably be just over 19 ft \(5.7 m\)  
instead of 16.7 ft \(5 m\), also dependent of course on its width, the readability of its graphics, and the total  
number and placement of other pieces of décor.  
**Figure 2.3** The golden proportion

When working with event décor, some other general rules also apply. When in doubt about the exact  
proportion, oversize almost always impresses. Why? Because having décor larger than the scale demands  
gives the psychological impression that there is more of it, and it is usually easier to take some away than  
to add some at the last minute. Second, for visual variety, it can be more interesting to mix the scale in  
patterns if there will be more than one pattern. For example, large patterns in table overlays could be mixed  
with smaller patterns in chair covers.  
# 2.1.2.2 Balance  
Visual balance is related to the size of objects \(forms\) and also their value, such as lightness or darkness,  
termed visual weight. One part of a design should appear equally weighted or visually balanced with another.  
There are three categories of balance\:  
2.1.2.2.1 symmetrical balance  
This is usually considered to be mirror image balance, meaning that in two dimensions, both sides of the  
design are identical. It can also mean that both sides of a design are equal in terms of numbers, colors, and  
sizes of objects or forms \(Skaalid, 1999\). In three dimensions, symmetrical design is more difficult to  
achieve, particularly in an event space where doors, windows, and other features may prevent perfect  
symmetry. In general, symmetrical balance is more formal and orderly, and “conveys a sense of tranquility,  
familiarity or serious contemplation” \(Howard Bear, 2014\). Typical symmetrical balance at an event would  
refer to both sides—or even four quarters—of a venue being decorated with identical numbers and sizes  
of props in close to similar positions in the space, although the subject matter and material need not be  
the same. Approximately equal color value would also enhance the symmetry.  
2.1.2.2.2 asymmetrical balance  
This is considered to be informal balance. Each design half is different yet appears to be of equal importance  
visually. As Skaalid \(1999\) states, this is achieved when\:  
several smaller items on one side are balanced by a large item on the other side, or smaller items  
are placed further away from the center .  
.  
. than the larger items. One darker item may need to  
be balanced by several lighter items. It is usually harder to achieve \[than symmetrical balance\]  
because the artist must plan the layout very carefully to ensure that it is balanced.  
Sometimes, by intentionally avoiding balance, a designer can “create tension, express movement, or convey  
a mood such as anger, excitement, joy, or casual amusement” \(Howard Bear, 2014\).  
2.1.2.2.3 radial balance  
The third type of balance is radial balance in which all elements radiate out from a center point \(although  
not all designs are exactly circular\). “It is very easy to maintain a focal point in radial balance since all the  
elements lead your eye toward the center” \(Skaalid, 1999\).  
# 2.1.2.3 Rhythm  
Rhythm in design refers to the manner in which one’s eye is drawn into the design. Some designs\:  
move you throughout in a connected, flowing way much like a slow, stately rhythm in music.  
Others move you from one place to another in an abrupt, dynamic way much like a fast, staccato  
rhythm in music will give you the impression of movement.  
\(Skaalid, 1999\) **62** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
Rhythm is produced through repetition and transition\:  
Repetition is the use of the same element more than once. Transition is the relative change in size  
from large to small; the gradation in color from light to dark, from dull to bright, and from color  
to color; and in texture from rough to smooth or coarse to fine.  
\(Adler, 1998\)  
# 2.1.2.4 Emphasis  
Emphasis, also known as dominance, is all about controlling the attention of a viewer. According to Adler  
\(1998\),  
it creates a focal point or center of interest within the design and attracts the eye to a central  
outstanding feature or idea to which all else is subordinate. One kind of line, shape, direction,  
texture, or color needs to dominate or the design falls apart.  
Emphasis is achieved through contrast, placement, or isolation.  
2.1.2.4.1 Contrast  
Contrast can be by color or value \(i.e. lightness or darkness\). Generally, bright colors of the same hue stand  
out more than dull colors \(value\), but different colors that are the same value do not stand out as much  
from each other. Contrast can also be by shape and texture. A single geometric shape, for example, will  
stand out against a backdrop of free-form shapes, a vertical line against horizontal lines, and a silver truss  
grid against a painted wall.  
2.1.2.4.2 placement  
Correct placement of décor in the context of a special event is key to creating a focal point. In the three  
dimensions of a special event, creating one or more focal points becomes a design challenge due to the  
many options available. Let’s look at what can affect the placement of décor to create a focal point\:  
● Type of event. This will be the first determinant in choosing a focal point. For example, if the event is a  
dinner with only dining tables in a room, multiple focal points could be created as spectacular, 8 ft tall  
table centers each individually lit from above. If the event is an awards show with a stage, the main focal  
point will have to be the stage and most effort should go into designing an attractive and practical stage  
set. If the event is a standup reception with multiple buffets, the decorating effort should go into making  
the buffets the focal points in order to attract guests to them, best done by designing very tall and well-  
lit buffet centerpieces. Perhaps it is an interactive event in which there are multiple themed rooms or  
areas. In this case, it would be best to design entrance décor, perhaps in the form of themed vignettes,  
to lead guests to that location. Finally, if it is an outdoor event such as a festival with large crowds spread  
out over a large area, the focal points will necessarily have to be extremely high and well-lit in order to  
act as “beacons” for people to go to them. These might be tents with large banners on top, stages with  
huge graphics over speaker wings, an entrance with a tall arch, and so on.  
● Number of attendees. We have briefly mentioned the necessity of placing décor above the average height  
of a human being in our initial section on space as a design element. Again, this is a factor in designing  
a focal point. Anything that is intended to be a focal point will have to be above this height. One  
interesting exception is that the floor can be a focal point. This can be done by using certain lighting  
effects like gobos or automated lights on the floor, by using a colored light-emitting diode \(LED\) dance floor,  
or by placing actual décor on the floor. Many great designers have used a variety of floor coverings to  
achieve a certain effect. These have included live rose petals for a romantic setting, sawdust for a western Décor **63**  
theme, peanuts for a Cuban-themed restaurant or a baseball theme, leaves for an outdoorsy theme,  
artificial turf for a sports event, sand for a beach theme, and many more. In these cases, the number of  
attendees becomes irrelevant.  
● Budget. If money is tight, there are key areas that, if decorated well, will still make a focal point. In  
approximate order of descending importance, these are\:  
● Stages. If there is no more at an event than a performance stage—or multiple stages—it can be made  
a focal point by the simple placement of a drape or curtain behind it to offset the action onstage from  
the wall or scenery behind. This is often the only focal point for many corporate meetings, conferences,  
and outdoor festivals.  
● Entrances. An appealing entrance gives a good first impression and sets the theme for the entire  
event.  
● Tables. If the event involves a sit-down meal, attractive dining tables can override all other décor as  
a focal point. High, well-lit table centers and well-chosen table linens can draw the eye immediately  
to them. This also applies to buffet tables.  
● Corners. If budget allows after the other key areas have been decorated, then we move to corners  
where décor vignettes can be built out of props or backdrops, then subtly illuminated. These work  
well for themed events.  
● Walls. Now the budget gets bigger. Wall coverings in the form of murals, complete draping, or wide-  
screen projections can form spectacular focal points but are expensive.  
● Ceilings. Finally, ceiling draping, hangings \(e.g. banners or inflatables\), complete coverings, or ceiling  
lighting can be focal points and complement the other décor. They tend to be costly due to the extra  
time and labor involved for installation.  
Once the focal point has been established by placement, what is noticed next as either part of that same  
point, or the next focal point, is governed by proximity, similarity, and continuance \(Saw, 2001\). Proximity  
refers to the fact that near or overlapping objects will generally be seen next. For example, if the main focal  
point is a stage set with a large graphic, the panels surrounding the graphic will be seen next. Similarity  
means that an object that is of the same color, size, and/or shape will be seen after the nearest one. In our  
stage set, if a frame surrounds the graphic and there are other frames surrounding A-V screens, they will  
be seen third. Continuance means that if the primary object points or looks at another object, it can direct  
the viewer’s attention. This could be especially important in the design of multimedia shows. In the case  
of our stage set, if there are two A-V screens with similar frames, the image on one could be used to direct  
the audience’s attention to the second screen, or to any other object on the stage or in the event. See also  
Section 7.5 of Chapter 7 on Set design.  
2.1.2.4.3 isolation  
This is fairly obvious as a method of controlling emphasis. Everyone is acquainted with the giant inflatables  
used for advertising. A giant Elvis on top of a used car dealership is a very obvious example of how isolation  
can work to create a focal point. Similarly, for an outdoor event, a stage strategically placed with no other  
similar stages or décor of comparable size near it will be the focal point.  
# 2.1.2.5 Harmony  
“Harmony is achieved when different forms and colors have a feeling of unity” \(Skaalid, 1999\). In essence,  
for an event it is an almost intangible sense that the design is complete and that all the elements and  
principles have been successfully followed. It is pleasing visually and psychologically. **64** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 2.2 categories of décor  
A successful event designer not only has to know design theory, but must also be intimately familiar with  
the ingredients that can be used to put the theory to practical use and build the design. By this we mean  
the actual décor itself. There are almost endless choices for décor with new inventions added annually. To  
assist with understanding what they are, we will break these choices down into categories and explain  
what each one is and how the types of décor within it can be used.  
# 2.2.1 Backdrops  
In the special event world, backdrops \(also called murals\) are used for theming. By definition, they are often  
used as backdrops for stages \(where they make excellent focal points\) and as decorative murals mounted  
on, or in front of, walls. Because of their size, sometimes measuring over 50 ft \(15 m\) in width and up to  
the ceiling of a venue in height \(i.e. approximately 22 ft or 6.7 m\), they are ideal for creating a total  
surround, themed environment. Realism is often enhanced by the addition of smaller props to extend out  
into the third horizontal dimension in front of the backdrop.  
Although in the past most backdrops were constructed of canvas and the designs used oil-based paint,  
today they are constructed of lightweight, 100 percent polyester and the designs are airbrushed on. In the  
past, the old painted canvas was subject to drying and cracking whereas today’s lightweight polyester  
cotton material with better paints applied can be easily folded and transported without any damage.  
Today’s material also receives fire retardant treatment as standard procedure. Most backdrops are  
constructed with a top sleeve and/or fabric ties that allow for easy suspension on pipe and drape hardware  
\(horizontal poles supported by vertical poles\), trussing, or any other horizontal support available in a  
venue. Some newer themed backdrops are painted onto smaller horizontal sections that can be joined  
together vertically by means of heavy-duty zippers to form larger murals, thus providing flexibility for  
fitting into venues with differing ceiling heights.  
Correct lighting is the key to a backdrop having optimum decorative power. Even lighting over the entire  
surface of the backdrop is recommended to eliminate shadows. Luminaires are best placed well downstage—  
or in front—of the backdrop surface to avoid any burning of the fabric. Figure 2.4 illustrates a fantasy  
backdrop in use as a main décor component of a themed dinner. Note how it creates a total environment  
feel, particularly with the color-coordinated lights and tables.  
# 2.2.2 themed sets  
Set pieces for special events generally mean large décor pieces. Sets have traditionally been designed as  
part of theatrical stage productions, but they have actually been part of special events for centuries. One  
spectacular early event near the beginning of the third century bce was a dinner held in an immense tented  
pavilion in Alexandria, Egypt, and hosted by Pharaoh Ptolemy II. The pavilion was decorated\:  
on either side with beams concealed by tapestries with white stripes draped voluminously about  
them; between the beams were painted panels set in order. Of the columns four were shaped like  
palm trees, but those which stood in the middle had the appearance of Bacchic wands.  
\(The Deipnosophistae of Athenaeus, Book V, trans. 1928\)  
Other parts of the set included gold tunics, silver and gold shields, paintings, 25 ft long gold eagles in the  
ceiling, couches, and much more.  
Indeed, one of the most famous theatrical set designers, turned special event producer, was Leonardo da  
Vinci. He staged many theatrical spectacles for royalty during the Renaissance and was especially adept at  
creating mechanical devices as part of sets. Examples include sets designed as mountains and earth that Décor **65**  
**Figure 2.4** Example of fantasy Alice in Wonderland backdrop  
Photo provided by Backdrops Beautiful®, www.backdropsbeautiful.com  
opened up to reveal hell and a self-propelled, mechanical lion that actually took steps then opened its chest  
to reveal lilies \(Laurenza et al., 2006, pp. 185–187\).  
Shortly after da Vinci died, in 1520 at the famous Field of the Cloth of Gold meeting between Henry VIII  
of England and Francois I of France, theming was very much on display. The English built a temporary  
palace for the occasion,  
in four blocks with a central courtyard, each side over 300 ft long. The only solid part was a  
brick base about 8 ft high. Above the brickwork, the 30 ft walls were made of cloth or canvas  
on timber frames, painted to look like stone or brick; a slanting roof was made of oiled cloth  
painted the color of lead to give the illusion of slates. Contemporaries commented especially on  
the huge expanse of glass, which made visitors feel they were in the open air. Red wine flowed  
from two fountains outside.  
\(Nurse, 2007\)  
Not unlike those of the 16th century and even before, sets today tend to be constructed of wood with  
various adornments such as window frames, signs, mock stairs and doors, or roofs. Although spectacular  
if used in the right space, these sets can be extremely cumbersome to set up, and nowadays they are often  
rejected in favor of lightweight fabric décor, backdrops, lighting, and projection technology. There is,  
however, still a place for them in events such as trade shows and often as spectacular focal points on a  
stage or room entrance. They also work well if setup time is not at a premium, in a large space with high  
ceilings, especially if an element of realism is sought.  
Set pieces are usually constructed of thin wooden plywood sheets affixed to a wood frame \(together called  
flats\), painted realistically on their front surfaces or covered with material, and supported by triangular  
wooden bracing screwed into the frame, upon which sandbags or other weights are placed to hold them  
sturdy and upright. They can also be supported by L-shaped steel brackets, especially good for two-sided  
scenic flats. Part of the difficulty with using sets for special events is that they are large and this can pose **66** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
problems if venue access is difficult or tight, especially freight elevators and hallways where the pieces  
must be carried. As with backdrops, realism may be enhanced by the addition of smaller props in and  
around the larger set. More detail on sets is provided in Chapter 7.  
# 2.2.3 Props  
Prop is a shortened version of the word property and derives from theater terminology, wherein stage  
properties constitute the smaller items that are used by actors in a play. This terminology has also crossed  
into the movie industry as well as special events. In theater, props have traditionally been divided into  
three categories\: set props, hand props, and decorative props.  
Set props are considered to be larger movable items not built into a stage set, such as furniture, floor lamps,  
rugs, stoves, tree stumps, and others \(Gillette, 2000\). We can categorize these items similarly in special  
events but include much larger items such as classic columns, cars, wagons, models, machinery, and others.  
They often are used to embellish large sets or backdrops as described above. In my personal event career, I  
have utilized a great variety of unique large props in events, such as large model trains and airplanes, boats  
of varying sizes, antique cars and hot rods, real race cars, real western buckboards, robots, miniature space  
ships, jukeboxes and pinball machines, and totem poles. Set props, if used correctly, especially authentic  
ones like jukeboxes or antique cars, can become good focal points for an event, often acting as a surprise  
component. They work best when combined with thematically matching large sets as described above \(e.g.  
a western buckboard placed within a false-fronted western street scene\), so that the realism of the scene is  
enhanced. As with backdrops, due to their size and attractiveness, these items demand proper lighting, as  
well as safekeeping and adequate insurance, since many are on loan or rented from private collectors.  
Hand props are smaller items that are literally handled or carried by actors. Decorative props are ones that  
enhance a setting visually but are not actually handled by actors \(Gillette, 2000\). In special events, these  
two categories tend to be lumped together as small props. Sometimes they are handled by guests at the  
event, sometimes they are handled by performers, and sometimes they are pure decoration with nobody  
touching them. Typical small props are such items as mock ice cream sodas and old signs at a 1950s diner,  
surfboards at a beach party, carved masks at a northwest coast native potlatch, a suit of armor at a medieval  
feast, a real ice carving as a table center or as a larger sculpture, or an old movie camera at an Academy  
Awards-type dinner.  
Often, real props cannot be found and replicas must be made or new creations manufactured. Suffice it to  
say that any and all materials are used, including Styrofoam \(e.g. simulating large boulders\), Foamcore  
\(simulating many different shapes in lightweight material\), wood, metal, Plexiglas, rubber \(e.g. knives,  
swords\), and plastic \(e.g. those fake ice cream sodas\). Designers will either make them themselves or sub-  
contract to have them built as required for a specific event. The current thinking in props is that they must  
be very real and purposeful, ideally with an interactive element \(Rothstein-Kramer, 2013\).  
Figure 2.5 illustrates two different prop categories. On the left are several buffet table centers for a Cirque-  
themed event using decorative small props. Note that these centers also provide dramatic focal points in  
the event space. On the right is an example of a large set prop, an Asian archway used as an event entrance.  
# 2.2.4 Furniture  
Not that long ago, the only furniture at an event consisted of dowdy dining and buffet tables in standard  
shapes, and unimaginative dining chairs so ugly that they begged to be covered up. Fortunately, that has  
all changed. Furniture has finally become décor by itself, and much of it begs to be exhibited in its naked  
form, rather than being hidden. There are essentially two main categories of furniture that are used in  
events\: specialty lounge furniture and bars; dining tables and chairs. For purposes of this discussion, office  
furniture will be omitted even though it may sometimes be part of a larger event or trade show. Décor **67**

# 2.2.4.1 Specialty lounge furniture and bars  
The increasing appeal of lounge furniture appears to have come from two directions. On one hand, budget  
crunches resulting from the economic downturn of 2008 “have resulted in a trend away from full-seated  
\[more expensive\] events to hors d’oeuvres and cocktails served in stand-up environments” \(Beurteaux,  
2012\). On the other hand, event organizers seem to have finally realized that many people use such events  
to network, and often to make critical business decisions. To not have enough high and low tables for  
drinks and light food as well as insufficient seating \(as in older event scenarios of the 1990s and early  
2000s\) means unhappy attendees and an unsuccessful networking environment. Using lounge furniture  
also permits an easier division of the event space into different purpose-designed areas, such as networking,  
dinner, and/or dance.  
Almost any style, color, or material is available for easy chairs, ottomans, and sofas, including vintage,  
modern, rustic, and specially themed. Some are also internally lit by LEDs. Tables open up the possibilities  
even more, with traditional coffee and end tables to LED tables in programmable colors being available  
from numerous rental companies now specializing in only event furniture. Most companies also offer a  
wide range of accessories to complement the tables and chairs, including mirrors, cushions, rugs, and  
occasionally florals. Such furniture can thus bring both subtle theming and event colors into the event  
décor mix without a lot of extra cost coming from other props or from extra room lighting.  
Bars and liquor displays have really blossomed as unique décor focal points, especially those using LEDs.  
They can be large, small, or modular for a custom look.  
See Figure 2.6 for examples of modern event lounge furniture.  
# 2.2.4.2 Dining tables and chairs  
Once upon a time in special events . . . there were only four choices for dining tables, and they were all  
round. Events—corporate ones especially—would be held almost exclusively in hotel or conference center  
ballrooms and the catering departments of those hotels and conference centers would own a stock of  
round, foldable dining tables varying from 48 in. \(120 cm\) in diameter to 72 in. \(181 cm\) in diameter and  
capable of comfortably seating between six and ten people. Occasionally, an adventurous event producer  
would attempt the extraordinary and ask for rectangular dining tables, often to be told there were not **68** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 2.6** Examples of event lounge furniture

events.net; bottom—Seventy Event Media Group, www.seventyemg.  
com  
enough for the number of guests. Heaven forbid! It was considered sacrilegious to mix table types, so it  
would be back to the good old rounds. These tables were hideously ugly and had to be covered at the very  
least with unimaginative white table linens, and for the then adventurous producer, occasionally black if  
he or she could scrounge enough linens that looked reasonably similar from various sources.  
Likewise, dining chair choices were limited to the hotel’s vast stock of uncomfortable and almost as ugly  
conference chairs that doubled as dining chairs. Although they usually at least color-matched the hotel’s  
overall décor scheme, they often did not match an event’s décor in any way. That’s about the time that  
spandex chair covers and accompanying chair bows—and spandex table covers—came onto the scene in  
order to make some semblance of a coordinated overall event color scheme.  
Fast forward about 15 or 20 years. The choices now are almost limitless. Although the tried and true dining  
rounds and hotel/conference chairs are still available in abundance, many event producers choose to go Décor **69**  
farther afield and rent dining tables and chairs, as well as linens \(as we will see in the next section\). These  
rental items are much more conducive to creating a personalized, custom event. Flexibility in styles, colors,  
and sizes is becoming the new norm.  
Tables run the gamut of styles, from heavy, period Napoleonic to ultra modern clear Plexiglas with LED-lit  
pedestals. Sizes vary from intimate square tables for four, to large rectangular tables for 14, with rounds  
and ovals covering everything in between. There are even sectional tables that can be made in varying sizes  
and shapes, from a triangle to a hexagon. Except for the clear ones, the tables come in many different  
colors and materials, most of which are designed to be beautiful in their own right and seldom need  
covering up with linens, although many designers still do for the best overall themed look. Oh, yes, and  
now it is no longer considered to be in poor taste to mix table styles and sizes. As long as the main theme  
is maintained, it is much more “progressive thinking.”  
Chairs—at least the rental ones—have undergone a similar transformation in sizes, styles, materials,  
and colors. Wooden Chivari chairs are still popular, but they are now facing strong competition from some  
creative newcomers such as Chameleon Chairs® \(www.chameleonchair.com\) with changeable styles,  
cushions, and covers all designed specifically for that chair line instead of for generic chairs. Even LED-lit  
dining chairs are appearing \(www.cortevents.com\). There is no doubt that many more inventions for chairs  
and tables will appear in the near future. Figure 2.7 illustrates some of these new tables and chairs.

# 2.2.5 linens and napery  
Arguably the category of décor that has revolutionized the appearance of special events more than any  
other over the last 25 years has been fabrics, particularly fabrics associated with dining. Dinner tables with  
stark white tablecloths and practical but ugly chairs have been replaced by free-form structures with  
shapely fabric table and chair covers of every imaginable color and design, creating event venues bursting  
with energy and life. Cavernous convention center halls have now become fantasy environments. The  
choices and uses of different fabrics increase each year.  
Linens and napery include tablecloths, table runners, table overlays, table skirting, chair covers, chair  
sashes or bands, napkins, tray and tray stand covers, and placemats. The options of material, sizes, colors, **70** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
and patterns available are almost endless, making it easy to coordinate a color scheme or event theme. As  
an example, some of the materials available in most of these products include polyester, spandex, cotton,  
damask, crushed velour, satin, lace, burlap, and denim. Prints vary from red and white checks to themes  
of space, sports, stars and stripes, racing, leopard, jungle, and many more. These fabrics are used to cover  
almost every type of table and chair, including round dining and cocktail tables, rectangular dining or buffet  
tables, serpentine tables, regular dining chairs, Chivari chairs, fold-up chairs, and stools. Table 2.1 details  
linen sizes generally required to properly fit the most common table sizes.

For these sizes, note the following\:  
● Table size refers to table diameter in inches for round tables and the width and length in inches for  
rectangular tables.  
● Cloth size refers to the cloth diameter in inches for round tables and the cloth length and width in inches  
for rectangular tables.  
● Drop point refers to the point below the tabletop where the cloth ends, in inches. For rectangular tables  
the points are the drop below the sides followed by the drop below the ends. The formula to find the  
drop point is\:  
Cloth size in inches – Table size in inches  
2  
Table size in inches x 3.1416  
Drop point in inches =  
● Skirting refers to the total length of skirting required to fully skirt the table \(in feet\) with one extra foot  
added for safety. The formula to find the total length is\:  
Length of skirt in feet =  
+ 1  
12  
● Overlay dimensions are in inches and refer to the size of a square overlay \(dimension of a single side\)  
that will at minimum fully cover the table surface. For many, two options of sizes are given, separated  
by a slash.  
One important consideration when working with linens, especially chair covers, is that installation  
can take much more time than expected, particularly if the covers must be individually fitted and if  
the chairs also require the addition of sashes or bands. It should be determined at the outset by the  
designer who will be doing the installation \(and strike\) of these items, either catering staff or decorating  
staff, and the appropriate labor planned. Venues do charge for the installation of linens so costs should be  
compared.  
Care must be taken when handling linens in order to keep them unwrinkled. Normal packing and  
transportation will necessarily result in fold lines. If these are unsightly, then they are best removed  
through steaming, especially if they are synthetics made of polyester or nylon, such as lamés and organzas.  
Sometimes, however, steaming is wasted because most of the linen’s area ends up being covered by  
tableware and the only part of chair covers seen are the backs. Linens do wrinkle when held by a hand  
though, so wait staff in particular need to be made aware.  
See Figure 2.7 for examples of coordinated linens and chairs.  
# 2.2.6 Drapery  
Thanks to an array of sturdy and flexible support hardware, drapery has become commonplace as an  
attractive and inexpensive means to isolate stage areas and to hide equipment and undesirable sections  
of a venue. In addition, drapery fabrics are used extensively in decorating entrances, ceilings, walls, and  
augmenting other décor pieces such as props, furniture, and backdrops. We will examine the main uses  
and types of drapes and materials.  
# 2.2.6.1 Stage draping  
Event managers frequently neglect to consider what a stage presentation will look like when a stage is  
placed against a bare wall. Because the stage is relatively low in height, it tends to get lost against the larger  
area of wall behind it. For this reason, to assist in creating a focal point, placing a simple drape backdrop **72** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
behind the stage can make a tremendous difference. Besides the need for creating a focal point, sight lines  
in a venue often necessitate drapery being used to mask or hide backstage areas and equipment such as  
lighting and A-V equipment. We will cover stage draping in detail in Chapter 7.  
# 2.2.6.2 Room draping  
Drapery is often used to dress up, divide, or hide other areas of an event besides the stage. For example,  
it may be swagged over entrance doors to give a classy appearance when guests arrive, it may divide a trade  
show into separate booth areas, it may hide changing and technical areas, or last but not least, it may be  
suspended from ceiling-mounted piping or trussing to form floor-to-ceiling masking of the entire venue  
walls and the ceiling itself. This drape, in one form or another, plus its associated support hardware, is  
known generically as pipe and drape. There are two main considerations when planning to use pipe and  
drape\: the method of support or hardware, and the type and amount of fabric. Parts of this section have  
come from Whitacre \(2014\).  
2.2.6.2.1 method of support  
The hardware for mounting drape from the ground consists of steel base plates, vertical pipes, and  
horizontal pipes. The horizontal and vertical pipes are usually made of aluminum.  
● Base plates. Base assemblies include a heavy square steel plate with up to nine screw holes into which  
is screwed a short pin over which the vertical pipe is fitted. Base weights vary from 6–62 lb \(2.7 kg–28  
kg\), with the most common being 35 lb \(15.8 kg\) for an 18 in. x 18 in. \(45 cm x 45 cm\) plate. The higher  
weights are used for higher drapes. Pins vary from 4–8 in. \(10–20 cm\), again with the higher ones used  
for higher drapes. Sandbags of 25 lb \(11.3 kg\) are often added to the base assemblies for extra support,  
with two bags necessary for 22 ft \(6.7 m\) high drapes.  
● Vertical pipe. Although some vertical pipes are of fixed height \(typically used for trade shows\), most  
are fully slip-lock adjustable from 3–5 ft \(1.0–1.5 m\) up to 14–26 ft \(4.2–7.8 m\).  
● Horizontal pipe. These are fully adjustable with button click stops and incorporate metal hooks at each  
end that slip into the slotted openings in the vertical pipes \(uprights\). They are capable of holding light  
and heavy fabrics. The rule of thumb is to use a horizontal that is 1 ft \(0.30 m\) less than the desired  
hanging length of drape.  
2.2.6.2.2 fabric  
There is a wide range of options for drape material. The two defining overall categories are opaque and  
non-opaque. Opaque drapes are most often used to mask off room areas like walls or kitchens and are the  
material of choice for stage and A-V draping. They include\:  
● Velour. This is the most common theatrical and event drape. It is a medium weight woven polyester  
fabric that is full of texture, bright with luster, and feels luxurious. It comes in various weights from  
14–25 oz/yd \(396–708 g/m\), the most common being 16 oz \(453 g\). It has a nap so all sections must  
be hung the same way.  
● Encore. Now replacing velour, Encore is a wrinkle-resistant, brushed polyester velour with no nap. Its  
weight is 22 oz/yd \(624 g/m\).  
● Supervel. This is a lightweight, brushed polyester velour with a dappled finish and that comes in vibrant  
colors. It responds very well to up lighting. Its weight is 8 oz/yd \(227 g/m\) and it has the best inherent  
flame retardancy of any fabric. Décor **73**  
● Muslin. Natural Muslin is an un-bleached, lightly woven cotton-like polyester fabric that gives a warm,  
sophisticated, and clean look to any event space. For want of a better description, it is similar to a bed  
sheet—and does wrinkle. The weight is 7 oz/yd \(198 g/m\).  
● Commando Cloth. Also known as Duvetyn \(Duvetyne\), it comes in three weights\: 8 oz, 12 oz, and 16  
oz/yd \(227, 340, 453 g/m\), and is a flame retardant, 100 percent cotton fabric with a brushed matte  
finish. It is used for budget draperies and masking.  
Non-opaque, or semi-transparent, drape is typically cheaper than opaque and often used with opaque drape  
for a layered effect. For example, black Encore or Supervel can be used as a mask for walls and transparent  
sheers can be arranged as an inner layer. If lights are used behind the inner, transparent layer, the effect is  
highly dramatic. Another unique but classy look is the use of swags. Swags are pre-made in order to make  
them look the best and can also be used over the top of an outer layer. The different types of non-opaque  
drape include\:  
● Sheers. For an elegant special effect, polyester sheers may be used alone or as an overlay. Sheers are  
popular for ceiling draping, and they respond well to lighting. This is the lightest of all drape material  
at 3 oz/yd \(85 g/m\).  
● Banjo. This is a lightweight, polyester fabric with a slightly shiny finish, usually used for trade show  
booth dividers. The weight is 7 oz/yd \(198 g/m\) and it comes in many colors.  
● Show Taffeta. Also known as Velon or Show Plastic, taffeta is a budget-driven, waterproof vinyl drapery  
that comes on a roll ready to hang. It has a matte finish with slight texture and perforation between  
drapes. It comes in many colors and can reach heights of 150 ft \(45 m\). Liner coverage helps prevent  
transparency.  
Of critical importance in making drape look its best is the fullness. Fullness adds depth, richness, opacity,  
and improves sound suppression. Fullness is achieved by gathering the drape along its width. A completely  
flat look is 0 percent fullness, often used with Muslin. The most common fullness is 50 percent, so  
that for a 10 ft wide drape, 15 ft of width must be ordered. Thirty percent fullness is weak and 100 percent  
is very rich. This is most often used with lightweight drape such as Show Taffeta or Sheers \(can even  
be up to 200 percent\), and would mean that for a 10 ft wide drape, 20 ft would need to be ordered for  
100 percent fullness.  
The actual hanging of drape is normally achieved using pockets or sleeves sewn into the upper hem of the  
drape. Bottom hems also allow for straightening and flattening some drape such as Muslin. The horizontal  
pipes are inserted through the sleeves and the drape manually gathered along the horizontal pipe to obtain  
the desired fullness. Double horizontal bar setups are also available for layering \(i.e. with inner sheers as  
described above\), as are special clips for extra support.  
Another method of hanging drape is using a theatrical tie-on method. Drape tie methods used may be a  
standard grommet and tie, where the tie and grommet hole are visible unless a clove hitch is used, and  
once tied, the drape ties must be rolled to hide the ties from the audience side of the drape. Blind ties are  
another drape top finish that allows for drapes to be tied to a pipe without the audience seeing the  
grommets and ties \(Pipe and drape, 2014\).  
To complete a theme if budget permits, effective ceiling treatment can be spectacular and swagged draping  
is often the means to accomplish this. Because of the heights and weights, the material used for ceiling  
treatment is usually lightweight sheer, voile, or satin made from 100 percent polyester. The material is  
typically suspended from trussing, piping, or wires that have previously been rigged from ceiling hanging  
points. As a cautionary note, ceiling draping can be very time-consuming and labor-intensive, and also  
must be accomplished while there are no interfering obstacles such as dining tables or chairs underneath. **74** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
This means that it must usually be done before any other equipment or décor has been set up for the event,  
often in the early morning hours.

# 2.2.7 Banners and signs  
Material and printing technologies are now at the point where gigantic, crystal-clear photo reproductions  
and graphics can be printed on a variety of durable materials and suspended from large buildings or other  
structures, both indoors and outdoors, to be viewed from great distances. These are not the old-style  
painted billboards, but superior quality, easy-to-install signage. These banners and signs have become  
commonplace in the special event world as décor and signage at trade shows, exhibitions, sporting events,  
and festivals, not to mention all types of smaller events. We will review the different materials available  
for signs and banners, the methods of printing, the requirements for graphic artwork, and finally, the  
methods of suspension.  
# 2.2.7.1 Materials  
Materials for signs and banners are varied, with some long-lasting fabrics that are suitable for indoor or  
outdoor use, and many flexible or rigid options. All materials used for graphic displays need to be tested  
for fire safety and should come with a fire certificate, especially for fabric prints. The following list is a  
summary of materials, applicable methods of printing, and sizes generally available \(some provided by  
Signable Inc., 2010\), although these can and do change frequently\:  
2.2.7.1.1 specialty fabrics

plastic, and shiny metal surfaces. It sticks to these surfaces without any adhesive and can be removed  
without leaving behind any residue. It is ideal for a variety of graphics, craft, and decorative applications  
such as signs, decals, window graphics, door covering, protective masking and more. Screen or UV  
printing.  
● Vinyl. Economical indoor/outdoor, smooth finish, multiple colors. Up to 16 ft 4 in. wide. Seaming will  
create larger sizes. Comes in different weights. Screen or digital printing, appliqué, hand painting,  
computer-cut vinyl letters or graphics.  
2.2.7.1.3 rigid substrates  
● Acrylic. Also known by the trade name of Plexiglas. Due to the high thermal expansion and contraction  
rate of acrylic, it is best mounted using an extruded aluminum frame \(usually custom made to size\).  
Vinyl may be applied—including translucent vinyls—for backlit signs. Thicknesses vary and sizes range  
from 49 in. x 97 in. \(1.5 m x 2.9 m\) to 75 in. x 100 in. \(2.3 m x 30.3 m\). Some typical uses include  
backlit ground signs, backlit fascia signs, and pylon signs. It is popular in some of the LED furniture  
mentioned in this chapter.  
● Aluminum. Lightweight, durable sheet metal, variety of thicknesses, can be coated to any color. Up to  
5 ft x 10 ft \(1.5 m x 3 m\) sheets. Screen or digital printing, hand painting, computer-cut vinyl letters or

resistant material. It is usually used where the opportunity of breakage is possible. Vinyl may  
be applied—including translucent vinyls—for backlit signs. Polycarbonate comes in white or  
clear. Thicknesses vary and sizes range from 49 in. x 97 in. \(1.5 m x 2.9 m\) to 75 in. x 100 in. \(2.3 m x  
30.3 m\). Some typical uses include backlit ground signs, backlit fascia signs, and pylon signs.  
● Plywood. Durable wood, indoor/outdoor, variety of thicknesses, can be coated to any color. Sometimes  
known as Crezon. Up to 5 ft x 10 ft sheets. Screen or digital printing, hand painting, computer-cut vinyl  
letters or graphics.

This chapter’s Voice of the Industry looks at where décor has come from and where it will be going  
in countries on opposite sides of the globe.  
Leslee Bell founded Décor and More in 1989 and since its inception has successfully cultivated it  
into Canada’s largest and most awarded design and décor company, garnering over 50 national  
and international awards in the process, and employing over 30 people.  
Martin da Costa is recognized as one of the pioneers in the high-end special events industry in  
India. His multi-award-winning company, Seventy emg, with offices in Mumbai and Delhi, pro-  
duces some of the most exclusive weddings, fundraising benefits, luxury brand experiences, and  
festivals in Asia.  
**DM**\: How have you seen décor change over the last five to ten years? Not the flash in the pan hot  
ideas, but the trends with staying power?  
**LB**\: Décor is ever-changing and ever-evolving. After 9-11—and sars for Canada—then with the  
economic recession, the field of décor was hit the most. Over-the-top ostentatious events went to  
streamlined modern, eco-friendly, and urban for anything corporate. The days of hard prop sets Décor **77**

were diminishing and being replaced by a “look” or a “feel” rather than a theme in corporate  
Canada. Our typical Canada Coast to Coast themed dinners, so synonymous with conferences,  
were being replaced by food stations that articulated iconic props in an urban design with the  
chosen medium being ice, or metal, or even sculptured florals.  
Nowadays, experiential is a major buzzword. People not only want to be entertained, but to be  
engaged as part of a performance. Characters—we term “decortainment”—serve as greeters,  
visual sign pieces to an event. If we use a large 15 ft feathered Caribana costumed character, it is  
100 percent décor and 100 percent entertainment, stretching décor dollars for greater roi.  
For corporate, the formal sit-down dinner—unless an awards evening—is being replaced by a  
clubby scene with high volume, soft seating and stroll-about experiential food stations. Within the  
last year spending has been on an upswing. Every party wants their “aha” moments so that guests  
can “Tweet” and “Instagram.”  
Florals over the last ten years have gone from lush and opulent to structural and dramatic. We are  
now doing a melange of both—lots of show but with architectural lines for drama.  
Only recently did we hear so much hype about the pantone shades of the year. With huge social  
media impact and Pinterest and Olio, every home diY \[do-it-yourself\] guru knows about the “in”  
colors of each year.  
Over the last six or seven years, beaded crystal drape, first seen at the Oscars, made its way into  
many events, fashioned into hanging “shimmiliers” \(a form of chandelier made from beaded drape  
with no internal light source\) where projected light dances off them and gives incredible drama.  
Linen suppliers are providing copious choices in texture, finish, bling, and appliqué—with multi  
layering added if budget permits.  
**MdC**\: The Indian marketplace has seen some quite dramatic changes in décor sensibilities over the  
past decade, at least at the top end of the Private Function, Wedding and Special Event business.  
The very large-scale sets based on Rajashtani, Bavarian, and Louis XIV palaces, Bollywood dance  
sets, and temples that we used to design and build on a regular basis are slowly being replaced by **78** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
an emphasis on a gentler, more holistic design aesthetic. The focus these days for the clients at the  
trendy leading edge of the market has been a shift to more understated luxury. As a client from  
one of India’s most powerful industrial houses disarmingly told me a few weeks back, “Everyone  
knows we’re rich. There’s no need to trumpet it at large. Let’s design this wedding so that my  
guests are amazed at the detail at every level—design, hospitality, travel, catering.” One of the  
trends here in India has been to re-locate events out of the major urban centers to destinations  
like Udaipur, Venice, Florence, and Versailles purely in order to take advantage of the architecture  
already present. The implications have been two-fold\: one, absolute numbers of guests at large  
Indian functions have decreased, certainly at the top end of the market; and two, florists, choreog-  
raphers, and set dressers have dramatically increased in importance.  
**DM**\: Have there been unique trends within certain event genres such as weddings, corporate,  
fundraisers, and festivals?  
**LB**\: Weddings \[in Canada\] have not been affected by the economy the way that corporate events  
have, and those companies who had a nice balance between social and corporate fared best.  
Milestone moments like weddings, bar and bat mitzvahs still had either modest or higher budgets  
with the mid-range almost disappearing. Brides or families were justifying the expenditures on a  
“once in a lifetime event,” so even as contracts were signed, more and more last-minute additions  
were the norm. Also, the once elitist event chair has been lowered in price so much it is main-  
stream. Chair accessories have been added, skirts, bustles, cinched lace back sheaths, florals,  
rhinestone buckles are all add-ons for the “dress to impress” chair. In fact in some circles, the chairs  
are better dressed than the guests in them.  
Fundraisers wanted more and more for less and less, advocating great exposure. This is the worst  
reason to invest. \[A décor company should\] invest time and energies into an event because you  
believe in the cause.  
**MdC**\: Indians are stretching their ambitions globally, and are increasingly traveling to destinations  
that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. One of the largest Indian weddings of 2014–15  
took place at a Palace/Fortress deep in the Umbrian countryside for example.  
Clearly though, the trend here is echoing a more generalized, worldwide focus on events that  
fit beautifully into their surroundings. The days of re-imagining a Belgian sports center into a  
Bollywood set with the addition of miles of crenellated plywood battlements and thousands of  
square meters of pink fabric are long gone. Clients are much happier with designing events in and  
around a heritage site or spectacular natural surrounding. In a sense, it is a sign of the growing  
design maturity of luxury Indian clients.  
**DM**\: How do you see décor changing over the next five to ten years?  
**LB**\: Décor is evolving yearly; nothing is stagnant. From a company that still has one of our skills as  
large set and set piece design, we are looking at smaller and smaller element pieces that travel  
well and assemble easily onsite into large sets. With warehouse space at a premium for most  
companies, large oversized sets cannot be stored for years. Either they are a one-time use, or they  
are readily repurposed and built from component pieces that allow for that in their original design.  
Painting on fabric and digital artwork are perfect when clients have multi-city events. This is only  
getting bigger in the industry as technology improves.  
In the last decade, digital mapping has come of age, electro-luminescence, led component walls,  
dance floors, and stages are all front and center. Entertainment in illuminated light costumes or Décor **79**  
sound-activated shirts for wait staff are the perfect countdown for a New Year’s Eve event, taking  
center stage as mixed media form a new product.  
More and more clients want grand reveals, whether a launch, an intro of an MC or President, or  
just the first glimpse of an event space. Exploding walls, mist screens, the lowering down of a  
main stage, smoke, Kabuki drop, fireworks, or traveler draping are all used to create the mystery  
and hype clients want.  
I believe the next ten years will place sound and light as a major “paintbrush” at events, coloring  
and changing the room over and over. A good lighting director will be imperative to the success  
of an event. Depth, motion, mood, and a great vision are all achieved by lighting. What Disney has  
mastered in “digital mapping” will be the direction of lighting going forward.  
We are sitting on the cusp of a new era of design we call “The Chocolate Fluoride Theory,” where  
two diverse designs are played off each other in harmony. Phrases like industrial chic, rustic ele-  
gance, modern country, upscale grunge, or shabby chic are the future of irreverent design, which  
encourages you to understand the rules of design in order to break them . . . break them by juxta-  
posing the right elements for a totally new look.  
What 2025 looks like, none of us know . . . it could look like the 80s revisited, it could look very  
futuristic—almost sci-fi—but whatever it is, it will begin evolving today, kind of like a kaleidoscope,  
and with each turn of the lens a new pattern occurs, and re-occurs with each new shape tumbling  
into place. The key to ever-evolving design is to keep turning the lens and never staying stagnant.  
It will be interesting to hear what people in 2025 think of design in 2015. . . .  
**MdC**\: Technology as décor has existed for some time, certainly in the special events and festivals  
that Seventy emg promotes and designs. In the corporate space \(e.g. launches, conferencing,  
exhibition stand design, etc.\), it has become a staple of the décor aesthetic. Holograms, 3D  
mapping, and \[large\] projection have become commonplace in the work we do. Where the design  
and set have to communicate a specific brand message, technology will continue to dominate  
décor briefs; in the luxury special event space, less so. The emphasis is on a more natural, ambient  
enhancing décor aesthetic, linked to the use of a venue’s innate beauty as the dominant trend in  
India outside of the festival party/corporate space.  
# 2.2.7.2 Printing methods  
Many options exist for getting graphics and photos onto materials. Here is a brief listing and what they  
can do\:  
2.2.7.2.1 digital printing  
Digital printing techniques are generally used for printing short-run graphics, especially banners and signs  
for special events. The three main processes are regular photo printing, inkjet or UV printing, and dye  
sublimation or fabric printing. The assistance of Image Options and the Freddie Georges Production Group  
in California is gratefully acknowledged in compiling the information in this section \(M. Salmon and  
F. Georges, personal communications, February 2006\).  
● Regular photo printing. This uses a traditional style processor to produce photo panels that are then  
laminated with a variety of offerings for finish. Printing with this method requires a high-resolution  
image of 150–300 PPI at full size be provided to the printing company. In order to work with smaller Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**80** files, it is possible to proportionally downsize the file given to the printing company to 300–600 PPI at  
half the final print size. Note that PPI refers to the resolution of a photograph in a digital file, while dots  
per inch \(DPI\) refers to the resolution of a photograph from a printer.  
● Inkjet or UV printing. This method is slightly lower in resolution but costs less for printing large  
graphics. Heated dies with raised images press a thin plastic film carrying colored pigments against the  
paper. The pigments transfer from the film to the paper; heat and pressure assist in the bonding process.  
Using new UV flatbed printers allows graphics to be printed directly onto substrate material instead of  
printing on paper first then laminating and mounting the print onto the substrate, thus saving on labor  
and material. Files for the inkjet print process should be 75–150 PPI.  
● Dye sublimation printing. Sublimation is a process that imprints color on a variety of surfaces using  
heat and pressure. Sublimation is performed by using specially formulated inks printed on paper, and  
then applying the print to receptive surfaces. Unlike screen-printing, the sublimation process produces  
permanent images that will not crack or fade. Dye sublimation is cost efficient and popular for short-run  
customization of fabrics. Special logos, pictures, and designs can easily be created or scanned into the  
computer. Transfer paper can be generated and custom prints finished in a matter of minutes. Files for  
this process should also be 75–150 PPI.  
A fairly recent outgrowth of digital printing is variable-data printing \(VDP\), also known as variable-  
information printing \(VIP or VI\). It is a form of printing in which elements such as text, graphics, and  
images may be changed from one printed piece to the next, without stopping or slowing down the printing  
process and using information from a database or external file. It holds promise for special events in which  
certain graphics must remain on signage while other details change, examples being the changing daily  
schedules of conferences or festivals.  
2.2.7.2.2 screen printing  
Screen printing is a very old process that is the most economical method of producing thousands of images  
from a single one onto a variety of substrates, especially textiles such as nylon, cotton, wool, silk, and  
canvas. Ink is expressed through a stretched fabric mesh by a squeegee blade to reproduce the original  
image onto the substrate below. It is ideal for such things as multiple advertising banners and signs \(e.g.  
for a festival or large public event\).  
2.2.7.2.3 appliqué  
Appliqué is a decorative design made of one material attached to another \(e.g. sewn or glued\). This can  
be very attractive for single designs for special events but does not make sense for large runs of signs or  
banners.  
2.2.7.2.4 hand painting  
Like appliqué, hand-painted designs are great for one-off pieces of decorative artwork, but prohibitively  
expensive for multiple copies. Occasionally, hand-painted designs have made their way into special events,  
especially for such unique items as T-shirts, clothing, or other artwork created by well-known artists as  
part of an event entertainment program or fundraising auction.  
2.2.7.2.5 Computer-cut vinyl  
This refers to small lettering and graphics that are cut out of sheets of vinyl with adhesive on one side,  
using special cutting machinery controlled through a computer interface. These letters or graphics are then  
applied to larger banners or signs of almost any material that will allow them to adhere. Décor **81**  
# 2.2.7.3 General requirements for graphic artwork  
In addition to the resolution sizes mentioned for graphics in the section on printing methods, there are  
several other general requirements that most printing companies have \(M. Salmon and F. Georges, personal  
communications, February, 2006\). Knowing what they are will save time and effort for designers, producers  
and managers\:  
● Vector files \(e.g. file formats for what is known as line art, including logos and geometric shapes, such  
as EPS and SVG\), produced by such software as Adobe Illustrator and Corel Draw, are ideal for large  
format reproductions because they can be scaled to larger sizes without losing any image resolution. In  
other words, one can start out with a small image file and it will be just as good when blown up.  
● Raster files \(e.g. file formats for photographs, such as TIFF, BMP, GIF, and JPEG\), produced by such  
software as Adobe Photoshop, are dependent on resolution and require higher resolution files if the  
image is to be blown up to a large size.  
● Files should be provided with all editable elements, including fonts and actual images.  
● Color references should be included for consistency. This means giving the printing company color  
matching PMS numbers. PMS stands for Pantone Matching System, which designates every color in a  
standardized industry set by a unique number. Alternatively, there should be enough time allowed for  
a proof of all files before final printing is done.  
● Color model. Most printing companies require color images or files to be in the CMYK color format rather  
than the RGB format. “The CMYK color model \(process color, four color\) is a subtractive color model,  
used in color printing, and is also used to describe the printing process itself. CMYK refers to the four  
inks used in some color printing\: cyan, magenta, yellow, and key \(black\). Though it varies by print house,  
press operator, press manufacturer, and press run, ink is typically applied in the order of the abbreviation.  
The ‘K’ in CMYK stands for key because in four-color printing, cyan, magenta, and yellow printing plates  
are carefully keyed, or aligned, with the key of the black key plate. Some sources suggest that the ‘K’ in  
CMYK comes from the last letter in ‘black’ and was chosen because B already means blue. However,  
this explanation, although useful as a mnemonic, is incorrect.  
The CMYK model works by partially or entirely masking colors on a lighter, usually white, background.  
The ink reduces the light that would otherwise be reflected. Such a model is called subtractive \[as  
opposed to the RGB model which is additive—see Section 2.1.1.6.2\] because inks ‘subtract’ brightness  
from white” \(CMYK color model, 2014\).  
● Printed image resolution or DPI must be adjusted for viewing distance. If the originating file resolution  
in PPI is high, usually the resulting printed image will be better, but not always. An 8 ft x 10 ft \(2.4 m  
x 3 m\) image on a wall does not need the same DPI at full size as a 2 ft x 3 ft \(0.6 m x 0.9 m\) image.  
The smaller image will probably be viewed from 1 to 8 ft \(0.3–2.4 m\) away, whereas the larger image  
will probably be viewed from 6 to 25 ft \(1.8 m–7.5 m\) away. A simple formula can be used to determine  
an approximate resolution for the final image as follows\:  
Standard Resolution in DPI = 300/Viewing Distance  
High Resolution in DPI = 600/Viewing Distance  
In other words, if a blown up 8 ft x 10 ft photo will be viewed from a 10 ft distance in a trade show  
booth and the highest resolution possible is needed, the DPI would be 60. A good rule-of-thumb is to  
provide raster \(image\) files at 72 DPI for the final output size.  
# 2.2.7.4 Methods of suspension  
Most fabric banners and signs are constructed with a method of suspension built in. These methods are  
simple and usually consist of one of three types\: a stitched hem with a metallic grommet and hole at **82** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
corners and key points along a hem to allow for rope, wire, plastic, or other ties to be inserted; a series of  
fabric ties stitched to the banner along the top and/or bottom hems to allow the banner to be tied onto a  
support; and a sleeve or pocket stitched to the top and/or bottom hem of the banner to permit horizontal  
support poles such as those used with draping to be inserted.  
Actual suspension mechanisms vary considerably. For larger fabric banners, a horizontal pole inserted in  
the top sleeve of the banner is the preferred method and allows for the easiest installation on large  
structures or from ceilings or trusses. A horizontal pole inserted into a bottom sleeve helps to keep the  
banner hanging straight. Fabric ties are also used. For smaller signs, especially ones made from rigid or  
semi-rigid material, there are a great many different freestanding support bracket and sign holder  
combinations available. Occasionally, male and female Velcro patches placed on the back of signs and on  
the mounting surfaces work well for temporary signage, as do flexible magnets \(e.g. like refrigerator  
magnet material\) on the back of the signs if they will be mounted on metal surfaces.  
# 2.2.8 tension fabric structures  
Since the early 1990s, interior tension fabric structures have revolutionized special events. By definition,  
the fabrics used are stretched \(i.e. tensioned\) into a final shape in one of two ways\: the first is by anchoring  
lines tied on one end to reinforced corners of the fabric and on the other end to an architectural structural  
component such as a wall, ceiling, or floor; the second is by forming around a freestanding or self-forming  
structure made of aluminum, PVC \(polyvinyl chloride, a widely used plastic\), or fiberglass tubing. The  
freestanding structures are supported by vertical poles \(pipe and drape hardware\) that fit into heavy metal  
bases for anchoring. For indoor use, the fabric is typically nylon spandex \(also called Lycra®, or elastane  
in Europe\) that can be cut into limitless shapes, colors, and sizes, and can be imprinted with graphic  
designs \(e.g. advertising, logos, photos\) using a dye sublimation or silkscreen process. Because of the  
nylon, it is stretchable in four directions. Single-color tension fabrics, especially white, are perfect for use  
as projection media for video and multimedia, and for lighting effects, and are so used in many event  
applications.  
Fabric structures are most impressive when well lit. According to Debra Roth of the fabric structure design  
firm, The Originators, and indeed one of the first designers in the industry\:  
the best form of lighting is front and up lighting because it causes the structures to glow. LED  
lights are the standard because of their low cost, battery power, and safer cool operation, and the  
fact that they can safely be used for inner lighting of the structures.  
\(D. Roth, personal communication, June 30, 2014\)  
She also mentions that such structures are coming into their own as photo backdrops. The designs “elicit  
an emotional response . . . \[they\] make people want to take photos precisely because they’re taking images  
worth sharing.”  
Interior tension fabric structures are popular for creative trade show booth design especially with large  
graphics, stage set design, delineating event spaces and pathways, and focal points in an event space.  
Several firms provide both custom design and ready-made shape rentals.  
Figure 2.10 illustrates two different tension fabric structures, one used as a 140 ft tunnel entrance \(note  
the photo being taken\), and the second used as a trade show booth with printed graphics.  
Besides indoor uses, tension fabric structures play a major role in the latest designs of tenting but  
are constructed of more durable, weather-resistant material that we will be discussing in Chapter 8  
on Tents. Décor **83**

# 2.2.9 People and other creatures as décor  
There is nothing that raises the participation level and excitement of an event more than having the action  
amongst the guests. If the guests are the action, or at the very least interact with the action, they feel  
empowered and tend to enjoy the event more than if they are only observers. This is the ultimate in the  
“experiential” concept. One way to do this is by using people as décor. People—and creatures—as décor  
can take three forms\: functional, interactive, and decorative.  
Functional refers to using the actual participants in the event as décor. These include wait staff, bar tenders,  
technical personnel, and guests. It is relatively easy to rent costumes for technical personnel, wait staff,  
and bar tenders. Add guests to the mix of costumed participants and suddenly a venue is transformed into  
a sea of moving decorations. Costuming in this manner has several advantages. First, costuming is relatively  
inexpensive when compared to other décor. Second, even a simple hat can transform the most reticent  
guest into a gregarious personality. Third, setup time is non-existent.  
Interactive refers primarily to entertainment and the different forms that can interact with guests in  
thematic costumes or as special characters. This includes robot characters, strolling celebrity look-alikes,  
magicians, stilt walkers, jugglers, musicians and others in theme costumes, and table acts such as  
caricaturists, graphologists, and fortune tellers who can be in character and costume but interact from a  
fixed position. Figure 2.12 illustrates an interactive performer in a balloon costume.  
Besides people, this category can include other creatures, specifically animals. Until not so long ago, before  
animal rights advocates pushed for changes in municipal laws, animals were a popular highlight of events.  
My company frequently put a variety of live Canadian wild animals on decorative display for guests, such  
as bear cubs, cougars, eagles, moose, and deer, and sometimes more exotic ones like pythons, panthers,  
tigers, and spiders. Two necessary conditions that we always insisted on were that they be properly caged  
or penned for safety and that qualified handlers be present at all times. Although this form of display is  
rare now, if and when it is still possible under the strictest of safe, sanitary, and humane conditions, it can  
represent a unique opportunity for guests to interact with creatures they would never see close up.  
Although we had the occasional sanitary mishap, because precautions were taken, no guests or animals  
were ever harmed. **84** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
Decorative refers again to entertainment but in this case not as interactive. Decorative entertainment is  
there to actually be visual and to be a passive part of the décor. Although the performers may move, they  
generally do not interact. Examples are living statues and performance art.  
# 2.2.10 Floral décor  
Nothing evokes memories or joyful gasps from guests on first entering an event than the scent of fresh  
flowers in bloom. In keeping with the designer’s dictum to use the five senses, nature never fails when  
called upon to assist.  
Many volumes have been written about floral design and many schools and classes exist. Because  
of this, we will not go into detail about floral design in this section. See Malouf \(1999\) and Monroe  
\(2006\) for excellent treatments of this subject. However, we will briefly refer to how and where florals  
may successfully be used in events and review general guidelines for integrating their use into event  
production.  
# 2.2.10.1 Where and how is floral design used?  
Nature has endowed humans with a love of flowers. Our senses of smell and sight react to them in a  
positive way, very seldom negative. For this reason, their use is almost unrestricted, and a special event is  
no exception. For the remarkable, memory-evoking scents mentioned above, real flowers arranged  
creatively and timed to bloom at the event cannot be beaten. Also running a close second visually, but  
without the scent, are silk and artificial flowers. If seasonal flowers are not available and/or if maximum  
impact is required for minimal budget, either a design using all artificial flowers or a combination of real  
and artificial can work well. Also not to be forgotten are other forms of plants categorized with florals,  
such as trees, mosses, grasses, cacti, and vines, all of which can be real or artificial. Armed with this  
knowledge, let’s now look at where and how both these types of florals may be best used.  
2.2.10.1.1 Part of event focal points  
Earlier in the section on design we discussed the principle of emphasis, or creating a focal point, and  
referred to several locations within an event space that would be considered focal points. Some of these  
form perfect settings for the use of florals to achieve this emphasis. These include tables \(dining and  
buffet\), entrances, stages, and corners, or décor vignettes. Floral arrangements placed in these areas will  
be the most obvious.  
● Entrances. Colorful, large, surrounding, and aromatic are the key words when placing florals at entrances.  
Large vases with high, full arrangements and colored but hidden lighting work well. Topiary trees with  
pin lights work, as do many other possibilities. The idea is to be spectacular since the entrance is the  
first impression of the event.  
● Dining tables. For many events in which a meal is served, the dining tables occupy the largest proportion  
of the event space, so to use this space and that above the tables makes sense if visual impact is sought.  
High table centers with a floral component extending as much as 6–10 ft \(1.8–3.0 m\) above the table  
surface can be truly spectacular. Heights should be adjusted to accommodate sight lines for guests if  
they must view a stage or presentation of some sort, as must conversational barriers in the form of lower  
table centers. Usually, a short table center should be under about 1 ft \(30 cm\) in height while tall centers  
can extend much higher as long as their bases are narrow and guests can still see each other across the  
table. Indeed, a long, low center can be just as effective as a tall one—and allow for better sight lines.  
See Figure 2.11 \(top\). Décor **85**  
● Buffet tables. The guidelines for dining tables do not apply to buffet tables. For buffets with a floral  
component, spectacular is the way to go. High, wide, and oversize is best if space permits, because each  
is a focal point. Interestingly, in keeping with today’s emphasis on “green events,” even food is being  
used as décor, especially as centerpieces on buffets and dining tables.  
● Stages. Florals are often used to dress stages. Typical placements are on downstage corners, upstage  
corners, as rows along the downstage edge, as rows along the upstage edge or under a backdrop, in front  
of lecterns, or on the floor in front of the stage. Generally, any of these arrangements should be large  
and oversize as long as they do not obstruct sight lines of the audience. This is because distances to the  
stage are often large and what at the front of a room may appear large will appear very small 200 ft  
\(60 m\) away at the back of the audience. Also, these arrangements are isolated and as such need to be  
large to create an impact and to help focus attention. See Figure 2.11 \(bottom\).

● Corners or décor vignettes. Florals can become part of décor vignettes in isolated locations such as  
corners or smaller themed rooms. Again, scent, color, freshness, and size determine how effective the  
arrangement will be.  
2.2.10.1.2 Total environments  
Probably the ultimate in event design with florals is to completely transform the event space using florals.  
Good event designers can use all three dimensions to do this. Consider the impression created by filling  
the ceiling with hanging vines and subdued lighting for a jungle atmosphere, completely covering the floor  
with rose petals to instill a candlelit dinner with an ambience of romance, or covering the walls with giant  
floral murals. What the designer is really doing is using architecture to advantage, and instead of trying to  
match or coordinate with the room colors or designs, is choosing to ignore the designs and create a totally  
new space.  
Alternatively, if the architectural design is so unique and attractive, it may invite the designer to bring  
florals into it without disturbing the basic aesthetic, but rather augmenting it. I have seen this done in an  
800-year-old Norman cathedral in England in which floral arrangements were creatively worked into  
doorways, windows, pews, and other sections of the cathedral.  
2.2.10.1.3 On people  
The act of wearing flowers has always been an important one for human beings, whether it is as an  
expression of love as with corsages or boutonnieres at weddings, or simply as an expression of individualism  
as in hair bands of the “free love” generation. This begs the question, “Why not more?” Indeed, event  
designers have already been there in some very unusual ways. People can become décor unto themselves  
and florals can be the way to do it. Actors or dancers so costumed can stroll around or be part of a specially  
designed “living garden” concept. Individuals have also been used as buffet table centerpieces and have  
become part fruit or vegetable and part human, the so-called “talking centerpiece.” Combined with props,  
this concept makes for some very interesting approaches.  
# 2.2.10.2 General guidelines for integrating florals with event production  
To successfully integrate floral design with an overall décor design and to accomplish the installation of  
florals at an event in a timely fashion that fits into the production schedule, there are some key points with  
which a producer or event manager should be familiar\:  
● Florals can and should be integrated with any theming in keeping with the event’s overall décor design.  
This is mentioned because the floral supplier is often not the overall event décor designer. Themed props  
and other décor should be considered to be part of the design, whether it is table centers, stage  
arrangements, people as décor, or entrance décor. Props can be added to florals or florals can be added  
to props. For example, this can include using miniature cars in a floral table centerpiece for a racing  
theme, old wine barrels or giant oversized wine bottle props as part of a wine-tasting event integrated  
with a floral vineyard, or adding large classical urns of florals on top of tall Greek columns on a stage at  
an awards ceremony.  
● Sufficient time and space must be allowed for final preparations of florals onsite. This means having a  
room or large vacant area set aside to do the final builds of table centers or the final arranging of large  
pieces. This room should preferably have access to fresh water and be well lit but out of direct sunlight.  
● The floral designer must communicate with the producer, and vice versa, in order to obtain florals that  
match the event design and that can be obtained for optimum freshness in that particular season. This Décor **87**  
communication should include a discussion of the temperature of the event environment in order to  
time the arrival and setup of florals to minimize harm to them. Flowers should be delivered the day of  
the event, a few hours before the start time. They are often one of the last things to be set up, after the  
rush of lighting, room décor, table placement, and linens. Because the temperature of the venue can  
never be predicted, it’s possible that the flowers could wilt quickly once the event begins—although not  
common under normal circumstances—and the freshest flowers possible are required. Fresh out of the  
florist’s cooler or off the design table works best because both situations will help prolong the florals’  
lifespan. An example of a hot venue in which one should be careful about adding florals too soon is a  
summer tent that can get incredibly warm inside. If you can’t avoid the risk of storing the florals before  
the event or even overnight, they must be kept cool \(not cold\) and out of the sun. The venue contact  
person should be asked if they can be kept temporarily in the venue’s empty fridge. Some types of  
flowers will die in the cold, like delicate orchids, but others will appreciate the cold.  
● Static floral designs must be properly illuminated. This can include everything from individually lighting  
table or buffet centers with pin spots or automated fixtures, to subtle hidden ambient lighting of  
entrance or corner vignettes. A meeting of the lighting designer, décor designer, and producer is essential  
to accomplish this. Sufficient space should be allowed on buffets or around vignettes and other  
arrangements to allow for lighting, ideally from overhead using small PAR lamps or remote-controlled  
LED lamps \(see Chapter 5\).  
● Finishing touches are critical to successful florals. Edges and the underneath of floral designs  
have to be finished with embellishments such as moss, grass, sand, or dirt or at least a neat enclosed  
border.  
# 2.2.11 Inflatables  
The term inflatables covers a number of different products\: air- and helium-filled regular latex balloons;  
balloons made out of foil and other materials in regular and odd shapes; reinforced poly air tubes; and  
other oddly shaped blowups made of various materials such as foil, latex, and lamé. Inflatables have been  
a staple of event décor for a long time, and with new concepts coming along regularly, will continue to be.  
We will briefly examine each type of inflatable and how it can be used.  
# 2.2.11.1 Balloons  
The lowly balloon is the grandfather of inflatables. Balloons are ideal as decoration when one wants to  
create a whimsical look, or for any festive event such as a carnival, a life celebration like a birthday and bar  
mitzvah, or a grand opening. Balloons come in every color and style imaginable. Surface finishes include  
metallic foil, jewel tones, solid, and at last count, up to more than 30 types and names, each with at least  
one or more shapes. They can be filled with helium to float or with air to hang. However, recent restrictions  
in the helium supply in the United States have caused helium prices to rise so that most balloon companies  
now do about 90 percent of their balloon décor on pre-built frames using air-filled balloons \(Masori, 2013\).  
The following are some of the most common types used in events\:  
● Animal balloons. These are the long, narrow balloons used by entertainers to create animals, flowers,  
and other sculptures. Also called pencil or twisty balloons, they are made of latex, a form of rubber.  
Animal balloons are used in small sculptures and as embellishments in helium-filled balloon bouquets  
or clusters on tables and around rooms.  
● Foil balloons. Often incorrectly called Mylar \(a trademarked name for a certain type of polyester film\)  
balloons, the balloon industry refers to them as foil balloons because they are made of nylon sheet,  
coated on one side with polyethylene and metallized on the other. They are generally used in bouquets,  
sculptures, or clusters. **88** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
● Giant balloons. This refers to balloons that are greater than about 16 in. \(40 cm\) in diameter. The  
smaller sizes are usually latex, the larger made of vinyl. They are most often used to make a visual  
statement over tables or as the tops to balloon columns.  
● Round balloons. These are the standard latex balloons that are most used in balloon bouquets, arches,  
clusters, and drops. They come in a variety of finishes and diameters. They are often customized by  
imprinting with logos or names.  
● Odd shapes. Other common shapes of latex balloons include\:  
● Airships. Same shape as a blimp but small.  
● Crescent. Shaped like a crescent moon.  
● Flying saucer. A flat, round balloon with a nozzle coming off the edge at an angle. It spins as it  
deflates.  
● Geos. Donut-shaped or flower blossom-shaped.  
● Hearts. Heart-shaped, sometimes made of foil.  
● Knobbies. Long skinny balloons that inflate into a series of bulbous segments, rather like a caterpillar.  
● Link-o-Loons. Type of balloon that has an extra tail on the end so that it can be tied to others in  
chains.  
● Megaloons. Large foil balloons in the shape of numbers and letters.  
● Mouse head. Shaped like a cartoon mouse head.  
Balloons can be used in several novel ways for event décor. The common ones include\:  
● Arches. Arches are built by tying helium-filled round balloons to strong \(e.g. 50 lb\) fishing line and  
weighting the line down at both ends using attractively wrapped bricks or other weights. They can also  
be made using framing and air-filled balloons. Arches can be single balloon or multiple balloon spirals.  
If used with a mixture of colors, the effect of a spiral arch can be quite spectacular. Arches are perfect  
for covering vertical space at an event as a grand entrance or over entire areas of a room or stage.  
Multiple arches of decreasing size on the same vertical plane can be used together to create a backdrop  
or wall cover, or multiples of the same size on a horizontal plane can be spaced to create a tunnel effect.  
The opposite of arches in the form of balloon swags can be created using air-filled balloons suspended  
from the ceiling.  
● Columns. Columns are built of air-filled round balloons supported by an internal PVC frame or of  
freestanding, helium-filled balloons. Most columns are topped with a large helium-filled, giant round  
balloon. As with arches, multiple colors used in a spiral effect works well. Columns are very effective  
in key locations in an event space, such as the edge of dance floors, the corners of rooms, or the corners  
of stages.  
● Clusters or bouquets. These are arrangements of helium-filled round balloons often mixed with some  
of the differently shaped ones, and tied to decorative ribbon, then weighted down. They can also be  
supported by air-filled balloons. They are commonly used as table centers in which they can also  
be mixed with small props, flowers, custom Foamcore cutouts, or fabrics, or they can be stand-alone  
centers themselves. Large bouquets or clusters can be freestanding around a room as well, and of any  
height. They are good for augmenting arches in key locations such as entrances, stages, or dance floors.  
● Ceilings, floors, and walls. Masses of free or structurally supported balloons can be used to cover  
ceilings, floors, or walls.  
● Sculptures. Giant three-dimensional depictions of life-sized machines, buildings, animals, people, logos,  
and artwork constructed entirely of balloons can be impressive. These are often suspended from a ceiling  
or freestanding, and attractively illuminated to act as a décor focal point in an event. They are usually Décor **89**  
constructed out of air-filled round balloons, but can bring in other shapes and types as well. Similar  
two-dimensional art can be used to fill walls and built using a preformed frame and small 5 or 6 in.  
balloons.  
● Balloons as clothing. Very small sculptural balloons are used to create entire dresses. This can be highly  
imaginative and add a wild new dimension to people as décor. Even more interesting is Paintloon. The  
brainchild of fine artist and body painter Bella Volen from Bulgaria and balloon artist and designer Guido  
Verhoef from the Netherlands, it is a combination of fine art, body painting, and balloon sculpting. Using  
latex modeling balloons, objects, and accessories, complete costumes are made that create an extension  
of the body paint or add surfaces for the fine artist to paint on. The body thus fully merges with  
additional parts into one design. If used on a professional dancer then combined with music, this  
creation can bring a unique form of performance art to an event. See Figure 2.12 \(bottom right\).  
For any of the creations listed above, the balloons may be augmented with rope light or pin lights woven  
throughout the bouquets or sculptures, by external illumination, or even by small, battery-powered LED  
lights placed inside some of the balloons.  
Using masses of balloons, certain special effects can be created. These include\:  
● Reveals. This is industry terminology for an effect that hides an object or person and then instantly  
reveals them using a special effect. Balloons can do this in several ways, including\:  
● An exploding wall in which air-filled balloons are arranged close together as a wall supported by  
an internal PVC framework and hiding the person/thing. At the appropriate moment, key balloons  
with small charges in them are exploded and the entire wall instantly falls apart revealing what is  
behind.  
● A floating reveal in which a similar wall of helium-filled balloons is created but anchored to a  
supporting bottom frame. At the key moment, the frame support is loosened and the balloons float  
up to reveal what is behind.  
● Drops. A large number of air-filled balloons is enclosed in a light netting and suspended from a ceiling  
with a length of filament or string coming down to the floor in a key location. At the appropriate time,  
the string is pulled releasing the netting and the balloons fall. Like any special effect, this is best timed  
to emphasize a key point in an event or program. This same effect can also be achieved by building an  
upside down pillar and filling it with small air-filled balloons capped with a giant one. Once the giant  
one is released \(ideally as an exploding balloon\), the insides spill out.  
● Releases. This involves releasing dozens—or even up to thousands—of helium-filled balloons into the  
air at once, usually timed to be a strategic component of an event. Although impressive, due to  
environmental concerns releases have come under severe restrictions. Most municipal authorities have  
special regulations as do aviation authorities. Both would need to be consulted prior to any such release.  
There are several insider tips about balloon décor that every producer and designer should know in order  
to get the most out of the balloons \(L. Jones, personal communication, June 28, 2014\)\:  
● Air-filled balloons are best for long-term displays due to the fact that air molecules are heavier than  
helium and do not escape as rapidly. Air is generally good for up to seven days and helium for 24 h.  
However, a helium retention product called “Hi Float” can be used to coat the inside of helium balloons  
to make them last up to five times longer.  
● Oxidation dulls the outside finish of balloons, particularly jewel tones \(transparent balloons\), so the  
length of display time should also be judged by the appearance of the balloons based on this oxidation.  
If a longer term is needed, a different choice of finishes should be made.  
● Nitrogen makes a good inflation medium as an alternative to air when large quantities of small balloons  
are required. This makes for quick inflation due to the high pressure in the nitrogen tank. **90** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
***2.2.11.2 Airtubes®***  
Invented by Doron Gazit of Air Dimensional Design, Airtubes are long, tubular inflatables, best used when  
an abstract display is needed. They fill visual space very well and can be used to wind around permanent  
or temporary architectural structures, both indoors and outdoors, such as buildings and bridges, scaffolding  
and fences, stages and columns. Airtubes are constructed of heavy, flame-retardant polypropylene and are  
sold in long rolls of flat uninflated material. They must be unrolled and cut to length before installing in  
their uninflated state. One end is then attached to a high-powered, steel-encased, 110 V, 3 amp fan  
that must constantly blow air to keep them inflated, and the other end is sealed. They can remain inflated  
indefinitely. They are available in inflated diameters ranging from 4.5 in. \(11.3 cm\) to almost 18 in.  
\(45 cm\), and multiple colors.  
# 2.2.11.3 Other blowups and air-supported décor  
The ingenuity of inventors combined with strong new materials has resulted in a plethora of different  
inflatable and air-supported products that can be used for event décor. One such inventor, Ashley Ramage,  
president of UK and San Francisco-based Blowupthings, takes a distinctly refreshing approach to the design  
of events using inflatables. Because of the ability of inflatables to do so much with so little, he likes to take  
an event space and use it to “enhance, conceal, or distract, and also to arrest people’s sensibilities; in other  
words, make them stop and think” \(A. Ramage, personal communication, March 28, 2006\). He has made  
walls, suspended décor, stage backdrops, and trade show booths out of unique, customized inflatables and  
is on the cutting edge of this expanding category of décor. His and most of the other new inflatables also  
coming from inventors such as Gazit are made of lightweight fabrics other than latex, such as rip stop  
nylon, and most require an electric-powered, low voltage fan to keep them inflated, and/or at least one  
external suspension point. Some of these exciting products include\:  
● Architectural pieces such as stage backdrops, entranceways, and trade show booths for indoor use.  
● Giant portable movie screens as large as 100 ft x 45 ft \(30 x 13.5 m\) for outdoor use.  
● Smaller air- or helium-filled abstract shapes for hanging or mounting on the ground. Many are lit  
internally for extra attention.  
● Wearable inflatable products to permit a human interactive component to be added. Some are not  
wearable but are guidable by humans because they are so large \(e.g. a full-sized parading elephant,  
http\://spacecadets.com\). Some are strictly for fun like inflatable ball suits, similar to the older sumo  
wrestling suits, and some are just decorative.  
● Wind-movable products such as Fly Guys®, another invention from Gazit of Air Dimensional Design,  
that come in heights up to 60 ft \(18 m\) and require two fans to keep inflated and moving. Note that  
they need to have dry weather if used outdoors.  
See Figure 2.12 for examples of unusual inflatable décor.  
# 2.2.12 Technology as décor  
Similar to what was explained in Chapter 1 about technology as entertainment, mobile and other technology  
is playing a major role in re-shaping what we think of as event décor. Advances are happening quickly and  
new ideas surface every year. Here are some that are potentially destined for greater things\:  
● The use of large screen projection to create an atmosphere for an event in the form of still images  
\(photos\) or video that cover entire walls. There will be more about this in Chapter 4. See Figure 2.6,  
which also includes a wide-screen projection covering an entire wall. Décor **91**

blowupthings.com; bottom right—Bella Volen, www.bella-volen.com  
● The creation of an artistic iPad “wall” in which individual attendees contribute to a physical wall of iPads  
to build a single image \(www.magencydigital.com\), a new consideration for event décor.  
● The projection of drawings and designs from attendee smartphones or tablets onto a café wall or  
other projection surface \(http\://buzzy.io\), again a possible component of event décor once further  
developed.  
● Interactive wallpaper that can be programmed to monitor its environment and control lighting and  
sound. A hand can be run across this wallpaper to turn on a lamp, play music, or send a message to a  
friend. The wallpaper is flat, constructed entirely from paper and paint and can be paired with a paper Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**92** computing kit whose pieces serve as sensors, lamps, network interfaces, and interactive decorations  
\(http\://highlowtech.org/?p=27\).  
● The use of mobile devices \(smartphones, tablets\) to control event elements. Even now, smartphones  
are being used to control lighting. As illustrated in Chapter 3 of Special Event Production\: The Process, the  
unique aerial sculptures of Janet Echelman are designed to be illuminated by lighting controlled by  
audience smartphones.  
And these are just the beginning . . .  
# P r od u c t i o n Wa r S t o ry  
# A premature surprise  
A beautiful and highly creative balloon wall was installed in front of the band stage that  
would magically burst and reveal the band once it was time to dance. It would be an incredible  
ending to an evening of good food, fun, and camaraderie. Unfortunately, someone forgot to tell  
Mother Nature. The room was fully encircled by floor-to-ceiling windows looking out to the west  
and this event was held late in June near the day when sunlight lasted until very late in the evening.  
The event day was quite hot and the sunlight beamed through the windows, eventually making  
its way to shine on the balloon wall. Just as dinner was underway, we heard the first explosion,  
followed in fairly rapid succession over the course of the next 20 minutes by a periodic, unrehearsed  
exploding balloon wall that was soon left in tatters, ragged pieces of balloons hanging from the  
wall supports like broken flesh. Although somewhat comical while happening, this premature  
balloon wall explosion did not make our client very happy. The balloon experts were called in  
and the remaining pieces of the wall were dismantled to leave a clean look, but the damage had  
been done.  
In this case, communication with the client was immediate and consisted of an apology and an  
explanation. This was a situation that could only be described as a true Act of God. It may have  
been avoidable but we were never sure exactly how. During the site inspection days before, the  
weather was cloudy and an estimate was made of exactly where the sun would be at a certain  
time and whether it would strike the balloon wall. This was only a guess and even with this,  
nobody—even the balloon experts—expected or anticipated that the sunlight would overheat the  
balloons and their tethers, which we could only surmise expanded at different rates and caused the  
premature explosions. The client was not charged a penny for the wall and seemed to be happy  
with that settlement, but nothing could bring back the planned excitement that had been lost.  
What lessons were learned? This was a difficult case. The most obvious one that we learned was  
not to use a balloon wall or any balloon structure in situations where weather—or excessive heating  
or cooling of any sort—could be a factor.

# 2.2.13 Other unique décor  
Every year, someone invents a new type of décor that does not fit within the categories laid out in this  
book, so more than likely we will not have covered it all. However, in an attempt to bring it all in, here are  
some other categories that do not fit the traditional mold. Décor **93**  
# 2.2.13.1 Nature as décor  
The ancient world was considered to be composed of the elements earth, air, fire, and water. Special event  
designers still use these elements in various ways. Fire is still popular in the form of candles or as  
entertainment. Earth and sand are sometimes used in floral displays or artificial beaches. Water is used for  
florals and sometimes in special displays for boats and in the form of ice carvings. All of it can enhance  
any event if used properly. However, some cautions pertaining to risk management are in order\:  
● Candles, especially tall ones, tend to drip wax and should never be used in a drafty room. Furthermore,  
all flammable material in close proximity should be treated with flame retardant or the candles should  
not be used at all. Tall candles on candelabra are particularly susceptible to drafts and if flame is used,  
it should be sustained by gas and not the candle itself. Many events have moved away from real flame  
candles to battery-operated ones.  
● Earth or sand, especially in large quantities such as for an indoor artificial beach and beach volleyball  
games, can be a nightmare for venue staff to clean up. It almost always requires several large dump  
trucks full of sand to provide enough. The event will likely be a big success providing arrangements have  
been made for cleanup before the event is finalized.  
● Ice carvings are spectacular when sculpted by a master. There are even companies that carve to music  
as a form of entertainment. Carvings can be used as food dishes, bars, table centers, buffet centers, and  
just plain décor focal points. The cost usually depends on the size, which is governed by the number of  
standard ice blocks that will be used. They must be delivered just before the event begins and will last  
at least 2 h or so and still look good. However, they do require proper lighting and proper drainage,  
whether it is a small tray placed beneath a table center or larger trays on a buffet for a giant ice carving.  
For ponds and other water displays, tarpaulins or waterproof ground sheets should be used as well as  
leak-proof containers.  
# 2.2.13.2 Other sensory décor  
Up to this point, we have mostly concentrated on only two of our senses, sight and touch. A successful  
event will encompass all the senses if possible, and that is where other sensory décor comes in. Apart from  
food \(our sense of taste\), which is usually the purview of catering, there are two other senses we need to  
think about.  
2.2.13.2.1 Smell  
The Proust effect, or Proustian memory, named after French author Marcel Proust who first described it  
in writing in the early 1900s, is the phenomenon of a particular smell or odor bringing a memory to mind.  
It has been proven that the part of our brain that handles memory is the same part that interprets smells,  
so we have a built-in link. Thus, smell is a very powerful sense and one that can lead directly to an  
emotional interpretation of time and place. It has not been used to its full potential as part of special event  
décor, but the tools are available to use it.  
Certainly, the catering side of an event uses appropriate food choices to stimulate our olfactory receptors,  
but artificial scents are also available to help. There are several companies that provide different scents to  
retailers to stimulate sales, and to events to create sensory environments. For example, North Carolina-based  
ScentAir offers over 1,000 scents ranging from environmental ones like ocean, rain, sagebrush, and redwood  
forest, to exotic and unusual ones such as musty, oily machinery, and dinosaur breath. They are delivered  
using a dry-air technology that releases a fragrance from undetectable locations such as ceilings, without  
sprays, aerosols, or heated oils. A single scent delivery system is very small, operates on adapted 110 VAC,  
covers up to 4,000 ft2 of space, and even includes a motion sensor. A scent cartridge lasts up to 300 h. **94** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
2.2.13.2.2 Hearing  
Several authors talk about soundscaping for events \(Goldblatt, 2014; Rutherford-Silvers, 2012\) and how it  
adds to the experience of being encompassed by a total environment. Put simply, soundscaping is the  
ability to control the aural environment at an event. Certainly, there are event sounds that cannot be  
controlled such as people \(talking, eating, moving, etc.\), but other ambient sounds can be. It is included  
in this section because it should be considered as part of the event designer’s arsenal of décor options.  
There are two main ways to control the aural environment\: live sound, such as musical groups or people  
making real-time sounds through an audio system, and recorded sound. It’s easy to say to the audio  
engineer, “Just put on some mellow walk-in music” or “Crank up the volume when they start dancing.”  
This is not soundscaping and it is far from properly controlling the aural environment. Successful control  
considers timing, volume, and content, and often must be coordinated with other resources such as  
lighting and catering.  
Timing means that a conscious effort has to be made to change the ambient sounds at pre-determined  
moments at an event. For example, a popular form of entertainment for convention opening ceremonies  
in Vancouver has been a West Coast Native Talking Stick Ceremony, and our company produced many.  
During walk-in, we would carefully choose appropriate new age music with an environmental flavor such  
as flutes with light drumming at a low volume to set the mood, then at the start of the ceremony, we would  
dim all the house lights and initiate a grand entrance with the room dark and only the sound of crashing  
thunder and the rain forest for ambience. The thunder was at a volume high enough to shake the floor,  
thus creating a realistic feel, and demonstrating the power of dramatically changing volume at a precise  
moment to gain attention.  
Volume is also important when sounds are being played in the background to only create ambience. Many  
events have been ruined because volume was not controlled. Whether it is the sound of ships’ foghorns  
set amongst a rolling fog and a gangplank at an event entrance, or a live quartet playing background jazz,  
either one could be too high or too low to be effective if not continuously monitored. It is necessary to  
monitor guest reactions to background sounds by physically being where the sounds are. The audio  
engineer or producer has to literally go to the entrance or walk amongst the diners to see if people can  
hear or are complaining about volume. People-watching is critical to successful soundscaping.  
Content, as we have discussed in Chapter 1, is arguably the most powerful variable in generating emotional  
and physical reaction to entertainment. This is where many producers do not take enough time to consider  
what the effect of sound will be. This is particularly true of background music or other sounds. Let us take  
an example of a sports-themed event in which guests walk around to different themed rooms to participate  
in activities and partake of different foods. Consider a “baseball room.” What would be more conducive  
to an exciting and emotional reaction in that room, background rock music or playback of a live radio  
broadcast of a world series winning game, complete with play-by-play action and the sound of the cheering  
crowd? If you had been watching that game 20 years ago, wouldn’t the radio broadcast bring back more

# 2.3 considerations for the setup and strike of décor  
Setting up or installing décor can be a stressful undertaking, not only for the designer but also for the event  
producer who must coordinate with venue staff and other suppliers. There are literally hundreds of details  
that have to be considered and probably equally as many things that can go wrong. Of course, every event  
and every type of décor presents unique problems and challenges, so it is virtually impossible to predict  
or list every one. Throughout setup, however, constant monitoring for potential risks and safety hazards  
is essential. Although there are no specific safety or design standards for décor, many venues have a number Décor **95**  
of restrictions on what can and cannot be done. Monroe \(2006, pp. 104–105, 109, 133, 174–175\) outlines  
several potential risk areas for the various types of décor, such as structural stability, flame retardancy, and  
toxicity. Producers should be fully aware of all restrictions on décor and of all potential risk by thoroughly  
reviewing the event décor plan with the designer. Here are some of the general considerations necessary  
prior to and at the event\:  
# 2.3.1 Prior to the event  
These happen from the moment the event is being considered right up until move-in, and include safety  
and risk concerns\:  
● A preliminary site inspection should be made by the producer and designer to ascertain\:  
● Load-in access from the loading dock to the event space, including exact measurements of the freight  
elevator if there is one, sizes and lengths of any connecting corridors, door sizes, timing restrictions  
to movement of décor caused by necessity to go through public areas.  
● Accessibility of the actual loading dock, including size and number of docks, whether there is a ramp,  
parking restrictions for trucks and/or parking areas.  
● The number, location, and load rating of ceiling hanging points in the event space if rigging and  
suspended décor will be used.  
● The location\(s\) and rating of house power in volts and amps, plus which outlets are on which circuits.  
● The location of doors and windows and any effect daylight might have on event décor and lighting.  
● The exact measurements of the event space and preliminary locations for décor placement, and if a  
scaled floor plan is available that may be translated into CADD \(computer-aided design and drafting\).  
● Whether there will be any stages, tables, dance floors, or other furniture in the space, plus the  
planned number and sizes of everything.  
● Who will be responsible for providing ladders or scissor lifts and qualified operators.  
● Any restrictions on scheduling caused by other activities in the same or adjoining space, including  
noise restrictions.  
● Any restrictions on nailing, screwing, or otherwise affixing décor to venue property.  
● Any pertinent restrictions relating to fire and the flammability of décor.  
● Requirements for cleanup before and after the event and whether it will be done by contracted  
decorators or by venue staff.  
● Existing venue color scheme and whether it must be covered or can be worked into the event color  
scheme.  
● Availability of dedicated preparation areas or rooms for décor staff such as florists.  
● Availability of a crew break area and availability and cost of refreshments.  
● Planned setup schedule for venue staff such as power tie-in, stage setup, and table placement.  
● Any restrictions from the venue for strike of décor after the event, including loading dock accessibility,  
noise, or staff assistance.  
● The designer should create a preliminary décor design plus a rough floor plan using the venue information  
and all the resources necessary, and/or incorporate the rough plan into the overall floor/site plan on  
CADD.  
● The designer should create a setup schedule of deliveries and timing for all suppliers that should be  
reviewed by the producer for integration into the overall production schedule and for possible cost  
savings by using existing suppliers such as lighting who can light décor as well as stages. **96** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
● The designer should calculate staff needs for setup and strike based on the approved schedule ensuring  
that sufficient staff plus a contingency factor are included.  
● The designer should review and plan for all necessary tools, including portable electric saw, screw gun  
and electric drill and selection of drill bits, duct tape in a variety of colors, 50 ft \(15 m\) measuring tape,  
hammers, variety of nails and screws, glue gun and glue, zap straps, pencils, paper, and paint, brushes,  
and cleaner if onsite painting is to be done. If sets and hard props form a large part of the décor, it can  
be useful to have a carpenter onsite for last-minute changes.  
● The designer should arrange for all transportation for setup and strike.  
● The designer and producer should review safety procedures and risk, including\:  
● Any setup or strike procedures that could incur a risk or injury to workers, event staff, clients, or  
venue staff and ensure all involved are aware of the hazards.  
● Safety attire \(e.g. steel-toed boots, hard hats, gloves, safety vests\) and that it will be used by setup  
and strike personnel as required.  
● Flame retardancy rating of all materials.  
● Support mechanisms for all décor and whether they will adequately and safely carry the weight of  
that décor.  
● Qualifications for equipment operation if designer personnel will be operating it, such as scissor lifts.  
● All WCB \(Workers’ Compensation Board\) certificates are current and payments are up to date.  
# 2.3.2 at the event  
These happen during onsite setup and strike\:  
● The producer and designer continuously monitor all work for safety, risks, and adherence to regulations.  
● The producer and designer continuously monitor setup schedule and liaise with venue staff immediately  
to overcome problems as they arise.  
● The producer and designer ensure all décor setup is coordinated with other suppliers such as lighting  
and A-V to ensure they can work around each other and that their components fit the décor as planned  
\(e.g. lighting décor\).  
● The designer should ensure finishing touches are applied to all décor elements, such as\:  
● Edges of floral displays are finished with moss or grass or edging.  
● Any battery-operated equipment has new batteries.  
● All electrical cords for décor are taped down safely, preferably using duct tape in the color of the venue  
carpet or floor.  
● All electrical hazards such as lights close to flammable material are moved to safety.  
● Any support mechanisms for large décor such as pipe and drape hardware for backdrops or wooden  
bracing for set pieces is hidden by other décor, specially manufactured returns, or drapes.  
● The producer and designer together should conduct a final “idiot check” at least 1 h prior to the  
event commencing to ensure there are no safety hazards and all décor as planned and contracted is  
in place.  
# 2.3.3 after the event  
Mention must be made at this point of the importance to plan for décor strike after the event. This is a  
time, usually very late at night, when many problems occur, often unseen by either the producer or the Décor **97**  
designer as new crews are in place to accomplish the strike. For this reason it is absolutely necessary for  
the designer and producer to do the following\:  
● Establish crew call times for strike.  
● Assign a supervisor for strike.  
● Give special instructions about the handling of all décor and the exit routing out of the venue.  
● Provide the supervisor with venue and client contact information. This will ensure that the strike is  
smooth and coordinated.  
# p r od u c t i o n c h a l l e n g es  
**1.** You have a client who wants you to produce an event in which the venue is completely trans-  
formed into a jungle. Suggest three different ways to cover the walls, including methods of  
support or mounting for the décor.  
**2.** You and your designer are having a debate about which color scheme will best combine richness  
and high contrast for an event. What would be your choices as the best two schemes and why?  
Which would be easier to coordinate?  
**3.** You and an event designer are brainstorming ideas for table centers for a theme of “The Old  
West Meets the 21st Century.” What are three different types or combinations of types of décor  
that could be used to depict this theme? How high would you make the table centers if the  
diners will be watching a stage show and how high if they will only be eating dinner followed  
by dancing to a DJ?  
**4.** You are attending an initial meeting with a potential client who wants a 1980s Rock and Roll  
event. Describe some specific creative décor for her that would appeal to all five senses and  
would sell her on using your company to produce the event.  
**5.** Give ten items that should be discussed with a venue manager before proceeding to organize  
the décor setup for an event, and explain why they must be agreed upon and finalized ahead  
of time.

# Audio systems  
# l e a r n i n g o u t c o m es  
After reading this chapter you will be able to\:  
**1.** Explain how the acoustics of an event space affect the quality of sound produced by an audio  
system.  
**2.** Understand the primary uses of an audio system for special events.  
**3.** Understand and be able to explain the general working of the main groups of equipment in a  
special event audio system and the components within these groups.  
**4.** Know where in an event space the groups of audio equipment are normally located.  
**5.** Understand the reason for an audio sound check and what it entails at an event.  
Whenever an event has more than a bare minimum number of people in a small room \(e.g. 100 people  
maximum, probably far fewer!\), there will be a requirement for sound reinforcement in order that any  
speeches or entertainment can be heard. Poor sound quality can be catastrophic for an event, especially if  
an important speech cannot be understood or a high-cost celebrity artist’s sound mix is totally inadequate.  
Audio systems and their design tend to be one of several technical areas of specialization within the events  
industry that event planners and managers prefer to leave to the experts, often relying on the event  
producer to oversee the installation and operation of the systems. For that reason, the producer must  
understand the basic theory and functioning of these systems so that the optimum system can be designed  
for a specific event, and the best return-on-investment \(ROI\) made. This chapter will therefore explore  
the following key topics\:  
● Basic acoustic theory and how it is applied to the event space.  
● Uses of an audio system.  
● Main audio system groups, their components, and their basic theory of operation. **100** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
● Signal flow and equipment locations within the event space.  
● The pre-event sound check and system operation during the event.  
● Risk and safety.

# 3.1 acoustic theory and its application to the event space  
In order to understand why music or the spoken word can either be well heard or completely unintelligible,  
we must first understand the part that acoustics play in a venue and how they react to the room’s  
architecture.  
# 3.1.1 What is sound?  
Sound is produced by vibrating objects such as musical instruments, loudspeakers, and human vocal cords.  
These vibrations in turn produce pressure variations in the air immediately adjacent to the object, which  
cause a wave effect of high and low pressure much like a wave in water. This is a sound wave and it travels  
through the air exactly like a wave in water, radiating outward from the sound source. A complete wave is  
a complete pressure change, or cycle, and takes the air pressure from rest, to maximum, to minimum, and  
back to rest again. Figure 3.1 shows how a wave forms alternating regions of rarefaction and compression  
as it radiates.  
There are several important characteristics of sound waves that one needs to know in order to understand  
the basics of an audio system. They are frequency, wavelength, and loudness. The following explanations  
**Figure 3.1** Sound wave causing a change in air pressure  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews Audio systems **101**  
of these characteristics, unless otherwise noted, are provided by Shure Inc. and used with permission  
\(Vear, 2011a\).  
# 3.1.1.1 Frequency  
The frequency of a sound wave indicates the rate at which the sound pressure changes occur. It is measured  
in Hertz \(Hz\) or cycles per second, where 1 Hz equals 1 cycle per second. As an example, human hearing  
extends from about 20 Hz \(very low sounds\) to about 20,000 Hz or 20 kHz \(very high sounds\).  
# 3.1.1.2 Wavelength  
The wavelength of a sound is the physical distance from the start of one cycle to the start of the next cycle.  
Wavelength is related to frequency by the speed of sound, which at sea level is approximately 1,130 ft/s  
or 344 m/s. The following formula shows this relationship\:  
Speed of sound  
Wavelength =  
Frequency  
For example, for a 500 Hz sound source, such as the upper ranges of a tenor voice, the upper range of a  
tenor saxophone, or the middle to low range of a flute, the wavelength is 2.2 ft \(i.e. 1,130 ft/s divided by  
500 cycles per second\). Of course, any particular frequency will have a unique corresponding wavelength.  
Table 3.1 gives some more examples of common frequencies and their corresponding wavelengths.  
This relationship is important to know because shortly we will be discussing what happens when sound  
waves of certain lengths hit objects of a certain size.  
**Table 3.1** sample of wavelengths at different frequencies  
# Frequency \(Hz\) Wavelength  
50 About 23 ft or almost 7 m \(low range of a bass drum\)  
100 About 10 ft or 3 m \(low range of a tenor saxophone, mid range of a bass drum,  
low range of a bass male voice\)  
1000 About 1 ft or .3 m \(upper range of a female soprano voice or mid-range of a  
flute and violin\)  
10,000 About 1 in. or 2.5 cm \(the very highest notes of a pipe organ\)  
Courtesy of Shure Inc.  
# 3.1.1.3 Loudness  
The loudness of a sound is directly related to the variation of air pressure, or in other words, the amplitude  
of the sound. The greater the pressure change or amplitude, the louder the sound. Loudness is commonly  
measured in decibels Sound Pressure Level \(dB SPL\); 0 dB is the threshold of hearing and at the other extreme,  
120 dB is the threshold of pain. A loud rock band heard from 10 ft away is in the 110 to 120 dB range of  
loudness, and a quiet whisper is around 30 dB. Most special event environments are in the 80–110 dB  
range of loudness.  
An additional property of direct sound is that it becomes weaker as it travels away from the sound source,  
at a rate governed by the inverse-square law. For example, when the distance increases by a factor of two **102** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
\(doubles\), the sound level decreases by a factor of four \(the square of two\). This corresponds to a drop of  
6 dB in sound pressure level, which is a substantial decrease. In contrast, ambient sound, such as noise  
and reverberation, is at a constant level everywhere in the space. Therefore, at a given distance from  
a sound source, a listener \(or a microphone\) will pick up a certain proportion of direct sound to ambient  
sound. As the distance increases, the direct sound level decreases while the ambient sound level stays the  
same \(Lyons et al., 2008\). A properly designed sound system can increase the amount of direct sound  
reaching the listener without increasing the ambient sound significantly as we will see later in this chapter.  
# 3.1.2 Sound propagation and its relationship to the event space  
Now that we know how sound waves are generated and travel through the air, the next thing to understand  
is that sound can actually be altered by its environment as it travels. There are four basic ways that this  
can happen\: reflection, absorption, diffraction, and refraction. Let us examine each of them and relate them  
to the environment of a special event.  
# 3.1.2.1 Reflection  
A sound wave can be reflected by a surface or other object if the object is physically as large as, or larger  
than, the wavelength of the sound. The reflected sound will have a different characteristic than the direct  
sound if all frequencies are not reflected equally.  
Reflection is also the source of echo, reverberation, and standing waves. Echo occurs when a reflected sound  
is delayed long enough \(i.e. by a distant reflective surface\) to be heard by the listener as a distinct repetition  
of the direct sound. Considering the typical indoor special event environment, all but the very lowest  
frequencies \(e.g. a bass drum\) will normally be reflected by a room’s walls and ceiling. If the room is a  
large one, such as in some conference centers, there may even be an obvious echo, particularly of low  
frequency sounds. Important to note, though, is that higher frequency sounds can be reflected by a lot  
more hard surfaces than the low frequency sounds. For example, again in our special event room, even  
dining tables, chairs, staging, and some items of décor will reflect higher frequencies, such as the human  
voice, or the high notes of instruments.  
Reverberation consists of many reflections of a sound, maintaining the sound in a reflective space for a  
time even after the sound has stopped. For enclosed special event environments, particularly large ones  
like conference centers, this has the effect of making the listener feel that he is inside a giant cavern.  
Standing waves in a room occur for certain frequencies related to the distance between parallel walls. The  
original sound and the reflected sound will begin to reinforce each other when the distance between two  
opposite walls is equal to a multiple of half the wavelength of the sound. This happens primarily at low  
frequencies. For example, in a small room that is, say, 60–65 ft \(18–19.6 m\) wide, a standing wave could  
form when the low notes of an electric bass are played. Let us look at how this works. At a frequency of,  
say, 90 Hz, one of the bass notes would result in a wavelength of about 12.6 ft \(3.8 m\). Half this figure is  
6.3 ft \(1.9 m\). Therefore, with a width of 63 ft, the room would be a ten-times multiple of half the  
wavelength, resulting in a standing wave, or overly loud bass sound. This standing wave has to be eliminated  
during the sound check by adjusting the frequencies coming out of the main system speakers, a process  
called equalization \(EQ\) \(see Section 3.5.1\).  
# 3.1.2.2 Absorption  
Some materials absorb sound rather than reflecting it. The amount and efficiency of absorption are again  
dependent on the frequency of the sound. Thin material such as acoustic ceiling tiles or clothing on humans Audio systems **103**  
**Figure 3.2** surface  
Reflection and absorption of sound waves from a large  
Courtesy of JBL Professional, www.jblpro.com  
will absorb middle to high frequencies, while thicker material such as pile carpets, padded furniture,  
and heavy velour drape will absorb lower frequencies \(Figure 3.2\). It is this absorption that helps to  
control reverberation in an event space. It is also the reason why the sound in a room will be completely  
different during a sound check when the room is empty, compared to during the event when the room is  
filled with people.  
# 3.1.2.3 Diffraction  
A sound wave will typically bend around obstacles in its path, which are smaller than its wavelength.  
The resulting effect in an event space is for low frequency sounds to fill a room while high frequencies  
tend to be blocked by most small objects, particularly people. That is why audio engineers place large  
bass speakers \(low frequencies\) on the floor, as they will be heard everywhere in the room, even  
with people sitting or standing in front of them. Likewise, the middle and high frequency speakers will be  
placed either on top of the bass speakers or, ideally, flown from the ceiling in order to be in a position to  
reach the entire audience without these frequencies having to go through the audience \(see Figure 3.3\).  
As an example, from the table of wavelengths \(Table 3.1\), if an acoustic trio of flute, bass, and guitar  
are playing for a standup reception in a crowded room with only a localized, small audio system to  
amplify them, as one gets farther away from the trio in the crowded room, only the lower registers of  
the bass will be heard because the shorter wavelengths of the other instruments will be stopped by the  
people in the room.  
# 3.1.2.4 Refraction  
A sound wave will bend if it must pass through a change in air density. This is most apparent outdoors,  
particularly at large distances, when the sound from loudspeakers passes through temperature and wind **104** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 3.3** Diffraction of sound around obstacles  
Courtesy of JBL Professional, www.jblpro.com  
gradients \(see Figure 3.4\). As well, there is more sound attenuation in drier air \(i.e. lower relative humidity\)  
for frequencies above 2 kHz. This means that high frequencies will be attenuated more with distance than  
will low frequencies \(Eargle, 1999\).  
In summary, the audio quality at an event will depend on the dimensions of the room, the materials present  
in walls and other structures and equipment, the number of audience members, the seating or standing  
arrangements of the audience, the layout of the room, whether or not audio system speakers will be flown  
or mounted on the floor, and finally, whether the event is outdoors or indoors.  
# 3.2 uses of an audio system  
Armed with knowledge of acoustic theory, we now turn our attention to the actual audio system and how  
it is used to amplify the human voice and the sounds of musical instruments or recordings for special  
events. Patil et al. \(2000\) have provided parts of the explanations in this section.  
# 3.2.1 audio for speech  
Often if speech is the main component of an event, the audio system takes on a different appearance  
from that for a concert or musical entertainment stage show. It must provide extremely crisp and  
clear reproduction of the spoken word. The spoken word generally demands specific types of microphones  
and speaker systems that are different from those used for music. Microphones, which we will explore in Audio systems **105**  
**Figure 3.4** Effect of different temperature gradients on sound waves  
Courtesy of JBL Professional, www.jblpro.com  
depth shortly, are primarily of four main types when the spoken word is to be amplified. These are  
wireless handheld, wireless lavalier, wired lectern, and wired handheld microphones. Occasionally, wireless  
headset microphones will also be used, but these tend to be more for a theatrical setting that uses the  
spoken word.  
What is called a distributed system of speakers is most often used for speech, at least in smaller venues. This  
type of system consists of multiple smaller speakers that amplify mid-range voice frequencies. These  
speakers are placed on stands distributed usually around the periphery of the event space. This distribution  
permits clear sound coverage throughout the audience without any single location being too loud. It  
presents a more appealing and unobtrusive look to the equipment, and one that does not block sight lines.  
It is also better suited to improving the sound quality of the range of speech frequencies in acoustically  
challenging spaces with a lot of hard, reflective surfaces \(e.g. glass-walled buildings\), as the placement of  
speakers allows for easier adjustment of critical frequencies and generally less reverberation to eliminate.  
Finally, it permits what is known as more gain before feedback, which essentially means that sound attenuation  
is not as serious and the volume may be increased without feedback. Speech generally does not need  
speakers for sub frequencies below about 80 Hz., although for a warmer and fuller sound, some audio  
engineers add small sub-woofer speakers \(also called bass bins\) near or even under the stage to handle the  
very low to mid-range frequencies.  
# 3.2.2 audio for entertainment  
Most special event entertainment, particularly musical acts and bands, operates within a much more  
demanding range of frequencies than the spoken word, as well as with a large fluctuation of loudness  
levels. An audio system must deliver clearly and audibly to an entire audience, no matter how large,  
everything from quiet whispers to loud rock music, and from high-pitched violin solos to booming bass  
lines. This wide range of frequencies and volumes can come from many different sources, some live, some  
already amplified, and some pre-recorded. To do this acceptably requires a much larger variety of  
microphones and a different package of speakers with different capabilities than those systems used only  
for speech.  
Microphones used for entertainment include wireless handheld, wireless lavalier, wireless headset,  
wired handheld, plus a wide variety of specialized wired and wireless ones for picking up musical  
instrument sounds. **106** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
Speakers for entertainment must be able to amplify frequencies covering the entire spectrum of  
audible sounds. This cannot be done acceptably by any single type of speaker as for speeches. The  
spectrum of frequencies has to be amplified using at least two or even three different types of speakers.  
These speaker systems, especially the bass bins used for low or sub frequencies, tend to be large,  
cumbersome, and intrusive to sight lines, and must be placed judiciously within the event space to  
keep this sight line intrusion to a minimum. Likewise, the speakers that amplify the middle and  
high frequencies are better placed as high above an audience as possible in order to avoid reflection,  
absorption, and diffraction of the higher frequencies. Therefore, they usually perform better flown  
or rigged from the ceiling—or from special trussing if outdoors—if the venue structure and setup  
times permit. Both sound quality and sight lines are improved by doing this. If the event space is very  
large, with an audience that extends a significant distance back from the stage, delay speakers are also  
needed to compensate for the time delay in the sound reaching the rear of the audience. These are  
also best flown.  
In addition to the larger speaker groupings, musical entertainers usually require a monitor system so  
they can hear themselves and the other musicians play. This system may be quite complex. It consists  
of a number of different monitors \(e.g. small, floor-mounted speakers and increasingly, in-ear  
monitors\) and mixes which combine certain performers and instruments into one monitor. The monitor  
mixing board is normally positioned beside the stage and is typically operated by a dedicated, trained  
monitor engineer.  
# 3.3 main audio system groups and their components  
An audio system includes three groups\: Input group, Mixing and Processing group, and Output  
group, each with its own set of equipment components and standard locations \(Patil et al., 2000\).  
See Figure 3.5. Let us take a long look at each one and try to explain exactly what all this equipment does  
and how it works.  
# 3.3.1 input group  
It might help in gaining an understanding of an audio system by thinking of the entire system as the flow  
of an audio signal, much like a river, from its origin as a sound wave from an instrument, a voice, or a  
recording, downstream toward its final destination, the ocean, otherwise called speakers. The sound wave,  
at its origin, is converted to an electrical signal within the first main group of sound system components  
called the Input group, most of which is normally located on the stage at a special event. This group  
consists of a number of standard pieces of equipment, all of which, in some manner, convert sound waves  
into electrical signals. They are\:  
● wired vocal and instrument microphones;  
● transmitters of wireless microphones;  
● direct input boxes or DIs;  
**Figure 3.5** Main audio system groups and signal flow

● keyboard mixers;  
● onstage CD/DVD players, tablets, computers, Internet;  
● CDs, DVDs, USB flash drives, tablets, computers, Internet, and audio inputs from video or PowerPoint  
located near the main mixer.  
Except for wireless microphone transmitters and the other inputs located near the main mixer, these are  
all connected to a common onstage connector or junction box. This box forms one end of the snake or  
cable between the stage and the Mixing and Processing group \(where the main mixer is located\). Since  
the resultant electrical signal from this equipment is the essence of the audio system, we will first examine  
each of these components and explain how this conversion takes place.  
# 3.3.1.1 Microphones  
A microphone is\:  
a generic term that is used to refer to any element which transforms acoustic energy \(sound\) into  
electrical energy \(the audio signal\). A microphone is therefore one type from a larger class of ele-  
ments called transducers, devices which translate energy of one form into energy of another form.  
\(Davis and Jones, 1990, p. 113\)  
The most important characteristics of microphones for live sound applications are their operating  
principle, frequency response, and directionality. Secondary characteristics are their electrical output and  
physical design. It is these five characteristics that an audio engineer uses to choose the appropriate  
microphone for a specific event application, such as speeches or picking up the sounds of certain  
instruments. The choice of microphone based on these characteristics can mean the difference between a  
successful event and audio disaster. Event producers should be aware of the choices available and what  
they mean.  
In this section we will cover all the characteristics of microphones, as well as how to correctly position  
them and finally, examine the design and use of wireless mic systems for special events. The explanations  
and figures in sections 3.3.1.1.1 through 3.3.1.1.4, except where noted, are provided by Shure Inc. and  
used with permission \(Tapia, 2008; Vear, 2011a; Lyons et al., 2008\).  
3.3.1.1.1 operating principle  
The operating principle describes the type of transducer inside the microphone. A transducer is a device  
that changes energy from one form into another, in this case, acoustic energy into electrical energy.  
It is the part of the microphone that actually picks up sound and converts it into an electrical signal. The  
operating principle determines some of the basic capabilities of the microphone. There are several such  
principles\:  
● Dynamic microphone. This type of microphone employs a thin plastic diaphragm that vibrates in  
response to a sound wave and in turn sets up an electrical signal in a small, attached coil of wire \(voice  
coil\) within a magnetic field created by a small permanent magnet. This type of microphone is extremely  
robust and is the most widely used in special events \(Figure 3.6 left\).  
● Condenser microphone. This type of microphone employs a thin metal diaphragm mounted in front of  
a metal backplate and this entire miniature assembly \(otherwise known as a condenser\) is continuously  
charged electrically. When the sound wave hits the front diaphragm, the space between the two  
diaphragms changes and the resultant electrical signal also changes. The power used to maintain the  
continuous electrical charge within the microphone is known as phantom power and is provided by a **108** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 3.6** Microphone operating principles\: left—dynamic; right—condenser

mixing board that actually sends the small voltage required \(typically 12 to 48 V DC\) back through the  
microphone cable to the actual microphone. Condenser microphones are more complex and costly than  
dynamic microphones, and are not as robust, but are more sensitive and provide a smoother, more  
natural sound, especially at higher frequencies \(Figure 3.6 right\).  
● Others. Other principles include an electret condenser, a ribbon, a carbon, and a piezoelectric type of  
microphone, all with unique characteristics. Davis and Jones \(1990, pp. 114–116\) provide excellent  
explanations of these types, most of which are seldom used in special events.  
3.3.1.1.2 frequency response  
This determines how the microphone sounds. It refers to the sensitivity of the microphone over a certain  
frequency range. A microphone whose output signal is equal at all frequencies has a flat frequency response,  
and is typically used to reproduce instruments with a wide range of frequencies such as guitars or pianos.  
One whose response has dips or peaks in signals at certain frequencies has a shaped response, and is  
typically used for close-up vocals.  
3.3.1.1.3 direCTionality  
This is the sensitivity of the microphone to sound relative to the direction or angle from which the  
sound arrives. The three basic directional types of microphone are omnidirectional, unidirectional, and  
bi-directional\:  
● Omnidirectional. This microphone has equal pickup sensitivity from all directions around it, a full 360  
degrees \(Figure 3.7 left\). This means that the sound source does not need to be directly in front of it to  
be heard. It is used, for example, as a type of lectern microphone when there might be several speakers  
at a lectern, none of whom may be standing directly in front of the microphone, such as in an awards  
show with several winners of an award all surrounding the lectern. It is important to remember, however,  
that omnidirectional microphones can pick up ambient room sound as well and thus can be more  
susceptible to feedback. Audio systems **109**  
**Figure 3.7** Microphone directionality\: left—omnidirectional; center—unidirectional; right—bi-directional  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews and Microphone, 2014  
● Unidirectional. This microphone is most sensitive to sound arriving from on-axis and less sensitive to  
sound arriving as it moves off-axis \(Figure 3.7 center\). This type of microphone will allow higher gain  
levels \(i.e. higher input volume\) before feedback becomes a problem. There are two types of unidirectional  
microphones that derive their names from their pickup patterns. Cardioids \(upside-down heart-shaped  
pickup pattern\) have a 130-degree pickup angle in front. Supercardioids have a 115-degree pickup angle.  
The lower the angle, the less is the susceptibility to feedback.  
● Bi-directional. This microphone is the last form of directional microphone. It has a pickup angle of 90  
degrees, so that it essentially picks up sound coming from directly in front of it or directly behind it  
\(Figure 3.7 right\). It is not used much in special events but more in studio recording situations.  
3.3.1.1.4 eleCTrical output  
The output of a microphone is usually specified by output level, impedance, and wiring configuration. These  
determine the proper electrical match of a microphone to a given sound system\:  
● Sensitivity. Remember that small electrical signal that is generated by the microphone when a sound  
wave reaches it? That small signal is called the sensitivity, output level, or microphone level, and is measured  
in millivolts. It generally falls between 0.1 mV and 100 mV, depending on the intensity of the sound  
and the type of microphone. If a signal voltage is small \(i.e. if a sound is faint or distant from the  
microphone\), it may be of similar level to the level of noise in the circuit \(e.g. thermal noise from  
amplifiers, hum, hiss, clicks\). Microphone level signals therefore must be amplified to what is called  
line level before being processed or routed onwards in order to overcome the effects of unwanted noise.  
This is done in the mixer, to be discussed later, but the line level voltage is approximately 1 volt.  
● Impedance. The output impedance of a microphone is roughly equivalent to the electrical resistance of its  
output\: 150–600 ohms for low impedance \(low Z\) and 10,000 ohms or more for high impedance  
\(high Z\). For practical purposes, low impedance microphones can be used with cable \(snake\) runs of  
1,000 ft \(300 m\) or more with no loss of quality, while high impedance types lose high frequencies with  
cable runs greater than about 20 ft \(6 m\). Most microphones used for special events are low impedance.  
● Wiring configuration. Finally, the wiring configuration may be balanced or unbalanced. A balanced output  
carries the signal on two conductors \(wires with shield\). The signals on each wire are the same level  
but opposite polarity so that only the difference between the two signals is amplified and any unwanted  
noise is rejected, since it is identical in each wire. On the other hand, an unbalanced microphone output **110** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 3.8** Balanced and unbalanced cables and connectors  
Copyright Shure Inc., used with permission  
carries its signal on a single conductor \(plus shield\), which in turn amplifies any unwanted noise pickup  
up by the conductor \(wire\). Unbalanced microphones and cables can never be recommended for long  
cable runs, or in areas where electrical interference is a problem. Therefore, for the sake of the best  
sound quality, nearly all special event sound reinforcement systems use balanced, low-impedance  
microphones. See Figure 3.8 for a representation of balanced and unbalanced cables and connectors.  
3.3.1.1.5 physical design, technique, and placement  
The physical design of a microphone is its mechanical and operational design. Types used in special event  
sound reinforcement include handheld, lavalier, headset, overhead, stand-mounted, instrument and  
instrument-mounted, and surface-mounted. Most of these are available in a choice of operating principle,  
frequency response, directional pattern, and electrical output depending on the intended application. The  
correct selection of microphones is essential to good sound at a special event. The audio engineer must  
understand all details of the sound source in order to select the right microphones.  
Proper techniques for using microphones, as well as the correct placement of those microphones, no matter  
what the application, are also critical to avoid feedback and other potential problems. This is an area that  
is often overlooked in special events and it can result in disastrous audio problems. It is also an area about  
which many event producers are blissfully ignorant. We will review the main microphone designs, consider  
the optimum technique for using each design, and review the basic placement for optimum sound quality.  
Most of the explanations and diagrams in this section, except where noted, are provided by Shure Inc. and  
used with permission \(Lyons et al., 2008; Vear, 2011b; Waller et al., 2012\)\: Audio systems **111**  
● Handheld microphones. These come in both wired and wireless types and are normally used for speeches  
and by vocalists. The desired sound is the voice; the undesired sounds may be other talkers and, in the  
case of a musical group, other instruments, voices, or amplifiers. Dynamic microphones are the ones  
most often used in special events as they are more robust and will withstand frequent handling. The  
preferred frequency response is shaped, the directional pattern is usually unidirectional, and the output  
is balanced low impedance. See Figure 3.9 for an example of a handheld, wired microphone.  
Good technique for handheld microphone use includes\:  
● holding the microphone at the proper distance for balanced sound \(4–12 in. for speech; touching the  
lips or 3–4 in. away for vocals\);  
● aiming the microphone toward the mouth, ideally somewhere between the nose and mouth;  
● using a pop filter to control breath noise;  
● controlling loudness with the voice rather than moving the microphone;  
● using a microphone stand \(for wired or wireless types\) to reduce handling noise if the speaker or  
vocalist does not need to move around.  
● Lavalier. These come in both wired and wireless types. The desired sound source is a speaking voice;  
undesired sounds include other talkers, clothing and movement noise, and loudspeakers. A condenser  
lavalier will give the best performance but only when phantom power is available. Otherwise, a dynamic  
is the choice. The most common directional pattern is omnidirectional but it may lead to more ambient  
noise. The frequency response is specially shaped to compensate for off-axis placement \(e.g. speaker’s  
head turns away from the microphone\) and the output is balanced low impedance.  
Placement of lavalier microphones is critical. They should be as close to the mouth as practical, usually  
a few inches below the neckline on a lapel, tie, or lanyard, or at the neckline on a woman’s dress, and  
never underneath any clothing. When they are used in theater applications on actors, they are best  
placed on or near the hairline, with the best method of holding it in place to be determined by the wig  
master. For this purpose, lavaliers come in white and tan colors to be more inconspicuous, and with an  
array of mounting pins and clips. Figure 3.9 gives an example of a lavalier microphone.  
Good technique for lavalier microphone use includes\:  
● not breathing on or touching the microphone or its cable;  
● not turning the head away from the microphone;  
● speaking in a clear and distinct voice.  
● Headset. These come in wired and wireless forms, unidirectional and omnidirectional, condenser or  
dynamic, and with a choice of frequency responses. Most newer models have a lightweight frame that  
sits on the ears and wraps around the back of the head, with a short boom arm that holds the microphone  
at the corner of the mouth. They are the preferred microphone \(especially unidirectional, wireless\) for  
use in special events entertainment, in particular when a performer must both move and speak at the  
same time. They are used extensively for dancer/singers and for other variety performers moving around  
the stage \(e.g. jugglers, physical comedians\). The big advantage to these microphones is that they are  
directly in front of, and close to, the sound source, resulting in optimum sound quality with minimum  
feedback possibilities. Figure 3.9 gives an example of a headset microphone.  
● Overhead. In the temporary world of special events, overhead microphones are rarely used except in  
venues that enable mounting of them above the stage area, such as in theaters. These microphones are  
most often condenser types, with unidirectional, cardioid pickup, and flat, wide-range frequency  
response. They are balanced, low impedance, and high sensitivity due to the distance from the sound  
source\(s\). Physically, they consist of a small condenser element mounted on a short gooseneck, which  
then leads to a thin cable that can be up to 20 or 30 ft \(6 or 9 m\) long. Figure 3.9 gives an example of  
an overhead microphone. Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**112** In these cases, if the desired sound reinforcement is of a large area of the stage \(e.g. for a special play with  
multiple actors/performers\), placement would be for the upstage area with the microphones suspended  
8–10 ft \(2.4–3 m\) above the stage and aimed upstage. The pickup areas should not be overlapped.  
● Lectern mounted. Although most of the standard microphone types may be mounted on microphone  
stands, it is the lectern type of microphone that we are concerned with here. These are normally wired  
and are used exclusively for the human speaking voice. Undesired sounds include nearby loudspeakers,  
rustling papers, and ambient noise \(e.g. ventilation, traffic, reverberation\). Both condenser and dynamic  
microphones are used, with condenser types providing the most unobtrusive design with the highest  
quality. The frequency response is flat within the range of the human voice \(100 Hz to 10 kHz\), the  
directionality is usually unidirectional cardioid but can be omnidirectional depending on how much  
movement there will be by the person speaking or how many persons may be sharing the lectern, and  
the sensitivity should be in the medium to high range since the sound source may be low and occasionally  
distant from the microphone. Most of these types of microphone are small and mounted on a gooseneck  
\(Figure 3.9\).  
Good technique for lectern microphone use includes\:  
● maintaining a fairly constant distance of 6–12 in. \(15–30 cm\) from the microphone;  
● not blowing on the microphone or touching the microphone mount when in use;  
● not making excessive noise with materials on the lectern;  
● speaking in a clear and well-modulated voice.  
● Surface mounted. Also known as boundary microphones, these types can be used for speech in a  
boardroom meeting setting or equally well to pick up stage floor sound as in the case of tap dancers.  
They are low profile in appearance, condenser in principle, and have unidirectional cardioid or  
omnidirectional pickup patterns, with varying frequency response and sensitivity depending on the  
application \(Figure 3.9\). They are placed either on a conference table for meeting applications, or usually  
on the downstage edge of a stage or dance floor for best pickup of performance applications.  
● Instrument and choral group microphones. Because of the range of frequencies and tone qualities  
\(timbres\) exhibited by musical instruments, there is no single microphone that will work for all  
instruments \(or choral groups\). Critical in the decision of which microphone to use are the directional  
output and dynamic range of the instrument. With respect to directional output, a musical instrument  
radiates a different timbre in every direction, essentially resulting in different timbres coming from  
different parts of the instrument. It is thus difficult to find the exact location for microphone placement;  
however, generally speaking, a close placement minimizes feedback and gives the best gain. Dynamic  
range refers to the instrument’s range of volume from softest to loudest. Loud instruments such as  
drums or amplified guitars are best handled by dynamic microphones with moderate sensitivity, but  
soft instruments such as flutes or violins are best with condenser microphones with high sensitivity.  
Waller et al. \(2012\) provide extensive recommendations for choral and musical instrument mic  
placement but here are some very general guidelines that work in most live performance situations\:  
● Choral groups and large musical ensembles. Use flat response unidirectional microphones, ideally  
condenser for best quality, placed 1–3 ft \(0.3–0.9 m\) above and 2–4 ft \(0.6–1.2 m\) in front of the first  
row of singers, aimed toward the middle row of the group, and approximately one microphone per  
10–15 voices. Similar techniques can be used for large musical ensembles with one microphone  
per section. Soloists should have a small condenser clipped to the instrument. See Figure 3.10 for an  
example of a choral mic.  
● Electric guitar or bass amplifier. Dynamic cardioid microphone placed 1–4 in. \(2.5–10 cm\) from the  
loudspeaker pointed toward the center of the speaker cone. See Figure 3.10.  
● Drums. Good coverage can be achieved with four microphones—usually dynamic—quite easily\: one  
overhead of cymbals, one overhead of tom-toms, one overhead of snare, and one in front of bass/kick  
drum. See Figure 3.10 for an example of a kick drum mic. Audio systems **113**  
**Figure 3.9** Examples of vocal and speech microphones \(not to scale\)

● Upright bass. A condenser microphone placed about 6 in. in front of the bass just above the bridge  
works best.  
● Piano. For a grand piano, one flat response, cardioid condenser microphone placed roughly 12 in.  
\(30 cm\) above the middle strings and 8 in. \(20 cm\) from the hammers will suffice. For an upright  
piano, a similar microphone should be placed just over the open top above the treble strings.  
● Woodwinds. A unidirectional cardioid, or supercardioid, dynamic microphone works best placed a  
few inches above the bell and aimed at the sound holes \(mounted on a stand\). Alternatively, a **114** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
miniature condenser microphone clipped to the instrument and aimed at the bell yields excellent  
sound quality. Figure 3.10 illustrates a typical small condenser mic used for this purpose.  
● Brass. A similar setup and choice works for brass instruments as for woodwinds. A dynamic  
unidirectional microphone placed 1–2 ft \(0.3–0.6 m\) in front of the bell or a small condenser  
microphone clipped onto the bell.  
● String quartet. For violins and violas, a miniature condenser microphone clipped to the instruments  
near or on the chin rest works best; for cellos, a stand-mounted condenser microphone aimed at the  
bridge about a foot away.

3.3.1.1.6 general rules for microphone placement  
Based on acoustics and the effects of using multiple microphones in a performance situation, there are  
some general rules that help in deciding where to place microphones. They are\:  
● 3-to-1 rule. This basic rule-of-thumb states that, for multiple microphones, the distance between  
microphones should be at least three times the distance from each microphone to its intended sound  
source. See Figure 3.11. Audio systems **115**  
**Figure 3.11** 3-to-1 rule  
Copyright Shure Inc., used with permission  
● Potential acoustic gain. Also called gain before feedback, this determines how high the volume can be  
turned up before feedback occurs. It is a mathematical relationship involving the distances between  
sound system components, the number of open microphones, and other variables. The resultant  
calculations tell us the following about microphone and audio system component placement\:  
● Microphones should be placed as close as practical to the sound source.  
● They should be kept as far away as possible from loudspeakers.  
● Loudspeakers should be placed as close as possible to the audience.  
● The number of microphones should be kept to a minimum.  
3.3.1.1.7 Wireless microphone systems  
A unique but important adaptation of the microphone as described up to now is the wireless microphone.  
Wireless mics eliminate the need for cables, so performers are no longer tethered to a sound system or  
tripping through messy performing environments. The characteristics of the microphone are all the same  
as for any microphone, but with one notable exception. The electrical signal produced by the workings of  
the microphone is converted into a radio signal that is broadcast by a transmitter to a receiver \(usually  
across the event space or room to near where the mixer is located\). This principle is called frequency  
modulation \(FM\) and is identical to that used by commercial radio stations. The combination of transmitter/  
receiver thus replaces the microphone cable.  
Physically, the transmitter can take three forms. One is a small box, called a body or beltpack that can be  
clipped to a belt or otherwise attached to the user, and the microphone is connected to the beltpack via a  
small, thin wire. This form is most often used with lavalier or headset microphones for someone who must  
move around a lot, such as a keynote speaker or singer who also dances. It is also used for clip-on instrument **116** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
mics \(e.g. that can be attached to stringed or brass/woodwind instruments\) and via a cable plugged directly  
into an acoustic guitar or electric guitar/bass. The second form of transmitter is built into the body of the  
microphone itself and is used almost exclusively for speeches and for vocalists. The third form is a plug-on  
transmitter designed to attach directly to a typical handheld microphone, effectively allowing many  
standard microphones to become wireless. The transmitter is contained in a small rectangular or cylindrical  
housing with an integral female XLR-type input connector. All wireless transmitters, whether inside the  
actual mic or inside the beltpack, require batteries, so any good audio engineer will have spares on hand.  
The receiver end of the system converts the radio signal back into an electrical signal and a regular audio  
cable connects the receiver output to the mixer, where the microphone is assigned a separate channel as  
for any wired microphone.  
Wireless microphones operate in two main frequency bands, very high frequency \(VHF\) from 49 to 216 MHz,  
and ultra high frequency \(UHF\) from 450 to 952 MHz. The VHF frequencies are shared with walkie-talkies,  
radio-controlled toys, and other consumer electronic gadgets, thus making the wireless equipment using  
these frequencies prone to radio frequency interference \(RFI\). It is for this reason that most serious special event  
applications use only UHF wireless systems. A combination of larger frequency range, smaller antennas \(i.e.  
UHF is less than half the size of VHF\), and dramatic radio circuitry advances have all but eliminated VHF  
systems from the current landscape. Present UHF systems offer much greater performance capabilities than  
historical VHF systems and at comparable or even lower cost. However, there is still the possibility of  
interference from such devices as cell phones in the upper range of UHF wireless operation \(Vear, 2011b\).  
It should be noted that each wireless microphone must be assigned an individual frequency, which means  
that no two microphones can share the same frequency, and each microphone must have its own transmitter  
and receiver. The transmitter and receiver should always be placed in line of sight of each other for proper  
functioning.  
Wireless mics are now also moving into digital format. The highest level of digital implementation uses a  
fully digital transmission path. The input signal is digitized in the transmitter and remains in the digital  
domain until the receiver output. It is even possible to output a digital signal from the receiver to subsequent  
digital equipment. Benefits of an all-digital wireless approach include both improved audio quality and  
improved radio transmission \(Vear, 2011b\).  
# P r od u c t i o n Wa r S t o ry  
# The latest and greatest  
I was waiting backstage with Canadian country music star Michelle Wright as a spitfire auctioneer  
rambled through a long list of items, getting the audience pumped. Michelle was up after him.  
Out front, my own audio engineer, Chris, was assisting Michelle’s personal engineer, Danny, in  
getting ready for the show. Danny had brought in a very compact digital mixing console. I had  
heard the two of them talking about it earlier during a rehearsal.  
Whereas the old-fashioned analog one Chris used was about 6 ft wide, Danny proudly boasted  
about the extensive capabilities of his new 2 ft wide board.  
“It can pre-record all the settings for the show. All I have to do is plug it in and the show’s ready  
to go—virtually no rehearsal. It’s been with us for this whole tour with Michelle, all over North  
America. Absolutely no problems.”  
Chris looked envious. Audio systems **117**  
Danny continued, almost rubbing it in. “Everything can be recorded on a disk and I just insert it  
into the board. I carry around a separate disk for each different arena we play in.”  
Because of the “wonder board,” the rehearsal was over in less than an hour, much more efficient  
than the normal 2 h or more.  
As I watched the auctioneer ramble on, I received an excited call from Chris over the intercom.  
“Doug, we have to delay the show start as long as possible.”  
“Why? What happened?”  
“We just had a power surge and it fried all the settings for Michelle’s show that were on the disk.  
Danny has to re-program the entire show into his board.”  
“Crap. How long will that take?”  
“Dunno. Could be half an hour.”  
“Well, I don’t think we have that long, maybe 10 min at best. I’ll try to get the auction stretched  
out a bit. Keep me posted.”  
I looked over at Michelle. Her long, dark hair outlined her appealing features. She smiled and shifted  
from one foot to the other. I had to say something to her. I knew how performers hated waiting.  
But not the whole truth. I liked her smile too much.  
“Uh, Michelle, we’re going to be a bit longer before show start. There are more auction items  
than we first thought.”  
“ok, no problem,” she said. She was more patient than many others I knew.  
I asked the auctioneer to extend and then spent the next minutes worrying whether he would run  
out of things to auction before the audio was ready. After 7 or 8 min, I could sense that keeping the  
auction going any longer would kill the show. The audience was getting impatient. We had to go.  
“We need to start in 2 min,” I signalled to Chris. “Is Michelle’s show ready?”  
A long, silent pause.  
“No, Danny says it will take way too long to get all the cues back into the board. He’s going to  
run it live.”  
I knew what this meant. Danny would have to monitor all the board settings continuously and use  
the first minutes of the show to set absolutely every single level on the board from scratch—the  
same thing that was normally done in the course of a 2-h rehearsal on an analog board. The likeli-  
hood of tremendous sound problems was very high, screaming feedback being one of the worst.  
I cued Michelle. She had no idea what had happened, and I didn’t tell her.  
Unbelievably, other than a few motions from her to Danny to change monitor levels, the show was  
flawless—at least from my viewpoint. No question they were pros.  
The client loved the show and never knew about the power surge and audio panic that had  
occurred. We were lucky.  
Afterwards, I went back out front and talked to Chris, who had basically witnessed an hour of  
intense panic as his companion in the audio world fought to control Michelle’s show. He had a  
big grin as he whispered in my ear, “I’m kinda glad I still have the old stuff. It’s reliable as hell.” **118** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
Danny departed with a brief thanks and goodbye. He never said another word about his new  
digital board.  
From then on I viewed new technology with trepidatious optimism—and a healthy respect for the

# 3.3.1.2 Direct input boxes \(DIs\) and other stage inputs  
To review, there are three factors that determine the output of a microphone\: the signal level, the impedance,  
and the wiring configuration. These same factors are also important for all other instruments and electronics  
feeding signals into the mixer via the snake. In the case of instruments or devices such as electric guitars,  
keyboards, keyboard mixers, DVD players, laptop computers, tablets, and even smartphones, the electronic  
signal that is created by these instruments or devices is higher than the signal created by a microphone  
and is at what we previously described as line level.  
Recalling our previous discussion, unbalanced wiring configurations \(e.g. quarter inch phono plug\) are  
capable of carrying a line level signal a short distance \(less than 20 ft or 6 m\) whereas a balanced configuration  
\(e.g. XLR cable\) is capable of carrying a low, microphone level signal a long distance \(1,000 ft/300 m or  
more\). Certain instruments \(e.g. guitars, keyboards, keyboard mixers\) produce output signals that are  
already at line level. This means that if these signals were to be fed directly into a mixing console—and there  
are inputs that accept line level signals—there would be a significant amount of noise and poor sound quality  
due to the length of cable that would be required to get the signal from the instruments to the mixer in  
almost every special event situation. For example, in a typical event, the stage is on one side of the room  
and the mixing console is on the other, sometimes as far as 100 or 200 ft \(30 or 60 m\) away, enough distance  
to degrade a line level electronic signal. This is where a DI or direct input or injection box is used.  
A DI is, in its most simple terms, a transformer that takes a line level signal \(high impedance and  
unbalanced\) and transforms it down to a lower or microphone level signal \(low impedance and balanced\)  
so it can be transported along that extended length of cable \(the infamous snake\) to the mixer and still  
arrive in good condition via an XLR connector at either end. A passive DI is one that is constructed of  
components such as capacitors and resistors, and an active DI is one that is constructed of active electronics  
such as integrated circuits, and must have continuous power applied from a wall outlet or battery. Active  
DIs tend to be less susceptible to hum and have more flexibility with types of inputs.  
The other main purposes of a DI are to balance the signal and to independently feed the same signal to a  
separate onstage amplifier \(such as a guitar or keyboard amp\) at the same time as the signal goes to the  
main PA system.  
In most real event situations with musicians, it is, however, more normal to use a microphone for an  
electric guitar or electric bass amplifier rather than putting the signal through a DI, which tends to take  
away some of the warmth of the sound. On the other hand, a DI is used for acoustic guitars and also for  
an electronic keyboard mixer output.  
For other onstage devices such as turntables for DJs, laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones, there  
are DIs available with the appropriate input receptacles \(e.g. USB\). Most recently we have seen the advent  
of Bluetooth wireless DIs with the ability to accept radio frequency \(RF\) signals from a device \(e.g. tablet,  
smartphone\) and output them to low impedance, balanced signals and then to the mixer via an XLR cable

# 3.3.2 mixing and Processing group  
This important group of equipment is normally located directly in front of the main stage and at least  
30 ft \(9 m\) away and across the room or event space.  
The purpose of this group is to increase the strength of, and to manipulate, individual signals arriving from  
the Input group via the snake, integrate them to create the best sound possible, and then send it as a  
package back to the Output group via the snake. The group includes\:  
● the house console or mixer;  
● effects;  
properly\).  
● the snake \(although not technically part of this group, it is included so that it can be explained **120** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 3.3.2.1 The mixer  
Also called a sound, house, or audio console or board, the mixer to the uninitiated eye looks like the bridge  
of the Starship Enterprise; something to be feared and far too complicated for the average event producer  
to comprehend. Once the basics of design and operation are known, however, the mixer ceases to hold as  
large a fear factor. In this section, we will explain the layout of a traditional analog mixer and then look at  
its modern counterpart, the digital mixer.  
3.3.2.1.1 analog mixer  
The job of the mixer is really quite simple. It—with the guiding hand of a good audio engineer—performs  
the following tasks\:  
● Provides a separate channel for each input. Every single microphone \(both wired and wireless\), DI, CD/  
DVD player, keyboard mixer, computer, smartphone, and piece of sound-producing equipment onstage  
is assigned a separate input channel on the mixer. Mixers are usually identified by the number of input  
channels they have, with standard mixers coming in four, eight, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 54-channel  
versions. Inputs are mic level \(XLR\) or line level \(quarter inch phono plug\).  
● Increases or normalizes the strength of the input signal. The mixer converts the input signal, if required,  
from the small microphone level \(in the order of millivolts\) to line level \(0.1–2 V\), so that all inputs  
have approximately the same signal strength before they move on.  
● Sends the input signal of each channel to monitors if desired.  
● Integrates effects. It manipulates the sound of each channel and of the entire mix.  
● Combines all input signals into a final mix and sends the signal on to the Output group via the snake.  
Let us now look at how the audio engineer uses the controls available on each separate channel. This is  
the actual “mixing” of the individual signals. Here is a brief explanation of how each control works and  
what it does. For purposes of illustration, we will use an older, basic analog mixer’s channel strips \(Mackie  
CFX20.MkII\) as a guide \(Figure 3.13\), starting from the top of the strip.  
● Trim or gain control. This controls a preamplifier or preamp built into the mixer. It boosts the input signal  
from microphone level to line level, or otherwise adjusts the signal strength to bring it to the same level  
as all others.  
● Auxiliary send \(AUX\). This feature allows a channel to send a signal to an external device, such as stage  
monitors or an effects unit, and then accept the return of the modified signal. By using this option, audio  
engineers can use their own effects units or devices to customize the sound instead of being limited to  
using only the effects that the audio mixer offers.  
This particular mixer has specific sends for effects \(EFX\) after the pre-fade listen \(PFL\). We will cover  
effects in Section 3.3.2.2.  
● PFL \(or pre-fader\). This button enables the audio engineer to check that the signal is present, at the  
right level, and of suitable quality before it goes to the fader \(volume control\) for the channel.  
● EQ. This refers to equalization of bands of frequencies. The engineer can boost or diminish a particular  
frequency band for the individual channel to improve the sound quality of that channel. For example,  
the bass frequency band can be reduced on a lavalier microphone to reduce clunking sounds, or the high  
frequency band can be reduced to prevent sibilance \(excessive hissing through a microphone\).  
● Pan. This adjusts the amount of individual channel sound heard through the left or right speakers.  
Although each channel is actually in mono, this adjustment enables the simulation of stereo.  
● Mute button. This mutes or silences the particular channel to prevent unwanted noise from impinging  
on the mix. Audio systems **121**  
**Figure 3.13** Example of analog mixer \(Mackie CFX20.Mkii\) and individual channel strips  
● Assign. Also known as the bus section, this assigns the input microphone or channel signal to the main  
output channels of the mixer, which can be anywhere from two to eight \(for this mixer\).  
● Fader. This controls the individual signal or channel level \(volume\) sent to the output of the mixer. Note  
that the individual channel signals sent to monitors and effects \(i.e. via aux send\) are sent before the  
channel fader so such things as monitor mixes \(e.g. guitar wanting to hear more piano or vocals in his  
monitor\) or the quality of individual vocal or instrument sounds are not affected when a channel fader  
is moved.  
● Solo button. This isolates the channel signal so that it can be heard by itself. This is useful for such  
things as cueing CDs or other device playbacks.  
Once effects have been integrated, the individual channels are combined into one signal that is controlled  
by two stereo faders \(left and right\) usually on the right side of the mixer, and sent to the Output group  
and speaker system.  
In an analog mixer, every channel, bus, preamp, EQ, and other component mentioned above is comprised  
of physical circuitry \(e.g. wires, resistors, potentiometers, and switches\). If there is a large number of  
separate channels required, this makes such a mixer very space reliant and cumbersome. On the positive  
side, analog mixers are easier to understand and operate. Because of this ease of use, analog mixers still  
hold a percentage of the professional audio market. Digital mixers, however, are becoming more the norm. **122** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
3.3.2.1.2 digital mixer  
Digital mixers are nothing but a replacement for the large analog mixers described above. According to  
Tim Lang of Proshow Audio Visual Broadcast in Vancouver, Canada, once events require more than about  
16 channels of input, digital mixers begin to make sense, and are used for almost all of these larger events  
\(T. Lang, personal communication, August 12, 2014\).  
The main difference between digital and analog mixers is that the analog signals from microphones and  
other inputs are converted to a digital signal through what is known as an analog-to-digital converter \(ADC\)  
either before they enter the snake \(see Section 3.3.2.3\) or shortly after entering the mixer, usually right  
after the preamp. Also, with digital mixers, all effects described in Section 3.3.2.2 are built into the mixer,  
as well as dynamics control \(e.g. compressors and gates\) and output processing \(e.g. equalization and time  
delays\). This means that a great deal of extra equipment is not required and setup time is reduced. Most  
professional digital mixers have add-on modules so that a small mixer can be increased to 96 channels or  
more with little space added. Such modules may be placed anywhere in the event space and need not be  
together onstage. The beauty of digital mixers is that individual channel settings can be pre-set, memorized,  
and instantly recalled when required. They can also be managed as any number of groups with common  
requirements using voltage control amplifiers \(VCAs\) so that at the touch of a single button, a group of several  
channels can be brought up on a monitor to allow adjustments to be made to those channels. Finally, most  
are remotely controllable via proprietary apps for tablets, smartphones, or computers.  
By design, at first glance digital mixers appear nothing like analog mixers and every manufacturer’s design  
is different. However, in concept they are the same. On the MIDAS PRO6 console of Figure 3.14, for  
example, the input channel controls are still there on the left hand side of the mixer \(twelve\), and also on  
the right hand side \(four\) to enable two completely different operators, designated as Areas A and B. The  
functions described above for each channel are hidden behind buttons and can be recalled instantly onto  
the main monitor screen and can then be individually adjusted. The center portions contain\: channel  
grouping mix options controlled by VCAs; auxiliary sends \(e.g. to effects or monitors\); monitor mixes;  
and output faders. Some mixers like the PRO6 have color-coding of buttons to assist with operation.  
Any and all settings can be stored and instantly recalled later from a USB stick, thus saving considerable  
time in sound checks if the same mixing is required in different venues \(e.g. as with a touring band\).  
Storage, transportation, and setup are naturally much easier; however, operation requires a longer learning  
period.  
# 3.3.2.2 Effects  
Effects help to thicken or modify the audio signal that is going through the system. They are normally  
added by setting up what is known as an effects loop in which an individual channel signal is sent from the  
mixer via the auxiliary send. The signal is then routed through a number of different effects. In an analog  
mixing setup, the hardware that creates these effects is all mounted on what is known as a rack \(just  
another term for a vertical arrangement of individual effects boxes in a traveling road case\). Once the signal  
has had the effects added, it is returned to the mixer either pre- or post-channel fader. In a digital mixing  
setup most if not all of the effects—and more—are available and applied from within the mixer itself,  
meaning the external rack is not required.  
The effects that are most commonly used in special event audio systems are\:  
● Delay and echo. Echo is exactly that. It simulates the sound of a natural echo. Delay is basically the  
same. It is done by adding a time-delayed signal to the signal output. This produces a single echo, but  
multiple echoes \(delay\) can be achieved by feeding the output of the echo back into its input. Delay  
times from a few milliseconds to several seconds are common. Audio systems **123**  
**Figure 3.14** Example of a digital mixer \(midas Pro6\)\: top—front view; bottom—rear view  
© Copyright 2013. musiC Group IP Ltd., www.midasconsoles.com  
● Reverberation \(reverb\). This is used to simulate the acoustical effect of sound in large rooms or concert  
halls, in particular the sound from all sources including reflected sound. It gives the impression of being  
in a very large space. It can be done digitally to lengthen the actual reverberation time within a small  
room to give it the feel of sound within a large room.  
● Chorus. Chorus simulates the effect of more than one person singing. In other words, it can make a  
solo vocalist sound like two or more vocalists. It is achieved by adding in an echo to the original input  
signal; however, in this case, the echo’s delay is continuously varied.  
● Flanging and phasing. These are similar effects and are variations of the chorus effect. They make the  
sound appear to “whoosh” or pulsate.  
● Noise gate. This is used to prevent unwanted pickup of background noise such as hissing or extraneous  
stage noise. It can be set to a certain threshold level so that any audio signal below that level will not  
pass through the gate, the result being a quiet channel.  
● Compressor. A compressor simply reduces the difference between the loudest and quietest parts of a  
piece of music by automatically turning down the gain when the signal gets past a pre-determined level.  
In this respect, it does a similar job to the human hand on the fader—but it reacts much faster and with  
greater precision. In a loud environment, say, for example, a special event dinner, quieter passages will  
get lost unless the audio engineer “rides” the channel fader for that instrument or vocalist to boost the  
volume during those quiet passages. The volume then needs to be reduced to prevent distortion or Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**124** feedback when the instrument or vocalist gets loud again. A compressor allows the volume to be left at  
the “boosted” level by reducing the peaks \(loud parts\) by a preset amount so they don’t cause distortion.  
Two controls common to compressors are threshold and ratio. The threshold determines at what point  
the compressor function activates, and the ratio controls how much the signal is compressed \(Sigismondi,  
2008\). The compressor allows much more control by the audio engineer, and negates any reason for a  
vocalist—or person speaking—to move a microphone to control the volume level.  
Once all effects have been added to the mix, the signal is routed to the final output of the mixer and the  
main speaker volume level controlled directly from the master fader on the output panel of the mixer. It  
is normally comprised of one stereo or two single channel faders that correspond with the left and right  
main house speakers. It can also include outputs that correspond to monitor mixes for onstage performers.  
# 3.3.2.3 The snake  
The purpose of the snake is simply to act as an extension cord that connects all the signals on the stage  
to the equipment the audio engineer uses at the audio console position, usually at least 30 ft \(9 m\) across  
the room or event space from the stage. Traditional audio snakes use analog technology and consist of a  
large diameter cable containing multiple wires \(XLR cables\). These wires—one for each channel—carry  
the audio signals from one location to the other. At one end of the cable is a large junction box, or snake  
box, with low impedance \(i.e. XLR\) female receptacles for connecting each of the audio sources \(e.g.  
microphones and DIs\). The other end of the cable splits into individual multiple plugs again for connection  
to the mic preamps and line inputs of the mixing console.  
Some snakes also allow for a number of return signals to come back through the snake, such as for monitor  
mixes; however, for best audio quality, it is recommended not to use these returns \(in analog snakes\) for  
the mixer output going to power amps, and hence to main speakers, as feedback can occur due to coupling  
of signals going to and coming from the mixer \(Davis and Jones, 1990, p. 289\). In summary, analog snakes  
are bulky, heavy, expensive, and don’t always provide the best possible audio quality.  
Now, however, the snake, like everything else, has become digital. The benefit of the digital snake is that  
it eliminates long analog audio signal transfers and the signal degradation that always comes along with  
them. This is accomplished by converting audio signals to digital at the stage position \(typically actually  
beside the stage\) within the snake box—sometimes referred to as an input-output \(I/O\) box or interface by  
some manufacturers—which allows them to be transferred hundreds of feet with absolutely no loss in  
sound quality. Since multiple digital signals can be transferred over a single lightweight cable, the enormous  
bulk of the analog snake’s multi-channel cable is also eliminated. The stage unit may also feature a number  
of audio outputs for signals sent back to the stage from the mixing console \(e.g. amplifier feeds for main  
and monitor speakers\). See Figure 3.15.  
At the mixer end of the digital cable, there may be a requirement to convert the digital signal back to analog  
if it is going into an analog mixer \(yes, the two can be compatible\). This is accomplished by another similar  
unit to that onstage except it contains a digital-to-analog converter \(DAC\). The separate signals are then  
patched into the mixer using standard XLR cables. If the mixer at the receiving end of the digital snake is  
a digital mixer, then the cable is patched directly into the mixer and reconversion of the one digital signal  
into separate ones is done internally using the mixer’s software.  
The actual lightweight cable is called Enhanced Category 5 Ethernet patch cable \(CAT5e\). It is very small in  
diameter, lightweight, and uses connectors similar to those for a telephone, but a bit more robust.  
Depending on the brand, up to 56 or more channels can be carried on this cable for up to 100 m \(330 ft\)  
or more with little degradation. Category 6 \(CAT6\) is the next generation, arranging the wire pairs within  
the cable jacket differently than CAT5e. CAT6 cable is flatter and a bit less flexible than CAT5e. Many Audio systems **125**  
**Figure 3.15** Example of onstage digital interface unit  
Images courtesy of\: left—Roland Corporation; right—etherCon Cat6 Cable © Neutrik® ag 2014  
people use “CAT5” as a generic term for any Ethernet-style cable. See Figure 3.15. The methodology of  
transporting audio signals via a digital CAT5e or CAT6 cable is known as Audio-over-Ethernet \(AoE\).  
There are drawbacks to Ethernet cabling and digital snakes, however, as Lang of Proshow Audiovisual  
Broadcast notes\:  
They are very susceptible to damage and the promised longer runs have not materialized without  
extra repeaters. As well, they are technologically complex. However, they work well for fixed  
installations and for large concert setups. We continue to use mostly analog snakes.  
\(T. Lang, personal communication, August 12, 2014\)  
What’s next? Wireless connectivity is coming—soon! Using a wireless protocol designed for A-V—and  
there are several coming onto the market—all an audio engineer will have to do is set up the stage end of  
the snake and the mixer end without running any cable between the two. Even better, up to 512 channels  
can be run using this protocol, more than enough for almost any special event one can imagine. In addition,  
fiber optic cable is replacing Ethernet for longer runs up to 100 km or more.  
# 3.3.3 output group  
This group is comprised of the audio system components that represent the final destination of the original  
audio signal that began way upstream as a sound wave going into a microphone on the stage. The equipment  
includes\:  
● A frequency equalizer system for the main sound, located as an independent unit near FOH, or within  
a digital mixer, or within a speaker processor.  
● A limiter for the main sound, located as an independent unit near the stage, or within a digital mixer,  
or within a speaker processor.  
● Crossovers to divide up frequencies going into the power amplifiers, located as an independent unit  
near the stage, or within a digital mixer, or within a speaker processor, or within the speakers themselves.  
● Power amplifiers, located either near the stage or within the speakers themselves.  
● The main speakers, located on, above, or near the stage.  
● The entire monitor system, also including equalization, amplifier, and stage monitors, located either  
near the stage or at FOH. **126** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
The purpose of this group is to prepare and deliver the output signal from the main mixer to the main or  
house speakers. The signal is first adjusted by the house equalizer and then by the limiter. The signal is  
then routed back through a snake to the main stage area where it is divided up by crossovers into frequencies  
that correspond to the different main or house speakers, amplified, and finally fed into the speakers. Let’s  
examine how each of these components achieves this\:  
# 3.3.3.1 Equalizer  
This equalizer system works exactly the same as the one for each individual channel except that this one  
adjusts the frequencies going to the main speakers in the house or event space after the audio signal has  
already been adjusted for each channel. In other words, this particular equalizer adjusts the entire mix.  
The equalizer placed at the output of the mixer—and in digital mixers usually within the mixer itself, or  
in many cases in a speaker processor unit near the main mixer—is used primarily to control the frequencies  
that are affected by the room or event space itself. For example, we earlier discussed the problems with  
low frequencies being dominant in a room by virtue of the fact that they “bend” around small objects and  
are thus not absorbed as much as higher frequencies. Because of this, they can be minimized through the  
use of an equalizer at the output of the mixer, just as the high frequencies that tend to be absorbed by  
people filling the room can be boosted. This is especially important when a sound check is done in the  
afternoon before an event and before the room is filled with people. At the time of the event, with more  
people, the room behaves differently acoustically and the equalizer can compensate for this.  
# 3.3.3.2 Limiter  
A limiter is a specialized form of compressor \(see the earlier section on effects\) that uses a very high ratio  
to prevent any signal from surpassing the level set by the threshold. A limiter is primarily used as an overall  
system protection after the equalizer, while compressors are typically used on an individual channel basis,  
although the actual hardware usually combines the two functions. Most digital mixers now incorporate a  
limiter, or it can be found as a separate control within a speaker processor unit near the main mixer.  
# 3.3.3.3 Crossovers  
Crossovers are electrical devices placed in the path of the audio signal after the limiter. Their purpose is  
to divide up the audio signal into separate outputs of mid-, low-, and high-range frequencies. These  
separated signals are then routed to the appropriate speakers that are designed for them. Passive crossovers  
are located inside full-range speaker cabinets \(i.e. speakers that cover all frequencies\) and do this by dividing  
the signal after it leaves the power amplifiers. They tend to be inefficient in that all the speakers are working  
from the same power source, and the low-range speakers, which require more power, will rob power from  
the higher range frequency speakers.  
Active crossovers are located outside the speaker cabinets and before the power amplifiers. In this way, they  
make it possible to power the low-, mid-, and high-range speakers from different power amplifiers. This  
is a much more efficient use of power and enables the system to provide a more powerful and full sound  
covering all frequencies equally. It does, however, require more equipment and expense. It is the system  
of choice for most special events with complex audio requirements and large audiences. However,  
increasingly nowadays, powered, full-range speakers are being used for more intimate events and these  
speakers contain both active crossovers and power amplifiers.  
Most digital mixers also include active crossovers or, if not located within the speakers, they can be found  
in the same speaker processor unit that controls the limiter and EQ functions. Occasionally, they may be  
located near the stage along with separate power amplifiers. Audio systems **127**  
With respect to the current digital technology, for small to medium-sized events, Tim Lang of Proshow  
Audiovisual Broadcast in Vancouver, Canada, states that the digital mixer at FOH typically handles the job  
of the limiters, crossovers, and EQ in most instances. However, when it comes to larger events, concerts,  
or touring shows, it is more likely that a separate unit called a speaker or effects processor, as mentioned  
above, will be used. The processor is normally located at the FOH position and handles the limiter,  
crossover, and EQ functions rather than the digital mixer or, as in the “old days,” a group of individual  
units, each with a separate job \(T. Lang, personal communication, August 12, 2014\).  
# 3.3.3.4 Power amplifiers  
The purpose of the power amplifiers is to boost the low voltage line level signal coming from the limiter  
\(or from the equalizer if there is no system limiter\) to a higher voltage output signal capable of efficiently  
driving the loudspeakers. Power amplifiers are functionally simple units. All amplifiers have a set of line-  
level inputs and a set of speaker-level outputs. Most have a power switch and volume controls as well.  
Appropriately, the power rating of an amplifier is its most important statistic. It is measured in RMS watts  
\(root mean square, or RMS, is a mathematical expression used to describe the level of a signal\) and should  
match the power-loading capabilities of the speaker it is driving. For example, for special event situations,  
it is not unusual to have amplifiers rated at 400 W or higher to amplify all the instruments and microphones.  
However, the matching speaker system must also be able to handle at least that amount of power.  
It should be noted here why exactly so much power may be needed. The answer is quality and clarity of  
sound. If the required level for comfortable listening for a musical stage show is only 20 W, but there is a  
musical peak in the performance that is twice as loud, the laws of physics demand that the amplifier  
will require ten times the power to make the music seem twice as loud. In other words, the amplifier must  
be capable of delivering 200 W of power to the speakers. Otherwise, the music will sound distorted and  
fuzzy. Not only that, but the speakers may also be damaged if the amplifier is incapable of providing that  
power level.  
# 3.3.3.5 Main speakers  
Speaker design and the choice and placement of the correct speakers within the event space are critical to  
audio quality.  
3.3.3.5.1 design  
A loudspeaker \(speaker\) is the final destination of the original sound wave that started onstage with a  
microphone or other electronic device. It simply converts the electrical signal back into mechanical energy  
in the form of a sound wave. The signal activates an electromagnet attached to the speaker frame. This  
electromagnet in turn generates a magnetic field that corresponds in intensity to the frequency and  
loudness of the electrical signal emitted by the amplifier. The variation in this magnetic field causes a voice  
coil, which is attached to the rear of a flexible cone-shaped diaphragm \(also called a membrane and constructed  
of paper or synthetic material\), to move the cone forward and backward in a pattern that mimics the  
frequency and loudness dictated by the electrical signal \(Gillette, 2000\).  
Figure 3.16 \(a\) is a simple drawing showing basic speaker design, and Figure 3.16 \(b\) shows how the  
electromagnet moves the cone to produce a sound wave.  
Speakers are generally classified as low frequency \(woofers\), with a frequency range from approximately  
20 to 1,000 Hz; middle frequency \(mid-range\), with a frequency range from approximately 500–5,000 Hz  
or more; and high frequency \(tweeters\), with a frequency range from approximately 5,000–20,000 Hz. **128** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 3.16** Speaker design and operation  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
Most manufacturers make speakers that combine the middle and high range of frequencies into ones  
that cover about 30 or 40 Hz to 20 kHz. These are referred to either as mid-high or full-range speakers.  
Only the very low frequencies below about 80 Hz occasionally need reinforcement in event  
situations, especially for concerts or musical acts, and these speakers are called subs or sub-woofers,  
although most manufacturers’ speakers in this category cover a range from about 30–50 Hz to about  
220–250 Hz.  
Most low frequency speakers are of a cone-type design while the mid- and high-range speakers incorporate  
both a unique horn design called a pressure driver that uses a thin metal diaphragm, and a horn that helps  
to direct the sound in a particular direction and pattern because of its unique shape.  
Speakers can be active \(i.e. with their own built-in amplifiers—also sometimes called powered speakers\)  
or passive \(i.e. no built-in amplifier\). Most speakers in the larger audio systems for special events  
are passive, although the sub-woofers are active. However, according to Tim Lang of Proshow  
Audiovisual Broadcast in Vancouver, Canada, the use of powered speakers is increasing, with at least  
50 percent or more of those used in corporate events being powered \(T. Lang, personal communication,  
August 12, 2014\).  
Speaker cabinets are also designed to enhance the specific frequencies of the speakers they house.  
For example, bass speakers may incorporate sound-absorbing material to reduce reflections within the  
cabinet since the low frequencies tend to radiate in all directions. In general, cabinets help to reinforce  
the low frequencies and to smooth out the quality of the bass response. Mid and high frequencies radiate  
outwards at about 180 degrees or less, so less cabinet design is required, although most speakers for  
these ranges have their backs covered with thin material to avoid interference from the vibrations of  
lower frequencies. Figure 3.17 illustrates a full-range speaker \(left\) and a sub-woofer \(right\), both without  
their front grilles. Audio systems **129**

3.3.3.5.2 placement  
Speaker placement is also critical depending on the type of event, whether there will be only speeches or  
mainly musical entertainment, the size of the audience, and the size and construction of the venue or event  
space. Placement must be made with at least a general understanding of the acoustics of the space.  
In the case of an event in which there are only speeches, there are several options for speaker placement.  
The one that achieves best consistent sound quality throughout the event space is a distributed system.  
This system uses a number of full-range speakers on tripod stands placed around the space so that full  
coverage is obtained. For a richer sound, as previously described, it may also include small sub-woofer  
speakers beside or under the stage \(for frequencies below 80 Hz\). It is good for a relatively small space  
and audience. See Figure 3.18. Note that this is a side view of the space and shows only one row of speakers  
**Figure 3.18** Example of a distributed speaker system

**Figure 3.19** Example of a flown speaker system  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
down one side of a wall in a 100 ft \(30 m\) long room. This arrangement would be duplicated down the  
near wall with perhaps one or two speakers across the back wall as well.  
Figure 3.19 is a second option for speaker placement. It uses a flown system from a ceiling-mounted truss  
that points a cluster of full-range speakers at the audience so that all seats are covered by the dispersion  
of the sound. Additionally, sub-woofers are generally placed under or beside the stage. In most situations,  
there would be two or more sets of speakers mounted on the same truss over the stage so that equal  
coverage could be maintained across the space.  
Occasionally a situation will arise that requires audience seating closer to the stage, usually because event  
managers want to seat the maximum number of persons in the room. If the sound system is flown, this  
requires that an additional set of flown speakers be aimed at the front few rows of seats, as in Figure 3.20.  
An optional way to achieve the same thing is to either place one or two sets of the same full-range speakers  
on stands at the front of the room to cover this part of the audience, or place even smaller fill speakers \(such  
as monitors\) on the downstage edge of the stage pointing at the front rows of the audience.  
If the event space is large and extends back from the stage more than 80–100 ft \(24–30 m\), there is usually  
the need to provide what are known as delay speakers. These are exactly the same types of full-range  
speakers except that there is a programmed delay to the sound that emanates from them in the order of  
milliseconds. This delay compensates for the sound coming from the speakers nearest to the stage and  
reaching the audience’s ears at a time after it would reach them if a delay were not built in. Thus, all sound  
reaches audience members farther from the stage at exactly the same time. These delay speakers also  
compensate for sound degradation at distant points in the event space caused by reverberation, points at  
which the level of reverberation and the direct sound level \(i.e. the sound coming directly from the speakers  
vs. reflected sound\) are approximately equal. Farther back in the room from this point the sound quality  
will be poor and speech especially becomes less intelligible. Figure 3.21 illustrates the installation of such  
delay speakers in a long room.  
**Figure 3.20** Example of a flown speaker system with front fill speakers  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews Audio systems **131**  
**Figure 3.21** Example of a flown speaker system with delay speakers  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
In the case of entertainment, as mentioned in Section 3.2.2, the range of frequencies is much more than  
for ordinary speech. Because of this, large sub-woofers are demanded. These are typically placed near the  
stage and immediately to either side. They do not normally have to be flown because, as explained in  
the section on acoustic theory, low frequencies tend to bend around obstacles and therefore can cover  
an entire room with objects such as people in the way. Figure 3.22 illustrates how a typical event dinner  
might look from a side view showing such speaker placement.  
One final concern in speaker placement is lateral coverage. The above placements can cover short and long  
rooms, but what if the room or event space is very wide? This is usually solved by arraying several speakers  
on the same horizontal plane but facing different directions in order to obtain coverage across the room.  
The exact amount and quality of coverage will depend in the end on speaker design and angle of speaker  
placement. Figure 3.23 illustrates this type of placement from a top view of the same event situation as in  
Figure 3.22.  
3.3.3.5.3 line arrays  
The last point for discussion on speakers concerns larger indoor or outdoor events, mainly concerts with  
large audiences. The term “array” has already been mentioned above in explaining the use of multiple  
similar speakers placed in a horizontal plane in order to achieve horizontal coverage. An array of speakers  
is also used to cover large distances and large audiences in the vertical plane. This is known as a line array.  
A line array is a set of speakers arrayed in the vertical plane to create what appears as a straight line when  
viewed from the front. However, arrays can take several forms when viewed from the side\: straight, simple  
curve, “J” shape, and spiral. Although the “J” shape has been used a lot, in fact the spiral shape gives better  
coverage. For example, a line array can be used to cover the entire vertical plane within a stadium from  
roof to floor.  
**Figure 3.22** Example of speaker placement for a typical event with stage entertainment  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews **132** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 3.23** Example of speaker placement for lateral coverage  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
The majority of systems used in vertical line arrays are specially designed for that use alone. The individual  
speakers generally cover a wider frequency range than other types, usually from about 40 Hz to 18 or  
20 kHz. Often sub-woofers are added for events involving entertainment in order to cover the very low  
frequencies below 30 Hz. These may be mounted on the ground or flown with the line array. Line array  
speakers are also designed for wider horizontal coverage, usually about 90 degrees in the horizontal plane,  
but some can go up to 120 degrees.  
The decision on number of speakers, curvature of the speaker array, and type of speakers is determined  
based on the size of the venue or event space, the audience size, the extent of coverage needed,  
manufacturer’s specifications, and other variables. Manufacturers typically provide a spreadsheet or custom  
program to design arrays. The design process starts by entering the dimensions of the room and the  
required sound pressure level. The program then suggests the number and arrangement of boxes.  
Alternatively some programs require the number of boxes to be entered and it will predict the resulting  
sound pressure levels in different parts of the room.  
Once designed, the speakers are hung from rigging points on a support structure such as trussing  
constructed as a stage roof. The individual speaker boxes of the array may be connected one at a time or  
rigged together on the ground and then pulled up using chain motors \(see Chapter 9 for more details about  
chain motors and rigging\). One benefit of using a manufacturer’s line array design is that special mounting  
and flying bracketry comes with the speakers, making this process much more efficient. As the array is  
lifted, individual box angles are adjusted to match the array prediction program. If height or lack of rigging  
points does not permit flying the speakers, the speakers are typically stacked on the stage or on sub-woofers  
using a custom stacking frame. Stacking of line arrays is common in smaller venues and in temporary Audio systems **133**  
**Figure 3.24** Example of vertical line array of speakers for large area coverage  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
installations. Compared to flown speakers, they require less vertical dispersion to cover front to back and  
the resulting array will have little curvature \(Line array, 2014\).  
Recent developments have led to floor line arrays for improved coverage in smaller venue situations. The  
speakers comprising these arrays are much smaller than for the large event setups.  
Figure 3.24 illustrates a line array setup in side and plan views. Figure 3.26 also shows line arrays.  
# 3.3.3.6 Monitor system  
The main purpose of monitors is to allow performers onstage to hear what all the other performers are  
singing, what other instruments are playing, or what backup music is being played to accompany a  
performance or program. If an event is held in a small room with very few people in the audience, there is  
probably no need for any stage monitors since anyone onstage will be able to hear what is going on directly  
from the main speakers. However, when an event gets to any significant size in terms of audience, or the  
event space or venue itself becomes large, there will be a need for monitors—typically small, wedge-shaped **134** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
speakers sometimes called wedges—to allow onstage performers to hear everything else that is happening  
on the stage. Often for many special events the audio system is quite modest, even with multiple  
performances onstage in a large venue. Perhaps there is a choreographed dance show, or perhaps a few  
speeches followed by a four- or five-piece combo for dancing, or perhaps a multimedia show with  
PowerPoint slides accompanied by a choir. In all these cases, there is probably no need for more than two  
to four monitors onstage at any time.  
In these cases, monitors and their mixes can be controlled entirely from the main FOH mixer. Most analog  
mixers have auxiliary sends located on each input channel. This means that the signal from that channel  
can be sent to an auxiliary output channel on the mixer, thereby creating separate mixes for onstage  
monitors that are sent back through the snake to the stage. Unfortunately, in an analog mixer, the number  
of different mixes is limited by the number of auxiliary output channels on the mixer. Once the number  
of mixes required exceeds the number of auxiliary output channels, a separate monitor mixer is needed.  
For example, if there is a large band playing with several instruments, lead vocals, and backup vocals, there  
may be quite a large number of separate mixes desired by the band. The lead vocalist, for example, may  
want to hear only the keyboard and bass players with a little bit of the backup vocals; the drummer may  
only want to hear the bass, guitars, and keyboard; the keyboardist may only want to hear the lead vocalist,  
guitars, and drummer, etc. In this type of situation, with complex monitor mix requirements, the monitor  
mix must be located beside the stage. See Figure 3.25 for an example of a typical band’s stage plot for  
exactly this type of situation.  
In the case of digital mixers, most have multiple auxiliary sends—some as many as 32 or more—allowing  
all monitor mixing to be done at the main FOH mixer. However, even with this possibility, larger bands  
will probably opt for a monitor mix close to the stage if for no other reason than better communication.  
In almost all cases, though, the monitor mixer itself will be digital.  
It should be noted that many musical groups and performers now prefer to work with in-ear monitors  
\(IEMs\) that are simply one-way ear bud speakers much like those available with portable music players  
**Figure 3.25** Typical traditional band stage plot with monitor requirements  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews Audio systems **135**  
and smartphones. This personal monitor system may be either wired or wireless. From the output of the  
mixer, the audio signal goes to a transmitter, which converts it to an RF signal. A beltpack receiver, worn  
by the performer, picks up the RF signal and converts it back to an audio signal, all very similar in principle  
to wireless microphones except in reverse. At this stage the audio is then amplified and output to the  
earphones. Personal monitors eliminate large monitor speakers and remove onstage clutter. The most  
practical benefit to personal monitors is that performers can have direct control over what they are hearing.  
While still relying on the sound engineer to make fine adjustments, personal monitor systems give the  
performer some ability to make broad adjustments, such as overall volume, pan, or the ability to choose  
different mixes. If everything in the mix needs to be louder, instead of giving a series of complex hand  
gestures to the monitor engineer, the performer can raise the overall volume directly from the beltpack  
\(Sigismondi, 2009\). Indeed, some manufacturers also have complete small individual mixers for each  
performer, thereby eliminating altogether the need for any master monitor mix beside the stage or even  
at the main FOH mixer position.  
The monitor mixer—if needed—and the associated equipment are essentially identical to the main mixer  
and its related equipment, except that the output ends up at a number of different monitors onstage instead  
of the main house speakers. Because the same principles apply as for the main audio system, the monitor  
system will not be explained in detail.  
# 3.4 Signal flow and equipment locations in the event space  
Now that we have examined in detail all the main groups that comprise the audio system, let’s go back  
and review exactly how the audio signal flows and follow it from beginning to end in a diagram.  
# 3.4.1 Signal flow  
Let us follow the actual signal flow with assistance from a more comprehensive diagram, Figure 3.26,  
in which colored text indicates components of each group, red for the Input group, green for the Mixing  
and Processing group, and blue for the Output group. The lines with arrows indicate the path of the  
audio signal.  
To review, the audio signal\:  
● begins onstage with the Input group, through\: microphones where it is converted from a sound  
wave into an electrical signal, instrument DIs, guitar amp, keyboard mixer, or other devices such as  
computers;  
● goes into a snake box that sends the signal to the main mixer and possibly also to a separate monitor  
mixer beside the stage;  
● is processed in the Mixing and Processing group, by the main FOH mixer where it is raised in strength  
by a preamp, and has various effects added \(for each individual channel\);  
● goes from the mixer into the Output group, via a speaker processor in which a house equalizer adjusts  
frequencies, a house limiter controls maximum strength, and house crossovers split it into different  
frequency bands;  
● goes back through the snake to the power amplifiers that boost its strength and send it to low frequency  
speakers/sub-woofers \(usually floor-mounted\) and full-range speakers \(usually flown from trussing\)  
that convert it back into sound waves.  
The signal going to the monitor mixer is handled in almost exactly the same way as the signal going to the  
main house mixer, with identical components. **136** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 3.26** Signal path and equipment locations for typical event audio system \(not to scale\)  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
# 3.4.2 equipment locations  
In the same way, let us review exactly where in the event space all the audio equipment is located, again  
with reference to Figure 3.26.  
● Input group. In special event applications, almost all the Input group of equipment is located entirely  
onstage. This includes vocal and instrument microphones, instrument DIs, keyboard mixers, and  
occasionally onstage CD/DVD players or even computers that are controlled by performers. Other  
components of the Input group are found often at the house mixer location. These may include USB  
flash drives, CD/DVD players, computer audio output signals \(used in multimedia presentations\), video  
audio outputs, receivers for onstage wireless microphones, and voiceover microphones for MCs.  
● Mixing and Processing group. This equipment, including main house mixer and effects rack, is located  
at the FOH position which, particularly in the case of special events with complex entertainment and  
musical stage shows, should be at least 30–100 ft \(9–30 m\) directly across the room or event space from  
the stage. The general rule of thumb, as suggested by Davis and Jones \(1990, pp. 190–191\), is that the  
console should not be closer to any of the main speakers than the distance between the two mains \(left  
and right\), and no farther than twice the distance between the two mains. It is not absolutely necessary  
to have the console at the same height as the stage. In fact, it may be preferable to have it on the floor  
to avoid the amplification of low frequencies by the riser structure, which would be required if it were  
raised. Often, due to the restrictions of space and the room layout, it is not possible to have the FOH  
location in front of the stage, but rather at the side of the room somewhere. This is not ideal and means Audio systems **137**  
that the audio engineer must continually monitor the sound by walking to the center of the room to  
listen for proper balance. Unfortunately, this is one of the negatives of the event business.  
As mentioned in Section 3.3.2.2, most effects are now contained within the main mixer if it is digital,  
so external effects racks are no longer required at the FOH position as they were in the past with analog  
systems.  
The third member of this group, the snake, is what connects the Input group to the Mixing and Processing  
group. There are several options for locating it, whether it is an analog or digital snake. The snake box  
is usually at the side of the stage near the monitor mixer. The ideal routing of the actual cable from an  
audio standpoint is in a straight line on the floor between the stage and FOH. If the event is a dinner or  
standup reception of some sort, however, this can make it a serious trip hazard. It should therefore be  
matted if possible with a solid mat with yellow warning markings or at the very least with a rubber mat,  
again with yellow or caution cross-taping. Otherwise, the safer route is also in a straight line but across  
or through the ceiling, which negates any matting and avoids trip hazards, but increases setup time. The  
third option is to route the cable around the perimeter of the room. This means that it must either go  
over doorways, or across the floor in the doorways. The better choice is over the doors but if it must go  
across the floor, it again must be matted with either a solid cable mat \(best\) or a large rubber mat.  
● Output group. The components of this group have several different locations which are usually as  
follows\:  
● House equalizer and limiter. These are always located near the FOH console position. If a digital  
mixer is used, they are usually contained within the mixer or within a speaker processor.  
● Crossovers and power amplifiers. These are usually located on or near the stage and, if there is a  
monitor engineer, close to him, although the crossovers can be placed at the FOH position. Again, if  
a digital mixer is used, the crossovers are usually contained within the main mixer or within a speaker  
processor. The power amplifiers may be separate units, or nowadays more frequently contained  
within the individual speaker cabinets.  
● Main speakers. The locations and number of these can vary depending on the type of event, the size  
of the audience, and so on, as explained in Section 3.3.3.5.2. Figure 3.26 is just a general scenario.  
However, there will always be a set of speakers near the main stage, usually at the outside edges.  
● Monitor system. In a simple event, regardless of whether the system is digital or analog, monitors  
will probably be controlled from the FOH position. In a complex event, the entire monitor system  
will be located on either stage right or left and there will be a separate technician called a monitor  
engineer assigned to it full-time.  
# 3.5 Pre-event sound check and system operation during the event  
In this section we examine what the audio engineer does during sound check and during the actual event.  
# 3.5.1 Pre-event sound check  
Most audio systems, no matter what the size, are run in essentially the same way. Whether it is a small  
meeting with simple speeches and an audience of 100, or a stadium rock and roll concert, the operating  
principles of the audio system are similar. Once the basic components of microphones, snake, mixer,  
effects, equalizer, amplifiers, and speakers are set up, then it is necessary to carry out a sound check and  
proceed with system operation.  
What is the purpose of the sound check and why does it take so long? This is perhaps one of the most  
misunderstood—but absolutely necessary—tasks that must be carried out for a special event to run without  
technical glitches, especially one with a large audience and complicated audio requirements. Event **138** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
producers must understand that sufficient time has to be allotted to accomplish it. One to two hours—or  
more—are not unusual for a complete check.  
A thorough sound check is done for several reasons\:  
● Testing the system. Because of the number of components in most systems, initial testing must be done  
slowly and in the right order so no damage is done to components, mainly speakers. Before the system  
is turned on at all, the crossover points \(i.e. specific frequencies\) must be set for all the speakers so that  
signal power is not too great for the speakers. After this, the system components are turned on in the  
general order of\: effects, EQ, mixer, and amplifiers. This is done with all volume and gain controls set  
to zero and most other knobs at a neutral position on the mixer. Following this, the individual speakers  
\(mid/high then low\) are tested to ensure that only the correct frequencies are coming through them.  
● Setting EQ. The main reasons for using EQ \(specific frequency adjustment\) in an audio system are to  
prevent feedback and to help create a desired sound. Of these, feedback is of the most concern and the  
one annoying problem that can keep cropping up throughout an event if this procedure is not done  
properly. The procedure is done in exactly the same way for main speakers and for monitors. The  
preferred method is to use an analyzer system that compares the output of the console with what is  
heard coming out the main speakers via calibrated microphones in the audience. After going to all this  
trouble, there may still be a problem with feedback due to the different acoustics in the venue once all  
the event attendees are present, so EQ usually needs to be monitored continuously during the event.  
● Adjusting individual channel signals. From this point on during the sound check, the band or performers  
should be present so they can provide information to the audio engineer as to the acceptability of their  
sound. For this exercise, individual channel signal inputs are tested separately. For example, the lead  
vocalist’s microphone is tested by first turning the gain control on that channel up until clipping or signal  
cutoff is shown by a light on the mixer channel. The gain is then turned down just below this level and  
remains there with no further adjustment during the event. From then on, the only adjustment is to the  
individual channel faders. The purpose of doing this is to get the maximum possible clear signal from  
each input source. Once this is accomplished for all channels, then the main mixer faders can be turned  
up and the individual channel faders adjusted to obtain a suitable overall mix coming out of the main  
speakers. Most audio engineers will assign a name to each channel at this time on a piece of tape and  
sometimes will set a preliminary level indication as well for each channel. On a digital mixer, the crude  
tape is often replaced by color-coded buttons. This entire process can take quite a long time with a large  
band, so that time must be built into the event schedule.  
As a quick review, here is the relationship amongst the different volume controls on the mixer\:  
● The gain control adjusts the signal as it comes into the mixer.  
● The channel fader adjusts the signal level as it leaves the individual channel on its way to the main  
fader.  
● The main fader adjusts the entire level of all signals as they leave the mixer on their way to the amps  
and main speakers.  
● Setting monitor mixes. This is a procedure that in theory is very simple. The musicians onstage decide  
who wants to hear which of the other performers \(either instruments or vocals or both\) and then those  
specific channels are combined in the monitor mixer to create a specific mix that is sent to that person’s  
individual monitor. If there are only one or two mixes required, as with a small band, then this mix  
procedure can be handled by the main mixer using the auxiliary send channels. If there are too many  
mixes for the main mixer, then, as described earlier, a separate monitor mixer must be set up beside  
the stage and an audio technician assigned to mix the monitors full-time during the event. Of course,  
every musical group has different requirements so there is no set mix that can be described. What  
should be remembered, however, is that although the procedure is simple in theory, in practice it can  
be the most time-consuming part of the sound check. Event producers should keep this in mind. Audio systems **139**  
In the case of musical groups, Tim Lewis of Proshow Audiovisual Broadcast in Vancouver, Canada, states  
how important it is to have a band that is organized for the sound check and especially for setting mixes.  
He cites one group that uses a method of going through the monitor mix procedure one musician at a  
time by having that musician play while all others raise their hands until their individual mix is perfect.  
This saves considerable time overall and is one of the best ways to accomplish the procedure if in-ear  
monitors are used \(T. Lewis, personal communication, August 12, 2014\).  
Of course, as mentioned in Section 3.3.3.6, if a personal monitor system is used, especially in combination  
with digital mixing, much of this time-consuming procedure can be eliminated.  
● Setting up effects. This is usually the last part of the sound check and is done to enhance or improve  
overall sound quality rather than to cover up mistakes or poor musicianship. If you recall those effects  
racks—or equivalent digital mixer software—and all the possible effects such as reverb, chorus, flanging,  
and such, this is the time that they are brought into play. The procedure is really just a balancing act in  
obtaining a nice sound using a combination of the individual channel effects send knob and the master  
effects send knob \(both on the main mixer\), plus the effects mixture controls and the effects level knob  
\(both on the individual effect units—or digital mixer\).  
Now that the sound check is complete, it’s time to open the doors and start the event—after crew dinner  
break, of course!  
# 3.5.2 System operation during the event  
If the sound check has been done properly, there is not too much to worry about for the audio engineer in  
terms of maintaining levels. However, if the event is complicated and will involve speeches, followed by  
entertainment, followed by a band, and most of the channels of a large mixer are being used, then he/she  
must be constantly vigilant. He/she will need to do some or all of the following during the event\:  
● Adjust individual channel faders on the mixer to minimize feedback and to isolate speeches \(i.e. turn  
off all channels except the speech microphone\).  
● Adjust individual channel faders for instrumental solos, backup vocalists, or other inputs such as  
computer backing tracks, voiceover microphones, video, or PowerPoint feeds.  
● Prevent feedback by adjusting house EQ and main mixer and individual channel faders.  
● Adjust effects as needed for best sound quality.  
● Maintain house volume to an acceptable level for the audience and client.  
● Adjust monitor levels and fine-tune monitor mixes as requested by the performers \(this task may be  
assigned totally to a separate monitor engineer\).  
This, then, is the essence of special event audio systems. Although technology changes constantly, the  
basics remain the same. Understand them and the new technology will become much easier to follow.

**DM**\: What are some of the major changes you have seen in the use of audio in special events in  
the last five to ten years?  
**tl**\: First, of course, is the introduction and widespread use of digital mixing boards. Their quality  
and ease of use has increased so that most events are now using digital mixers. This has allowed Audio systems **141**  
for shorter setup times, smaller space requirements for audio gear, smaller trucks, fewer crew, and  
ultimately better audio quality at a lower cost.  
A second major change is in the continuing advancement of line array speaker technology, leading  
to ever smaller sizes while increasing quality and power. This has led to better sound quality and  
coverage, and better audience sight lines and reduced visual obstructions.  
Lastly, a negative one. There has been a proliferation of low-quality, cheap equipment flooding the  
industry. I refer to it as the commoditization of audio-visual. It simply does not have the robustness  
or good engineering that the top-level gear does. Clients who are not knowledgeable may opt for  
paying less and are often disappointed with the results. Also, increasing competition means that  
many A-V companies do not have good maintenance policies and engineering support for their  
equipment, again leading to disappointed clients.  
**BJ**\: I guess the biggest change is the usage of the digital console. It’s everywhere now, from the  
small in-house club to major events and touring . . . Another big change is the way systems are  
networked and you can see what is going on from end to end. On top of that, most of the system  
control is digital which allows a lot of last-minute changes if a client wants to send sound to some  
particular area . . . I’m also seeing that audio is taking a back seat to the lighting and video budgets  
on these shows.  
**DM**\: What changes do you see coming in event audio over the next five to ten years?  
**tl**\: Line arrays will continue to improve, becoming smaller, cheaper, and of better quality. Wireless  
technology will also continue to improve. Digital mixers will continue to get cheaper while adding  
more and more features and capabilities.  
**BJ**\: I feel that the digital age is really upon us now and we will see everything being digital across  
the board. At the high end most systems are now networked and there’s a load of pressure on  
audio technicians to have a good understanding of networking, etc. . . . There seems to be a lot of  
pressure on audio companies and the fees they are getting, so I see a lot of re-systemizing to help  
make systems less labor intensive and in the end cheaper to put out to a show. Fiber \[optic\] distri-  
bution systems are starting to take off and as they become less costly I would say most systems in  
the future would all be on fiber. I’d say soon the smaller digital boards would have all the plug-ins  
that the large expensive boards have. Hopefully we see a drop in the costs of digital consoles . . .  
Also we are going to start to see a lot more use of WiFi products.  
**DM**\: From your experience working with both event planners and event producers \(producers  
generally being more technical than planners\), what would you say is the minimum knowledge  
base for both in terms of event audio systems?  
**tl**\: They need to understand the different approaches to sound reinforcement. They need to  
understand venue infrastructure requirements for their desired level of production\: the number,  
location, and rating of rigging points; power availability; what setup times are required and what  
it means if venues squeeze clients for time. They need to understand the effects of audience size  
on sound reinforcement, for example what is the best speaker arrangement for a certain size of  
audience and type of event.  
**BJ**\: I guess it would be good if they had a basic understanding of how we go about things.  
I don’t think it’s a must, but it certainly helps when you start discussing schedules and timings, etc.  
Otherwise they start thinking we can get this all up and running in an hour or so. Also it does help  
when they do in fact understand what they want sound wise. From my experience, most have a  
general understanding I guess through working their way up the ladder themselves. It certainly  
helps when they do. **142** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 3.6 risk and safety  
As with most of the technical subjects covered in this book, producers must be concerned with risks  
involved in the operation of audio equipment and with the safety of their own or contracted personnel and  
event attendees. We begin by providing current known North American and other audio equipment  
operation and safety standards, as follows\:  
● IEC 62368-1 \(in the United States, and Europe with EN prefix\) and CAN/CSA-C22.2 No. 60065A-03  
\(R2012\) \(in Canada\)\: Audio/Video, Information Technology and Communications Technology Equipment, Part 1  
– Safety Requirements.  
● ANSI \(American National Standards Institute\) E1.8 – 2012\: Entertainment Technology – Loudspeaker Enclosures  
Intended for Overhead Suspension – Classification, Manufacture and Structural Testing.  
● Cooper, D.C. \(Ed.\) \(2014\). The Event Safety Guide\: A Guide to Health, Safety and Welfare at Live Entertainment  
Events in the United States. New York\: Event Safety Alliance of USA, Inc./Skyhorse Publishing. Of  
particular note are Chapters 9 through 15 regarding worker and work site safety. Note also that this  
publication is an intentional and cooperative upgrade of The Purple Guide to Health, Safety and Welfare at  
Music and Other Events from the United Kingdom.  
● Other ANSI standards with respect to rigging for audio systems that must be flown are available from  
www.plasa.org.  
These standards apply specifically to the general design and use of this equipment in an entertainment  
context, although the Event Safety Guide applies also to worker safety. Not listed here is the myriad of  
design standards that apply to individual pieces of equipment. However, most of these are covered within  
UL 60065. It should be noted that for Canada and the United States, this equipment is certified by  
Standards Development Organizations \(SDOs\) in each country \(see Chapter 8 of Special Event Production\:  
The Process for an explanation of these organizations\). In the United States, the main SDO for audio  
equipment is the Underwriters Laboratories Inc. \(UL\) and in Canada, the Canadian Standards Association  
\(CSA\). Producers should be extremely cautious of allowing suppliers to use any equipment that does not  
bear a certification sticker with either of these marks on it. There is every chance that it may be of  
substandard quality or built by an individual with little knowledge of the standards required. In other  
words, it could be hazardous not only to health but also to the proper functioning of all other equipment  
to which it is connected. Indeed, as with other standards, it is advisable to mandate the use of only UL or  
CSA certified equipment within production supplier contracts.  
In terms of personnel safety when using audio and A-V equipment, the OSHA \(Occupational Safety and  
Health Administration\) and WCB guidelines in the United States and in Canadian provinces, respectively,  
must strictly apply. Associated with them must be strict adherence to the National Electrical Code in the  
United States and the Canadian Electrical Code when working with any electrical equipment in either country,  
which is essentially all audio and A-V equipment. Again, it is recommended that adherence to these  
standards be mandated in all supplier contracts.  
For other countries \(limited list\), here are the general starting points for worker health and safety standards\:

Employment, Government of India, www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/---sro-  
bangkok/documents/policy/wcms\_182422.pdf. Audio systems **143**  
● South Africa. Act No. 85 of 1993\: Occupational Health and Safety Act as amended by Occupational Health and  
Safety Amendment Act, No. 181 of 1993, www.labour.gov.za/DOL/downloads/legislation/acts/  
occupational-health-and-safety/amendments/Amended%20Act%20-%20Occupational%20Health%20  
and%20Safety.pdf.  
As well, certain risk mitigation techniques that ensure flawless event execution are employed regularly by  
audio specialists based on their experience. Tim Lewis, the owner of Proshow Audio Visual Broadcast in  
Vancouver, Canada, and Bruce Johnston with JPJ Audio in Australia offer recommendations from their  
experience \(T. Lewis, personal communication, August 12, 2014; B. Johnston, personal communication,  
September 4, 2014\)\:  
● Redundancy. For every event on which he works, Lewis has what he calls a Catastrophic Backup Plan.  
He analyzes the audio requirements for the event and looks at what might cause a worst-case scenario  
or “catastrophe.” By his definition, a catastrophe is having the audience leave because the event cannot  
continue. He then plans the amount of additional equipment required to prevent that from happening.  
For example, if a VIP or keynote speech is lost, the event is over. If a band cannot be heard, the  
show or dance is over. Depending on what that catastrophe is, the extra equipment might be a small  
powered house mixer, twin lectern microphones \(or running an extra microphone cord to the lectern\),  
additional lavalier microphones, obviously many extra batteries for wireless equipment, additional  
handheld wireless microphones, extra CD/DVD players and computers, extra cables and power supply,  
and so on. The decision centers around what the event can do without and still survive. Lewis further  
stresses that the decision should be based on maintaining the highest level of professionalism and never  
on the cost.  
Johnston echoes Lewis’s concern with respect to redundancy in equipment\: “What we try and do at JPJ  
Audio is have enough spares to get us out of any issues that might arise. We always carry extra  
microphones, leads, and power. With our rigging we always supply an extra chain motor. I guess that’s  
the same with the monitors as we always send extra wedges out. We do send out spare diaphragms and  
the odd speaker for ‘just-in-case’ issues . . . We also tend to supply a similar opening act console to the  
main act even if it’s on the same digital console \[note that Johnston specializes in touring concert acts\].  
If we are at a regional/out in the country show we will send a spare console as it would be just too hard  
to sort it out if we did have an issue.”  
● Ambient effects. Producers need to be cognizant of what is happening in the event space and with other  
equipment. Lewis points out that ambient noise from other equipment can be problematic for audio  
quality. For example, fan noise from projectors, moving lights, and air conditioning can be quite high  
and can interfere with audio quality, thus squeezing the available headroom or amount of gain available  
before feedback. It is far better when it comes to ambient noise to turn the noise off rather than turn  
the audio system volume up, according to Lewis, even if it is only for a very short period during a key  
moment in a speech or the event program.  
● Technical capabilities of personnel. In audio, there can be specialists in mixing audio for widely different  
types of events. For example, some audio engineers are trained and experienced in mixing rock and  
roll at concerts, some have only experience with corporate speeches, some have experience with  
theatrical presentations, and many more. According to Lewis, it is essential for producers to ensure from  
dialogue with audio subcontractors that the experience of the engineers provided matches the audio  
needs of the event.  
A combination of these tips, compliance with safety and design standards, and a well-thought-out list of  
risks and their solutions for the particular event should alleviate most potential problems for producers in  
the audio area. **144** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS

**1.** You are managing an event in a large indoor venue with all glass walls and a very high ceiling,  
in addition to quite a number of large structural columns. Explain generally why the acoustics  
are bad in this venue.  
**2.** A keynote speaker has been hired for a conference opening general session. Besides speaking  
for 30 min, this person also plans to sing several songs to backing music tracks on his iPhone as  
part of his presentation. Suggest three options for microphones for this person and why they  
may or may not work for him.  
**3.** Your client is dumbfounded by the apparent complexity of the digital mixer that your audio  
engineer has just unloaded and set up on the venue wall opposite the main stage. She express-

# Visual presentation  
# technology  
# l e a r n i n g o u t c o m es  
After reading this chapter you will be able to\:  
**1.** Understand the purpose of creating a visual presentation.  
**2.** Understand content and why and how a multimedia show is created using visual presentation  
technology.  
**3.** Describe the different visual sources used in presentations.  
**4.** Describe the signal path and how the visual signal is manipulated as it travels from source to  
final projection.  
**5.** Describe the different types of display and projection equipment.  
**6.** Understand what happens during the setup and operation of visual display equipment at a  
special event.  
The “tag team” of audio and visual equipment \(A-V\) can sometimes be confusing because it encompasses  
so much technology. Because the audio needs of a complex entertainment program are very different from  
a meeting consisting mainly of speeches, audio has a separate chapter in this book, and only the visual  
component of A-V will be the subject of this chapter. \(We will refer to visual presentation equipment, for  
purposes of simplicity, as A-V.\) In truth, many companies offer both audio and visual equipment because  
they are both interrelated.  
As with all other technologies, visual presentation equipment is advancing rapidly. It is the goal of this  
chapter to take a point in time and to explain the current theory of operation of this equipment and how  
the equipment is used in special events. We will therefore concentrate on the following topics\: **146** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
● purpose of visual presentations;  
● content in visual presentations;  
● visual sources;  
● control and distribution;  
● projection equipment;  
● display equipment;  
● equipment setup and operation;  
● risk and safety.  
# 4.1 Purpose of visual presentations  
“There is nothing worse than a brilliant image of a fuzzy concept.” So said famous photographer Ansel  
Adams. All the most advanced equipment and largest screens in the world will not make an event successful  
if the purpose of the visual presentation is not fully understood by all concerned before the event is  
designed \(see Chapter 2 of Special Event Production\: The Process concerning event design\). Clients, producers,  
and equipment suppliers must be in perfect synchronization. The choice of projection and display  
equipment, the location of equipment, the length of the presentation, and most importantly the content  
of the presentation are all impacted by the purpose of the presentation.  
For example, one of the most common purposes is for educational meetings and conferences in which the  
presentation is primarily for speaker support. In this case, there are often no more than one or two  
supporting screens designed either as part of a stage set or off to one or both sides of a stage. Occasionally,  
smaller monitors may be used throughout the venue depending on the venue design and ease of actually  
seeing the speaker and stage. Projection equipment may consist of no more than one or two digital  
projectors for PowerPoint and content may be entirely provided by the presenters.  
On the other hand, if the purpose of the presentation is to augment an entertainment program, such  
as 3D projection mapping, then the possibilities become endless and limited only by budget. Frequently  
now, with the advent of high-intensity projection systems, A-V is being incorporated into almost every  
event, even outdoors. Visual elements such as computer animations, slides or still images, and video are  
projected onto fabric, ceilings, walls, the sides of buildings, and even water as part of event décor, part  
of the entertainment, or part of strategic messaging. Such imaging may be stored not only on CD/  
DVD players, but computers, smartphones, tablets, or even the Internet. For complex shows, content is  
the key and considerable time must be devoted to programming it, either by the producer or by a specialist  
in the medium.  
# 4.2 content in visual presentations  
Not all presentations are or will be simple. More frequently with advancing technology, several technical  
areas are combined in visual presentations in order to convey the message of the event. We have all seen  
recent Olympics opening and closing ceremonies in which the latest large screen projection technology is  
combined with entertainment, special effects, and creative staging in order to tell a story. As would be  
expected, this scenario is spilling over into private and corporate events as well as other public events. This  
has traditionally been known as a multimedia presentation. Before we look at the actual equipment used in  
visual presentations, let us delve a little deeper into content, because unless content is right, an expensive  
visual presentation—and indeed the event itself—can fall flat on its face.  
What, then, is a multimedia presentation? According to at least one definition, it is “the use of computers  
to present text, graphics, video, animation, and sound in an integrated way” \(Beal, 2014\). Herein lies the Visual presentation teCHnology **147**  
problem. On one hand, the expectations of those more attuned to working with computers, such as A-V  
companies and anyone under the age of 50, are for a multimedia show to incorporate mainly computer  
technology and video. On the other hand, those of a generation able to remember the 1960s associate  
multimedia with the influential work of Andy Warhol in his groundbreaking 1966 performance “Exploding.  
Plastic. Inevitable,” which was then termed “multimedia” and combined the rock music of the Velvet  
Underground with cinema and performance art. Arguably, this was the true beginning of not only the visual  
aspects of the psychedelic phenomenon, but also of adding visual content in the form of lighting effects,  
video, and IMAG to concert performances.  
To be sure, multimedia can encompass all these influences, but to get it right, the producer has to have  
very clear goals at the outset of the project in order to meet the expectations of the client and audience.  
To do this, let us consider that there are two types of multimedia presentations\: traditional and non-  
traditional. The traditional, contrary to the influences explained above, includes only the simplest of  
presentation content and equipment, such as basic video, still images, PowerPoint on a screen, and a live  
presenter, but with minimal interaction between the audience and speaker or audience and the visuals  
themselves. Only the speaker interacts with the visuals \(e.g. by changing slides\). The non-traditional,  
more contemporary presentation may include not only video and PowerPoint, but also newer technology  
\(e.g. water screens, LED screens, 3D projection mapping, touchscreens, and live streaming content from  
the Internet\) along with special effects, live human performances, and possibly audience interaction using  
mobile devices. See Figure 4.1 illustrating an event \(Russia Day, 2014\) in which water effects, lasers,  
fireworks, video, lighting, and live stage performances were all incorporated into a multimedia show.  
**Figure 4.1** Example of a multimedia presentation  
Courtesy of Petr Ushanov, http\://petrushanov.livejournal.com **148** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
It is this second form of multimedia presentation, like the one originating with Warhol, that we are  
concerned with in this section. As Warhol said at the time of his 1966 presentation, “We all knew something  
revolutionary was happening. We just felt it. Things could not look this strange and new without some  
barrier being broken” \(McNeil and McCain, 2006, p. 16\). Of course, what everyone had experienced was  
the emotional power of combining visuals and performance. That is the secret to getting a message across  
with multimedia, the power of emotion. Here are some tips on doing it right\:  
# 4.2.1 Setting goals and content for the show  
To start with, multimedia can be expensive. There is always a temptation that “more is going to make it  
better.” That is why it is necessary to understand and discuss with all concerned what the exact goal of the  
presentation is before the project is launched. There may not be a reason for using three or four live video  
cameras if two will do. Perhaps the show is not complicated enough to warrant pre-recording and  
synchronizing everything to disc. As with entertainment and décor, the sensory experience is being  
heightened through the addition of more exciting visual stimuli and audio effects, so these stimuli had  
better get the point across in the most efficient manner possible. This means a close examination of the  
goals. Some of the more common goals of a multimedia presentation include\:  
● improving the understanding of a particular message, such as corporate goals or strategic marketing;  
● motivating sales forces;  
● evoking emotions in order to more easily sell a service or product, or motivate the audience to take some  
action;  
● educating in a cultural or spiritual context.  
Once the goal has been determined, it then requires creative sessions with the producer and A-V supplier  
to decide what sort of show content should be developed. The combinations are almost endless, but here  
is some food for thought based on the above generic types of goals\:  
● If there is to be a specific message such as a corporate sales goal, will the company president be part of  
the show and will he or she be able to, or want to, deliver the message without help from additional  
images or video? Will signage suffice for a message or must extra pizzazz be added? Will he or she need  
to use PowerPoint with perhaps a laptop computer or tablet near or on the stage?  
● If the goal is motivational, how is it best delivered? This is where the list of possibilities is long.  
Cheerleaders, motivational keynote speakers, upbeat dance routines, bands, celebrity acts, magicians,  
cirque shows, and many others have been used as live entertainment together with motivating slides,  
videos, projection mapping, special effects \(e.g. fireworks, lasers\), and automated lighting. Who will  
write the script and direct the show?  
● Does the show require an emotional appeal or impact and how will that best be achieved? This can  
sometimes be done by using a pre-recorded video clip with good scripting, videography, editing, and  
perhaps suitable emotional background music. On the other hand, it might be better achieved more  
dramatically with a live performance, especially if the performers are good at eliciting emotion from  
audiences \(e.g. the drama of a Shakespearean actor, the flawless performance of a professional ballerina,  
the power of a 100-voice choir, etc.\), which in turn can be augmented with other visuals such as still  
images, or short video clips.  
● If the goal is to tell a story or educate, what length is the show to be \(shorter is always better, in the  
order of five to ten minutes or so\)? Is it too cerebral to be effective as a multimedia presentation \(most  
presentations work best if the message is fairly straightforward\)? Will it need extensive scripting and  
rehearsing? All these can take extra time and money. Often, telling a story requires intensive research  
for, and editing of, still and video images in order to make them suitably relevant to the subject, in order Visual presentation teCHnology **149**  
to achieve the emotional impact sought, and in order to make them clear and of high enough resolution  
to be effective.  
● In any of the scenarios, will there be live video and how many cameras will be needed?  
# 4.2.2 choosing equipment and personnel  
Once content has been determined, then equipment and personnel must be planned. The options once  
again are almost limitless, but usually end up being restricted by budget. Here are some points to consider\:  
# 4.2.2.1 Screens and projection surfaces  
If there is only one stage and all the presentations are intended to be from there, is there any sense to have  
auxiliary screens or monitors elsewhere in the venue or is the audience small enough that they will be fully  
engaged with a large screen or projection surfaces at or near the stage? Typical screen setups for large,  
seated audiences include\: a large stage backdrop screen\(s\) with occasional smaller screens as part of the  
larger one\(s\); corner screens set diagonally across the front corners of the venue, usually flanking the stage;  
and supplementary screens for large audiences sometimes flown on trussing partway down a long venue.  
Not used too often are side screens. If the screens are close to the stage and there will be performances,  
their visibility will be influenced by any light spillage from stage lighting, so the entire show will also have  
to be reviewed with the lighting designer. As well, any stage performances may have to be restricted to  
only the downstage area if there is front projection, due to the possibility of shadows falling on the screen  
surface from the performers.  
Is the presentation to be outdoors during the daytime? In this case, LED screens might be the best solution  
because of their brightness and ability to overcome the competition from sunlight \(see Section 4.6.4\). Also,  
if there is to be a lot of audience interaction in the form of either touchscreens, mobile devices used as  
input, or body gestures as input, then extra consideration must be given to the proximity of the screen\(s\)  
to the audience.  
# 4.2.2.2 Projectors  
The main concern for projectors is whether they are used for front or rear projection and what brightness  
is needed, depending on the ambient light. Also required is the distance to the screens or projection  
surfaces and the material of the surfaces. The show does not necessarily have to be on only traditional  
screens. It can be partly on other surfaces like water screens, fabric, tables, walls, ceilings, floors, streets,  
buildings, and décor components as mentioned earlier. Lens focal length is also critical, and is influenced  
by the final decision on projector placement. Front projection in a large venue, for example, may very well  
be from a projector suspended from a lighting truss. The truss location is decided based mainly on lighting  
concerns and so the projector lens has to be chosen to ensure optimum projection from this location. For  
massive 3D projections outdoors, projectors may have to be mounted on the roofs of buildings, so not only  
is projection distance important, but so are obtaining the proper authorization, weather-proofing,  
scheduling, potential setup problems, and risk management.  
# 4.2.2.3 Video cameras  
Section 4.3.3 deals at length with IMAG and the use of video cameras. Suffice it to say that prior to  
embarking on a multimedia show if part of it is to be live, the number of cameras and the exact locations  
of the cameras must be determined. Usually, for best results and to enable a creative variety of shots, at  
least two cameras, one stationary, and one roving, are required. **150** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 4.2.2.4 Personnel  
Personnel are chosen based on the complexity of the show. They may include\:  
● Technical director to call the camera shots and video switches from a central location, usually FOH.  
● Camera operator for each camera plus a grip for each roving camera \(see Section 4.3.3.4\).  
● Shader or switcher operator to operate the signal processing, switching equipment, and video recorders  
at the FOH position. This position will also typically have one preview monitor per camera, and one  
preview monitor for the final signal before it goes to projection equipment, so the operator can ensure  
what will be viewed on the final display has the correct color balance, resolution, and size.  
● One or more computer operators depending on the number of computers and the complexity of software  
and digital images used as part of the show. Each computer will have a monitor for previewing images  
before sending them to the switching hardware. The location is usually backstage with the rest of the  
A-V equipment for the show.  
● Possibly an extra technician to assist with complex tasks and equipment problems.  
# 4.2.3 Putting it together  
Putting a multimedia show together means more than just showing up with a collection of discs, USB flash  
drives, PowerPoint, computer, and video cameras. A good multimedia show is a full-blown work of art,  
much like a musical composition or a stage play. It requires a story line, a script, performers who are  
professional, good production support, and extensive rehearsals and technical run-throughs. In many  
cases, the job of writing and scripting a story line falls to the show producer who must interpret the goals  
of the show set by the client and deliver a stunning multimedia performance that gets the point across.  
This may be, in its simplest form, just a series of PowerPoint slides interspersed with video clips or guest  
speakers, but put together in a logically flowing format. On the other hand, it may be an actual story written  
from scratch that is used as an analogy to deliver a message. This might involve actual scripting. It might  
involve researching for, selecting, and editing still and/or video images. It might involve specialized  
programming for large screens or 3D mapping. It might involve auditioning and contracting appropriate  
live entertainment to supplement and emphasize the message. It might be very short or it might extend  
over an entire event.  
Whatever the case, it is helpful to treat visual sources such as live or recorded video and still images as  
another form of performer, albeit with some limitations but many capabilities. In this way, the technology  
can be fit into the story line whenever it will improve the delivery of the message, particularly the emotional  
side. This means that the show must be built as any entertainment program, with a logical flow to a climax,  
using all the disparate elements. Chapter 1 of this book and Chapters 2 and 9 of Special Event Production\:  
The Process discuss the creation of such a show in detail.  
My company created many multimedia shows, but one sticks in my memory as an example of the intricate  
mixture of such disparate elements. The concept was to use an original Native American legend as an  
analogy to the historic rise and success of the client company. My task was to write the story, find the  
performers, choose the background music and much of the imagery, and rehearse the show with my A-V  
colleagues who also assisted with video selection, still image and video editing, and putting it all together  
with the appropriate equipment. We ended up with a complete three-act play that was performed on three  
different stages throughout dinner, each stage with a separate large screen as a backdrop. The play was  
narrated by an old chief whom we had to pre-record in a studio and whom we placed behind a scrim where  
he sat by a campfire telling the story. The logistics were complex to say the least, and the timing of the  
entire visual component with live dancers, rhythmic gymnasts, giant puppets, stilt walkers, and backing  
imagery was a challenge. It called for an experienced show caller \(see Chapter 9 of Special Event Production\: Visual presentation teCHnology **151**  
The Process\), a well-written script broken down into logical segments with accompanying cues for music  
and visuals down to the second, and video clips that were accurately edited.  
Once it is determined that an event requires some sort of visual presentation, whether just a basic  
PowerPoint presentation backing up a keynote speaker, or a full-blown, no-holds-barred multimedia  
extravaganza, then it’s time to delve into the equipment required. While the majority of visual presentations  
will be coordinated by an A-V company, it is still useful for any producer to have a basic understanding of  
the equipment and its capabilities. To that end, what we are going to attempt in this chapter is to translate  
a world of complex jargon and equipment into a logical pattern. Computer, video, projection, and display  
technologies are undergoing a quantum leap in capabilities. Much of the older analog technology is rapidly  
becoming obsolete and being replaced by its digital equivalent. For this reason, the chapter will concentrate  
solely on digital technology.  
In order to make this chapter understandable, we will follow a visual presentation from start to finish,  
from its basic initial visual source to its final destination as an image displayed for an audience. Along the  
way, we will examine the most common equipment currently in use, paying particular attention to how  
this equipment transforms our initial source into the projected image. In general, a presentation will follow  
a path similar to that in Figure 4.2.

# 4.3 visual sources  
In the good old days of the 1980s and 1990s—and earlier—most of the projected visuals for special events  
came from 35 mm slides played back on Kodak carousel projectors. Sometimes, for complex shows, several  
banks of such projectors could be found mounted on scaffolding behind a screen. Likewise, for many  
technical or scientific presentations, an overhead projector could be found in front of a screen with a real  
person assigned to change the acetate transparencies whenever required by the presenter. For the more  
sophisticated events, analog video might have been used and played back using a VHS or other format tape  
player, with the actual projector being mounted either in front of or behind the screen. Generally speaking,  
the overall quality of any of these types of presentations was not what today’s event attendees are  
accustomed to experiencing.  
To begin, we will review and explain the main sources of information for visual presentations, starting with  
the simplest and ending with the most complex.  
# 4.3.1 Still image files  
Most still images that will be projected will be photographs or graphic illustrations, and the key  
considerations here are image size, image resolution, and file format.  
# 4.3.1.1 Image size  
Most photographic or other still digital images will originate from a digital camera or a scanner, and  
will in all likelihood be too large or too small in size for a suitable onscreen presentation. How the **152** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
image will appear onscreen is a factor of both the computer it was processed on and the projector that will  
display it.  
Assuming that the intention is to fill the screen with the image, in a photo-editing program like Adobe  
Photoshop the original image should be cropped to the size desired to fill the screen. In other words,  
if it is desired to show the entire width of the photo onscreen, then the entire width of the computer  
screen should be filled, so for example, assuming the computer screen resolution is 1,024 x 768, then  
setting the image width at 1,024 pixels \(px\) will result in the entire width of the photo being  
projected and fitting perfectly onto the screen. If the image is a vertical one, then the same applies,  
so the image should be sized to 768 px in the vertical dimension depending on the computer resolution.  
It is preferable to crop in a photo-editing program rather than in PowerPoint because PowerPoint  
only resizes without reducing the image file size. Note that for higher resolution images from some  
of today’s digital cameras, computers will automatically downsize the image size to fit on the  
computer monitor. Unfortunately, keeping that resolution—and corresponding large file size—will  
not necessarily result in a better image onscreen. That is a function of the projector resolution  
\(see Section 4.5.2.1\).  
# 4.3.1.2 Image resolution  
For onscreen presentations, the best resolution is 72 to 100 PPI and this is what should be set  
when cropping the photo in the photo-editing program. This allows for optimum clarity and minimum  
file size.  
# 4.3.1.3 File format  
The enemy of effective smooth presentations is excessive file size as it slows them down. The preferred  
file format for projection is JPG \(also called JPEG\). This is a compressed file format, which means that  
it consumes less memory yet still delivers good quality. When saving re-sized files, the highest quality  
JPG option should be chosen. Although JPG files are the best for photos, a file format called GIF is  
best for images that have blocks of solid color like graphs or clip art. Like JPG, it does not take up  
excessive memory.  
# 4.3.1.4 Text and non-photographic material  
For non-photographic screen presentations within PowerPoint, there is a fundamental caution that what  
looks good on a computer screen may not look good on a large screen. Font types and sizes should be basic  
\(e.g. Arial or Times New Roman fonts\) with a minimum of bullets on a slide, these being large bullets.  
Contrast is best achieved with white or yellow text on a dark background. Finally, for logos or other  
graphics, it is best to avoid web-sourced, low resolution versions and opt for an original version from the  
artist if possible. See the discussion above for image resolution and sizing.  
# 4.3.1.5 Other image improvements  
Because projectors tend to darken images, it is better to increase the brightness during the initial  
editing process. Using the same photo-editing software \(e.g. Photoshop\), the brightness should  
be increased to more than would be appropriate for best viewing on the computer monitor but not  
enough to distort image details. Contrast between darks and lights should also be turned up as well  
as saturation. Finally, the image color profile should be converted to sRGB for best compatibility with  
the projector. Visual presentation teCHnology **153**  
# 4.3.1.6 Storage of digital still images  
Most still image files or slide show files like PowerPoint will be stored on USB flash drives, CDs/DVDs,  
or laptop computers for delivery to the event and the A-V engineer. Before delivery, the producer should  
determine that all files can be read by the host computer’s software used for the show \(i.e. that the host  
computer has a compatible and current version of PowerPoint or other slide show program\) or that all  
necessary connections are available for such options as running the presentation from an onstage laptop  
computer. It is wise to store a copy of any presentation and all image files online for easy access and  
download in case of emergency or loss of data.  
# 4.3.2 Pre-recorded digital video  
Thanks to smartphones, tablets, and the incorporation of high-quality video technology in every level of  
consumer camera, video is now an integral—and some might argue necessary—part of almost every special  
event. Whether the video originates from a mobile device, a video camera, a CD/DVD, or the Internet,  
producers and A-V engineers must have the necessary equipment available to successfully play back all  
these forms. Although the technology can be daunting, this section will attempt to simplify it to the point  
that any producer may be able to effectively communicate a client’s needs with the A-V subcontractor.  
Once again, to take a relevant point in time, we will only be concerned with digital video.  
By definition, “video is an electronic medium for the recording, copying and broadcasting of moving visual  
images” \(Video, 2014\). When we talk about video at the source, we are talking about two methods of  
playing it back for an audience. The first is from a stored video file pre-recorded on a DVD, computer, SD  
card, or other medium, and the second is as a magnified image \(IMAG or image magnification\) on a screen  
taken directly from a camera or multiple cameras recording live action. In this section we deal only with  
pre-recorded video and will cover IMAG in the next section.  
In order to easily follow the path of the video image from the source to the screen as in Figure 4.2, we  
must first fully understand how video works. The two main areas of concern for video to arrive at the final  
pre-recorded product \(i.e. a visual source\) are image acquisition and recording/storage.  
# 4.3.2.1 Image acquisition  
Since the optical front end of a digital video camera is almost identical to that of a digital still camera, we  
will not be concerned about the optics in this section but will concentrate on the electronic nature of the  
video signal.  
Video cameras incorporate sensors that convert incoming light to an electronic charge then convert the  
charge into a voltage. The voltage is digitized, stored in memory as an image, and then displayed on the  
camera’s liquid crystal display \(LCD\). Until recently, all video cameras used charge-coupled device \(CCD\)  
sensors. The advent of complementary metal oxide semiconductor \(CMOS\) technology changed this, however,  
and now the overwhelming majority of cameras have CMOS sensors, for the simple reason that they are  
easier to produce and hence cheaper to manufacture. They are also capable of higher shutter speeds than  
CCD cameras. It should be noted that the amount of detail recorded by a sensor is determined by the  
number of pixel sensors on its surface.  
Unlike digital still images in which the structure of the image is the same anywhere in the world, digital  
video has been influenced by television with the result that various groups of countries have dictated that  
digital video signals created within a camera—and played back by projectors and display equipment—must  
conform to certain structural standards. There are currently four standards in use\: Advanced Television  
Systems Committee \(ATSC\), mainly in North America, Mexico, and South Korea; Digital Video Broadcasting **154** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
\(DVB\), mainly in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia; Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting \(ISDB\),  
mainly in Central and South America, Japan, and some of Southeast Asia; and Digital Terrestrial Multimedia  
Broadcast \(DTMB\), mainly in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Fortunately, there  
is considerable compatibility among the standards, although still enough differences to cause concern if a  
video created on one system \(i.e. in a camera using those standards\) must be played back on another. The  
standards cover the following key aspects related to the acquisition of the video signal by a camera\:  
● Frame rate. Like a movie camera, a video camera takes a specific number of still pictures or frames, every  
second \(i.e. fps, the frame rate\). This, of course, is how the illusion of motion is created. For most video,  
this frame rate is either 25 or 30 fps. Which rate is used is dependent on the display standard—and the  
relevant equipment—in use in the particular country in which the video is recorded and played back.  
For example, one of the main remaining differences between ATSC and DVB standards is frame rate,  
with 25 in the case of DVB and 30 in the case of ATSC. Most professional video cameras, however, are  
capable of shooting at both frame rates.  
● Scanning and interlacing. For a video to be displayed on a screen, each frame must be “painted” on the  
screen or display surface. The method of doing this is called scanning. It started with the original  
video formats that were designed for use with cathode ray tube \(CRT\) televisions \(analog type\) on which  
the picture was displayed by an electron beam that projected one horizontal line of information  
at a time as it literally swept across the screen from left to right and top to bottom. The method is still  
in use today with digital video although the technology to actually imprint the image on the screen  
surface is complex and not related to this topic. We will delve into it a little in Section 4.6 on display  
equipment.  
Today there are two methods of video scanning, interlaced and progressive. An interlaced display is one in  
which the horizontal scans skip every second line and return to the top to fill in the missing lines. This  
helps to smooth out motion and flicker. A progressive display is one in which each frame includes all  
the scan lines rather than every second one. The result is a much higher perceived resolution. To  
summarize what this means, to be effective as a device to accurately portray the motion recorded by the  
video, a television display or a monitor, for example, therefore has to produce at least 25 \(or 30 depending  
on the standard\) full-screen pictures per second \(i.e. 25 or 30 full scans\) to match the 25 frames taken  
by the video camera. Video sources that are listed with the letter “p” are called progressive scan signals,  
while sources that are listed with the letter “i” are called interlaced. Examples of these would be 480p,  
720p, 1080p, 480i, or 1080i. The numbers listed before the “p” or the “i” represent the number of scan  
lines the video source uses to reproduce the video, in other words, the resolution. This is one standard  
which is supported by both ATSC and DVB.  
● Resolution. For digital video, resolution is the number of horizontal pixels per scan line combined  
with the number of scan lines \(i.e. vertical pixels\), and the frame rate. These are expressed as  
combinations of three numbers and a letter indicating whether the scan is interlaced or progressive, as  
described above. For example, all standards support high-definition television \(HDTV\) resolutions up  
to 1,920 x 1,080p60 \(i.e. 1,920 px per scan line, with 1,080 scan lines in a progressive scan at  
60 frames per second, where the resolution of the display screen or television is 1,920 px wide by 1,080  
px high\). They also support the older, lower quality resolution of standard definition television \(SD\).  
See Figure 4.3.  
● Aspect ratio. Aspect ratio is the ratio of the width of a video or TV picture to the height, in other words  
the actual shape. Although there is no universal standard for aspect ratio, the most common ratios are  
4\:3 and 16\:9. Traditional analog televisions and computer screens were all 4\:3, but the newer HDTV  
models and almost all new computer screens are 16\:9. These can easily be seen by the screen resolution  
set up on a computer in terms of horizontal and vertical pixel counts. For example, a common resolution  
for analog video is 1,024 x 768 or 4\:3, but for digital such as the HDTV mentioned above, it is 1,920 x Visual presentation teCHnology **155**  
**Figure 4.3** Comparison of video resolutions/aspect ratios  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
1,080 or 16\:9. Unfortunately, when a video made on one system must be transferred to another system,  
there will necessarily be a loss of some of the actual picture if moving to a smaller size \(e.g. HDTV to  
NTSC, an older analog standard\), like trying to watch a full-screen version of a wide-screen movie  
specially formatted for an old 4\:3 analog TV set, or requiring a smaller picture if moving to a larger size.  
This effect is also illustrated in Figure 4.9 later on in the chapter. Once again, most video cameras have  
the option of shooting in either 4\:3 or 16\:9.  
The actual size of a video image displayed, however, is not necessarily restricted to these dimensions.  
In special events, with current panoramic projection technology, images covering entire walls may be  
projected and appear seamless, even though they are composed of multiple projected video images. See  
Section 4.5.3.  
Figure 4.3 compares different TV/video resolutions for different display standards and illustrates  
the aspect ratios of these common standards. We will be discussing the ultra HDTV in a later  
section.  
● Color encoding. Besides information about the size and resolution of the video picture, the video signal  
must also contain information about the color \(known as chrominance in video parlance\) and brightness  
\(known as luminance\). This is done by adding a small “packet” of information about the color and  
brightness to each line scanned. The way in which the color information is stored and carried with the  
other information is extremely complex and differs with each of the standards. The color and brightness  
information are then decoded at the receiving end \(e.g. television set\) by built-in electronics. The  
differing color encoding methods are one reason why video connectors are different for different types  
of video.  
It should be mentioned that the standards also cover the recording of audio tracks and the transmission  
of video signals \(including audio\) via mobile devices, satellite, and cable.  
# 4.3.2.2 Recording and storage  
Digital video requires a tremendous amount of storage capacity for the signal to be recorded and stored in  
its entirety on a medium \(e.g. card, disk, tape—more about this later\). For example, uncompressed 1,080i  
HD video recorded at 60 fps eats up 410 GB per hour of video. Likewise, the audio tracks recorded with  
the video take up a lot of storage space, although nowhere near as much as the video signal. For this reason,  
the video and audio information must be reduced in size to allow for more efficient storage. This process  
is called compression and the software that does it is referred to as a codec \(coder-decoder or compressor-  
decompressor\). This software is found within the video camera itself and it “compresses” the information; **156** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
it is also found within any playback unit \(e.g. computer\) and there it “decompresses” the information,  
basically turning it back into the full video signal.  
Once the information has been compressed, it is placed in a “container,” much like a zip file, and then all  
of this is stored on a medium \(all accomplished within the video camera itself\). Let us look at each of these  
in turn\:  
● Codec. The most common compression method used currently is MPEG-4, sometimes referred to as  
H.264 or MPEG-4 AVC \(Advanced Video Coding\). It is found in most professional cameras. H.264 is  
perhaps best known as being one of the video encoding standards for Blu-ray Discs; all Blu-ray Disc  
players must be able to decode H.264. It is also widely used by streaming Internet sources, such as  
videos from Vimeo, YouTube, and the iTunes Store; web software such as the Adobe Flash Player and  
Microsoft Silverlight; and also various HDTV broadcasts over terrestrial \(ATSC, ISDB-T, DVB-T, or  
DVB-T2\), cable \(DVB-C\), and satellite \(DVB-S and DVB-S2\). It is thus truly compatible with all the  
main digital video standards \(H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, 2014\). While there are other codecs \(e.g. Theora,  
VP8, DV, etc.\) for consumer and proprietary professional cameras, this is the one most commonly used.  
A codec is also applicable to the audio signal recorded with the video. Common audio codecs include  
MP3, AAC, and Vorbis.  
● Container. Basically, a container is what we associate with the file format. Containers “contain” the  
various components of a video\: the stream of images, the audio, and anything else. For example, you  
could have multiple soundtracks and subtitles included in a video file, if the container format allows it.  
Examples of popular containers are OGG, Matroska, AVI, and MPEG.  
One of the benefits to the MPEG-4 AVC codec is that it acts as video codec, audio codec, and container  
all in one. The file name for the MPEG-4 container is often called MP4 or .m4v.  
● Medium. This refers to the actual recording medium on which the container and its contents \(compressed  
video and compressed audio\) are stored. As with a still image digital camera, digital video cameras  
typically have similar cards. Examples include SD card, P2 card, Memory Stick, and others. This card  
can then be removed from the camera and the contents loaded into a computer \(i.e. video and audio  
decoded\) for further editing and processing.  
# 4.3.2.3 Video editing  
What we have described above really only gets to first base as far as creating a final video for an event. All  
the action takes place within the video camera but most people wishing to use a video in an event, such  
as a keynote speaker, will need to edit the raw footage down to something manageable and make it more  
attractive, perhaps adding fancy transitions between scenes, music, a voiceover, still images, and titles.  
Unlike the early days of video when a full studio was required to do this, almost anyone with a computer  
can now accomplish it with video-editing software.  
From lower end programs such as iMovie to heavy duty professional programs like Adobe Premiere Pro or  
Final Cut Pro X, high-quality final edited videos can be produced at home. The programs read the input  
video using a card reader \(e.g. SD card reader built into the computer\). They accept a wide variety of video  
file formats \(i.e. the “container” that holds the compressed video and audio information\) and with their  
own built-in codecs, decode the compressed information for editing. Such formats might include MPEG-4  
\(.m4v\), DV stream \(.dv\), Flash Video \(.flv\), Microsoft AVI \(.avi\), Windows Media \(.wmv\), QuickTime  
Movie \(.mov\), and many others.  
Once editing is complete, the video is compressed again into any one of a number of similar file formats  
using the software’s codecs. It can then be stored on different media such as USB flash drive, CD/DVD, Visual presentation teCHnology **157**  
or Blu-ray disc, using hardware built into the computer, or alternatively exported using WiFi or cable to  
the Internet \(e.g. YouTube, Vimeo, etc.\) or a mobile device \(e.g. smartphone or tablet\). The finished video  
is most likely to be given to the A-V engineer at an event as either an edited file on a USB, DVD, Blu-ray  
disc, or on a personal device \(e.g. laptop, smartphone, tablet\). From this the engineer must ensure that  
the video is playable and that the necessary playback equipment is available \(i.e. clean computer with  
software installed that can read and play the video for projection\).  
# 4.3.3 live video and image magnification \(imag\)  
Nothing makes an audience feel closer to the action than live video. Rock concerts, award shows, meetings,  
and conferences use this technology extensively. Image magnification is simply the projection on a large  
display, usually a screen, of whatever action is taking place onstage or elsewhere, and being filmed or  
videotaped by one or more live cameras. It applies well to events that have an audience of more than 400  
or 500 persons, and in venues that are very long and narrow, placing much of the audience at a distance  
from the stage. A live video presentation requires the consideration of four key aspects\: equipment choice,  
camera location\(s\), lighting, and personnel.  
# 4.3.3.1 Equipment  
The video camera is the first consideration. For purposes of this discussion, we will concentrate on only  
professional digital video cameras, sometimes called camcorders. In Section 4.3.2.1 we discussed how  
these cameras acquire the video image. Fortunately, today’s cameras are extremely versatile. They can  
record from the older standard definition \(SD\) of 480i/p or 576i/p right up to full high definition \(HD\)  
1,080i/p and also at either 50 or 60 fps, which makes them compatible with any of the current world  
standards. Quite simply, they can be used anywhere.  
Professional cameras also come equipped with remote control that allows the iris, black balance, white  
balance, and chroma \(color\) adjustments to be made remotely by another person. It is thus possible for  
another person to completely control the quality of an image on a screen without the cameraperson having  
to worry about it.  
Of course, to get the live image to a projector and screen entails the camera being physically connected to  
a video mixer and switcher and then to the projector \(more about this in Section 4.4\). Pro cameras have  
one or two outputs or physical connections—remember this is not the storage medium, which is something  
different, as explained above. The most common is a 75 ohm \(Ω\) Bayonet Neill–Concelman connector \(BNC\).  
This type of connector carries both the audio and video signals according to serial digital interface \(SDI\)  
standards established by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers \(SMPTE\) \(i.e. along an SDI  
cable\). Most consumer cameras use the High-Definition Multimedia Interface \(HDMI\) interface and connector.  
Also necessary is a good tripod for stability, equipped with a solid head that allows for pan \(movement on  
the horizontal axis\) and tilt \(movement on the vertical axis\) functions, and a spreader to keep the tripod  
legs in position.  
# 4.3.3.2 Locations  
Prior to the event, a decision will have to be made on the number of video cameras needed to cover the  
action. Often, if everything is taking place only in relatively fixed positions on a stage, one camera will  
suffice mounted on a tripod in a fixed position. The location of this position will be critical, with a position  
as close to the action as possible generally being the best. However, the decision will be impacted often by  
audience visibility of the action, as “close” usually means placing the camera and operator on a riser in the **158** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
middle of the venue mere feet \(meters\) from the stage, in turn obscuring some of the audience’s view and  
often blocking foot traffic to and from many of the seats. An option to this position is one at the rear of  
the venue, most likely on or near the technical riser. The disadvantage of this position is that it requires a  
longer lens which, coupled with the placement on a riser, can lead to shakiness of the final image caused  
by even the slightest movement of the riser, but the advantage is a shorter cable run. If possible, for  
optimum viewing, the height of any camera riser should take the camera on its tripod up to the eye level  
of any person onstage.  
If there is action taking place in the audience, if there is action taking place in more than one position  
onstage \(e.g. award winners are coming to the stage while someone is still announcing, or multiple  
entertainers are working at the same time\), if there are multiple focal points \(e.g. multiple stages\), or if  
there is a desire to shift the focus between different points of view purely for excitement and a more  
professional look, then more than one camera will be required. A two-camera shoot with one camera in a  
fixed position and one roving can often provide an adequate option with switching between the two points  
of view for excitement. More cameras naturally provide more creative options. One big advantage of live  
video, and particularly of using more than one camera, is that the event can be recorded for posterity for  
later TV viewing or even for selling or giving away copies of the event video.  
The most interesting shots for live entertainment are usually from the side of the stage or from a hand-held  
camera onstage. An additional stationary or hand-held camera in front of the stage can take care of lead  
singers or shots from the audience’s perspective.  
For speakers or awards presentations, a single camera in front of the stage, either stationary or roving, can  
usually cover all that is required, although a second camera adds interest and can be used for over-the-  
shoulder shots as in interview situations.  
See Figure 4.4. This image illustrates just such a camera position in front of the stage at an awards show.  
Also note the camera, a professional video camera \(Sony\). From this position an SDI cable \(BNC connection\)  
runs along the floor to the FOH position where the video signal goes through a switcher and is projected  
as IMAG.  
# 4.3.3.3 Lighting  
Correct lighting for live video is a high-priority production consideration. Because video cameras have  
much lower contrast or dynamic ranges than the human eye \(e.g. 100\:1 compared to 100,000\:1\), the  
lighting needs to be much brighter \(i.e. higher color temperature of around 3,600 Kelvin\) and the contrast  
between subjects \(e.g. entertainers or speakers\) and background \(e.g. black stage backdrop\) in order for  
the video images to look realistic and not be too dark. As will be explained in Chapter 5, this is best done  
with a combination of unfiltered light that provides at minimum a key light from one side, a fill light from  
90 degrees to the key, and a back light to help visually separate the background from the subject. The  
lighting director or supplier will need to know that live video is planned so that the correct color temperature  
luminaires are provided and placed in the appropriate locations for the shoot.  
# 4.3.3.4 Personnel  
For a professional live video presentation and IMAG, certain key personnel are required. They include\:  
● The director. This is the person who calls for camera shots and communicates with the technical director  
who actually works the controls on the switcher \(see Section 4.4\). These positions are often combined.  
The ability to think three to five shots ahead while communicating this information to the rest of the  
video team is the most important quality of a director, combined with knowledge of transition and shot Visual presentation teCHnology **159**  
**Figure 4.4** Main video camera position for imag  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
selection so as to enhance—not distract from—dance, drama, awards presentations, or whatever is  
happening onstage. Directors need to specify what shot is up, what is next, and what camera those shots  
are coming from, starting with the camera number and then describing the shot succinctly. A common  
type of instruction might be, “Standby two.” This informs the technical director and camera operators  
that camera two is about to be selected as the live camera. The technical director would bring this shot  
up in the preview monitor, and camera two’s operator would make sure his shot was stable. “Cut two”  
would instruct the technical director to perform a cut to that camera. “Dissolve two” would instruct the  
technical director to perform a dissolve transition to camera two.  
● The camera operator\(s\). The operator \(op\) is the person through whose eyes the audience sees. Even  
given the same direction, two camera ops will see and shoot somewhat differently. A good eye and an  
ability to concentrate and quickly follow directions are necessary for this position.  
● The shader. While the video director, technical director, and camera operators are all focusing on the  
shots and transitions between shots, another person, called a video engineer or shader, watches each  
shot as it is put on standby, and adjusts its color and brightness to match the previous shot. This is done  
through a camera control unit \(CCU\) which powers the camera and remotely controls camera settings.  
The shader may also be given the responsibility of operating DVD players or computers when pre-  
recorded footage is to be shown.  
● A grip. The grip makes sure camera cables don’t tangle and follows the camera operators around to  
do this. **160** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 4.3.3.5 Timecode  
“A timecode is a series of numbers generated in a controlled sequence by a timing system. In video and other  
recorded media, timecode can be added to a recording in order to facilitate logging, synchronization, file  
organizing, and searching” \(Wavelength Media, 2014\). It can be very useful when editing and combining  
multiple live videos \(i.e. IMAG\) from an event for posterity. As a simple example, it is the best way to  
ensure videos from different cameras are synchronized for speech or music. Professional cameras and video  
recorders are equipped with timecode generators and readers.  
Timecode can be overlaid on a video image or it can be hidden as data only. In either case every  
single frame of the video is marked with a unique timecode number. Video timecode follows the  
format\: HH\:MM\:SS\:FF, which means hours\:minutes\:seconds\:frames. For example\:  
00\:00\:01\:00 = 1 second  
00\:01\:00\:00 = 1 minute  
01\:37\:14\:07 = 1 hour, 37 minutes, 14 seconds and 7 frames  
The first three numbers are the same as normal clock time so they have maximum values of 23,  
59, and 59 respectively. The last number counts the number of video frames since the previous  
whole second, so \[its\] maximum value depends on the frame rate of the video system. In a  
system that uses 30 frames per second \(fps\), the maximum range is therefore 00\:00\:00\:00 to  
23\:59\:59\:29.  
\(Wavelength Media, 2014\)  
# 4.3.4 4K and 8K ultra-high-definition \(uhD\) video  
New industry buzzwords are 4K and 8K ultra-high-definition video and TV. What are they? Quite simply,  
they represent full HD \(FHD\) taken to a new level of resolution. 4K provides a resolution of 3,840 x 2,160  
pixels, or four times as much detail as 1,080p FHD. In the movie business, the 4K resolution refers to  
4,096 x 2,160. Going further, 8K provides a resolution of 7,680 x 4,320 pixels, or 16 times as much detail  
as FHD. Fortunately for future equipment compatibility, both 4K and 8K remain at the 16\:9 aspect ratio.  
See Figure 4.3 for a comparison of these resolutions.  
It should be noted that 4K has been around for a few years; the first commercially available 4K camera for  
cinematographic purposes was released in 2003, several major motion pictures have been shot in 4K since  
2009, YouTube began supporting 4K for video uploads in 2010, 4K home theater projectors have been on  
offer since 2012, and consumer 4K televisions are already selling for under \$1,000.  
What does this mean for the future of video in special events? First, if 4K is to act as a visual source for  
events—and it surely soon will, both as live and edited video—it means new equipment and standards.  
New equipment includes specialized cameras to shoot at the new resolution. It also includes projectors  
capable of accepting the new signal, as well as the associated codecs. It means larger screens, because the  
higher pixel density of a 4K panel also enables one to get much closer without the grid-like structure of  
the image itself becoming visible. This means one can comfortably watch a much larger screen from the  
same seating position as for an FHD panel. Currently all available 4K UHD TVs are in excess of 50 in.  
\(Rivington, 2014\). Again, Figure 4.3 gives an idea of the increase in screen size possible to clearly see the  
same image from UHD video compared to FHD video. The potential for stunning graphics and panoramic  
screen videos at special events, especially in smaller venues, is thus very exciting.  
At the time of writing, UHD standards from all the standards groups were still under development,  
although narrowing in on a new codec called High Efficiency Video Coding \(HEVC\)/H.265. There are also  
few consumer computers with the graphic card capacity to edit video files of this size, and cable does not Visual presentation teCHnology **161**  
yet have the bandwidth to deliver 4K. Obviously, there is still a way to go. Of course, the challenges of  
dealing with the sheer size of files leave the successful use of 8K in special events still farther in the future.  
# 4.3.5 Projection mapping  
Projection mapping is another exciting source of visual material for special events. From early experiments  
in the theater through the son et lumière shows originating in the 1960s, projection onto large and unusual  
surfaces has always fascinated audiences. Today’s versions far surpass those early shows. Although it goes  
by several names \(e.g. older terms like video mapping or spatial augmented reality\), 3D projection mapping  
is the art and science behind creating projected visual effects on three-dimensional objects. “Mapping”  
visuals to fit an object creates the illusion that the light cast by the projector is actually emanating from  
the object itself. It is best known for outdoor projection mapping on a building, featuring specific content  
designed to highlight the building’s architectural features \(e.g. outlining windows, tracing bricks, and  
effects where content builds and collapses\). This type is sometimes called architectural mapping. It has been  
used on surfaces that range from Egyptian temples, historic castles, and mosques to cars and everything  
in between. 4D mapping extends 3D by utilizing additional sensory effects to heighten and accentuate  
illusions. This includes temperature, scent, interactive controls, fireworks, and water effects.  
Figure 4.5 illustrates a projection mapping installation in which a hotel’s wall appears to be crumbling.  
This was a relatively small project at the Westin Kierland Resort & Spa in Arizona, United States. Created  
by a project team from PaintScaping, it used only a single Christie Roadster HD 18,000 lumen projector.

According to specialist mapping company Christie Digital Systems USA, Inc., “The big driver behind  
projection mapping projects is using compelling visuals, blended with stories, information and even calls  
to action, to create profound experiences” \(Christie Digital Systems USA, Inc., 2013\). However, the  
finished product is not as simple to create as it looks. There are several important considerations for a  
successful mapping project, and we will review them so producers at least have a basic knowledge when  
clients come asking for this amazing technology. The information in Sections 4.3.5.1 through 4.3.5.3 has  
been provided courtesy of Christie Digital Systems USA, Inc., copyright 2013. All rights are reserved.  
# 4.3.5.1 Show content and objectives  
Projection mapping involves a considerable amount of time and money to build a show. It is essential to  
understand both the objectives of the show and the audience if the best technical and creative work is to  
be done.  
● Objectives. The outcome can be generating excitement and viral buzz about the public launch of a new  
consumer product or brand. But it can as easily be an effort to help make an audience aware of a  
milestone—like a centennial—and reflect that in visuals that make people both appreciate and understand  
the significance. It can be a monumental statement or used to help create or complement an environment,  
such as ambient visuals for a party. In those cases, the visuals are intended as accents that energize the  
space and set a tone but are not intended as focal points.  
● Audience. Many questions need to be asked and explored about the audience for a projection mapping  
project. These include\:  
● How large is the crowd? Are they seated or standing? How far back will they be?  
● How wide is the viewing zone and will those at the sides see the visuals properly?  
● Does the performance include audio and if so, what’s the audio delivery technology?  
● Is this a scheduled performance that people come to watch with a hard start and finish or is it  
intended as continuous ambient material? Or something else?  
● Do the content plans and objectives make sense for the composition of the expected audience and  
the tone of the event? \(e.g. Is what’s planned appropriate?\)  
● Are there any aspirations to make the event interactive with audience participation through gestures,  
sound, or other means?  
Once these questions are out of the way, then the actual content can be considered. It begins by gaining a  
complete understanding of the structure that will act as the display surface.  
# 4.3.5.2 Structure and location  
Before any creative programming can begin, the structure being mapped must be studied thoroughly as  
well as the surrounding area so that camera positions can be determined. Some of the considerations  
include\:  
● Characteristics of the structure. How will its contours, shades, and physical properties affect the ability  
to deliver a compelling visual spectacle? Traditional projection works with flat, planar surfaces that offer  
uniformity and a surface optimized for visuals. Projection mapping is almost invariably applied to  
surfaces that are not flat or uniform, or in some cases, even solid. Projections have been done successfully  
on vapor screens created by water jets.  
Ancient castles, cathedrals, and massive, complicated, and modern structures present endless variations  
in surfaces, color, and dimension. A castle will have different types and shades of stone, as well as Visual presentation teCHnology **163**  
crenels, merlons, slits, hoardings, rounded towers, and curtain walls that somehow have to be unified  
for a cohesive visual presentation.  
If the surfaces are outside, the color may change when it rains and make a light surface dark and the  
projection muted.  
Ultra-modern structures, like the sails of Sydney’s iconic opera house or cylindrical curves of New York’s  
Guggenheim Museum, present a uniform color palette, but are anything but flat, requiring precision  
scaling, warping, and blending \(see Section 4.5.3\).  
Even the tall, rectangular modern office towers in city centers around the world present challenges.  
They’re usually flat and uniform, but the glass of the office windows—or the full tower façade—can’t  
reflect light. Projections pass through unless the glass gets a layer of reflective film or scrim.  
Finally, the sheer scale of the targeted surface will dictate how many projectors, and what kind of lighting  
power, will be needed.  
● Site conditions. Technology and creativity can overcome the characteristics of most structures and  
objects targeted for projection mapping projects, but a thorough site inspection at the start of any project  
is essential.  
Both the technical and creative leads \(part of the projection mapping company team\) need to inspect  
the site and the environmental and physical conditions that can affect the presentation and technical  
operations.  
Those considerations include\:  
● the amount of ambient, surrounding light;  
● obstructions on the projection path, such as trees, streetlights, and power poles;  
● for live performances, the movement of people potentially in the projection path;  
● the distance, location, and height of projector positions, which informs decisions on the brightness  
and number of projectors needed, as well as the lenses and media devices;  
● power availability;  
● weather conditions, not just temperatures and moisture, but wind as well \(note that mapping can  
work in rain but not snow\);  
● rooftop access or line of sight window access.  
● Local approvals. Projects in public spaces will almost invariably be subject to the rules and regulations  
of local governments, and those can vary considerably even within the same metropolitan area.  
Bylaws affecting advertising, lighting, noise, temporary structures, public gatherings, traffic, and parking  
may all affect not only the scale of a project, but also whether it will even be allowed. It may take multiple  
approvals, because of jurisdictional rules and coverage, to get approval for one event.  
Involving someone on the project team familiar with the local government and its regulations is often  
critical to executing a project, particularly on the planned timeline.  
● Timelines. Every project is unique, but more time for planning, development, and execution tends to  
have direct ties to excellence.  
Projection mapping projects have been pulled off in as short a period as one week, but industry experts  
prefer to have much more time to fully deliver on objectives, as well as control costs and minimize chaos.  
The most ambitious projects can take a year or longer from the idea stage to the event launch. Some  
have taken many years in planning and approvals.  
Integrators and staging companies can often respond on relatively short notice, but what truly takes  
time is the creative. Minutes of motion graphics and video can require weeks or months of work to take  
through the idea stage, storyboard concepts, drafts, revisions, rendering, and testing. Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**164** In rare cases, creative is available that readily translates to the targeted projection surface. But projection  
mapping done well is much more than finding a massive surface to run broadcast or online creative.  
The best projects use structures as so much more than screens.  
Local approvals can also stretch timelines because of paperwork, process, and even public hearings.  
# 4.3.5.3 Budget  
Brighter projectors and software are steadily reducing costs on projects by illuminating a broader  
surface with fewer projectors and either automating or greatly simplifying many of the planning and setup  
tasks—like alignment—that historically have required many man-hours. But some things such as creative  
costs can’t easily be resolved through technology.  
The good news is that the producers of most projects—unless they are designed to be permanent—can  
limit capital costs by renting the projectors, related technology, structures, and other gear required to  
execute an event.  
Once a site survey is done, an experienced producer will have the knowledge and tools to estimate how  
many projectors will be needed and what supporting infrastructure is required onsite. The producer,  
creative director, and client need to then collaborate and reach decisions on the breadth and complexity of  
the creative, which will help arrive at an estimate on those costs.  
Because of the complexity of projection mapping projects, and since no two projects are alike, each  
installation requires careful budgeting so that costs can be contained while achieving a spectacular show.  
Depending on the requirements, an installation may also require as much coordination and equipment as  
a major public concert in an urban area.  
However, experience is showing tangible returns in ways such as earned media from both mainstream and  
social media. The buzz from big events has direct monetary value. The organizer of a massive projection  
event in Moscow for Russia’s Alfa-Bank suggested, for example, the overall costs were in line with a month-  
long national TV and outdoor ad campaign, but probably much more effective in media terms.  
# 4.3.5.4 Software and equipment  
Mapping relies on specialized software that can alter and distort projection content in real time, allowing  
the creation of mapping effects that work over and around architectural idiosyncrasies. Popular mapping  
software includes D3, Resolume Arena, VDMX, and Madmapper. Often, the programming is done on a  
stand-alone media server designed for highly reliable playback for a show. It includes mapping software for  
content mapping. Popular brands of media server include Pandora’s Box and the Hippotizer. The term  
“media server” may alternately be used to refer to a conventional computer running mapping software.  
Other main equipment consists mainly of projectors. Projection mapping may use as few as one or two  
projectors to as many as 30 or more for a single project. Most large-venue projectors used in projection  
mapping are 20,000 lumens or brighter. They also accept up to 4K UHD video signals. These projectors are  
by no means easily portable, topping out at anywhere from about 160 to 300 lb \(72.6 to 136.8 kg\) in weight  
and up to almost 5 ft \(1.5 m\) in depth. Input typically comes via BNC and HDMI connections from cameras,  
Ethernet for networking with other projectors, and Video Graphics Array \(VGA\) or Digital Visual Interface  
\(DVI\) for connecting to host computers. See Section 4.5 for more information on projectors.  
Quite often, projectors must be stacked on scaffolding and protected from the weather. Power may need  
to be from portable units brought in for the project \(see Chapter 9 for more details on portable power and  
scaffolding\). These setups may have to go in awkward locations like the tops of buildings opposite the  
surface used for projection, hence the need for extensive pre-planning. Visual presentation teCHnology **165**  
If there is one important recommendation from this section, it is that any mapping project be handled by  
a company that specializes in it since it is far too complex to be done by most A-V suppliers, although they  
may be able to supply the projectors and associated connection hardware.

**DM**\: What are some of the major changes you have seen in the use of video in special events in the  
last five to ten years \(e.g. wide screen, edge blending, projection mapping, switching technology,  
etc.\) and how have these affected the industry? **166** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**BC**\: Technical innovation has made integrating video into special events much more practical  
and impactful in the last five to ten years. Costs have fallen dramatically and equipment now is  
smaller, more flexible, and easier to use. Multiple screen surfaces, wide screens, led screens,  
projection mapping, and custom projection surfaces have allowed more creative ways of sharing  
visual content with the audience. Instead of the presentation being just a much larger version of  
a computer screen, we turn it into an experience. Display surfaces that wrap around the audience  
help to involve attendees and make them feel more like a participant than a viewer.  
High-definition cameras, graphics, video playback, and projection allow for greater detail, stunning  
imagery, and a level of control of the video image that was only dreamed of a decade ago. No  
longer is a video image projected on a screen as part of a set, video **is** the set so the look and feel  
of the room can change instantly in an infinite variety of ways. In many cases the size of a display  
can actually be reduced due to greater clarity, and we are using video where it couldn’t be a con-  
sideration a few years ago. HD has allowed high-quality wide-screen content to be produced at  
much lower cost. And video post cards** **are being used as “save-the-date” announcements and  
invitations.  
One of the biggest changes is in mobile engagement. People are always looking at their screens,  
so instead of telling people to put away their phone we now remind them to turn on their phones  
as part of the event. Social media, texting, and real-time display of collaboration and participant  
polls in the venue and on display surfaces involve the audience further in a presentation. Using  
mobile devices for voting allows for real-time collaboration and feedback in what otherwise might  
have been a one-way message.  
**DM**\: What changes do you see coming in event video over the next five to ten years?  
**BC**\: Advances in led technology will allow for more compact projection and improved color ren-  
dering over non-Xenon lamp sources. Better tools will be available for mapping projection images  
on dimensional surfaces. But since integrating video throughout an event is no longer technically  
or cost prohibitive, I think just like mood lighting, “Mood Video” will fast become the dominant  
special event design tool, with video covering every surface within a guest’s view. In events of the  
future, we will walk on video and we will sit on video. Buffet linen will actually be made of flexible  
Organic led \(oled\) video screen material that can instantly change color, pattern, or images.  
Event performers will wrap themselves in video wear and become flexible design elements. Video  
will drive the event experience and make distance irrelevant allowing global participation.  
**DM**\: From your experience working with both event planners and event producers \(producers  
generally being more technical than planners\), what would you say is the minimum knowledge  
base for both in terms of event video? In other words, how much should they understand the  
equipment and what it does?  
**BC**\: They should both understand the different types of video technology, what differentiates it,  
and when it’s appropriate. An event producer needs to understand more about how it actually  
works, as they need to be able to talk about content, work on cueing, and will likely “call” the  
show. They need to be able to intelligently discuss appropriate timeframes for creating content  
and how much content costs to produce. They need to be able to serve as a liaison between  
client and artists. So it stands to reason that the more you know and understand video the more  
effectively you’ll create with it. Visual presentation teCHnology **167**  
# 4.3.6 interactive content  
In Chapters 1 and 2, we discussed the increasing use of mobile applications as both entertainment and  
décor. In many of these cases, this required the projection of crowd-sourced material from smartphones  
or tablets on a display surface, either a screen or a wall. While very much still in its infancy, this technology  
is expected to grow quickly. These mobile apps are therefore at the point in their evolution where they  
now become visual sources themselves.  
This section explores how that can be done. For example, with an audience polling application, how do  
the results get instantly posted onto a screen? Or for a participative audience game, how does it get  
projected onto a screen in real time? Here are some of the possible sources for display and how that display  
is accomplished.  
# 4.3.6.1 Audience response systems  
Audience response and polling have been around for several years but have only recently been applied  
using smartphones and tablets rather than proprietary and dedicated voting keypads. The scenarios in  
which polling is most used are in a classroom teaching situation and in a conference venue as part of a  
conference speaker’s presentation. Most such current systems are software-based and rely on WiFi or  
General Packet Radio Service \(GPRS\) signals \(i.e. cell phone networks\). Audience members must download  
an application for their smartphones or tablets that works with special audience response software \(ARS\) that  
the presenter loads on his/her computer. The ARS collects participant data, displays graphical polling  
results, and exports the data to be used in reporting and analysis. Usually the presenter can create  
and deliver the presentation with the ARS software, either as a stand-alone presentation platform or  
as a plug-in to PowerPoint or Keynote. A standard projector and connections would suffice to project  
the presentation.  
# 4.3.6.2 Live audience gaming  
Of course mobile gaming has been extremely successful on an individual device basis. But what if a client  
wants to let the entire audience play the game at once? There are some companies that have developed  
such capabilities and there is much more to come. Let’s take a brief look at how some of these games work\:  
● Multiple choice and simple questions. The simplest of gaming is just a takeoff from audience polling,  
for example trivia-type games that require multiple-choice answers. This can be extended to create  
teams but still uses the same basic software. Many of these still use proprietary keypads emitting RF or  
infra-red \(IR\) signals, which require base stations to accept the incoming signals. However, mobile  
device-based games are software-driven, the technical setup is straightforward, and only the host  
computer needs to be connected to the projector. Again, these use either WiFi or GPRS signals.  
A slight variation on this technology uses separate wands that have different colors painted on each of  
two sides instead of keypads or smartphones. Video cameras in front of the audience record the colors  
displayed by the audience and feed the results to a computer program that either chooses an answer or  
moves something onscreen based on audience response.  
● Gesture recognition and motion tracking. Gesture recognition gaming involves the use of hand, arm,  
leg, and finger movements as well as facial expressions to control software. It is essentially the reverse  
of showing a video to an audience in that it relies on taking a video of the audience and feeding their  
movements into a program that interprets them in order to make decisions for the movement of  
something like racing cars or even “Angry Birds” on a large screen or other display surface. There are  
limited such games presently in existence but the number is expected to grow as gesture recognition  
software improves and moves beyond 2D into 3D, which typically would require a camera positioned Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**168** to record gestures in the third dimension \(e.g. mounted on the ceiling above the audience as well as in  
front of the audience\) \(Strickland, 2012\). Other than the regular connections between cameras and  
computers, no special hardware is required, only very sophisticated software.  
● Connected play. Connected play advances the software to beyond simple questions answered on mobile  
devices or body gestures and integrates actual games played on multiple audience devices. This software  
allows those multiple inputs to be displayed onscreen for the entire audience to see. This could include  
drawing software that displays designs on a wall or full video games. Again, projector connection should  
be straightforward from one or more computers as this is mainly software-driven. In some cases,  
proprietary hardware may be required to capture WiFi signals before processing them in the software.  
This is somewhat similar to the concept of second screen in which TV viewers—or event attendees for  
that matter—can interact with regular TV programs or with event speakers through their mobile devices  
as they watch \(Second screen, 2014\).  
# 4.3.7 the Internet  
One important source of visuals for events is the Internet. Such things as podcasts, Skype, Facetime,  
YouTube, and others have made the Internet ubiquitous in our daily lives and created additions to  
presentations for such people as keynote speakers and educators. Most of these types of pre-recorded or  
live videos will be from a unique computer, either a presenter’s or one provided by the A-V company. This  
has more or less replaced old-style videoconferencing with its multiple video cameras. The only requirement  
is for the receiving computer to be connected to the projector via a mixer/switcher so that the entire  
audience can see the conversation or pre-recorded video.  
# 4.4 control and distribution  
With the plethora of different visual sources possible at a special event, all with potentially different signal  
types and standards, there has to be some method of controlling the various inputs and ensuring they get  
mixed or displayed on the right screens or devices at the right time. Fortunately, what used to be a mass  
of separate specialized equipment has now been integrated into a single unit known as a digital video mixer  
or switcher. Some models integrate only video signals while others also incorporate a small audio mixer.  
For purposes of this discussion, we will deal with the switcher portion of the equipment since audio was  
covered in Chapter 3.  
A switcher has several key functions that used to be separate. They include\:  
● Splitting signals. This function allows any given signal to be fed to two or more displays while maintaining  
original signal quality. An example might be in a classroom setting with an instructor’s computer and  
multiple monitors for students, or for a special event that has a number of monitors in different rooms.  
It is accomplished with a video distribution amplifier \(VDA\).  
● Scaling. A video scaler is a system which converts video signals from one display resolution to another;  
typically, scalers are used to convert a signal from a lower resolution \(e.g. 480p standard definition\) to  
a higher resolution \(e.g. 1,080i high definition\), a process known as upconversion or upscaling \(by contrast,  
converting from high to low resolution is known as downconversion or downscaling\) \(Video scaler, 2014\).  
● Scan conversion. This is also built-in hardware that converts a video signal into a format compatible  
with a specific type of display. For example, it can convert different analog or digital video signals into  
a signal compatible with a particular projector or large monitor.  
● Compositing. This feature is a creative one. It allows such things as the application of layers to the image  
such as a picture-in-picture, keying a graphic over the top of the image, or putting a logo in a corner of  
a screen. Visual presentation teCHnology **169**  
● Switching. The actual switching for which the device was named enables multiple video and audio  
signals to be selected and sent to one or more display devices. These switchers accept audio/video  
signals from a range of input sources—computers, cameras, DVD players, tablets, etc.—and route the  
output to different destinations, such as projectors and monitors.  
In summary, the latest and greatest of these mixer/switchers are capable of accepting HD and SD video,  
both interlaced and progressive, video of different standards, computer inputs, live camera inputs, mobile  
device inputs, and more. Likewise, they can output to projectors, monitors, video walls, mobile devices,  
the Internet, and recording devices \(occasionally built-in\). They can also program transitions and effects  
as well as creative input for split screen displays and edge blending for wide screens. As if that were not  
enough, they can memorize settings for later recall.  
# P r od u c t i o n Wa r S t o ry  
# The deadly screen wipe  
It was the middle of a keynote address to a major conference about human interaction and training.  
Several of the 500 audience members had already begun to doze off as the PowerPoint slides  
rolled on. The speaker was nearing a critical juncture in his speech. It was deadly serious.  
I was at the back of the room sipping coffee and talking to someone. I had ceased paying attention  
to the presentation, as all I had to do was ensure that the A-V components functioned properly,  
which included the audio, lighting, and projector systems. Everything appeared to be well under  
control, that is until a collective guffaw arose from the suddenly wide-awake audience.  
The speaker stopped mid-sentence. He looked stunned.  
“Was that what I think it was?” he asked the audience as he glanced over his shoulder at the  
screen behind him.  
Amidst the snickers I heard, “Yup.” “It was.” “Oops.” “That was weird.”  
Feeling a little dumb, I asked, “What happened?” to a woman in the last row of seats.  
“You mean you didn’t see that?” she answered. “A silhouette of a nude dancer cartwheeled across  
the screen just as the speaker was going to give us the main message. It was hilarious. A bit of bad  
timing, though. Someone’s going to be in trouble.”  
I glanced up and realized that someone was me.  
Up until that time, I had only known my client as an easygoing, affable woman. Apparently she had  
another side, and that side was clearly broadcast by the expression of rage on her face. Within  
seconds she was at the control desk.  
“What the hell was that?” she asked. “It was inexcusable.” Her face was red and she was shaking.  
This didn’t look good.  
My video technician, who controlled the PowerPoint projection, looked sheepish. “Sorry, I pushed  
the wrong button.” At least he was smart enough to own up to it, since he was the only one at the  
controls. I knew I should have been watching him more closely.  
My client’s gaze drilled through me. “You make bloody sure that doesn’t happen again. I don’t  
want any more glitches.” **170** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
By now the humor of what had happened struck me and I had trouble stifling a giggle as I  
responded, “We will. No problem.” The irony of the blunder was that it might very well cement  
the speaker’s message in the audience’s memory better than anything could, but I didn’t offer that  
viewpoint to my client.  
A couple of minutes later, I retreated to a distant corner and laughed out loud. The juxtaposition  
of the serious presentation with the crazy screen wipe just wouldn’t leave my mind. Someone,  
though—and probably something—had to be sacrificed.  
I never hired the video technician again. But, being a businessman and wanting to stay* *in business,  
I offered my client a substantial discount and an apology. Her response was unusual.  
“Tell you what,” she said. “Why don’t you just bill us for the entire amount and then give your  
discount to our charity?”  
“Great idea.” I’d never thought of that as a way out. “I will.”  
A week later I received an accolade letter and a nice jacket with the charity’s logo on it. Apparently,  
they liked my “proactive mindset.”  
I learned a lesson about supervision—and how easy it is for technology to turn against you—but  
I still chuckle about the screen wipe.

# 4.5 Projection equipment  
Following our initial simple signal path illustrated in Figure 4.2, the next step after the visual source has  
been processed in the mixer/switcher is projection of the visual image. This section deals with the case in  
which the projection technology is separate from the display technology. In other words, we are concerned  
with how a video/data projector—or simply “projector”—is able to project an image on a screen, a wall,  
or other surface that has no inherent display technology itself.  
Projector technology, like all others, is advancing rapidly. Projectors may be required to project full HD  
video, 4K HD video, 3D projection mapping projects, or even simple PowerPoint slide shows. It is helpful  
if the event producer is able to understand the basics of today’s projectors in order to better choose the  
right one for a client’s needs and to better understand the job of the A-V company. To help with this we  
will look at projector types and capabilities.  
# 4.5.1 types of projectors  
There are four main types of video and data projectors currently in use\: LCD, DLP, LED, and Laser  
projectors. Each has advantages and disadvantages, based on the technology. Sections 4.5.1.1 through  
4.5.1.3 are provided courtesy of eBay \(eBay, 2014\).  
# 4.5.1.1 LCD projector  
These projectors utilize liquid crystal display \(LCD\) technology. An LCD is a thin, flat display device made  
up of any number of color or monochrome pixels arrayed in front of a light source or reflector. The  
technology is used in watches, smartphones, and other electronic devices. Visual presentation teCHnology **171**  
Most LCD projectors use 3 LCD technology, a patented system that combines three liquid crystal displays.  
An image is created in a multistep process, which begins with the light source providing a beam of white  
light. The white light is passed to three mirrors \(called dichroic mirrors\) that are specially shaped to reflect  
only a certain wavelength of light. In this case, the mirrors reflect red, blue, and green wavelengths. Each  
beam of colored light is then fed to an LCD panel, which receives an electrical signal that tells it how to  
arrange the pixels in the display to create the image. All three LCD panels create the same image, but they  
have different hues because of the colored light passing through the panel. The images then combine in a  
prism, creating a single image with up to 16.7 million colors that is passed through the lens and projected  
onto the screen.  
LCD projectors have been around since the 1980s, and the technology is more reliable than film projectors.  
However, they may still require maintenance, as pixels can burn out and dust particles can interfere with  
image quality. On the other hand, LCD projectors have no moving parts, as DLP projectors do, and they  
are generally less expensive than their DLP counterparts. They also support setups in larger rooms where  
a greater projection distance is needed, because they are compatible with zoom lenses and lens shifts.  
# 4.5.1.2 DLP projector  
Digital light processing \(DLP\), a technology developed by Texas Instruments, forms the core of this type of  
projector.  
In DLP projectors, the image is created by 2 million microscopically small mirrors, no wider than one-fifth  
the width of a human hair, laid out in a matrix on a semiconductor chip, known as a Digital Micromirror  
Device \(DMD\). Each mirror in this chip is capable of independent adjustment, moving toward or away from  
the light source to create a dark or light pixel. At this point, however, the image is in grayscale. Color is  
fed to the DMD by a beam of light that passes through a spinning color wheel before it reaches the chip.  
Each segment of the color wheel delivers one color. Basic color wheels support red, blue, and green,  
whereas more advanced color wheels support cyan, magenta, and yellow. While these chips can create up  
to 16.7 million colors, a DLP projector with a three-chip architecture can deliver up to 35 trillion colors.  
A three-chip DLP projector uses a prism to split light from the lamp, and each primary color of light is  
then routed to its own DLP chip, then recombined and routed out through the lens.  
DLP projectors require less maintenance than LCD projectors because they have a filter-free and sealed  
chip design, which means dust can’t settle on the chip and cause an image spot. They are effectively  
immune to color decay. Furthermore, they are not subject to the misalignments that can occur in LCD  
projectors with a three-panel design, which require each panel to be in perfect position to combine the  
image at the proper angle. They are also better for live video and other moving images. However, DLP  
projectors with slower color wheels may give off a rainbow effect; flashes of color that appear on the screen,  
like rainbows. There is also some fan noise and lamp replacement can be expensive. However, the  
introduction of LEDs and lasers as light sources has eliminated all these disadvantages to the point that  
DLP projectors are now the most prevalent in the higher-end market \(see the next two sections\).  
# 4.5.1.3 LED projector  
Light-emitting diode \(LED\) projectors—sometimes known as lamp-free—are defined not by the display  
technology used, but the lighting. In fact, some DLP projectors with solid-state illumination technology are  
actually LED projectors. Another type of projector, the pico projector, commonly uses LED technology as  
well. Pico projectors are essentially handheld devices that use LCoS \(liquid crystal on silicon, which is similar  
to an LCD panel but reflective rather than transmissive\) or DLP technology. In these cases, the projector  
replaces the traditional lamp with longer-lasting and more efficient LEDs, colored in red, green, and blue. **172** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
In DLP projectors, this also replaces the color wheel technology, instead letting the red, blue, and green  
LEDs shine directly on the DMD chip.  
The LEDs in an LED projector have a much longer life than traditional projector lamps, rated  
at 10,000 or even 20,000 h as opposed to 1,000 to 5,000 h. As such, the LED light source is  
meant to last the entire life of the projector without ever needing to be replaced. This is a big  
advantage because replacing traditional lamps can be a major expense in projector maintenance.  
There is no warm-up or cool-down time needed because the LEDs are much more energy efficient  
than traditional light sources, and they are also much quieter. This reduces maintenance and  
operating costs.  
\(eBay, 2014\)  
See also Section 4.6.4 for more explanation of LEDs.  
# 4.5.1.4 Laser projector  
In a modern laser projector,  
red, green, and blue laser beams each fall upon a separate spatial light-modulator chip. For each  
of these colors, the corresponding spatial light modulator determines, for every pixel of every  
frame, how much light of that color gets reflected through the projector optics to the screen. The  
path length for each colored beam from the modulator chip to the projection optics must be the  
same, so that the three images focus on the same plane.  
\(Beck, 2014\)  
Due to the special features of laser projectors, such as a high depth of field, it is possible to project images  
or data onto any kind of projection surface, even non-flat. Typically, the sharpness, color space, brightness,  
and contrast ratio are higher than those of other projection technologies. Future laser projectors are  
expected to have brightness well over 50,000 lumens, up to a 12-yr life for the light source, a much higher  
frame rate, and overall low maintenance \(Beck, 2014\).  
# 4.5.2 Key specifications for projectors  
For special events, projectors need to do many things, from projecting PowerPoint text in a small, darkened  
meeting room for 30 people, to projecting DVD movies or live video in an open-air, day-lit stadium for an  
audience of 60,000. No single projector will handle all these situations and the choice will depend on the  
key specifications of the projector, these of course being driven by the design technology discussed above.  
Listed below are these key specs.  
# 4.5.2.1 Resolution and aspect ratio  
Projectors use rows of pixels to make the images seen onscreen. The clarity of the image depends on how  
many pixels are projected and it is measured by projector resolution. The resolution that is built into the  
projector is dependent on the technology discussed previously and is called the projector’s native resolution.  
It is measured as the number of pixels across the screen and then down the screen and the ratio between  
the two numbers is the aspect ratio. For example, many consumer projectors have native resolutions of  
1,024 x 768 or 1,600 x 1,200. What this means is that the projector will itself scale any image it receives  
from a computer to its native resolution. Thus, if the file it receives is 4,000 px x 3,000 px, it will scale it  
down to 1,024 x 768. Although projectors will accept resolutions other than their native resolution, for  
example displaying an HD video at 1,920 x 1,080 resolution on a 1,024 x 768 XGA projector, the best  
viewing will be at the native resolution because the projector must scale up or down to be able to show Visual presentation teCHnology **173**

other resolutions and this can result in a loss of quality. Scaling down is usually less problematic than  
scaling up or, simply put, “a larger video signal with more information will look good on larger screens  
and anything smaller. Conversely, a smaller image will only look good on a smaller screen. It doesn’t have  
enough information to upscale properly” \(Shreve, 2013\). However, if a mixer/switcher is used, any scaling  
will probably be done with it, but it is always best to try to match the visual source resolution with the  
projector resolution.  
Table 4.1 summarizes the most common projector aspect ratios, resolutions, projector classes, and  
applications.  
# 4.5.2.2 Brightness  
The brightness of a projector is measured in lumens, a term discussed in Chapter 5 that indicates the  
intensity of a light source. In the case of a projector, this is the lamp or other light source. In fact, technically  
speaking, “brightness” is the measure of light leaving a surface being illuminated and is not measured in  
lumens but in foot-lamberts, so this can be a source of some confusion.  
The venue size \(i.e. audience size\), screen size, and ambient light are what will determine the brightness  
required. Most professional projectors for business uses are in the 2,000 to 5,000 lumens range, which is  
good for large venues and relatively subdued ambient lighting. If the lighting approaches daylight \(e.g. in  
an outdoor stadium or brightly lit room\), a higher rating is required. Some high-end professional projectors  
are available with 35,000 lumens for just these conditions. Table 4.2 provides a helpful summary of  
recommended projector brightness levels for certain ambient conditions, audience sizes, and screen sizes  
\(4\:3 aspect ratio only\). **174** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS

Some useful rules of thumb for estimating brightness requirements are also provided by Lewis Sound and  
Video Professionals\:  
● Increase projector brightness if the projector will be more than 25 ft from the screen.  
● Decrease brightness if the projector will be less than 12 ft from the screen.  
● Increase brightness by 1000–2000 lumens for room capacities of 400 or more.  
● Increase brightness by approximately 25% for 16\:9 installations.  
\(Lewis, 2013\)  
# 4.5.2.3 Contrast ratio  
This is the ratio between the brightest white and the darkest black and complements brightness. The  
higher the contrast ratio, the clearer the image will be. Room light impacts contrast so a higher ratio is  
better if the room will be well lit during projection. A contrast ratio of 1,500\:1 is good, but 2,000\:1 is Visual presentation teCHnology **175**  
considered excellent. Most projectors used in special events are well above even this level. However,  
because of the lack of any standardized method for measuring contrast ratio, it is considered to be of  
minimal use when comparing projectors.  
# 4.5.2.4 Weight and portability  
Projectors come in a diverse range of sizes and weights. The smallest and most portable are handheld  
projectors \(also called pocket projectors, mobile projectors, pico projectors, or mini beamers\). Besides being  
self-contained themselves, this technology also applies the use of an image projector inside a mobile  
device \(e.g. smartphone, digital camera, tablet\) and allows digital images to be projected onto any  
nearby viewing surface. While they are unlikely to be used for large projection at special events, as their  
brightness \(e.g. typically 100 or fewer lumens\) and maximum screen size \(e.g. maximum 80 in. or 203  
cm\) are too low, there is a definite possibility that the technology could morph into personal and  
crowd-sourced mobile gaming at events. These projectors weigh in the neighborhood of 1 lb \(454 gm\) or  
less, and are about 4–6 in. \(10–15 cm\) in their longest dimension. They fit in the palm of one’s hand. See  
Figure 4.7 right.  
It is in the mid-size range that most event projectors fall. These are the ones you might see mounted at  
the rear of, or in front of, a screen. Usually, especially if front projection is used, they are mounted on  
trussing above the audience. They are very portable and usually weigh in the order of 5–35 or 40 lb \(2–18  
kg\), with their longest dimension being in the order of 12–20 in. \(30–50 cm\). See Figure 4.7 center.  
The behemoths of the projector world are large venue projectors, those with brightness levels in the range  
of about 10,000 to 40,000 lumens. These are the ones most likely to be used for wide-screen video with  
edge blending, 4K video, and projection mapping. Although at the lower end of size and brightness they  
are reasonably portable \(i.e. 25 lb, 11 kg\), at the upper end they are far from it. For example, a 40,000-  
lumen Barco HDQ-2K40 large venue model weighs 463 lb \(210 kg\) and its longest dimension is about  
40 in. \(103 cm\). It would need more than two people to carry and install it. See Figure 4.7 left.

# 4.5.2.5 Connectivity  
Critical to the success of any presentation using a projector is the ability of the projector to accept the  
information from the source—and often several sources simultaneously. The source may be video, data, **176** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
or any combination of the analog or digital information we have already discussed, although most  
nowadays will be digital. In the higher-end projectors used in special events, connectivity can happen in a  
variety of ways.  
4.5.2.5.1 analog conneCTions  
For the odd occasion when older analog video is brought to an event, most projectors accept the following  
types of connections\:  
● Composite video. This is the most basic and lowest quality type of connection. It carries all the video  
information \(color, brightness, synchronization\) on a single, yellow RCA or composite cable. It is  
typically used to hook up a standard VCR and stereo equipment.  
● RF or BNC. This is another form of a composite cable and can be changed to an RCA type with a simple  
adaptor. It is the type most often found on professional video equipment rather than RCA. The physical  
connection is more secure because it uses a twist lock.  
● Separate video \(S-video\). This type of connector splits the video signal into two separate com-  
ponents\: luminance \(brightness\) and chrominance \(color\). It is typically found on most high-end  
televisions, all videodisk players, camcorders, digital cable, and satellite set top boxes, and older standard  
VHS VCRs.  
● Component video. With this type, the video signal is split into three components and three separate,  
color-coded cables\: the Y cable \(green\) carrying luminance, image detail, and synchroniza-  
tion information; the Pb or Cb cable \(blue\) carrying color information; and the Pr or Cr cable \(red\) also  
carrying color. This connection gives a superior image over composite or S-video connections, and is  
most often found on high-end DVD players and HDTV tuners.  
● RGBHV. These cables look identical to simple composite cables, but the RGBHV cable splits the video  
signal into five cables\: for color into red, green, and blue; and two more cables to carry the sync for the  
signal \(horizontal and vertical sync\). RGBHV connectors are found on most high-end professional  
monitors and some HDTV decoders. Cables can be either BNC or RCA.  
● Video Graphics Array \(VGA\). The 15-pin VGA connector is found on many video cards, computer  
monitors, and high-definition television sets. On laptop computers or other small devices, a mini-VGA  
port is sometimes used in place of the full-sized VGA connector.  
4.5.2.5.2 digital conneCTions  
Most video sources for special events will be digital. Generally, projectors accept the following types of  
digital connections\:  
● Serial Digital Interface \(SDI\). SDI is a broadcast quality digital video connection, serving SDTV and HDTV  
\(standard and high-definition\) digital standards at 1,920 x 1,080 resolution. SDI is a high-speed  
connection of most commonly 270 Mbps that is carried on one coax cable with a BNC connector. Higher  
speeds of 1.485 Gbit/s exist for HD-SDI \(high-definition\) connections, 2.97 Gbit/s for the newer dual  
link HD-SDI and the most recent 3G-SDI. It is good for long cable runs.  
● Digital Video Interface \(DVI\). This is a video display interface used to connect a video source, such as  
a computer, to a computer monitor or projector. It is a multi-pin connector that was designed to  
maximize the visual quality of digital display devices such as flat panel LCD computer displays and  
digital projectors. It can transmit digital streams at speeds up to 5 Gbps. There are several versions in  
existence, all with slightly different pin configurations, that are capable of connecting analog or digital  
devices. They are\: DVI-D for digital devices only; DVI-A for analog devices only; and DVI-I for digital Visual presentation teCHnology **177**  
and analog devices. An important point to note here is particularly applicable for smaller events in which  
there may only be a projector and computer present \(e.g. in a classroom situation\). If mixing PC and  
Apple equipment, an adaptor may be required to take the signal from the Thunderbolt connector on the  
Apple/Mac to the DVI input for the projector—or for a stand-alone monitor—as most projectors do not  
accept the Mac signal directly. Most PCs, however, do have either DVI or HDMI.  
● High-Definition Multimedia Interface \(HDMI\). An extension of DVI, this is an uncompressed, all-digital  
audio and video connection system. It is the first connection to handle all audio, video, and control data.  
Type A is a 19-pin connector and Type B is a 29-pin connector designed to support resolutions higher  
than 1,080p. HDMI is used with an increasing variety of digital equipment, including DVD players,  
digital audio or video monitors, computers, and digital TVs \(e.g. plasma, LCD, etc.\). It provides excellent  
image quality.  
# 4.5.2.6 Other features of projectors  
Projectors have come a long way in a very short time and most now have the following features as part of  
the package. It is useful to know what they can do\:  
● Zoom lens. This is useful if the exact placement of the projector cannot be controlled. In fact, many have  
optional lenses with different focal lengths, allowing more flexibility in placement.  
● Keystone correction. This corrects for rectangular distortion caused by positioning the projector away  
from the central axis of the screen or projection surface.  
● Remote control. Most now have remote control capability over focus, keystone, power, page up or down,  
color mode, freeze, resize, menu, onscreen pointer, and other features. Many projectors are now also  
operated with wireless technology.  
● Front or rear projection. Many projectors have the capability of projecting from the front or rear of screens.  
● Power consumption. The low-end, lower brightness projectors only consume in the 300 to 400 watt  
power range; however, the higher-end, brighter projectors can consume up to 8 KW of power. This is  
important to know when planning for power requirements for an event. See Chapter 9 for more details  
about electrical power.  
# 4.5.3 edge blending and warping  
Two recent technological advances having a major impact on special events are projector edge blending and  
warping. Both are software-based, with the software typically housed within either a separate processor or  
the projector itself, especially higher-end models.  
# 4.5.3.1 Edge blending  
This software allows horizontal arrays and/or vertical stacked arrays of projectors to blend their  
images together in an infinite number of ways. For example, an extremely wide image can be created  
by projecting a smaller part of it with each separate projector and blending the edges of the separate  
images softly so that the division between the images is not noticeable. The same can be done with  
vertically stacked projectors for a higher overall image. In this way, immense wide-screen projections are  
possible, covering entire walls—or even a complete surround—of the event space. Likewise, similar  
projections are possible as stage backdrops in which there may be a number of completely different images  
required to be seen. In this case, for example, an IMAG image of a keynote speaker could be combined  
with an image of his PowerPoint slides on the same screen, and even another IMAG of the audience’s  
reaction to his speech, the concept being that of a picture-in-picture \(PIP\). All these could be combined with  
hard or soft edges. **178** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
Edge blending and large screens have essentially replaced older, more cumbersome video walls for  
special events, and are having a similar effect on event décor, rendering large physical décor and sets  
almost obsolete.  
Figure 4.8 illustrates how edge blending works. In this example, four projectors have been ceiling-mounted  
in front of a 16\:9 proportion screen \(note the image is backwards and being viewed from the rear\) and are  
projecting four different quadrants onto the screen, each also 16\:9 in proportion. The middle vertical and  
horizontal strips shaded in yellow represent the regions in which edge blending takes place. The actual full  
image resolution can be determined by subtracting the image blending region pixels from the total vertical  
or horizontal pixels of both projectors in the vertical or horizontal plane respectively. The resulting full  
image appears seamless.

# 4.5.3.2 Warping  
Image warping is the process of digitally manipulating an image such that any shapes portrayed in  
the image have been significantly distorted. Warping is used for correcting image distortion so that  
a correct image is displayed. The software enables images to be projected onto curved screens or  
other oddly shaped surfaces such as domed ceilings, curved building walls, tensile fabric structures,  
and such. The most obvious uses are in real simulators used for training \(e.g. aircraft, trains, cars, and  
trucks\) and immersive rides, both of which utilize curved screens, and also projection mapping  
\(see Section 4.3.5\).  
# 4.6 Display equipment  
The final step in the process outlined in Section 4.2 is displaying the image\(s\) of the visual source. There  
are many ways to do this and we will look at each one in order to help in making the right choice for a  
special event. The main equipment choices for display are\:  
● plain screens;  
● monitors;  
● videowalls;  
● LED screens;  
● teleprompters and confidence monitors.  
# 4.6.1 Plain screens  
Undoubtedly what comes to mind as a first choice for displaying images is a projection screen. Screens are  
used more than any other display medium in special events. There are several concerns that must be  
addressed before deciding on a particular screen.  
# 4.6.1.1 Front or rear projection  
This is the first decision that must be made for any event. Each type of projection has advantages and  
disadvantages\:  
● Front projection. This takes up far less space than rear projection, and is particularly good if the projector  
is truss or ceiling-mounted, thus eliminating any chance of screen interference caused by people walking  
in front of the projector. However, there is a greater chance of light interference from other ambient  
sources such as stage or house lighting, and there may also be audio system interference from projector  
fan noise. Generally speaking, front projection is less difficult to set up.  
● Rear projection. This eliminates chances of audience members casting shadows on the screen when  
walking in front of the projector and it is less prone to ambient light interference. However, it may  
require a large area behind the screen for projector setup and this area must often be cordoned off and  
even curtained off to minimize light spillage on the projector and screen from external doors. Using a  
mirror with the projector can decrease the area required for rear projection setup; however, the mirror  
must be front-surfaced to eliminate double images.  
Note that for either front or rear projection, screens may be suspended from ceilings or trusses for better  
viewing. Supplemental or delay screens are frequently added in positions part way down a large venue if  
the viewing distance from the back of the audience is too far to the main screens\(s\). **180** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 4.6.1.2 Types of screen support and mounting  
Because special events are temporary, almost all requirements for screens will mean that the screens must  
be portable in some form, unless the event takes place in a location with a permanently installed screen,  
such as an arena, auditorium, classroom, or theater. This section deals with the types of screens and  
support systems available for temporary, portable use.  
There are four main types of screens that are available\:  
● Tripod. These are for front projection only. The fabric pulls up and out of a metal cradle, with the top  
of the screen being attached to a movable vertical support rod. The base is made of three foldable legs  
\(i.e. the tripod\). They are available only up to approximately 8 ft x 8 ft \(2.4 m x 2.4 m\) in size and are  
best used for presentations in small rooms or spaces with audiences under approximately 150 people.  
Size ratios are typically 16\:9, 4\:3, and 1\:1.  
● Pullup or floor. These are similar to tripod screens except that the support base is more compact and  
stands closer to the floor, making the overall screen appearance a little more professional. The screen  
itself also pulls up and out of a metal cradle mounted right on the base at the floor level, again attached  
to a vertical metal support rod. Some screens pull up past the bottom of the screen for better viewing  
and have a black portion or material under the screen itself. Sizes vary up to about 10 ft x 7.7 ft  
\(300 cm x 230 cm\) and ratios are 16\:10, 16\:9, 4\:3, or 1\:1 depending on the manufacturer.  
● Modular. Sometimes known by the brand name Fast-Fold®, these are tensioned screens that feature a  
foldable aluminum frame and a soft screen surface which attaches to the frame via push studs, tensioning  
the surface for an extremely flat projection screen. The screen may be used for front or rear projection  
depending on the screen material. Legs may be adjusted to various heights and the screens may also be  
flown if required, usually with a more rigid truss-type frame. They are available in sizes up to about 40  
ft \(130 m\) in width and ratios of 16\:10, 16\:9, 4\:3, and 1\:1, depending on the manufacturer. These screens  
are the most commonly used in special events, particularly corporate and private ones in hotels and  
conference centers.  
● Ultra-wide. With the advent of HD video, ultra-wide screens up to 150 or 200 ft \(45 or 60 m\) are  
becoming available, typically in increments of 50 ft \(15 m\) wide or so, and heights of 30 or 40 ft \(9 or  
12 m\). These screens are made of soft material similar to that of Fast-Fold®, and are mounted on  
trussing with piping weighting down the bottom. They are joined and stretched to eliminate wrinkling.  
Chain motors rigged from the ceiling allow them to be raised or lowered for dramatic reveals and  
surprises \(D. Clark, BC Event Management, personal communication, August 17, 2014\). Another  
mounting method is lace and grommet that literally ties the screen to a tubular metal frame. Masking  
material is used to cover the lacing and act as a screen border.  
# 4.6.1.3 Screen surface and material  
In front projection, matte white surfaces, by far the most popular, offer excellent definition for finely  
detailed images, such as computer text. Smooth silver or white pearlescent surfaces provide particularly  
bright images best for video or computer projection, but are prone to hotspotting. Glass beaded surfaces  
offer a brighter image with some sacrifice of sharpness. They are intended for general video and film  
projection use, but are not recommended for computer data. Lenticular surfaces are designed for video and  
slide projection and for rooms with side light from windows. They work by focusing projected light that  
would otherwise be disbursed on the vertical axis onto the horizontal where it can be viewed. In the same  
way, ambient side light that would otherwise mix with the projected image is reflected away. Gray screens,  
a fairly recent innovation, are good for front projection. Their high-contrast gray offers a high resolution  
image and enhances the depth of blacks while maintaining the quality of lighter colors. The low gain rating Visual presentation teCHnology **181**  
of 0.8 provides this type of projection screen with a wide 180-degree viewing degree, but requires it to  
operate in an environment of low ambient light \(Bamboo AV, 2011\).  
In rear projection situations, there are several coatings and screen materials designed for specific situations.  
Most standard surfaces are best for rooms with a relatively narrow seating cone and good lighting control,  
with specialty surfaces available when viewing angles will be wide or lighting high. Rear screen fabrics are  
translucent and allow the image to pass through from behind. They attach only to Fast-Fold® frames.  
# 4.6.1.4 Other features and concerns  
Understanding several other features of screens may help in making the right screen choice\:  
● Gain. This is the ability of a screen to gather light from a projector and direct it to a certain location.  
A high gain screen can be important in situations where room lights must remain high for note-  
taking or discussion, particularly if those lights wash onto the screen surface. Gain varies with screen  
surface. Most matte white screens are rated at a gain of about 1.0, and most glass beaded screens provide  
a gain of about 2.5. Lenticular surfaces are rated from 1.5 up to about 3.0, and rear screens offer gains  
up to 5.0.  
● Viewing angles. No matter what a screen’s stated viewing angle, seating an audience outside a 90-degree  
cone has inherent problems that no screen will overcome. At angles greater than 45 degrees from a line  
perpendicular to the center of the screen, images appear distorted, with objects looking taller and  
thinner than they should. Thus, most screens are designed to focus projected light back to an audience  
within that 90-degree cone, and images viewed from beyond that will appear quite dim.  
● Screen dressing. By dressing is meant finishing off the screen installation with defining borders, usually  
black drape. These give it a professional appearance, mask the support framing, assist in giving the  
perception of a brighter image, and help to mask any setup behind the screen, especially for rear  
projection. Most professional screens come with black borders anyway, but the addition of short drapery  
sections along the top and bottom of the screen along with full screen height drape on either side  
finishes the setup properly. Obviously, the side draping can extend as far as required in any direction by  
adding panels.  
# 4.6.1.5 Determining screen size  
Correct screen size is determined be using a general formula. Find the distance to the last row of seats and  
divide by eight to determine the screen height, then apply the aspect ratio of the media you will be using  
to arrive at the screen width. Usually this is 4\:3 for computer or video images, but may be 16\:9 for HDTV  
formats. For example, if the last row of seats is 70 ft \(21 m\) from the screen, then the height should be  
approximately 8.75 ft \(i.e. 70/8 = 8.75\), or for the closest screen size, 9 ft \(3 m\). Using the 4\:3 ratio will  
then give a screen width of 12 ft \(i.e. 9 x 4/3 = 12\) or 3.6 m. Note that the first number in screen sizing  
is the screen height and the second is the width. One caveat that goes with the above formula for  
determining screen size is that if the images are finer in detail than simple graphics, the guiding number  
of eight changes to six for reading spreadsheets or text, and to four for detailed drawings like CADD.  
Finally, the minimum distance from the screen to the first row of seating should be at least two times the  
width of the image on the screen, and the bottom of the screen should be at least 40–48 in. \(100–120 cm\)  
above the floor.  
In helping to determine the exact screen size, it should be noted that the most common aspect ratios  
in screen sizes are 4\:3 \(video format\), 16\:9 \(HDTV format\), 16\:10 \(wide format\), and 1\:1 \(square  
format\). The effect of using a screen size not matched to the aspect ratio of the projected image is shown  
in Figure 4.9. Note that this same effect will be apparent with monitors as well \(see Section 4.6.2\). **182** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 4.9** Screen aspect ratio and effect on displayed image

For many rental screens \(e.g. Fast-Fold®\), movable horizontal or vertical bars can be used to correct for  
the wrong screen aspect ratio.  
# 4.6.2 monitors  
Monitors can be thought of as combinations of projectors and screens. For special events they are often used  
in small venues and as supplementary displays to larger screens to cover sections of audience that the screens  
cannot cover in large venues \(e.g. at the front of an audience not within the viewing angle of the main  
screens\). In terms of appearance, the monitors used for events are no different than consumer monitors.  
Monitor technology is changing rapidly. Presently, there are four technologies commonly used in special  
events\: LCD, OLED, plasma, and touchscreen.  
● LCD. Similar in theory to LCD projectors, LCD monitors are the most widely used monitors today. They  
consist of liquid-crystal-filled pixels inserted between two polarizing filters. A backlight source generates Visual presentation teCHnology **183**  
light which passes through the filters. The electrodes control the flow of current which passes through  
the liquid crystals and aligns them in a particular direction. The alignment of the crystals, controlled  
by the electrodes, sets the intensity and color for the light which will pass through the second filter  
and will hit the screen. LCD monitors are lightweight, consume little power, and have good  
contrast and brightness. Diagonal sizes are now more than 110 in. \(277 cm\) and capable of accepting  
4K UHDTV.  
● Organic Light-Emitting Diode \(OLED\). This is a thin-film LED technology \(see Section 4.6.4 and  
Chapter 5\) in which the emissive layer is an organic compound, sandwiched between two thin-film  
conductive electrodes. In essence, it is a screen and projector all in one piece of extremely thin, flexible  
material. This technology lends itself to the actual printing of the light-emitting screen using ink-jet  
printers, a fact that renders it cheaper to manufacture than any other existing technology. OLEDs and  
their newer versions, polymer OLEDs \(PLED\), phosphorescent OLEDs \(PHOLED\), top-emitting  
OLEDs \(TOLED\), and flexible OLEDs \(FOLED\), all have a greater range of brightness, colors, and  
viewing angles \(e.g. approaching 180 degrees\) than any other technology. This means they will be able  
to be used in such things as clothing and portable displays. They are already evident in smartphones,  
tablets, and digital cameras. Advantages include faster response times, small size/thickness, better  
power efficiency, and good viewing angles. Diagonal sizes are now up to 77 in. \(194 cm\) and increasing,  
again for 4K UHDTV.  
● Plasma. Plasma monitors are flat, lightweight surfaces covered with millions of tiny glass bubbles. Each  
bubble contains a gas-like substance, the plasma, and has a phosphor coating. The bubbles can be  
considered as the pixels, each pixel-bubble having three sub-pixels\: one red, one green, and one blue.  
When it is time to display an image signal \(RGB or video\), a digitally controlled electric current flows  
through the flat screen, causing the plasma inside the designated bubbles to give off ultraviolet rays.  
This light in turn causes the phosphor coatings to glow the appropriate color. Advantages include  
superior contrast ratio, wide viewing angle, and high refresh rate. Diagonal sizes have reached over 152  
in. \(383 cm\) but in spite of this and their superior quality, plasma monitors seem to be losing the  
competitive battle and may not be around for long.  
● Touchscreen. A touchscreen is actually not the monitor itself but a separate layer or panel placed on top  
of the monitor, and so can be applied to the types of monitors described above. It has a grid of light  
beams or fine wires on the screen. It lets the user interact by the touch of a finger rather than typing on  
a keyboard or moving a mouse. The user enters data by touching icons or menus identified on the screen.  
There are different types of touchscreen technology. The most common types are resistive, surface wave,  
and capacitive\:  
● Resistive. This panel has two layers of thin, electrically conductive material facing each other. A  
change in electrical current occurs when it is pressed and the layers touch. The input can be processed  
by a computer. These monitors are the most popular types of touchscreen monitors used today. They  
are usually not affected by dust or liquids, which makes them very reliable.  
● Surface Acoustic Wave \(SAW\). These monitors use ultrasonic waves to process input from the screen.  
These waves flow over the touchscreen. The wave is absorbed and processed by computer when a  
person touches the pad.  
● Capacitive. These screens are coated with indium tin oxide. This material provides continuous  
current across the screen. The current can be measured by the processor when the panel is touched.  
These screens have high clarity and are not affected by dust.  
Other touchscreen technologies include infrared acrylic projection, optical imaging, dispersive signal, and  
acoustic pulse recognition; however, resistive and capacitive are the most used presently. Touchscreens are  
continually increasing in size, and are now in excess of 82 in. \(206 cm\). It is expected that their use will  
probably increase in special events, particularly with increased gamification. **184** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 4.6.3 videowalls  
Videowalls are high-end image display systems consisting of multiple monitors \(cubes\) placed in  
various configurations such as 2 x 2 \(e.g. four monitors with an overall aspect ratio of approximately  
4\:3\), 3 x 4 \(e.g. 12 monitors with an overall aspect ratio of 16\:9 or HDTV size\), and almost any other  
combination desired. The monitors are especially constructed for this type of display and are designed  
to be stacked together. The monitors use the same technology as found in other projection systems  
\(e.g. LCD, plasma\). The technology basically takes video, digital data, and/or computer graphics input  
and feeds it into a processor that manipulates and splits the signal to allow it to go to one or more  
monitors. Almost limitless possibilities are available for uniquely displaying the image or combinations  
of images. The advantages of a videowall include constant high resolution and brightness no matter  
to what size the image grows. Unfortunately, because of the setup time and complexity, multiple  
video projectors and screens are now replacing videowalls in most special event situations, although  
videowalls continue to thrive in more permanent installations like trade show booths, shopping centers,  
and control rooms.  
# 4.6.4 leD screens  
In its most simple form, an LED is a semiconductor device that emits light when electricity is passed  
through it. This effect is a form of electroluminescence. The color of the emitted light depends on the  
chemical composition of the semiconducting material used. LEDs are also explained in Chapter 5. Before  
we go any further, it is worth noting that LEDs can have two different purposes. On one hand, they  
can be strictly light sources, as with projectors \(see Section 4.5.1.3\) and conventional event lighting  
\(Chapter 5\). On the other hand, they can be display devices, as in the case of the OLED monitors mentioned  
above, but more importantly as larger screens for indoor and outdoor use. Such screens have now become  
ubiquitous in permanent displays for advertising, stadia, arenas, bars, and many other venues. They also  
see temporary use in concerts, special events, and other types of entertainment. Although they had been  
used before, one of the most impressive pioneering examples was their use in large format in the opening  
and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Because of their increasing importance, LED screens  
deserve a little more explanation. The two primary considerations when choosing a screen are the design  
technology and the specifications and features.  
# 4.6.4.1 Design technology  
In an LED screen, like a monitor, the screen corresponds to the computer screen driving it, and there are  
two slightly different technologies involved in creating the display\:  
● Direct In-Line Package \(DIP\). This technology uses discrete red, green, and blue diodes stamped into a  
pre-drilled printed circuit board \(PCB\) using a process known as through-hole mounting. The legs are then  
soldered onto pads on the opposite side, which can be done by hand or with machines. This complete  
module forms a single pixel. Screens formed from these modules are mostly used in large outdoor  
applications because of their lower resolution, lower cost, brightness, and high contrast.  
● Surface-Mounted Diode \(SMD\). This is an encapsulated LED that has all three colors of diode in a slim  
tube that is soldered directly onto a circuit board printed with solder pads instead of having mounting  
holes drilled into it. SMDs can be made smaller and placed closer together since they’re only mounted  
onto one surface of the board. Because of this, they are able to have smaller pixel pitches \(see Section  
4.6.4.2 below\) and much closer viewing distance \(InnovisionLED, 2014\). They are used mostly for  
indoor applications but are also making inroads into outdoor signage. See Figure 4.10 for an example  
of a large LED screen with SMD technology used as a stage backdrop. Visual presentation teCHnology **185**  
**Figure 4.10** Large led screen used as a stage backdrop

# 4.6.4.2 Specifications and features  
The choice of screen will also be influenced by certain specifications and features\:  
● Pixel pitch. This is the distance between screen pixels in millimeters. The lower the pitch, the closer  
the screen can be viewed without appearing to be pixelated. Pixel pitch typically ranges from 4 mm up  
to 20 mm for indoor LED displays; for outdoor displays, pixel pitch can range from 10 mm to 34 mm  
or higher. There is a trade-off, however. Generally the lower the pitch, the higher the number of pixels  
and also the higher the cost.  
● Pixel density. Also called LED density, this is a measure of how many pixels there are in a given area of  
screen. Sometimes this can be “per square foot”; sometimes it can be “per screen panel.” Because LED  
screens are made differently by different manufacturers, the pixel layout on a panel may indicate that  
there is a high pixel pitch, but when the pixel density is also taken into account, the resulting resolution  
may not be as high as another screen with the same pixel pitch. Put more simply, the higher the pixel  
density, the more pixels in a given area and the better the screen will look. It will also last longer because  
it can be driven at a lower current and temperature.  
As an example, one provider, Showmax Event Services in Vancouver, Canada, builds special event  
screens in which each panel measures 20¼ in. x 20¼ in. \(51 cm x 51 cm\) and weighs 25 lb \(11 kg\). Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**186** Each panel uses a 6 mm pixel pitch and has a density of 6,400 pixels per panel, which is incredibly high  
resolution. It can be viewed with no pixelation from only 12 ft \(3.6 m\) away. Using these panels, larger  
screens of varying sizes can be built easily. Unlike videowalls, the panels are seamless when placed  
together \(D. Sabina, personal communication, May 27, 2014\). See Figure 4.10, in which the screen was  
40 ft \(12 m\) wide x 8 ft \(2.6 m\) high.  
● Brightness. This is another specification that will help in choosing the right screen. Brightness is  
measured in Nits or candelas per square meter \(cd/m2\). For indoor use, a brightness of 800–2,000 Nits is  
adequate, but for outdoor use, it should be between 3,500 and 5,000 Nits. LED screens do tend to lose  
brightness after extended use.  
● Refresh rate. “The refresh rate of an LED screen is the number of times in a second that the LED screen  
hardware draws the data. This is distinct from the measure of frame rate in that the refresh rate for LED  
screens includes the repeated drawing of identical frames, while frame rate measures how often a video  
source can feed an entire frame of new data to a display . . . On LED screens, increasing the refresh rate  
decreases flickering, thereby reducing eye strain. However, if a refresh rate is specified that is beyond  
what is recommended for the LED screen, damage to the display can occur” \(Vegas LED Screens, 2014\).  
A normal refresh rate is in the order of 400 Hz, and a high rate is considered to be 1,500–2,000 Hz.  
Flicker generally disappears above 1,000 Hz.  
● Other features. Some desirable features include\:  
● a quiet fan for low noise;  
● dual signal cables for fail-safe operation;  
● easy panel replacement to avoid non-working segments of screen. The panels described above can be  
“hot-swapped” in under 5 min;  
● seamless panels.  
In summary, LED screens are improving in quality, size, and cost at a rapid rate, and are now even being  
incorporated into soft fabrics. They are incredibly bright, modular, easily scalable, and present unlimited  
creative possibilities for set and scenic design for special events.  
# 4.6.5 teleprompters and confidence monitors  
A teleprompter is the modern version of the old theatrical cue cards used to help with the speech of  
someone onstage. A modern teleprompter is a display device that prompts the person speaking with an  
electronic visual text of a speech or script, by sending the script to a flat panel that is projected up to  
one-way mirror glass that in turn reflects the writing directly at the eye level of the presenter. The glass is  
specially coated so that the audience can see right through it and cannot see the text.  
A teleprompter system usually requires three or four components to function\: a dedicated host computer  
and operator, although it can also be controlled by the onstage speaker; prompting software that can  
reverse and variably scroll the text; and a teleprompter display device with mirror hood. Nowadays,  
prompters can also use smartphones or tablets as the source, via an application.  
Teleprompters come in several different versions\: a hooded version that can be placed directly onto the  
front of a camera for TV or onscreen personalities so that it appears they are speaking directly  
to the camera; a floor-mounted panel with eye-level prompter glass used for executive presentations  
from a stage \(sometimes called a presidential teleprompter\); and a stage-mounted prompter that  
looks much like an audio monitor that can be used for singer lyrics or speaker text, called a  
confidence monitor. Visual presentation teCHnology **187**  
For special events, the executive-type teleprompter is most often used. With such a teleprompter, from the  
perspective of the audience, it appears as though the speaker is speaking extemporaneously with only pre-  
planned glances to the notes on the lectern. The eye contact with the audience assists the speaker to  
connect in a relaxed demeanor and with confidence.  
# 4.7 equipment setup and operation  
Once the use and format of the presentation is determined, the producer and A-V supplier must decide on  
the optimum equipment for the job, using combinations of the available projection and display options,  
and then proceed to setup and operation.  
# 4.7.1 Setup  
Like audio and lighting, visual presentation equipment can involve a time-consuming setup due to the  
requirements to occasionally fly projectors and screens, the need for dark time to check colors and  
alignment, and especially due to the need for rehearsing complex cues and switching. In order to ensure  
the right equipment and locations are chosen, here are the most important questions a producer must ask  
an event manager or client\:  
● How many attendees are there and what is the room layout? If this is a classroom setting, then more  
people can be accommodated within the space and there will likely be no obstructions to sight lines.  
This means that screens need to go only at the front of the room. If a dining setup, then attendees will  
be facing all different directions and projection to different locations in the room may have to be  
considered. If the event is in multiple rooms simultaneously, then smaller monitors in each room might  
be appropriate.  
● What size of projection system is needed? If there is a large spread-out audience, that means a larger  
screen size. The formula for screen size given in Section 4.6.1.5 may be used.  
● Is projection to be rear or front? As explained in Section 4.6.1.1, each has advantages and  
disadvantages.  
● Are sight lines to the screens clear or is there a possibility of any obstruction caused by people  
walking in front of a projector or of table centers or architectural elements \(e.g. columns\) being in the  
projection path? If so, then a decision must be made to change either the projection system or the event  
design.  
● Do presenters need support in the form of remote control or cabling for laptop computers near the  
stage?  
● Is a teleprompter or confidence monitor required for speaker or MC scripts and, if so, is there sufficient  
unobstructed space for it near the stage?  
● If IMAG is being used, where will the camera\(s\) be placed in order to obtain a good picture yet cause  
minimal obstruction to audience sight lines?  
● Is there appropriate technical support at the venue in the form of electrical power, ceiling hanging points  
with an acceptable load rating, and easy and early room access?  
● Is the budget sufficient to do the job?  
Once the answers are known and equipment chosen, the setup can proceed. It involves the following tasks\:  
● Preparation of all equipment takes place in the shop. If there is a multimedia show, some pre-  
programming may be required, as may the loading of special software on a computer. **188** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
● Equipment is delivered and loaded in.  
● Regular screens, LED screens, and monitors are positioned and set up, either flown or floor-mounted.  
They are then dressed with drapery material as required. Display equipment requiring it is connected  
to electrical power.  
● Switching hardware, preview monitors, show control computers, and Blu-ray/DVD players are set up  
backstage—or at the FOH position if that is where control will be—and connected as required. This  
equipment is tied into electrical power and Internet if required. Audio from the switching hardware or  
devices is tied into the main audio mixer in and out. Intercom is set up between the switcher position,  
all camera operators, and any additional technical personnel controlling equipment. Internet connections  
are tested. See Figure 4.11.  
● Projectors are positioned and set up, either on projector carts, scaffolding, or ceiling-mounted from  
trussing or other supports. Correct cabling is then run from the projectors to the switching position.  
Electrical power is connected to projectors.  
● Speaker support equipment, such as teleprompters, confidence monitors, onstage computers, and/or  
remote control devices, is set up, connected, and tested.  
● Video cameras, if used, are positioned, electrical power is connected, if possible, for all stationary  
cameras, and cabling is run from the cameras to the switching position.  
● Cameras are tested and balanced for color; projector alignment is finalized; LED screens and  
monitors are aligned, color-corrected, and tested; switching between sources is checked;  
preview monitors are checked; and all audio feeds in and out of the switching hardware are checked  
for levels.  
● An event and/or show talk-through or rehearsal normally takes place after all this has been done in  
order to ensure all cues are correct. This is especially important if the show involves a combination of  
verbal and recorded cues, as with a multimedia show that might include live performers and lighting or  
special effects.  
Figure 4.11 outlines the general layout of visual presentation equipment at an event and the routing of  
signals from their sources to their final display.  
Note that in the setup of Figure 4.11, a recording is being made of the event so all video signals from the  
switcher and audio signals from the house audio mixer must be routed through a special unit that  
synchronizes video and audio so nothing is out of synch \(e.g. lips moving on the video but not synchronized  
with the audio\).  
# 4.7.2 operation during the event  
Operation of visual presentation equipment during an event can be complex and stressful. It requires an  
intimate knowledge of the equipment and its capabilities as well as a thorough understanding of the event  
and show running order with all the cues involved. See Chapter 9 of Special Event Production\: The Process for  
more about show production schedules and running orders. Assuming a complex show environment, the  
following represent the most important tasks of the A-V team\:  
● Providing live camera coverage of the event according to the cues and shots called by the technical  
director.  
● Adjusting the color, resolution, and format of all live and pre-recorded video before screening.  
● Adjusting and correcting all still images before screening. Visual presentation teCHnology **189**  
**Figure 4.11** general visual presentation setup and signal flow  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
● Previewing and switching all visual presentation sources before screening according to cues given by  
the technical director.  
● Adjusting audio levels going to and returning from the main house audio mixer.  
● Running video recorders.  
● Communicating with lighting and audio engineers to ensure levels of audio and lighting work smoothly  
with the visual presentation.  
As with décor and lighting, a plan for equipment strike after the event must be coordinated with the other  
suppliers \(partly because A-V equipment is often part of the trussing used for lighting and audio\), the  
event manager, and venue personnel to ensure conflicting tasks are minimized. **190** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 4.8 risk and safety  
Visual presentation equipment is highly complex and evolving rapidly, yet standards still apply to its safe  
design and use. In this regard, Chapter 3 lists both audio and visual presentation equipment standards,  
and the same comments apply as for audio \(see Section 3.6 of Chapter 3\).  
As with audio, risk mitigation techniques that ensure safe and professional event execution are employed  
by knowledgeable visual presentation specialists. Tim Lewis of Proshow Audiovisual Broadcast in  
Vancouver, Canada, again offers the benefit of his extensive experience \(T. Lewis, personal communication,  
August 12, 2014\)\:  
● Redundancy. As with the audio system, this is critical. There is a significant failure rate of CDs and  
DVDs provided by suppliers \(e.g. performers\) and presenters, especially when trying to play them in  
different recorders. Lewis usually dubs a CD or DVD brought to him onto a trusted format and plays it  
in his own fully checked-out machine. He may also bring a second brand of recorder if there is any doubt  
that there may be trouble playing CDs or DVDs, especially if the requirement is very high profile, as  
when it is part of a VIP presentation. For PowerPoint presentations, he is insistent on redundancy and  
always provides a minimum of two computers onsite at the A-V console position, and all presentations  
are loaded onto the two computers. Each computer is equipped with a CD/DVD burner for quick  
copying when necessary.  
He also provides at least one additional projector that can be quickly hooked up and used with front  
projection off a cart in case a flown or floor-supported show projector goes down. He stocks a wide  
variety of lenses with differing focal lengths for all projectors in order to work in event situations that  
may not allow sufficient space either behind or in front of screens. In this way, there are far fewer  
restrictions on space placed on the venue and the client.  
● Equipment quality. Lewis is especially cognizant of problems that can occur with personal laptop  
computers provided by presenters. He does not allow presenters to use their own computers  
onstage or even at the console position, instead preferring to load presentations onto his own  
pristine computers that are equipped with the latest version of all software \(e.g. PowerPoint and  
Windows\). To alleviate presenter stress, he provides top-of-the-line remote cueing hardware that uses  
RF signals and has built-in laser pointers. As well, he provides a confidence monitor near the lectern  
for the presenter. He notes that his preference is a small monitor attached to a microphone stand that  
sits just below the lectern top out of audience sight lines, making it less obvious than a presentation  
teleprompter.  
For video, Lewis refuses to use less than professional, TV quality equipment, notably cameras. He insists  
on using only highly skilled video camera operators, preferably with a lot of television experience, as  
well as a good video director with similar training. As he says, “Bad camera operation can destroy an  
IMAG presentation.”  
● Effects of other equipment. Similar to the ambient noise effects mentioned in Chapter 3, other  
equipment might interfere with visual presentations. For example, moving lights should never be  
mounted on the same truss as projectors because motion is transferred to the projectors with obvious  
consequences.  
● Professionalism. Personnel make all the difference. Lewis insists on only providing highly trained  
technicians with a professional approach to the event \(as with the camera ops\). He recommends that  
all personnel be briefed before any event that such things as idle chatter and improper comments should  
never be part of the show, especially on intercom. Focus must be maintained at all times.  
As with audio, these tips plus compliance with safety and design standards and a thorough analysis and  
documentation of the specific event’s risks should minimize most potential problems. Visual presentation teCHnology **191**

# Lighting systems  
# l e a r n i n g o u t c o m es  
After reading this chapter you will be able to\:  
**1.** Explain the objectives of event lighting.  
**2.** Understand the qualities of light and how they can be manipulated for specific purposes in a  
special event.  
**3.** Describe the basic capabilities of the main types of lighting instruments used for special events.  
**4.** Understand how effective event lighting is achieved through proper design.  
**5.** Understand how event lighting is controlled.  
**6.** Explain the requirements for an efficient event lighting setup.  
**7.** Understand and explain what a lighting operator does during an event.  
Lighting is yet another of the rapidly changing technical fields in special events. Used for meetings, rock  
and roll concerts, outdoor architectural highlights, and every type of special event, lighting can be costly,  
frustrating, and power-hungry, yet still provide an amazing component to an event. It is one of the primary  
ways to achieve emotional impact, especially if done by an experienced professional lighting designer \(LD\).  
For special events, good lighting design should enhance the event experience without drawing too much  
attention to itself as a separate entity. This is accomplished by understanding from the outset exactly for  
what purpose the lighting will be used, what types of lights will be used to achieve this purpose, and how  
the design will be carried out. Although most producers subcontract to a lighting company, they should  
ideally understand what equipment is available and how it works in order to provide the best lighting  
design for the available budget. In this regard, this chapter will discuss and illustrate the following topics\: **194** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
● objectives of event lighting;  
● qualities of light;  
● lighting instruments;  
● event lighting design;  
● what happens between concept and execution;  
● lighting control, setup, and operation;  
● risk and safety.  
# 5.1 objectives of event lighting  
When people enter a special event, they are entering a new environment, an environment that has been  
purposefully transformed into one that is different from their normal one. This new environment can be  
as simple as a darkened room with a single spotlight on a keynote speaker onstage, or a room that has been  
changed into an undersea wonderland. In both cases, lighting plays an influential role in the success of the  
transformation. It is in this transformation that the objectives of event lighting lie. These objectives  
include\:  
● visibility;  
● relevance;  
● composition;  
● mood.  
We will examine each one to see how it can influence the transformation of an event space.  
# 5.1.1 visibility  
Considered the most fundamental function of event lighting, visibility simply means that for an event  
audience to clearly understand what is going on within the event space, they must be able to see the action  
or the appropriate décor. Although this may seem obvious, it is amazing how many producers fail to  
understand the importance of selective visibility. By selective, we mean that “well-lit” does not translate into  
turning all the house lights up full and leaving them there for the duration of an event. Selective means  
lighting only what an audience needs to see when they need to see it.  
For example, if the only activity happening on a large stage is a keynote speaker at a lectern, then there is  
no need to light the entire stage, but rather just the speaker himself. In this way, the focus of the moment  
is on the speaker, and the audience is not distracted by anything else onstage. Likewise, if a 40 ft \(12 m\)  
wide, decorative painted mural is placed against a wall, it should be fully lit in order to be seen and to be  
an effective component of the themed décor; however, if it only covers half the wall, there is no reason to  
light the other half.  
Although visibility presumes that certain objects or people will be lit, its effectiveness is not solely  
dependent on the intensity of the lighting. It is also affected by contrast, size, color, and movement of the  
object\(s\) being illuminated, as well as the distance of the light source from the object and the condition  
of the eyes of the observer.  
# 5.1.2 relevance  
Stage lighting specialists sometimes refer to this objective as naturalism, style, or even structure. According  
to Williams \(1999\), this means that the lighting design should provide a sense of time and place through Lighting systems **195**  
the use of such items as simulated sunlight or moonlight. In event lighting, it really is more than this  
because a special event often comprises more than what is happening onstage.  
For example, in a large special event that has different eras themed in different rooms, relevance might  
mean\: strobelights, lasers, and smoke in a futuristic setting; simulated gas lamps in a Victorian setting;  
lots of colored neon in a 1950s setting; and simulated fire in a prehistoric setting, all of which could be  
used to light décor or simply to add to the relevance of the theme by using these means to actually light  
just the room itself.  
At the same time, if there is action taking place within those settings, perhaps in the form of themed  
entertainment, that action might also have to be lit in a way that is relevant to the dynamics of the action  
within the theme. For example, a futuristic dance troupe might be accompanied by high-energy automated  
lighting moving in time with the music, a Victorian singer might be lit by old-time stage footlights, a 1950s  
diner scene with characters from Happy Days might have a mirror ball, and a prehistoric cave campfire scene  
with actors might use low light level amber tones to illuminate the scene with moving fire images on the  
cave wall.  
# 5.1.3 composition  
Composition refers to how effective the LD has been in helping to create an overall event environment.  
The lighting should take into account the same design tools and design elements that a decorator would  
use and, in fact, should be designed in conjunction with the décor design. For example, here are possible  
considerations within each of these groups\:  
# 5.1.3.1 Design elements  
As with décor, the design elements are\:  
● Space. Are all three dimensions effectively illuminated? \(e.g. Does lighting cover walls and ceilings—and  
even floors?\) Is lighting used to actually “fill” the space by using smoke or haze that will reflect the light  
beams?  
● Form. Does the lighting design enhance the form of objects? \(e.g. Are they made to look attractive? Do  
they become focal points? Are they more three-dimensional as a result of using proper lighting to create  
depth?\)  
● Line. Are the lines of objects made to be part of the whole design? \(e.g. Does rear lighting effectively  
separate a dark-suited speaker from a black velour stage backdrop?\)  
● Texture and ornament. Does the lighting bring out the texture in objects?  
● Light. Is the light intensity too high or too low?  
● Color. Does the lighting design complement the event’s overall color scheme?  
# 5.1.3.2 Design principles  
Similarly, the design principles are\:  
● Proportion. Is the lighting of different event components in proportion to each other? \(e.g. Is a large  
décor vignette lit by big lights and another lit by small lights?\)  
● Balance. Is the lighting design symmetrical or asymmetrical? This applies especially for stage  
lighting.  
● Rhythm. Is there a repetitive pattern in the lighting or are there smooth transitions between colors? **196** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 5.1** example of elements and principles of good lighting design  
Lighting by Images by Lighting; photo by Elizabeth Solano for John Solano Photography; event designer Ed Libby;  
event coordination and design by Levine Fox Events  
● Emphasis. Is there a lighting focal point or is lighting used to illuminate a decorative focal point?  
● Harmony. Does the overall lighting design create a comforting, or harmonious feeling, particularly in  
conjunction with other décor?  
Figure 5.1 illustrates several design elements and principles. Note the even lighting of the entire space,  
the texture of the stage backdrop brought out by the lighting, the consistent color scheme, and the overall  
balance and harmony of the design.  
# 5.1.4 mood  
Mood refers to how lighting affects the psychological reactions of the audience at an event and how it  
reinforces the emotional tone of a themed venue or of a stage performance. This is often done by using an  
appropriate color—or changes of color—to elicit an emotional reaction, as outlined in Section 2.1.1.6.1 of  
Chapter 2. However, it can also be accomplished by other means, such as using automated lights for  
excitement or combining lighting with various special effects to strengthen the effects and add to the  
emotion. We will discuss this in more detail in Section 5.4.  
# 5.2 Qualities of light  
Before committing to a design of any sort, the LD must first understand the actual qualities of light itself.  
In other words, how can this “raw material” in the form of a light beam emanating from a fixture be  
manipulated to achieve the desired look? The qualities of light that the designer is able to manipulate are\:  
● intensity;  
● distribution;  
● color; Lighting systems **197**  
● direction;  
● movement.  
We will discuss each of these in turn.  
# 5.2.1 intensity  
In simplest terms, this refers to the strength of a light source. However, there are some other relative  
measurements that are also associated with a light source and what happens when the light is projected  
over a distance and strikes an object.  
Intensity is the strength of a light source \(e.g. the actual lamp inside the light fixture\), or the light output.  
It is measured in lumens \(lm\) or candelas \(cd\). Illuminance is the light level actually falling on the surface  
of an object being lit. It is measured in lux \(metric\) or foot-candelas \(Imperial\) where 1 ft-cd = 10.76 lx  
\(lux\). Brightness is the effect of light leaving the surface of an object being illuminated. It is what the human  
eye actually sees. It is affected by the intensity of the light source, the distance from the source to the  
object, and the properties of the object \(e.g. color and texture\). It is measured in foot-lamberts \(ft-L\). These  
three measurements are related mathematically by the inverse-square law, E = I/D2, where E is the  
illuminance in foot-candelas, I is the intensity in lumens, and D is the distance in feet between the sources  
and the point of calculation on the surface.  
Generally speaking, objects that appear bright draw more attention to themselves. Because of this, it is the  
job of the LD to ensure that those objects needing attention, whether they be performers or decorative,  
are appropriately bright.  
# 5.2.2 Distribution  
Distribution refers to the manner in which light strikes a surface and reveals an object.  
It can be applied to how objects appear, in that they might be softly lit as part of a larger scene with light  
that has no sharp edges. On the other hand, they may be individually lit with a small, sharply defined,  
single light beam.  
On another level, distribution can be applied to the appearance of light that uses an image projector of  
some sort, such as a gobo in front of an ellipsoidal fixture \(to be discussed in more detail later in the chapter\)  
or an actual projector. These in turn produce certain desired images on a surface such as a wall or scrim.  
On a third level, distribution can be applied to the shape of a light beam itself when viewed through smoke  
or haze effects.  
# 5.2.3 color  
As with the design tools of event décor, color is the most noticeable and strongest quality of light. Indeed,  
all light is colored, and white light is simply a mixture of all visible wavelengths \(colors\) between infrared  
and ultraviolet radiation on the electromagnetic spectrum. One of the keys to good lighting design is a  
thorough understanding of color. We begin with some definitions.  
Hue is the pure form of a color with no white, black, or gray added. Tint is the mixture of a hue with white.  
Shade is the mixture of a hue with black. Tone is the mixture of a hue with black and white \(gray\). It is  
sometimes also called value \(see Chapter 2\). Saturation refers to the amount of hue in a color mixture.  
For example, a pure red color \(like fire-engine red\) would be said to have a high saturation of red.  
In the world of lighting, the color wheel takes on a slightly different appearance from the color wheel associated  
with décor \(which uses pigments\). For light, the primary colors are red, blue, and green. The secondary colors **198** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 5.2** Lighting color wheel  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
are yellow \(mixture of red and green\), cyan \(mixture of green and blue\), and magenta \(mixture of red and  
blue\). Figure 5.2 illustrates a lighting color wheel \(also called a visual or RGB color wheel\).  
The two differing color wheels, the one for pigment as described in Chapter 2, and the one for light, are  
often confusing since they do not make logical sense when mixing colors. Technically, as pointed out by  
Fitt and Thornley \(2002, pp. 22–23\),  
the lessons learned from mixing the colors of paint are somewhat different to those for mixing  
the colors of light. It has to be realized that light is the source of all color, but pigments in paint  
\[or in dyed fabrics\] are simply reflections or absorbers of parts of the light that illuminates them.  
If a beam of red light and a beam of green light are superimposed the result is yellow. On the  
other hand, if we mix red and green paint, we get rather a nasty looking ‘brown black’ color.  
When using light, all spectral colors can be created by adding various component parts of red,  
green, and blue light and the system used is called ‘addition,’ ultimately creating white. Pigments  
derive their colors by subtracting parts of the spectrum, therefore the system with pigments is  
called ‘subtraction’ and ultimately creates black.  
For special events, the LD is frequently called upon to not only light stage performances, but also decorative  
elements. These are particularly sensitive to the interaction between the hues of light and pigment hues,  
since most décor is pigment-based \(e.g. fabrics, painted surfaces, costumes\). Table 5.1 illustrates the  
interaction between the two types of color, and can serve as a guide for what a decorative element or person  
looks like when subjected to a certain color of light \(Fuchs, 1929\).  
To add to the confusion, additive and subtractive color mixing are also found in the lighting world alone.  
Additive color mixing refers to the combining of two or more colors to form a new color. As illustrated in Lighting systems **199**

Figure 5.3 \(left\), the combining of red and blue light sources, for example, will produce a new color,  
magenta. Subtractive color mixing refers to the filtering of light. When light passes through a single colored  
gel or filter, only the wavelength corresponding to the color of the filter will pass through it. Figure 5.3  
\(right\) illustrates this concept.  
**Figure 5.3** Illustration of additive \(left\) and subtractive \(right\) color mixing in light  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews **200** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
The last important concept of color in lighting design is the meaning of color. As outlined in Chapter 2  
when we discussed décor, every color has certain emotions attached to it. It is these emotions that the LD  
tries to enhance in order to make his design more effective.  
# 5.2.4 Direction  
For special event lighting, there are three areas of concern with respect to lighting direction\: stage and  
entertainment lighting, décor and theme lighting, and ambient lighting. In all cases, the effect of directional  
lighting is similar, but the desired outcome may be different. Let us examine the different directions that  
may be used to light people or objects and then see what the differences may be, using Figure 5.4 as a guide.  
# 5.2.4.1 Front lighting  
We begin with front lighting \(Figure 5.4A\). Although this direction gives the best visibility, it also tends  
to make objects and people appear “flat.” For lighting people and stage shows, this is one direction that is  
absolutely necessary so the audience can see what is happening onstage. Generally speaking, in almost  
every instance of special event entertainment, some component of continuous front lighting will be needed,  
even if it is not fully bright or not white. On the other hand, for ambient lighting and theme décor lighting,  
front lighting is not always desirable. If lighting walls, for instance, to achieve a general mood, direct  
**Figure 5.4** Direction in lighting  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews Lighting systems **201**  
lighting is less desirable than up lighting as it tends to highlight the flaws in the wall. However, if a large  
painted mural is part of the décor, front lighting may be the right choice in order to give the best visibility  
and render the mural scene more realistic. The same would apply if the front lighting is a gobo and a clear,  
proportionally correct pattern is required to be seen on the wall.  
# 5.2.4.2 Top lighting  
The next direction is top lighting \(Figure 5.4B\). For people, this adds shadows to faces but also adds nice  
highlights to hair and shoulders, which onstage can help to separate people from backgrounds. For décor  
purposes, top lighting is often used to light table centers with pin spots or automated fixtures, to give  
crisp, undistorted beams of light throughout the event space. It is also used for highlighting décor vignettes  
and for floor lighting.  
# 5.2.4.3 Rear lighting  
Rear lighting \(Figure 5.4C\) is very useful for adding dimension to people or objects onstage and for  
separating them from the background. Similarly, for décor it can help to add a third dimension and make  
a display seem more “alive.”  
# 5.2.4.4 Side lighting  
Side lighting \(Figure 5.4D\) is highly desirable in some form when lighting people onstage as it also adds  
dimension and makes the body shape more obvious \(e.g. facial features\). In the same way, it can add shape  
to décor. However, when lighting flat décor as in the case of murals, it tends to highlight flaws in the surface  
and is not recommended.  
# 5.2.4.5 Up lighting  
The final direction for lighting is under or up lighting \(Figure 5.4E\). When used to light people, this is  
associated with a ghoulish, macabre effect as seen in movies and is not desirable unless it is being used  
for a special effect. However, for décor, especially for ambient lighting, it is one of the most effective  
directions, particularly for uplightng walls, ceilings, and backdrops.  
# 5.2.5 movement  
A related aspect of direction is movement. Movement indicates any change in lighting that gives life to the  
lighting and brings it closer to the natural world. It is usually of timed duration and can include\:  
● a change in direction;  
● a change in color;  
● a change in intensity;  
● a change in distribution, such as the appearance of different gobos from the same fixture;  
● the movement of an offstage light such as a followspot or automated fixture.  
According to Williams \(1999\),  
movement may be rapid or very subtle, slow and imperceptible. Such may be the case of a  
designer that provides a slow shift in sunlight from one side of the stage to the other throughout  
the duration of a play. The audience may not notice the shift; however, they often may ‘feel’ the  
result of the change emotionally .  
.  
. Up until recently, movement was probably the least utilized  
quality of light by the stage LD. This all changed in the 1980s when the automated lighting  
fixture was born. The modern automated fixture can now move physically – directing its beam **202** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
from one part of the stage to another \[or any other area within the event space\]. In addition, the  
automated fixture can ‘move’ from one color or effect to another, at any speed. The changes and  
combinations of intensity, form, distribution, color, and movement are endless.  
There will be more on automated lights in the next section.  
# 5.3 lighting instruments  
Depending on where one works, lighting terminology differs. In North America, a lighting instrument is  
also called a fixture or unit. In Britain, it is known as a light fitting or lantern. In the engineering and  
architectural communities and the rest of the world, it is known as a luminaire. This will be our common  
term for the remainder of this chapter.  
In this section, we will be discussing the basic construction of luminaires, the different types, and what  
each is used for in special event lighting.  
# 5.3.1 construction of luminaires  
Like audio systems and video, lighting is in the midst of major evolutionary changes. Constantly advancing  
LED technology has resulted in the slow but inevitable replacement of most conventional luminaires with  
their LED counterparts, especially in many high-end events and concerts. Because there is still a place for  
conventional luminaires in lower-end events and permanent installations, in this section we will examine  
how both conventional and LED luminaires are constructed.  
# 5.3.1.1 Conventional luminaires  
All the terms defining a lighting instrument mentioned above refer to a “package” that is comprised of the  
following components\:  
● Outer housing. This is a metal or plastic, specially shaped container that houses the whole instrument  
and prevents light from spilling to undesired locations.  
● Lamp. This is the source of the light. Similar to an everyday household light bulb, lamps are normally  
made up of a glass or quartz envelope, a base, and a filament \(usually made of tungsten and powered  
by electricity\) surrounded by a gas \(called a gas discharge lamp\). Depending primarily on the gas used  
within the bulb, the light produced may vary slightly in its whiteness. This variation is an indication of  
different color temperatures. The only real significance of different color temperatures is that if luminaires  
with different temperatures are being used for lighting a specific scene, then different gels will probably  
need to be used to achieve the same apparent color. We will discuss gels in more detail shortly.  
● Lens. This is a curved, glass plate that is positioned at the front of the luminaire to give the light beam  
emanating from the lamp its characteristic shape. Most lenses are curved a certain way to make the  
beam either narrow or widely dispersed, and with hard or soft edges for effect. Generally speaking,  
the greater the curvature of the lens and the smaller the focal length \(distance from lamp to lens\),  
the greater will be the dispersion of light. This wide angle of the beam is known as the beam  
angle, defined as the point in the cone of light emitted by the luminaire where the light level is  
diminished by 50 percent when compared with the level in the center of the beam. Note that not  
all conventional luminaires have separate lenses. PAR lamps \(parabolic aluminized reflector—see below\),  
for example, incorporate reflector and housing as a single unit with the lamp attached to one end and  
the size of the beam determined by the length of the housing.  
● Reflector. Inside the luminaire, the lamp produces light that emanates in all directions, including to the  
rear of the luminaire. In order to increase efficiency, a curved reflector is placed at the rear of the Lighting systems **203**  
**Figure 5.5** General construction details of a conventional luminaire  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
luminaire that takes the excess light and re-directs it toward the lens. There are various reflector designs  
for each of the different types of luminaire and they play an important part in the intensity and shape  
of the light coming from the luminaire.  
See Figure 5.5 for a depiction of a generic conventional luminaire.  
● Accessories. In addition to the four main components of construction, most luminaires also come with  
accessories that improve their performance. They generally include some or all of the following\:  
● Lamp socket. This is a socket designed to accept the specific lamp.  
● Electrical cord and connector. These tie into the lighting circuitry.  
● Mounting yoke with a pipe or “C” clamp. The mount allows the luminaire to pan \(rotate horizontally  
360 degrees\) and tilt \(move vertically up and down\), then to be securely locked into place on an  
overhead truss or pipe support.  
● Color-frame clips. These metal clips, fitted to the front of the luminaire, accept a lightweight metal  
or heat-resistant fiber holder \(color frame\) for colored gels \(filters\), donuts, barn doors, or gobos \(image  
projection\). A colored gel is typically made of plastic or glass and comes in a large selection of colors.  
A gel normally serves three purposes\: to correct for the color temperature of a specific lamp, thereby  
allowing uniform light all over a surface; to provide drama and effect in lighting décor or performers;  
and to diffuse or soften light \(e.g. uplighting walls\). A donut is a metal plate used to increase the  
clarity of patterns in an ellipsoidal reflector spotlight \(ERS\) by reducing halation and sharpening the  
image. A barn door is a metal apparatus fitted on the front of a luminaire using the clips. It has  
independently adjustable flaps that are used to control light spill. A gobo stands for go-between and  
refers to a small metal cutout incorporating a pattern that can be projected onto any surface. This  
enables the luminaire \(typically an ERS, to be explained later\) to act as an image projector. Gobos  
come as stock patterns from a number of manufacturers or they can be customized into names,  
company logos, black and white or color photographs and graphics, and almost any pattern desirable.  
See Figure 5.6 for an illustration of these accessories.  
# 5.3.1.2 LED luminaires  
We have touched on light-emitting diodes in previous chapters but never really explained what they are.  
LEDs are basically just tiny light bulbs that fit easily into an electrical circuit. Unlike ordinary incandescent **204** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 5.6** Lighting accessories \(not to scale\)  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
bulbs, they don’t have a filament that will burn out, and they don’t get especially hot. They are illuminated  
solely by the movement of electrons in a semiconductor material, and the color of the resulting light is  
determined by the magnitude of that movement \(Harris and Fenlon, 2014\).  
There are several important advantages that LEDs have over conventional luminaires that have made them  
very attractive for event lighting, including\: faster cycling time; more light per watt; smaller size; changeable  
colors within a single luminaire eliminating the need for color filters/gels; no dimming circuits required;  
lower heat radiation; lower operating cost; longer life, typically 50,000 h vs 1,200 h; and easier focusing  
ability. These advantages make LEDs the luminaires of choice as more events concentrate on “going green”  
\(see also Chapter 12 of Special Event Production\: The Process\). There are few disadvantages and the main one,  
higher acquisition cost, is rapidly disappearing as the technology improves and becomes more competitive.  
The design of an LED luminaire is quite different from a conventional luminaire as described above. Let’s  
examine the components of one\:  
● Housing. Unlike the general “can” shape of a conventional luminaire, an LED luminaire’s housing is  
typically metal, shaped to dissipate heat rather than to form the light beam. Ironically, “although LED  
lighting systems do not produce significant amounts of radiated heat, LEDs still generate heat within  
the junction \[i.e. the movement of electrons within the semiconductor\], which must be dissipated by  
convection and conduction. Extracting heat from the device using heat sinks \[i.e. that part of the metal Lighting systems **205**  
housing designed to conduct heat away from the LEDs\] and by operating LEDs in lower ambient  
temperatures enables higher light output and longer life of the device” \(Bullough, 2003\). Because of  
this, most LED luminaires are much shorter than conventional luminaires.  
● Light source. This, of course, is the LED itself, or rather an array of individual LEDs. Some designs  
incorporate arrays of individual LEDs of separate colors \(e.g. red, green, blue, white\), while others  
incorporate arrays of individual LEDs that generate all colors, or simply plain white. Unlike the position  
of lamps in conventional luminaires at the back of the housing, LEDs are placed near the middle of the  
housing.  
● Lens and reflector. Individual LEDs usually incorporate their own lenses in this type of luminaire. Thus,  
if there is an array of 14 LEDs, there would be 14 separate lenses. They also incorporate their own  
individual reflectors, so instead of having one large reflector at the back of the housing, there would be  
14 separate reflectors, one built into each LED light package. Many LED luminaires add a separate lens  
in front of the LED array that moves back and forth or “zooms” within the housing, which allows  
adjustment of the beam angle from narrow to wide.  
● Power supply/driver. This is built into the housing and essentially integrates the DMX signal \(see Section  
5.6.2 for an explanation of DMX\) with electrical power and controls the functions of the LED array.  
● Control panel. This is normally found on the outside rear of the housing and consists of an LCD display  
that has menu options for such things as setting the individual address of the luminaire.  
● DMX in/out. These are two DMX connection points, one female and one male, that permit the luminaire  
to be daisy-chained \(linked together\) with other luminaires so that all can receive the proper DMX signal.  
● Accessories. Most LED luminaires also incorporate many of the same accessories as conventional ones  
\(e.g. mounting yoke and color-frame clips for the same purposes as conventional\) because they still  
must provide the same functionality.  
See Figure 5.7 for a depiction of a generic LED luminaire.

# 5.3.2 types and uses of luminaires  
Being highly competitive, the lighting industry has produced a plethora of luminaires with various trade  
names, many with the same capabilities. Additionally, there is interaction among the TV, movie, theater,  
and special events industries, each with their own preferences for certain luminaire types, which contributes  
to the confusion. We will attempt to cut through this confusion by categorizing and explaining the most  
common types of luminaires used in the events industry. Some of the lesser-used ones will be omitted in  
the interest of keeping to the point. The main categories of luminaires are\:  
● conventional;  
● LED;  
● moving;  
● digital;  
● specialty.  
# 5.3.2.1 Conventional luminaires  
These are fixtures basically designed as shown in Figure 5.5. They have a single light source and a  
beam whose shape is dictated by the lens and construction of the housing. They can only be fixed  
in one position so are controllable by manually aiming them where wanted. They can only provide a  
single color of light but can be dimmed using separate hardware. The most common ones include the  
following\:  
● Ellipsoidal Reflector Spotlight \(ERS\). One of the true workhorses of the lighting industry, the ERS also  
goes by the names Source Four \(as marketed by ETC—Electronic Theater Controls\), Leko \(as marketed  
by Strand Lighting\), and profile, a term in common use in the UK. It is the most sophisticated of  
conventional instruments. Its beam shape is round and uniform with a hard edge, and various lenses  
inside the changeable barrels control the size of the beam. Some units are focusable so that an image  
can be projected, and framing shutters allow the beam to be shaped to eliminate light spill onto projection  
screens, the audience’s eyes, and such. The lens trains available provide beam angles ranging from very  
wide \(50 degrees\) to very small \(5 degrees\), an important consideration when choosing the right one  
for gobo projections at various distances. Options include irises to further reduce the beam spread,  
rotating pattern holders to make the projected images spin, and others. This is the best instrument to  
use with gobo patterns. Power requirements vary from 500–1,000 watts \(W\) and throw distances from  
10–100 ft \(3–30 m\). Besides its use with gobos, it is a popular luminaire for isolating key areas and  
people onstage, such as a speaker at a lectern.  
● Fresnel. This is one of the standard stage lighting instruments, especially in theaters. The Fresnel  
produces a characteristically intense, soft-edged beam created by the pebbled surface on the back of the  
Fresnel lens, named for its French inventor. For special events, it is typically used to provide large color  
wash areas onstage, and its soft beam edge easily permits blending of multiple beams and colors. Beam  
spread can be modified from spot to flood \(about 15–70 degrees\). Power requirements vary from 150–  
5,000 W with throw distances of 10–40 ft \(3–12 m\).  
● PAR can. A PAR can is comprised of a PAR sealed beam lamp and a mounting fixture and base \(the can\).  
It produces a high-intensity narrow beam of light and is available in many different sizes and powers.  
The bigger the number with a PAR can, the bigger its size. Electric lamps used in PAR cans are sized by  
multiples of 1/8 in. To convert the PAR number to in., divide the lamp number by 8. Therefore, a PAR64  
has an 8 in. diameter. A PAR64 is the most used such luminaire, especially for stage washes when flare  
and a very soft beam edge are not a problem. It is also commonly used as an inexpensive alternative for  
up lighting walls. Its power requirements are 500 or 1,000 W. Lighting systems **207**  
● Pinspot. Pinspots are very narrow-angle PAR lamps in a basic can-type housing. Beam spreads are very  
narrow and range from approximately 5 to 10 degrees. Pinspots come in power ranges of 75–1,000 W,  
and have a throw of 5–50 ft \(1.5–15 m\). They are sometimes referred to as rain lights. All PAR lamps for  
pinspots are low voltage and require transformers to transform the mains voltage \(120 or 240 volts AC\)  
to the proper lamp operating voltage. Usually, the transformer is incorporated into the rear of the fixture  
\(Williams, 1999\). Pinspots are useful for providing accents and highlights, and are particularly effective  
when all general lighting is dimmed down, allowing the pinspot\(s\) to highlight or draw attention to  
something \(e.g. table centers in a dark ballroom\).  
● Followspot. This is a manually operated luminaire designed for following performers as they move about  
a stage or a venue. Modern followspot fixtures consist of a cylindrical housing 4–6 ft \(1.2–1.8 m\) in  
length, mounted on a telescopic stand with castered legs. They are usually fitted with a manual iris and  
a color filter changer. A followspot is designed to provide a hard beam edge. Controls often exist to  
soften the beam edge when required. Followspots are traditionally mounted as high as possible at the  
rear of an event space, in order to front light the performers if they are on a stage. The size of the room  
and the distance to be projected are the factors that determine the size and intensity of the unit to be  
used. Usually, they are 250–3,000 W in power, and throw 50–200 ft \(15–60 m\).  
● Floodlight. Sometimes called a cyclight \(after the technical term, cyc or cyclorama, for a stage backdrop in  
theater\), this consists simply of an enclosed light source in a box with one open side. Floods are designed  
to provide a wide, even distribution of light over a large area. Typical beam angles range from 70 to 150  
degrees. Most units come with a fixed beam angle, although a few units are adjustable between flood  
and wide flood. Wattages range from 500 to 1,500 W. Floodlights do not use lenses but some may have  
a clear protective safety glass. Floodlight fixtures are particularly well suited for lighting backdrops in a  
theater but have found their way into special events. Typically, a continuous row of floodlights is arranged  
above and parallel to the backdrop, at a distance of 3–10 ft \(0.9–3 m\) away. For additional interest and  
impact, a row of fixtures may be used to uplight the backdrop, from the floor, although front lighting is  
best if it is a scenic backdrop. Floodlights are also sometimes used for the lighting of scenery, to provide  
large area washes, and as work lights. Individual fixtures are commonly available in both scoop \(round,  
open front\) and box flood \(square or rectangular, open front\) designs \(Williams, 1999\).  
● Audience blinder. “Not quite the slang name or use the manufacturers intended, but this is what  
audience blinders are generally used for—to illuminate or literally blind the audience” \(Moody and  
Dexter, 2013\). Generally, they consist of various configurations of PAR cans grouped in four to 20 or  
more lamps within a specially designed housing. Although they began in the touring concert world,  
they have made their way into special events. Using DMX control \(see Section 5.6.2\), they can be  
strobed in various patterns.  
See Figure 5.8 for examples of all these conventional luminaires.  
# 5.3.2.2 LED luminaires  
These are fixtures basically designed as shown in Figure 5.7, with some modifications. These modifications  
have resulted in the development of LED versions of all the conventional fixtures except with more  
capabilities, smaller size, and much lower operating costs. Most of these fixtures have added the capability  
to operate off any of the world voltages so are useable anywhere. Here is a general breakdown of where  
the technology now stands\:  
● ERS. An LED ellipsoidal is a fairly recent development and the shape and optics of the fixture are  
almost identical to the conventional one, but the acquisition cost is considerably more. Savings  
come from the longer life of the LEDs and from the cooler temperature. For example, ellipsoidals  
are designed to project gobo patterns on surfaces. In the past such gobos have had to be made from **208** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 5.8** Examples of conventional luminaires \(not to scale\)  
Photos courtesy of Altman Lighting, Active Blue, and CPS Group as per labels, and Doug Matthews \(Fresnel\)  
heat-resistant material, usually metal, due to the heat generated by the lamp. With LEDs as the light  
source, such heat is non-existent and gobos can be made out of much cheaper material such as acetate,  
thus enabling the projection of such things as color images and almost any graphic at relatively low cost.  
● Fresnel. Some Fresnels have not changed much in appearance but some are much more compact \(i.e.  
thinner\) than conventional Fresnels. They have the same characteristic beam spreads as conventional  
as well as continuous focusing, plus they have the added features of DMX control and are remotely  
controllable. The Fresnel lens remains in these fixtures.  
● PAR can. LED PARs have LED arrays comprising varying numbers of red, green, blue, and occasionally  
white individual LEDs. They are normally fixed with a single beam angle like their conventional  
counterparts \(usually 14 or 15 degrees\), but some manufacturers offer filters to change the angle. They  
are programmable using DMX for color mixing—remember that conventional PARs could only have a  
single color using a gel—and many can strobe. Brightness is now equal to or better than conventional  
lights. Some are also much slimmer than conventional. Most come with a double yoke assembly that  
enables safe mounting on the ground or other flat surface as well as flying on trussing.  
● Pinspot. LED pinspots now take on two different forms. One is as a DJ/club light with strobe features  
in a very narrow beam \(e.g. 3 to 12 degrees\) using programmable white or colored lighting. Of course,  
these can also be used for special events to add excitement at a low cost. The second form LED pinspots Lighting systems **209**  
have taken is the more traditional one using only a single focus point, but with the added features of  
battery power and wireless infrared dimmable control, and throw distances up to about 30 ft \(9 m\).  
Some models have moveable heads via a gooseneck-type design. Unlike the DJ lights, these have been  
designed specifically for the special event market for ease of control, and also quick installation using  
strong magnets. The batteries last up to 14 h \(see Figure 5.9\).  
● Followspot. LED followspots are about half the size of their conventional counterparts thus making  
them much more portable. Some are still fully manual, but others have options for either manual or  
DMX control. Colors are now changed at the push of a button as is dimming, although beam angle and  
diameter and focus are still manually controlled. Gobos can also be projected.  
● Floodlight. Like the other LED luminaires, floodlights have added multiple capabilities. They are now  
usually referred to as wash lights, and come as either long, narrow strips, or larger rectangular panels.  
Most have DMX programmable strobing, dimming, and color mixing. Some are also sound-activated  
\(e.g. strobing, dimming, and colors can be triggered by music\), remotely controlled, and wireless,  
battery-driven.  
● Audience blinder. Not too different in appearance from conventional blinders, LED units have multiple  
colors and individual LED control for colors, dimming, and strobing. They can also be sound-activated.  
See Figure 5.9 for examples of some of the LED units described that are most changed in appearance and  
design from conventional luminaires.  
# 5.3.2.3 Moving luminaires  
In the history of the lighting industry, there is no invention that has revolutionized it more than moving  
luminaires.  
Although automated fixtures \(also called moving lights, intelligent lights, or kinetic instruments\)  
have only been used in the special events industry since the late 1980s, the concept has been  
around since an original United States patent was issued to Herbert F. King of Newtonville,  
Massachusetts in 1928, for an ‘automatic spotlight’.  
\(Cadena, 2005\)  
Real development, however, did not take place until the late 1980s and accelerated in the 1990s to the point  
where today, almost all special events, concerts, and stage performances with even modest budgets use them.  
**Figure 5.9** Examples of led luminaires \(not to scale\)

The field has exploded in recent years and there are so many developments and companies making these  
products that it is impossible to keep up with them. There is, fortunately, some commonality among them\:  
● Features of moving luminaires. What are moving luminaires \(automated fixtures\)? Quite simply, they  
are the fusion of all the static luminaires that we have discussed into a single unit that can be remotely  
controlled. “The common feature of automated fixtures is movement, often very rapid\: light beams pan  
the stage and event space, zoom in and out, change shape and color, diffuse and sharpen; gobos  
materialize, spin around, change pattern, then disappear” \(Gillette, 2000, p. 353\). Most such luminaires  
include a number of internal features, which can create almost endless combinations of effects\:  
● Color wheels with dichroic lenses used to change the color of the beam \(like having a variety of colored  
gels available\).  
● Pattern wheels with gobos used to change the shape of the beam \(like having many different gobo  
patterns to choose from\).  
● Shutters used to dim or strobe the output \(like using a strobelight or dimming the light\).  
● Automated lens trains used to focus the beam \(like a Fresnel lens\).  
● Irises used to change the size of the beam.  
● Gate shutters to square off the beam \(like using a highly focusable light with barn doors for a small or  
large area\).  
● Prisms used for splitting the beam into three or five images, which can then be rotated.  
● General principles of operation. As expected, these luminaires are complex in their design. Power  
requirements are typically 200–1,200 W—although LED versions are much less—and they operate  
on two main principles, moving yoke or moving mirror. The moving yoke principle achieves beam move-  
ment by using very precise electric step motors to control movement of the entire yoke and body of the  
fixture. The moving mirror principle achieves beam movement by reflecting the beam off a step motor-  
controlled mirror mounted on the body of the fixture. There are also numerous models of automated  
fixtures for the DJ/club industry that utilize the same basic designs but come in various forms and  
shapes that create differing effects. They are typically cheaper and less capable overall than the more  
sophisticated designs.  
● LED versions. LED movable fixtures, sometimes called moving heads, are proliferating, particularly in  
the club market. The advantages include multiple colors without the need for a color wheel, lower power  
consumption, smaller size, and lower cost. Interestingly, rather than trying to exchange LEDs for  
conventional light sources \(i.e. lamps\) in a complex design, many companies have gone to moving LED  
fixtures that replace and extend the more simplified designs of individual traditional luminaires  
described above. For example, there are now moving head wash units with zoom capability \(i.e. just a PAR  
can with extra capabilities\), and also moving head spots, which are more a combination of a pinspot and  
an ERS, with gobo-projection capability. No doubt even more different combinations will arrive, some  
of which will prove popular for special events.  
See Figure 5.10 for examples of moving luminaires.  
# 5.3.2.4 Digital lighting  
Digital lighting is the result of merging digital projection technology with automated lighting technology.  
This has produced products that are essentially moving projectors with the ability to project literally  
any type of digital graphic image, including digital photographs, computer graphics, and digital video,  
from one fixture onto any surface in a three-dimensional space. Not only that, but they also have the  
entire gamut of automated lighting features, typically those of a moving head wash unit. To do this  
effectively requires two light sources, one for the projector \(usually a conventional lamp with a high lumen Lighting systems **211**  
output\), and one for the other automated features \(usually banks of LEDs\), together in the unit. Also, to  
utilize all the projector and lighting features requires a media server. A media server is “a sophisticated  
computer that stores video clips and still image libraries. It can be used to manipulate any of those  
images with color, effects, and image correction to surfaces \(curved or flat\) through digital light sources”  
\(Moody and Dexter, 2013\). Current models of digital lights now incorporate the server within the housing  
at the base of the fixture and it is controlled using DMX digital protocol \(see Section 5.6.2\) via XLR cables  
or another protocol called Art-Net via Ethernet cables.  
Figure 5.10 also illustrates a digital fixture, the Robe DigitalSpot 7100 DT.

# 5.3.2.5 Specialty lighting  
Within the lighting industry, there are a number of specialized lights that are used frequently for events  
that do not fall exactly into the categories we have already discussed. These include\:  
● Blacklight. This light, an ultraviolet \(UV\) light source used to create special lighting effects with  
fluorescent materials, works best on light-colored material at low ambient light levels.  
● Laser. Actually an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation, this word has  
become synonymous with a device that produces pencil-thin beams of coherent monochromatic light.  
It is used primarily for special effects and is discussed in more detail in Chapter 6.  
● Strobelight. A strobe is a device that gives multiple rapid bursts of high-intensity light. Strobe lighting  
is almost always produced by a compact xenon strobe lamp activated by a power supply and timing  
circuitry. Strobelights can be simple low-power devices with fixed flash rates, or sophisticated devices  
triggered by a lighting control console at specific intervals. It should be noted that strobe lights set at  
certain frequencies might trigger epileptic seizures. They are now more often integrated with new  
luminaires \(e.g. audience blinders\) rather than single units.  
● Searchlight. Manufactured in World War II to detect enemy aircraft at night, searchlights are still in use  
today for special events. Using a carbon arc light source, they are capable of projecting a wide, intense  
beam of light into the sky at night. Worth noting here is a series of spectacular Nazi rallies in Nuremberg,  
Germany, in the late 1930s \(400,000 attendees\), in which designer Albert Speer created a “cathedral of  
light” using 130 searchlights pointed straight up 8 km into the night sky. This was arguably the first  
real “light show” of the 20th century.  
● Neon. Neon is a type of discharge lighting generated by a high voltage across two oppositely  
charged electrodes at opposite ends of a long, thin glass tube filled with neon gas. As the  
electrical charge flows between the electrodes, electrons collide with neon atoms causing them to give  
off energy in the form of visible light. Different colors can be obtained by mixing other gases, or by using  
fluorescent coatings. For special events and advertising, the glass tube is customizable and may be bent  
to form letters and different shapes. Small, battery-powered neon designs are popular as table  
centerpieces.  
● Fiber optics. Optical fibers are long, thin strands of flexible glass approximately the width of a human  
hair. They transmit light through a thin glass central core that is covered with an optical cladding  
material that reflects the light back inside the core whenever the fibers bend. This in turn is protected  
by an outer plastic buffer coating. These fibers are used in special event applications as battery-powered,  
light-emitting bundles for centerpieces or small “sculptures,” and as the main light source for star drops.  
See also Chapter 2 on Décor.  
● String lights. Also known as miniature lights, pin lights, or fairy lights, these are the typical low  
voltage Christmas lights that now come in strings of 50, 100, and 150. They can be plain white  
or colored and can also be set up to twinkle randomly. They now usually incorporate LED lamps.  
The latest strings come in various shapes such as swags, tree wraps, netting, icicles, and curtains.  
For events, they work very well in large quantities used in foliage, trees, and florals, or with sheer  
draping.  
● DJ club effects. What was once a popular addition to events was a mirror ball, a large plastic ball covered  
with small mirror pieces and motorized to rotate. When a spotlight—usually a pinspot—was focused  
onto the ball, specks of light were thrown around the room. This effect, and many other different  
patterns and colors, is now achieved by small moving luminaires intended for DJ events and clubs. Some  
are seeing their way into the special event market. Lighting systems **213**

**DM**\: What are some of the major changes you have seen in special event lighting over the last five  
to ten years, particularly in South Africa?  
**ol**\: One thing to remember is that special events \[as an industry\] really have only been around  
for the last 20 years in South Africa so we started later than everyone else. We follow the uk and **214** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
European trends and we have noticed greater quantities of lighting instruments and much more  
sophistication at events. It seems that people \[event managers\] have lost touch with the fundamen-  
tals of lighting and instead just go for a lot of movement and rapid changes in the lighting of an  
event. Also, you now need a good background and training to operate modern lighting consoles.  
**DM**\: What aspects of event lighting design and the “raw materials” \(i.e. the different luminaires and  
their capabilities\) do you think are essential knowledge for event producers or event managers?  
**ol**\: They should know about scheduling for setup and teardown, about the power requirements  
for lights, and about the budget required for lights \(i.e. the more lights and the more sophisti-  
cation, the more crew, and hence the more budget needed\). They should also have a general  
understanding of what lights are available and what their capabilities are, in other words, how they  
will affect a show. They need to know what kinds of lights can save money and still accomplish  
the show.  
**DM**\: Do you have any comments on event safety as it pertains to lighting, considering there have  
been so many accidents recently?  
**ol**\: Mainly, there are no internationally recognized, written safety standards and that is a concern.  
There should be worldwide standards. However, for now we try to keep up with what is available  
and are members of various safety organizations such as the Event Safety Alliance \(esa\) in the  
usa and the Production Services Association \(Psa\) in the uk. A specific example of another con-  
cern I have is that most trussing structures for stages are made of aluminum and that is a problem  
because it would be better made out of steel, since aluminum breaks more easily.  
**DM**\: Where do you see event lighting in five to ten years from now?  
**ol**\: leds will continue to dominate, getting faster \[moving heads\]. Spots like the Vari-Lites will  
improve. Digital control will continue to improve.  
**DM**\: Do you have any other words of wisdom you would like to pass on to students entering the  
profession of event management, or any comments about the special events industry in South  
Africa?  
**ol**\: A production manager \[producer\] should understand what is involved in preparing equipment  
for an event, break down the entire process and watch for problems and faults in that process.  
Health and safety are very important throughout.  
They \[students\] should try to acquire experience in as many different types of events as possible,  
including rock and roll, theater, and corporate. Take the time and make the effort to invest in their  
career and learn what a designer is trying to achieve with an event. They must remember that they  
\[producers\] are servicing the client and are not the stars.  
# 5.4 event lighting design  
Williams \(1999\), in his extensive online explanation of stage lighting, states that a “lighting designer must  
be an artist. He must understand style, composition, balance, esthetics, and human emotion. He must also  
understand the science of light, optics, vision, the psychology of perception, and lighting technology.”  
Williams wrote this with reference to lighting for the theater. Although the description of the LD is true,  
in the special event environment the luxury of a week or more to design and install a lighting configuration  
for a stage performance in a theater is not an option. Designers in events have only one chance and often  
no more than a cursory preliminary visit to the event venue before actual installation. Often, the design Lighting systems **215**  
has to be completed in a rush, sometimes only a matter of days or even hours before installation. Besides  
this minimal timeframe for design, the installation must frequently be completed the day of, or at best the  
day before, the event itself. Focusing of luminaires and programming of automated fixtures is often  
accomplished literally moments before the doors to the event open. The event LD must therefore be able  
to design with the same artistic flare as the theater LD but must add an equal capability to be organized  
and to work under extreme pressure.  
Steve Matthews, owner of Vancouver, Canada-based Innovation Lighting \(www.innovationlighting.net\),  
considers a complete understanding of the following topics to be critical for successful event lighting design  
\(S. Matthews, personal communication, September, 2014—and a note of gratitude must be added to  
acknowledge his assistance in writing Sections 5.4.1 through 5.4.3\)\:  
● conceptual design;  
● practical design;  
● physical design;  
● between concept and execution;  
● lighting setup, control, and operation.  
# 5.4.1 conceptual design  
Before beginning the design, the LD needs to know the purpose of the event and exactly what the goals  
for the lighting are in the mind of the event producer. The design will ultimately fail if both LD and event  
producer do not agree on these. For example, is the event’s purpose to be an award show with a few simple  
presentations, or does the event producer expect a show with enough lighting pizzazz and excitement to  
rival the Academy Awards? Other key questions center around what is being lit, what concept the event  
producer has in mind, and whether only an ambience is needed or something specific must actually be  
illuminated. The categories of conceptual design include theme, ambience, and practical illumination\:  
● Theme. This refers to the enhancement of a specific event theme, usually decorative, through the use  
of lighting. It can vary from complementing a theme’s colors, to lighting props, tables, walls, floors, and  
ceiling.  
● Ambience. When we think of ambience, we often imagine a quiet restaurant with soft music in the  
background and candlelit tables. What we are trying to do when we talk about ambience is to set a mood  
for an event, something that makes us feel a certain way. For the special event LD, ambience is not quite  
so restrictive as creating that intimate restaurant mood. The event might not be a simple dinner. It might  
be a rock concert requiring high-energy, automated lights for a 20-something crowd or it might be a  
dinner and awards show for a 50-something group of academics. Obviously, the ambience required will  
be vastly different for these two extremes.  
● Practical illumination. This refers to more of the plain, less creative use of lighting for such mundane  
items as stage backdrops, lecterns, IMAG and video, and guest speakers. The practicality concern goes  
back to our statement at the beginning of this chapter about selective visibility, in that an audience must  
be able to see only what they need to see when they need to see it.  
# 5.4.2 Practical design  
Keeping the three categories of conceptual design in mind, the LD moves on to practical design. Practical  
design forces the LD to consider how all the design elements and design principles that we discussed in  
Section 5.1 will be used to accomplish the goals set out by the event producer. Let us examine the practical  
applications of this theory. **216** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 5.4.2.1 Lighting for themes  
Décor and event theming using light is a vast field with perhaps only a handful of truly gifted LDs in North  
America. When it is done well, it is usually the single event component that causes gasps from guests as  
they enter the event space. Some practical considerations that have proven effective for designers include\:  
● Using complementary colors for props, such as greens to enhance trees, and reds or ambers to enhance  
wood.  
● Choosing the event colors at the outset with the event producer and trying to keep the lighting in those  
color families.  
● Using lighting in conjunction with special effects, each to enhance the other. Examples include lighting  
along a path at floor level under fog, rapid automated light movement to enhance indoor pyro and  
confetti cannons, or lighting effects and gobo patterns on a water scrim.  
● Using all the dimensions and surfaces within the event space. They can all be used for lighting\: ceilings  
for cloud patterns or changing colors; walls for theme gobos or uplighting; floors for gobos, color  
washes, and wild movement. See Figure 5.12 \(top\).  
● Striving for the unusual, such as\: lighting under tables; unique lighting of table centers \(not necessarily  
pinspots but battery-powered LEDs or mini lights\); reverse lighting of the audience instead of the event  
space and walls; lighting of different event elements and theme prop vignettes at different times as the  
event progresses.  
● Flying luminaires as much as possible in order to minimize clutter and distraction. For example,  
pinspotting table centers from above is effective and classy.  
● Keeping instruments hidden from view and out of people’s eyes.  
# 5.4.2.2 Lighting for ambience  
If this can be done very subtly, the effect is better and often can affect the mood of the event and of the  
guests. Some considerations that help to achieve the right mood, be it low key or highly exciting, include  
the following\:  
● Using indirect lighting for such things as walls, ceilings, pillars, and tables.  
● Using the psychology of color. This means that colors used for lighting must be flattering to the attendees  
\(stay away from cool colors that do not flatter the skin\), yet must create a dramatic and desirable  
environment to be in. Refer to Section 5.2.3 for more information.  
● Using color-changing instruments that can be programmed to change slowly over time and thus give a  
continuously new look and feel to the event every few minutes.  
● Minimizing jolting contrast changes, such as a quick movement from purple to orange or yellow, or from  
red to blue, rather making it a more gradual, subtle movement through several colors.  
● Generally keeping brightness levels low. See Figure 5.12 \(bottom\).  
● Trying to avoid light spillage on unwanted or extraneous objects.  
# 5.4.2.3 Lighting for specific needs  
Most events have some element of the more mundane such as the need to light the company president  
giving his annual address or award recipients as they come onstage. Often, the mundane must be mixed  
with the need for ambience and theming, and it is necessary to plan for this well ahead of time since many  
luminaires can serve double duty, especially automated fixtures. Some of the considerations for practical  
lighting include the following\: Lighting systems **217**  
**Figure 5.12** Examples of practical lighting design

bottom—Images by Lighting, esPY’s VIP Post Party produced by Silver Birches,  
photographer Brian Callaway  
● Lighting for live entertainment. Using front lighting is best to illuminate performers for visibility, but  
back lighting to create energy and to set the mood for the performance. The inclusion of automated  
fixtures on a back line is common in many high-energy performances. If a single performer or small  
group of performers is onstage, or especially going to be roving throughout the audience, one or more  
followspots is recommended. Depending on the type of performance \(e.g. themed cirque-type show,  
comedy, dance, or music\), a variety of front color washes is probably required so that the entire stage  
will be covered with even light, but also so that different onstage moods can be created for different  
segments of the performance. Typically, single luminaires \(e.g. ERS or Fresnel\) are used to isolate and Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**218** focus on individual performers who may be important within a group, such as soloists in a band. The  
best way to provide for all contingencies in lighting a stage performance is to discuss in as much detail  
as possible the needs of individual acts and performers, and then ensure that the LD is able to provide  
for those needs with a sufficient variety and number of luminaires.  
● Lighting for video. Using colored filters is not recommended, as the cameras require a common light  
color among all fixtures as well as a consistent temperature. Filters should only be used to correct for  
color temperature. Normally, lighting for the camera is bright and white. Cameras are less forgiving of  
color variations than is the human eye. Back light is also essential to create a visual separation between  
the subject and the background.  
● Lighting for people other than entertainers. Front light coming from two sides helps to eliminate  
shadows. Complementary colored filters help to enhance the appearance of good health. Warm colors  
\(pinks and ambers\) improve the apparent health of the subject and cool colors \(blues and lavenders\)  
enhance the colors in clothing and sets \(see again Table 5.1\). Back lighting is also recommended,  
although not always necessary, again to separate the subject from the background.  
● Lighting for attention. “Attention” generally refers to the use of flashy effects and new concepts in order  
to grab the attention of the audience, often in preparation for an important presentation or stage  
performance segment. Considerations include the following\:  
● Projecting a logo as a gobo design is simple, inexpensive, and rewarding. Everyone likes to see their  
name in lights, and they can be projected on walls, ceilings, floors, screens, or any other reflective  
surface.  
● Automated lighting is an excellent way to add professional pizzazz and high-energy flash to an awards  
show or gala event. Using moving luminaires, or even more effectively digital lights as described  
earlier, allows unlimited combinations of graphics, gobos, lighting effects, and computer images to  
be used throughout a three-dimensional space.  
# 5.4.3 Physical design  
The physical design of the event lighting refers to how it will be accomplished. This is when the designer  
brings out his toolbox and puts the right luminaires in the right number in the right location and makes  
the magic happen. Primary considerations include the design of the venue itself, where and how the  
luminaires will be mounted, the number and variety of luminaires, and where and how lighting will be  
controlled.  
# 5.4.3.1 Venue physical characteristics  
Every event space is different and an early site visit prior to designing the event lighting is essential. This  
enables the LD to mold the space with light. It also helps to establish the optimum number and types of  
luminaires to be used. The purpose of the site visit is to help the LD understand the following, especially  
if the event is to be held in an indoor venue\:  
● Shape of the room. Is it open, square, round, or oddly shaped and does it contain obstructions like  
pillars?  
● Ceiling height and design. If the ceiling is too high or too low, lighting will be impacted and the effects  
either heightened or lessened, requiring either more or fewer luminaires. If large chandeliers or complex  
recesses form large parts of the ceiling, extra luminaires may be needed or a different approach taken.  
For example, lighting can be reflected off large crystal chandeliers without the chandeliers being turned  
on, to create spectacular colored ambient effects on the ceiling. Lighting systems **219**  
● Control of existing house and ambient lighting. Will daylight through windows or translucent ceiling  
material such as tenting be a factor in lighting design? Where and how is house lighting controlled and  
can a remote controller be used at a lighting control console position in order to save time and effort in  
turning house lights on and off?  
● Stage position. Where will the stage or stages be positioned and how large will they be? Will there be  
one main stage and/or several satellite stages that need separate lighting or could one or two followspots  
be sufficient to light the satellite stages? Will there be a backstage area that requires work lights for  
performers or other technical personnel? Will there be elements of a stage set that require unique  
lighting? Often, these questions will require input from the event producer as well as the venue manager.  
# 5.4.3.2 Lighting support  
Luminaires must be mounted on something and in a location that provides optimum illumination to  
achieve the goals of the lighting design. Even though it could be directly on the floor or other surface \(e.g.  
table, stage, or décor\), the exact location, method of mounting and support, and tentative setup time  
required have to be determined well before the event takes place. The site visit is vital to establishing this.  
● Location of lighting support. The LD will be asking a number of key questions during the site visit to  
best determine where the lights will be positioned\:  
● Will lighting be flown \(i.e. rigged from the ceiling\) or ground supported on lighting trees or lifts? If  
flown, the designer must know the exact location of ceiling hanging points, how many there are, and  
what their load rating is. Flying lighting or audio is normally a much more expensive proposition  
than ground supporting it due to the additional work and time required, sometimes including the  
use of qualified union labor, extra time to rig the ceiling points, and time delay for other installation  
components such as décor and dining tables.  
● If trees or lifts are used, where should they be placed? Prime locations must be chosen to permit  
optimum lighting of stages and sets without blocking sight lines, without creating hazards to foot  
traffic, by eliminating lights in guests’ eyes, and by minimizing cable runs.  
● Are there permanent obstructions in the venue? If there are pillars in the room or sets and other  
décor elements that might block the path of light from any luminaires, then the design must be  
changed or a new support method devised.  
● If followspots are to be used, where is the optimum location for them and will risers be required to  
elevate them to the required height?  
● Ground-supported systems. Ground support can be simple or complex. Here are the possibilities in  
ascending order of complexity\:  
● Placement on a surface. The simple version can mean actually placing the luminaires on the ground,  
floor, or other surface, such as a stage, table, audio speaker, or décor piece. In this situation, the  
luminaire is simply plugged into either a separate electrical circuit or into a dimmer circuit, focused,  
and controlled from the lighting console. Many luminaires today come with dual, movable yokes  
designed specifically for mounting on flat surfaces. Increasingly, luminaires of different designs are  
being equipped with long-life batteries enabling remote control using infrared \(IR\) or RF signals  
without any wiring.  
● Lighting trees. A second type of ground support uses lighting trees. These are simple aluminum  
structures comprising a horizontal bar to which the luminaires are clamped, usually from four to six  
fixtures such as Fresnels or PARs, and a vertical, adjustable, aluminum support pole with a tripod  
base. Trees are a good solution for lighting a simple and low-budget stage performance, and they also  
are good if setup time is minimal. The setup normally incorporates one tree on each side of the stage  
with luminaires from each tree cross-focused to light the entire stage in a wash. Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**220** ● Genie lift-supported truss or lift. Continuing upwards in complexity, the next form of ground-  
supported system incorporates a special heavy-duty support machine called a Genie® Super Tower™,  
manufactured by Genie Industries. This machine is wheeled and vertically extendable, capable of  
supporting up to 800 pounds \(363 kg\) of weight, making it excellent for supporting a long truss line  
with many luminaires.  
The remaining ground-supported systems—rigging tower, ground-supported tower, and roof system—are  
variations of designs constructed entirely out of metal trussing. Most of these are used in outdoor events,  
although they are occasionally found inside large venues like arenas or stadia where flying from high roofs  
is discouraged or difficult. Because of its complexity and the need for critical load calculations when  
mounting luminaires on it, we will deal with trussing in detail separately in Section 9.2 of Chapter 9.  
● Flown systems. A flown system is one in which lighting trussing is attached to hanging points \(mounting  
hooks or bolts stressed to carry a certain load\) in a ceiling of a venue, usually by means of heavy-duty  
chains and pulleys or chains and a motor. Flown systems may also support audio speakers and audio-  
visual projectors on the same truss line as the lighting. Black masking drape is often used to hide  
the truss structure once the system is in place. The term “flown” can also refer to mounting luminaires  
on the larger, ground-supported systems mentioned above. Once again, this subject is discussed in  
Section 9.2 of Chapter 9.  
# 5.4.3.3 Types of luminaires  
Deciding on the number and type of luminaires to use is what makes a good LD and can make or break  
the effectiveness of the lighting design. Of all the instruments available from the lighting toolbox, the  
designer must choose the ones that will best achieve the event goals, including budgetary goals. In making  
this decision, the LD must review the following\:  
● Required intensity. How bright must each luminaire be to give the effect desired? Most lights come in  
multiples of 100 W power.  
● Required color. What is being lit and how will it be affected by different colors? Are colors required to  
enhance the effect? The types of gels or gobos to use will be determined by the answer to this question.  
This question becomes less important with LED luminaires since most can project a variety of colors  
without the need for gels.  
● Required coverage. How big an area must each luminaire cover? Will the budget allow for only eight  
luminaires to illuminate a 32 ft wide x 24 ft deep \(9.6 m x 7.2 m\) stage, or can more luminaires be  
added? The answers will determine the number and type of luminaires to be used.  
● Required functionality. Is some high-energy pizzazz needed or just static lighting for a speech? Will the  
person or thing being lit be in motion? The more pizzazz, the more costly because moving luminaires  
will probably be used.  
● Power. What will the total power consumption be? See Section 9.1 of Chapter 9 for more detail on power  
calculations.  
● Cost. What is the budget for lighting?  
# 5.4.3.4 Lighting console position  
Most events require a location for the lighting operator and the lighting console\(s\). The last concern on  
the site visit is to determine where control will be and if technicians will be required to operate the lights  
during the event. Usually, the best location for controlling lighting is in the middle of the venue at the back  
of the event space, ideally directly opposite any performance stage \(i.e. at the FOH position near the audio  
console\); however, practicality does not always allow this. The designer must know the exact location in Lighting systems **221**  
relation to power supplied in order to determine the length and routing of cable runs. In addition, the  
designer must know if the lit objects or people will be easily viewable, if there will be a raised platform for  
the control area, and if a remote house light control will be available at the console position.  
# 5.5 Between concept and execution  
What we have been doing up to this point in our discussion of lighting design is to follow a typical  
LD through the necessary steps and thought processes required to arrive at a tentative design for the  
special event. This design might include lighting for entertainment, for décor, or for architecture, and it  
might be either indoors or outdoors. Having now asked all the right questions and determined the type of  
lighting that is needed, the LD will return to his shop and take several more steps in preparation for setting  
up the event.  
First, if the event is relatively complex, meaning that there will be a large number of different luminaires  
used, possibly mounted on a large truss structure, or in several different locations, the LD will choose the  
required luminaires and determine where they will be mounted based on an analysis of the answers to the  
questions asked previously. These choices will then be laid out on a lighting plot or lighting plan. This is  
simply a hand or CADD drawing of all the specific fixtures in their exact locations, drawn to scale and in  
relation to what they are lighting \(e.g. stage or décor element\). The drawing also indicates for each fixture  
its dimmer and channel assignments, the fixture number and type, and any and all accessories such as  
color filters required. For some events, an LD will draw a three-dimensional rendering of the lighting plan  
in CADD, which gives a very accurate visualization of the exact lighting effects, since the latest CADD  
software takes into account the types of lights and the amount of light, the various surfaces in the space  
including their reflectivity, and integrates it all into an accurate picture. Two of the more common programs  
now used for such three-dimensional representations are Vivien from Cast Group and Vectorworks from  
Nemetschek. CADD is also discussed in detail in Chapter 9 of Special Event Production\: The Process.  
See Figure 5.13 for a sample two-dimensional event stage lighting plot drawn in CADD. This is the lighting  
plot used for the event depicted in Figure 5.12 \(top\).  
Second, and now with the lighting plot in hand, the LD will prepare a crew and installation schedule, along  
with power requirements, which will be passed to the producer, and then to the venue. In considering the  
crew required, often for complex events, the LD will not be the person present but instead the lighting  
crew will consist of one main operator \(crew chief\), possibly one programmer for automated fixtures, and  
one or more followspot operators. In addition, the LD—or the setup crew chief—will prepare all the  
necessary control and dimming equipment, the mounting and support hardware for the complete lighting  
installation, and load calculations for the rigging company if lighting is to be mounted on trussing.  
# 5.6 lighting control  
The control system allows each luminaire to be controlled \(e.g. dimmed, faded in and out, shut on or off,  
color changed, movement changed, gobo patterns changed, etc.\) from a central location. It incorporates a  
dimming system, a control protocol, and a lighting control console.  
# 5.6.1 Dimming system  
In most event lighting situations, luminaires are not used constantly at full power but must occasionally  
be dimmed, faded, or turned off. This is accomplished by using dimmers.  
In a traditional lighting setup in which only older conventional luminaires are used, each dimmer regulates  
one lighting circuit, or channel, allowing the attached luminaire’s intensity to vary by altering the electrical **222** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 5.13** Example of a 2D event lighting plot  
Courtesy of Innovation Lighting, www.innovationlighting.net  
current sent to the luminaire. Each dimmer is designed to work to a maximum electrical load. For example,  
a 2,000 W dimmer might be loaded with two 1,000 W ERS spotlights or up to four 500 W luminaires  
\(such as four PAR64s\). This is an important point to remember. If one dimmer channel is assigned to one  
luminaire, only that luminaire will dim when the channel is used; however, if the dimmer channel is  
assigned to four luminaires, all four luminaires will dim at once when the channel is used. The LD will  
determine the best combinations of luminaires and dimmer channels in his concept and lighting plot.  
A typical dimmer pack comprises several dimmer modules, all housed together. They may even be  
conveniently mounted on rolling racks, enabling the control of many lighting circuits. The dimmer packs  
are usually physically located in the event space close to the stage, or as close as possible to electrical power  
and ideally the luminaires as well. See Figure 5.14 and also Section 9.1.2.2 of Chapter 9.  
Remember, what has just been described applies only to conventional luminaires that are not designed  
internally to be controlled by digital multiplex \(DMX\). With the advent of DMX, each luminaire can be  
individually controlled without the need for a dimmer pack. Let’s look at exactly what DMX can do.  
# 5.6.2 control protocol  
Control protocol refers to the language used to communicate between the luminaires, dimmers, and  
control console. In 1986, a new digital standard was created for the lighting industry called DMX \(digital  
multiplex\), with today’s version being DMX512. The notation refers to a digital signal, which is a set of Lighting systems **223**  
512 separate channels or intensity levels that are constantly being updated at the rate of 44 times per second.  
Each channel/level has 256 steps divided over a range of 0 to 100 percent, and each set of 512 channels is  
defined as a universe. A DMX universe can be made up of many different devices that all use a set amount  
of channels. However, DMX512 has some limitations and must fall within the following limits\:  
● No more than 512 channels per universe.  
● No more than 32 devices \[e.g. luminaires\] per universe connected in a daisy chain \[however, this can  
be overcome—see below\].  
● The network cannot have cabling runs of more than 3,900 ft \(1000 m\) \[this can also be overcome—see  
below\]  
\(Seasonal Entertainment, 2012\)  
How does this all work? Think of an individual channel as being like a simple fader on an audio console with  
256 steps. Such a channel can be used to control any number of variables because it has a unique, identifiable  
address. The DMX signal is sent from the control console along a single cable—specifically a 5-pin XLR  
type—to the luminaires which are connected in a daisy chain fashion, with DMX going into the first luminaire  
then out to the second, and so on to the end where there is a special terminator to stop the signal.  
For a simple luminaire like a PAR can with minimal functionality, a single channel may just be used to dim  
the luminaire, which would equate to one device using one channel. For a more complex luminaire like an  
LED moving fixture, a single channel might control panning, another might control red color, another  
green, another blue, another the gobos, and still another a strobe function. In other words, the more  
complicated and functional the luminaire, the more channels will probably be required for maximum  
control of all functions. Thus it would be very easy to eat up the available channels in a single universe  
with far fewer than 32 devices/luminaires. Fortunately, there are ways around this.  
The first way is to give two or more luminaires the same base address. The base address corresponds to one  
DMX channel and, for example, could be “001.” If we assume that there are four luminaires that also each  
need three channels for controlling red, green, and blue colors, then the next three addresses would be  
“002 \(for red\), 003 \(for green\), and 004 \(for blue\)” for luminaire \#1. For luminaire \#2, if it was to be  
controlled independently, it would require “005” as its base address and “006, 007, and 008” as the  
addresses to control its red, green, and blue colors. However, by changing its base address to “001,” the  
same as luminaire \#1, when the faders on the console corresponding to red \(e.g. fader numbers 2 and 6\)  
are moved, both luminaires will fade in exactly the same manner. Even if more luminaires are added but  
all have the same base address \(i.e. “001”\), then they will all respond in the same manner to a control. In  
other words, by combining luminaires it is possible to control many more than 32 luminaires with one  
DMX universe.  
The second way to add luminaires in a single universe is to use a DMX splitter/repeater or opto-isolator which  
can extend both cable distance beyond 3,900 ft \(as the signal is regenerated and re-transmitted\) and the  
number of devices on a single DMX universe. Each branch of a splitter/repeater can support up to 32  
devices, so theoretically there is no limit to the number of devices controllable within a single universe.  
The splitter acts in a similar fashion as a router does for splitting an Internet signal \(either by WiFi or hard  
wiring\) and sending it to different computers/devices. It may be placed anywhere but is often found either  
near the lighting console or with the dimmer packs.  
The last way to add luminaires is to increase the number of universes, and this can only be done by using  
a console that has more than a single “DMX Out,” meaning that it can provide more than one DMX512  
universe. For each additional “DMX Out,” there are another 512 available channels.  
The last point to understand about DMX512 protocol is that it can still control older conventional  
luminaires that are not equipped with DMX controllability, as described in Section 5.6.1. For example, **224** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
dimming these luminaires can be done by running the DMX signal through a set of DMX-capable dimmers,  
again in a daisy chain setup, which will basically read the DMX signal then transmit it as a variable voltage  
to the conventional luminaires via a regular power cable. If there is more than one luminaire being dimmed,  
then a special cable known as Socapex bundles all the individual cables and carries them together to a  
position close to the actual luminaires, where an adaptor—also called a splay—once again splits them to  
go to the individual luminaires via separate wiring \(see also Section 9.1.2.2 and Figure 9.2 of Chapter 9  
for more details\). They are then treated as a single device and dimmed together. Note that DMX-controllable  
luminaires must also be powered and they receive their power in exactly the same manner as the non-  
DMX-controllable luminaires \(i.e. via regular power cables and/or Socapex\).  
Figure 5.14 illustrates DMX lighting control for both DMX and non-DMX-controllable luminaires. Note  
how the non-DMX-controllable luminaires on the left side are controlled from the console via dimmer  
packs—as explained above—while the newer luminaires on the right side that are DMX-controllable are  
controlled directly from the console via the DMX cable and daisy-chaining of the luminaires. All that comes  
from the dimmer packs for these luminaires \(DMX-controllable\) is power.

The future for DMX control is exciting. While it will probably remain at the heart of lighting control for  
some time, there are improvements coming rapidly. Remote Device Management \(RDM\) is one such  
improvement. DMX uses only one-way communication \(i.e. from the control console to the luminaires\)  
to control lighting. RDM protocol will allow configuration, status monitoring, and management of devices  
in such a way that it does not disturb the normal operation of standard DMX512 devices that do not  
recognize the RDM protocol. In other words, RDM uses two-way communication and will still play nicely  
with DMX. This means that such tasks as setting the addresses for luminaires and configuring their  
functions can all be done remotely.  
A second development already available is Art-Net or ArtNET. This is a control protocol that basically takes  
DMX signals and transports them using the Internet. Thus, signals can be sent in either of two ways, via  
an Ethernet cable \(discussed in Chapters 3 and 4\) or wirelessly via WiFi. When the signals must be read  
by a DMX device \(e.g. a luminaire\), they are converted back to that form using a special adaptor. The main  
advantage of Art-Net is considerably reduced cabling requirements and, as might be expected, there are  
already apps available that use it with tablets and smartphones for remote control.  
# 5.6.3 control console  
This is the front end of the lighting control system. It is the equivalent in lighting to what the mixer is in  
audio. Simple stage lighting \(i.e. conventional luminaires\) can be controlled using a manual control  
console. This has a single level control or fader for each dimmer channel. It might also provide for two  
faders per channel, allowing the operator to set up two separate scenes \(combinations of lights\) and cross-  
fade \(fade one scene in at the same time the other is fading out\) between them.  
More complex event lighting requirements will be handled by a digital memory control console. This is really  
just a computer with a complex interface built in. Most of these consoles are capable of storing dozens—or  
hundreds—of different scenes just as with an audio console, allowing for countless different “looks” to be  
created and programmed ahead of the event. For example, a low light level, cool-colored background for a  
musical ballad might be followed immediately by a high-energy rock dance routine requiring moving  
luminaires and warm colors, a change that is easily accomplished with pre-set scenes and fade times.  
Modern consoles also allow for soft-patching, or the assignment of more than one individual dimmer channel  
to a console channel. This allows more luminaires to be controlled as a logical unit than a single dimmer  
channel allows. Many of the higher-end consoles have more than one DMX universe, which simply means  
that they can handle 512 more separate channels for each DMX universe.  
Most state-of-the-art lighting control consoles have fully automated fixture control built into them,  
including some form of joystick or moving control wheel. With the multiple DMX universes available, the  
many channels needed no longer pose a major problem. Newer consoles can also handle LED fixtures and  
video inputs \(via a separate video processing unit\), and operate off 120 V/60 Hz or 240 V/50 Hz, making  
them universally adaptable.  
Finally, thanks to advancing technology, wireless lighting control is now possible in much the same way  
as wireless audio. Strategically placed transmitters and receivers send and receive the digital signal,  
eliminating long cable runs between the console and the luminaires, using the control protocol known as  
Art-Net discussed above.  
# 5.7 lighting setup and operation  
Lighting often requires considerable time for setup due to several factors that render it different from other  
technical equipment. It is a labor- and time-intensive series of tasks that need to be done correctly or not **226** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
only will the show be potentially poorly lit, but there may be a very real danger of physical injury to  
event attendees.  
# 5.7.1 lighting setup  
In all but the simplest of events, invariably the lighting must be mounted on support trussing which  
must be rigged or suspended from a ceiling, if the event is indoors. Rigging \(discussed in more detail in  
Chapter 9\) has to be accomplished as the first of a long list of tasks in the setup process. Lighting is  
different because it must not only be rigged and suspended from trussing, but conventional fixtures must  
also be focused. This means that an extra trip up a special automated scissor lift or a ladder must be made  
once the trussing is in place, and because the lights are usually suspended over a floor area where other  
event elements might be placed such as dining tables or theater seating, this has to be accomplished while  
the venue is still empty.  
Fortunately, most luminaires used in special events are DMX-controllable, thus eliminating some of the  
extra work of manual focus. However, if automated fixtures are part of the lighting plan, then a dedicated  
time for programming may also be required, ideally when nothing else is happening within the venue and  
it can be darkened. Working backwards, all these factors dictate that lighting be given special treatment in  
terms of allowed time for setup, especially since it is usually the first equipment to be installed.  
Unfortunately, sometimes this may only be accomplished at times when nobody else is working, such as  
between midnight and 6\:00 am. For these reasons, and to determine crew numbers, the LD needs to know\:  
● how early they can get in for setup, possibly up to 48 h before the event;  
● how long it will take to move equipment into the venue and room, including accessibility for trucks at  
the loading dock and availability of truck parking;  
● who will be competing for floor space;  
● whether “dark time” for programming of automated fixtures and focus time for conventional luminaires  
will be needed;  
● how long the show is;  
● what time equipment strike \(teardown\) will begin and what time it must be complete;  
● if the venue is union run and if specialized workers such as riggers will be required;  
● what is required in terms of equipment to comply with venue safety regulations \(e.g. hard hats, steel-  
toed boots, and safety vests for workers\);  
● if any special permits or badging will be required.  
# P r od u c t i o n Wa r S t o ry  
# Learning on the fly  
A few years ago I was working on a show for a very good client. my lighting designer had planned  
well for this show and the setup had gone amazingly well. We were completely ready well before  
doors and settling in for a fun evening.  
Thirty minutes before the guests were to enter, my lighting operator came to me, his face com-  
pletely white.  
“I just got a phone call, my parents were in a bad car accident, I don’t know what to do.” Lighting systems **227**  
At this point all my crew had left, it was just he and I in the room, and I did the only possible thing  
at that moment, I told him to leave right away and take care of his parents. I would run the show.  
The console we were using was a WholeHog 3; I was loosely familiar with its predecessor but  
had never used one of these before. i spent the next 30 minutes making sure I knew what was  
programmed and that I could access the most basic functions like room color and stage levels.  
The doors opened and guests entered amidst “oohs” and “aahs” to a beautiful room. The night  
progressed and I was able to bring up stage lights for presenters, and lights for the band. I even  
got the back lights to color chase. Yes, I had everything figured out.  
Dinner was over and the band was well into their set when I noticed that a couple of the band  
lights and some of the moving lights had gone out. too many to be bulbs, in fact too many to  
be a simple breaker. Fortunately the dimmer rack was right beside me so I dove right in with my  
iPhone flashlight to figure out the problem. two minutes of trouble-shooting confirmed my fears\:  
we had blown a main fuse in the building power service. options\: call building maintenance to  
replace it—no, they’d take 30 minutes to get here and we’d have to shut everything down for  
them to fix the problem. solution\: repatch the dimmer and distro to hot up the barest minimum  
for the show to continue unhindered, while trying to reduce the load on the remaining two legs  
to prevent any more issues.  
Great, we were up and running again—a little hamstrung, but the bulk of the evening was behind  
us.  
The event was to end at midnight. sure enough, at 11\:00 pm I’m running a chase on the console  
when I lose the monitor. Great, just what I need, the console has crashed—or so I thought. I cycled  
the power off and back on. nothing. then my heart stopped as I realized the console was plugged  
into my distro panel. I looked up to find the majority of my stage lights had also shut off. this time  
it only took me a few seconds to figure out that I had lost another leg of power—on a 3-phase  
service—meaning that I only had one-third of my rig capacity left. this time it took some really fast  
and fancy repatching, plus using a few wall plugs and voila, the show was still running! i looked  
over at the two audio guys whose jaws had hit the floor by this point, simply shaking their heads  
asking how I had managed to keep the show running? I simply smiled back, held my breath and  
prayed for the show to end before my luck ran out.  
Finally the stroke of midnight and the room lights came up. i spent a few minutes tidying up the  
console, and greeting the strike crew while telling them about my evening. Just as I was about to  
leave, the client walked up to me and thanked me up and down for a fantastic evening, everyone  
had a great time and the room looked amazing!  
As if only noticing for the first time, she asked, “By the way, where’s your regular operator? I hadn’t  
expected to see you here.”  
“Oh, he had to leave so I decided to give this one a shot on my own.” She had no clue that there  
was the slightest problem at any point through the night.

Once the answers are known, the setup can proceed. It involves the following tasks\:  
● Preparation of all equipment in the shop. Often this includes a pre-hang of luminaires on sections of  
truss in order to save time onsite.  
● Delivery and load-in of equipment.  
● Installation of chain-falls and motors \(or pulleys\) from the venue ceiling rigging points \(see Section 9.3.2.2  
of Chapter 9\). These are used to support the lighting trussing.  
● Construction of all trussing by piecing together the pre-hung sections, then attaching the completed  
trussing to the chain-falls.  
● If the lighting is conventional and non-DMX-controllable, then also the following\:  
● Tying dimmers and console into house power, or portable power if outdoors.  
● Attaching all luminaires to Socapex cables via six-outlet adaptors and running Socapex cabling  
through the trussing to the dimmers.  
● Raising the trussing into place using the chain-falls and motors, being cautious to ensure that safety is  
paramount and that the trussing is level at all times.  
● Running the main DMX cable from the dimmer packs located usually near the stage—or from DMX-  
controllable luminaires directly—to the lighting control console.  
● Assigning all lighting channels and programmed sequences to individual console channels.  
● Testing all channels and luminaires.  
● Focusing and gelling all luminaires \(if conventional and non-DMX-controllable\).  
If time permits, it is always a good idea to have the main lighting operator \(usually the crew chief\),  
automated fixture programmer if there is one, and any other techs such as followspot operators conduct  
a run-through of the event from cue-to-cue so that all the lighting looks or scenes for various show and event  
segments are known to the operators, to the TD, and also are approved by the event producer.  
# 5.7.2 lighting operation during the event  
Lighting operation during the actual event may be simple or complicated, depending on whether or not  
pre-set scenes are used and whether or not the event calls for numerous manual changes to the lighting.  
Up to this point, we have not mentioned much about lighting that is not used for the stage. However, many  
special events nowadays use lighting as a major component of décor. This means that a similar procedure  
must be followed for positioning and setting up décor lighting as for stage lighting. The big difference is  
that much of the décor lighting tends to be very subtle and hidden, often mounted on the ground and  
behind or inside props or fabrics. Just as with stage lighting, décor lighting can be pre-programmed for  
specific room “looks” such as gradual ambient lighting changes using wall up lighting to create a variety  
of moods. This can usually be accomplished by the main lighting operator in conjunction with the stage  
lighting, and is often controlled by the same lighting console.  
Thus, for the event itself and stage performances, the lighting operator will be doing the following during  
the event\:  
● Monitoring ambient light levels for mood, including house lights.  
● Monitoring stage lighting for unexpected stage requirements.  
● Monitoring light spill onto other event elements such as multimedia screens.  
● Either manually changing lighting scenes for stage needs or changing pre-set scenes based on rehearsed,  
verbal, or written lighting cues. Manual changes may require\: turning lights on and off in time to music Lighting systems **229**  
if this function is not automated; fading to black at the end of stage performances or musical numbers,  
or on script cues; and changing colors, gobos, movement, brightness, and such for different needs.  
● Giving cues to other lighting technicians such as automated lighting programmers and followspot  
operators.  
● Maintaining communication with the TD or event producer to change lighting when needed and to be  
aware of changes to the event running order.  
# 5.8 risk and safety  
Since it is the lighting company that usually provides the trussing for the luminaires and often for the audio  
gear \(e.g. full-range speakers\), it must also be the LD and lighting company that provide accurate load  
calculations for rigging, complete with exact luminaire locations on the trussing and the accompanying  
weights, along with the load data provided for any audio gear. Producers should demand that these  
calculations be made available when needed and certainly for record purposes should an insurance claim  
ever arise following the event. Concerning trussing, the lighting company should be fully conversant with  
all standards that apply to trussing and rigging as laid out in Chapter 9. Also with respect to rigging,  
knowing the correct trim height for any lighting trussing is essential to avoid last-minute panics to re-focus  
luminaires and raise or lower truss \(see Chapter 9 for more on trim height\).  
Lighting does have unique equipment and once again, the use of only UL \(Underwriters Laboratories Inc.\)  
and CSA \(Canadian Standards Association\) certified equipment applies as much to lighting as to audio.  
In addition, IEC 60598-1 Ed. 6.1\: Luminaires – Part 1\: General requirements and tests, an international standard,  
covers classification, marking, mechanical construction, and electrical construction of luminaires in  
Canada, the United States, and other countries. Otherwise, lighting—and especially lighting control  
protocol—has several other currently known equipment standards and guidelines as listed below. Producers

Regarding personnel safety, the same OSHA and WCB worker health and safety standards and regulations  
apply for lighting personnel as they do for all others. Chapter 7 of Special Event Production\: The Process refers  
to the controlling organizations for these standards in many countries. As well, compliance with the  
national electrical codes for the United States, Canada, and all other countries in which an event may be  
taking place is absolutely essential for lighting. Chapter 9 explains these in more detail.  
With respect to performer and audience safety, Cooper \(2014, pp. 190–191\) deals with the need to test  
any flown luminaires in a performance situation before an event takes place to ensure their safe installation.  
As with audio, redundancy and qualified personnel are considerations for lighting. Although changing or  
re-focusing lights mid-show is impractical in most event situations—unless full remote control is possible—  
bringing extra equipment such as spare dimmers, backup CD/DVD/flash drive with programs for a digital  
console, or even an entire lighting console for the more important lighting events should be considered as  
a hedge against complete lighting failure. As for trained personnel, producers should keep in mind that  
much of the new digital equipment \(e.g. digital fixtures and lighting consoles\) requires that technicians  
take specialized courses to operate it and also that programming it can literally take hours onsite prior to  
an event, depending on how many lighting cues there are. Allowances for programming and checks on  
technician qualifications should be made.  
Event lighting is constantly evolving, at least equally as fast as any of the other technologies. The goal of  
this chapter has been to provide a snapshot of the technology at this point in time and to give the basics  
of how it all works. Further reading is encouraged to keep up to date in this exciting field. Lighting systems **231**

# Special effects  
# l e a r n i n g o u t c o m es  
After reading this chapter, you will be able to\:  
**1.** Understand what elements go into making a successful special effects display.  
**2.** Explain in detail how the different types of special effects work, specifically\: streamers and  
confetti; smoke, fog, and haze; lasers; display fireworks and proximate pyrotechnics; and atmos-  
pherics.  
**3.** Understand and explain the safety concerns for all the special effects and what the related  
regulations and safety standards cover.  
Today’s event audiences demand creativity and cutting-edge ideas beyond the norm. Special effects  
\(also called SFX, SPFX, or FX for short\) are some of the most effective ways to leave a favorable impression  
with them and to make them feel they have been treated to something truly spectacular. At the same time,  
the events industry is under continuing pressure to maintain a high degree of safety and to minimize risk  
in the presentation of such effects. In this chapter we examine first what special effects are and how they  
can be designed for optimum presentation, followed by a thorough explanation of the most common types  
of effects used in events. Since risk management is one of the most important considerations in the  
decision to use special effects, we will also discuss the safety aspects of operation as they pertain to each  
type of effect.  
# 6.1 What are special effects?  
The term “special effects” has taken on several connotations in today’s world. For most people, what  
immediately comes to mind and what seems to have become the default definition is movie special effects\:  
computer-generated space travel; giant beasts; impossible movement; simulated disasters; and cartoon sPecial eFFects **233**  
animation. Most of these, while possible in limited situations, are not what we use in special events. What  
then, do we use, and what is different about what we use compared to movie special effects?  
Put simply, special effects used in special events are unusual and creative technological surprises timed to  
emphasize an event element. The main difference between our \(special events industry\) special effects and  
those of the movies is the fact that we use them for emphasis at strategic moments during the event. For  
the most part, they are not intended as the only entertainment, with notable exceptions such as a  
community fireworks show.  
Admittedly, we borrow heavily from the movie industry in effects \(e.g. artificial snow, wind, rain, and on  
rare occasions prosthetics, blood, and stunts\) but we also borrow from some of the more ancient theatrical  
effects \(e.g. fireworks, magic, and illusions\), from computers \(e.g. gesture control, gaming\), from science  
\(e.g. lasers, UV and black lighting, robotics, LEDs\), and from older technology \(e.g. balloon effects,  
streamers, confetti, bubbles\). The influences are definitely varied and numerous. We often adapt these  
effects for our own use. Sometimes, they actually further evolve into other more fascinating inventions  
and effects \(e.g. LED dance floors, lighting controlled by motion\).  
What about the actual presentation? According to Jaworski \(2003\), for a successful special effect  
presentation, one must consider four essential elements\: surprise, whether the effects are remarkable,  
timing, and taste. The element of surprise is crucial and effects must not be “telegraphed.” The surprise  
extends also to the type of feeling that needs to be elicited from the audience. For example, they can be  
alarmed and startled by fireworks, happy and uplifted by confetti and streamers, or energetic and excited  
by a combination of upbeat music and pyrotechnics.  
Remarkable means that the effects stretch the imagination from the usual. They go beyond what an  
audience has seen to something they have not. Often this is through a combination of effects or a  
combination of entertainment and effects. For example, a regular show might simply use a stage presentation  
of entertainment and pyrotechnics. A better show might bring together interactive mobile content,  
pyrotechnics, lasers, and the stage presentation. However, by adding choreography to time the effects to  
music and then bringing all the elements in one at a time so that the show builds to a climax, the  
presentation rises to another level.  
Timing the placement of effects tends to be intuitive. It is money wasted to place them at an inappropriate  
time during the event. It is also a waste of money to use them just for the sake of doing something different.  
They must be timed to coincide with a key moment in the event\: the announcement of a location for the  
next year’s event; the end of a song; the end or beginning of the event or show; the presentation of an  
award; and so on. It is usually the producer, in conjunction with the special effects expert, who decides the  
timing of the presentation.  
Taste is mostly a matter of matching the client’s vision with the producer’s. It means that there must be  
a mutual understanding of what will work for both the audience and the producer and what show will  
incorporate the best effects based on knowledge of what is available to match those tastes.  
# 6.2 types of special effects  
The list of special effects grows every year, with more colorful, bigger, noisier, higher, wider, denser, longer,  
and safer being some of the adjectives describing the never-ending innovations that cause hearts to skip  
beats. Although identifying the latest and greatest is a rapidly moving target, we will attempt to review  
and explain what the main ones are and how they are used. Some may seem obvious by their omission;  
however, that is either because they are very simple to use \(e.g. bubble machines\), or because we have  
reviewed them as part of other resources \(e.g. automated lighting, mirror balls, stage curtain reveals like  
Kabuki drops, video effects\). **234** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 6.2.1 Streamers and confetti  
The term confetti refers to small pieces of paper in large quantities that are thrown by hand, launched by  
a special device, or dropped from a height. The term streamers refers to long pieces of paper spread in the  
same manner. The confetti and streamers used for events come in a multitude of colors, sizes, shapes, and  
paper types. The traditional and most common paper type is tissue paper that, being lightweight, is able  
to travel farther and dwell for longer in the air.  
In terms of shapes and sizes, confetti is now available from ¼ in. \(0.6 cm\) diameter round shapes, to  
3/4 in. x 2 in. \(1.9 cm x 5 cm\) rectangular strips, plus triangles and virtually any custom shapes. It also  
comes in shiny Mylar in different colors, but is difficult to clean up and does not travel as far as regular  
tissue paper confetti. Standard confetti is not colorfast so should not be used over diners or outside when  
it is raining or there is wet ground; however, it is obtainable from some dealers in biodegradable form that  
dissolves in the rain, making it perfect for outdoors.  
Streamers are available in lengths ranging up to 100 ft \(30 m\), and widths ranging from ½ in. \(1.3 cm\) to  
2.5 in. \(6.3 cm\), all in multiple colors. Like confetti, they also come in Mylar. The larger streamers are best  
used either outdoors or indoors when ceilings are very high. They can be used to simulate fireworks  
indoors. Both confetti and streamers can be made flame-resistant. Confetti and streamers may be  
customized with logos and graphic messages, as well as special shapes.  
Confetti and streamer cannons—also called launchers—consist of long plastic or metal tubes or barrels that  
are filled with the densely packaged streamers or confetti and launched using a compressed carbon dioxide,  
air, or nitrogen cartridge or cylinder. These cannons come in various sizes from about a 1 in. \(2.5 cm\) to  
a 4 in. \(10 cm\) diameter barrel that can be up to 40 in. \(100 cm\) long, and even larger. They are capable  
of launching confetti and streamers anywhere from 30 ft \(9 m\) to 300 ft. \(91 m\) in the air. All are reusable  
in that they only require new charges of streamers and confetti and new compressed gas cartridges.  
Cannons come as handheld models as well as remotely triggered models via wireless or DMX protocol.  
They can be mounted on floors, overhead trussing, stages, and almost any surface. Some manufacturers  
have also developed much larger versions for bigger venues that are fed by separate units with larger  
capacity for confetti/streamers, and even a portable backpack version that carries extra charges. These  
larger versions are sometimes called confetti blasters. The blaster provides a continuous feed of confetti that  
is combined with air and compressed carbon dioxide in a venturi tube that shoots the confetti outwards  
for a total time of up to several minutes.  
At present, there are no safety or other standards for confetti, streamers, or cannons and launchers, and  
no permit is required. The main caution is obvious and that is to not point them directly toward people.  
See Figure 6.1 for an example of a stadium event using a large-scale confetti launch. Some of the cannons  
can be seen near the edge of the central crowd at the bottom of the picture.  
# 6.2.2 Fog, smoke, and haze  
To create “other-worldly” and dreamy looks, nothing beats fog, and to make light and laser beams sparkle  
and dance in the air, smoke and/or haze are a must. We will examine the main types of machines used to  
generate these effects.  
# 6.2.2.1 Fog  
The older type of fog machine uses dry ice. These machines produce a low-lying, rolling fog effect by  
dropping solid carbon dioxide \(“dry ice”\) into boiling water. Dry ice is very cold \(–70 degrees Celsius\) and  
will lose about 30 percent of its volume every day as the carbon dioxide sublimes back to a gas. The solid sPecial eFFects **235**  
**Figure 6.1** Example of confetti launch—Bayer Anniversary, 150 Years  
Courtesy of Vok dams Agency for Events- and Live-Marketing, www.vokdams.com  
carbon dioxide is available in pellet or block form from industrial gas suppliers and can be stored in an  
insulated polystyrene container. The visible fog effect is actually water vapor. The carbon dioxide gas is  
invisible. Dry ice fog gives the “walking on clouds” effect.  
More normally\:  
fog is created by pumping one of a variety of different glycol or glycol/water mixtures \(referred to  
as fog fluid\) into a heat exchanger \(essentially a block of metal with a resistance heating element  
in it\) and heating until the fluid vaporizes, creating a thick translucent or opaque cloud. Devices  
specifically manufactured for this purpose are referred to as fog machines.  
\(Theatrical smoke and fog, 2014\)  
These machines do not create the density or low-lying fog as well as carbon dioxide, but the\:  
effects can be simulated by combining a fog machine with another device designed specifically for  
this purpose. As the fog exits the fog machine, it is chilled, either by passing through a device  
containing a fan and dry ice, or by passing through a device containing a fan and compressor  
similar to an air conditioner.  
\(Theatrical smoke and fog, 2014\)  
Another spectacular fog effect is created by pushing liquid carbon dioxide through nozzles at high pressure  
in devices called cryo jets. They are used to generate fog bursts, which shoot dense white fog straight up  
into the air. They can be ganged together and controlled remotely but only work with regular 110 V  
switches. The carbon dioxide is pumped to each jet via a common line, much like a hose. **236** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 6.2.2.2 Smoke  
To generate smoke, a glycol/water mixture is vaporized by heating under compression. Nearly all smoke  
machines work this way. Glycol or mineral oil smoke guns all work on the same principles although their  
size, precise method of operation, and the chemical used do vary. The basic principle is that a mineral oil  
or glycol-based substance is heated, atomizing the substance. This is then forced out of the machine under  
pressure. This produces a familiar “white cloud” effect, which rises and spreads throughout the air. Thicker  
smoke is produced by increasing the length of the smoke burst. As opposed to fog, smoke rises in the air  
and can obscure viewing depending on its density. To confuse matters, commercial smoke machines are  
often called fog machines or foggers.  
# 6.2.2.3 Haze  
Haze effects refer to creating an unobtrusive, homogeneous cloud intended primarily to reveal  
lighting beams, such as the classic ‘light fingers’ in a rock concert. This effect is produced using  
a haze machine, typically done in one of two ways. One technique uses mineral oil, atomized via a  
spray pump powered either by electricity or compressed CO2, breaking the mineral oil into a fine  
mist. Another technique for creating haze uses a glycol/water mixture to create haze in a process  
nearly identical to that for creating fog effects. In either case the fluid used is referred to as haze  
fluid, but the different formulations are not compatible or interchangeable. Glycol/water haze  
fluid is sometimes referred to as water-based haze for the purposes of disambiguation.  
Smaller volumes of haze can also be generated from aerosol canisters containing mineral oil  
under pressure. Although the density of haze generated and the volume of space that can be filled  
is significantly smaller than that of a haze machine, aerosol canisters have the advantages of  
portability, no requirements for electricity, and finer control over the volume of haze generated.  
\(Theatrical smoke and fog, 2014\)  
As may be apparent, the main difference between smoke machines and haze machines is in the volume  
produced, smoke being much more dense. The chemical fluids used to generate the effects are similar but  
as a caution, experts advise never to mix the fluids specified for a given brand of machine with that of  
another brand \(Pea Soup Ltd., 2014\).  
Like confetti and streamer cannons, foggers, smoke machines, and hazers can be set off remotely using  
DMX controllers, similar to those used in lighting. See Figure 6.2 for an example of haze used effectively.  
# 6.2.2.4 Safety of fog and haze  
There are some contradictory problems with dry ice fog. The first is that it is very effective if air circulation  
is not good in that it remains close to the ground and does not dissipate quickly, making the effect more  
impressive. Contradicting this for health reasons is the need to disperse the fog through room ventilation  
so that concentrations do not get high enough to cause breathing problems. Fortunately, this is a small  
problem as most of the dry ice fog is water vapor and carbon dioxide does not reach toxic levels very  
quickly. However, it is a good idea to maintain ventilation and use the fog away from areas with high air  
flow, such as entrance doors, to avoid too rapid dispersion. Dry ice, due to its extremely cold temperature,  
must also be handled and stored safely. This includes the wearing of gloves when handling it and the use  
of heavily insulated containers for storing it. Dry ice machines also require a full-time operator to monitor  
the flow and to constantly feed the dry ice into the machine.  
Fog machines and/or hazers should be tested in the event venue prior to the event. If there are smoke  
detectors then there is a very distinct possibility that one of these machines might set them off. There are  
many venues where they cannot be used because of the fire alarm systems installed. In fact, these devices sPecial eFFects **237**  
**Figure 6.2** Example of haze used to enhance lighting  
Pretty Lights at Red Rocks August 2013; Photo By Soren McCarty, mtnweekly.com  
are now banned in many venues, or the fire department must stand by onsite for a large fee. If possible,  
smoke detectors should be disabled during—and only during—the effect. Again, however, the venue may  
charge for this service. They also may opt to stand by near the alarm system to monitor it rather than  
turning off the detection system, especially if the effect is a hazer that may be required for longer than fog  
in order to accentuate show lighting. If this is not possible, a test run is advisable. If in doubt, fog or haze  
should not be used because evacuation of the venue during the show is not the effect sought.  
In relative terms, the ingredients used in fog and haze fluid are quite safe, but there is an ongoing debate  
in the entertainment industry about whether the output of the machines is safe or not. Indeed, a 2005  
study found that short-term exposure to glycol fog was associated with coughing, dry throat, headaches,  
dizziness, drowsiness, and tiredness. This study also found long-term exposure to smoke and fog was  
associated with both short-term and long-term respiratory problems such as chest tightness and wheezing.  
Personnel working closest to the fog machines had reduced lung function results \(Varughese et al., 2005\).  
It’s a good policy to ensure that where fog or haze are being used in the vicinity of performers, it is kept  
to the minimum required to achieve the desired effect, and to post warnings. Other safety hazards include\:  
the condensation of fog/haze back to fluid near the nozzle of the machine causing a slipping hazard; the  
nozzle of the machine, which is very hot, causing burns; and large amounts of fog/haze causing panic and  
disorientation in an audience.  
In order to minimize the adverse effects of fog and haze, several international standards are available as  
guides, as listed below\: **238** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
● ANSI E1.5 – 2009 \(R2014\)\: Entertainment Technology – Theatrical Fog Made With Aqueous Solutions of Di- And  
Trihydric Alcohols. This standard describes the composition of theatrical fogs or artificial mists that are  
not likely to be harmful to otherwise healthy performers, technicians, or audience members of normal  
working age. This standard is intended to be applied in theaters, arenas, and other places of entertainment  
or public assembly where theatrical fogs and mists are often used. It lists what is permissible in the fog  
or haze and how much can be there on a short- and long-term basis.  
● ANSI E1.14 – 2001 \(R2013\)\: Entertainment Technology – Recommendations for Inclusions in Fog Equipment  
Manuals. The standard applies to the instruction manuals for fog-making equipment manufactured for  
use in the entertainment industry. In order to use fog safely and effectively, the user must have some  
general knowledge of the technology, have a clear understanding of how to operate the fog-making  
system, and be aware of the potential hazards related to the use of fog, and particularly the system that  
he or she is using. This standard is designed to establish guidelines for manufacturers to provide to the  
user the necessary information required for the safe and responsible use of fog equipment.  
● ANSI E1.23 – 2010\: Entertainment Technology – Design and Execution of Theatrical Fog Effects. This standard  
offers guidance on planning and carrying out fog effects so that recognized exposure levels are not  
exceeded, fire and egress hazards are not created, false alarms don’t summon the fire brigade, and fog  
effects are executed as they are designed, performance after performance.  
● ANSI E1.29 – 2009 \(R2014\)\: Product Safety Standard for Theatrical Fog Generators that Create Aerosols of Water,  
Aqueous Solutions of Glycol or Glycerin, or Aerosols of Highly Refined Alkane Mineral Oil. This is intended to  
help guide product safety testing laboratories in evaluating fog-making equipment for design or  
construction defects that might create unacceptable hazards. It is based on ANSI/UL 998 – 2006,  
Humidifiers, but has modifications to deal with safety issues peculiar to fog generators. Fog generators  
often are evaluated as heating appliances to assure they are not a fire or shock hazard. ANSI E1.29  
considers those issues, but also has safety tests for the fog generated.  
● Introduction to Modern Atmospheric Effects, Fourth Edition. While not a standard per se, this is a revised  
version of a popular handbook on theatrical fogs. Illustrated and with more than twice as many pages  
as the first and second editions, the book gives the entertainment industry a factual presentation on all  
types of popular atmospheric fog effects. The section on using fog offers tips on putting fog where it  
will do the most good, lighting it effectively, working with fire alarms, and limiting exposure. The  
relative advantages and disadvantages of using time/distance tables and aerosol meters to ensure  
that exposure limits are not exceeded are discussed. It is available—as are the other standards—from  
the PLASA web site at http\://tsp.plasa.org/tsp/documents/published\_docs.php.  
Producers should ensure that their subcontractors are familiar with these key documents if they intend to  
use theatrical effects at special events.  
# 6.2.3 lasers  
As the International Laser Display Association states,  
There’s no light like it\: the most vivid, saturated color palette available; a contrast ratio  
unsurpassed by the best film and video technologies; the ability to reach out in three dimensions  
and shower an audience with cascades of beams or embrace them in waves of moving light. It’s  
about enchanting an audience with dreamlike visions. It’s about exciting crowds with visual  
effects that move faster than any other light-form.  
\(ILDA, 2014a\)  
Lasers for special events consist of three main components\: a light source \(the laser itself\), a projector,  
and software. We will examine these and then briefly discuss safety. sPecial eFFects **239**  
# 6.2.3.1 The light source \(LASER\)  
The word LASER is an acronym. It stands for Light Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of  
Radiation. By ‘radiation’, however, the acronym refers to a radiant vibration, not an emission  
of radioactive particles. In other words, the emissions of lasers are in the form of light .  
.  
. The  
lasers typically employed in events are called ion gas lasers, due to the fact that they utilize a gas  
or a mixture of gases as the lasing medium .  
.  
. The stimulation comes in the form of electricity,  
which excites the atoms of the gas\: as the electrons in these atoms are given more energy, they  
tend to jump to a higher orbit. These unnaturally high orbits, however, don’t last long, and the  
electrons fall back to their proper orbital shells, to be once again excited by the influx of electri-  
city. It is this process of the electrons returning to their original orbits that creates the laser light  
we see. During this jump back down, the extra energy is released from each atom as a packet  
called a photon \(light\).  
\(Mueller, 2005\)  
There are three general types of light show graphics lasers\: low-power helium-neon \(red\), medium- and  
high-power argon \(green-blue\), and mixed-gas argon/krypton \(red-yellow-green-blue\).  
# 6.2.3.2 The projector  
The laser projector is the heart of the graphics system\:  
Using tiny moving mirrors, a single beam of laser light can be moved so fast the human eye no  
longer sees the individual beam. Instead, the audience sees fans, cones, tunnels, or cascades of  
beams that fill the air. Specialized optics \(diffraction gratings\) can create sheets of light by split-  
ting one beam into hundreds of individual shafts of light. Bounce mirrors can ricochet beams  
throughout a venue. Realistic wire-frame images can be projected onto walls, buildings, and  
even mountains to advertise products or tell a dramatic story. Wispy, cloud-like graphics called  
lumia can fill ceilings, and psychedelic abstract graphics can be created with eye-popping colors  
and contrast.  
\(ILDA, 2014b\)  
# 6.2.3.3 The software  
Laser show software is available for almost every personal computer, and there are even programs with  
their own custom computers. It is the software that creates the two main types of laser effects\: aerials  
\(sometimes called atmospherics\) and animation projection or graphics\:  
● Aerials. The laser effect that most causes audiences to gasp with wonder and delight is the experience  
of seeing laser beams move through open air. Walsh \(2005\) describes how it is done\: “These effects are  
called ‘atmospheric’ because they rely upon beams sculpting the atmosphere of the venue, with no  
projection screen involved . . . To help make the beams visible indoors, laserists often introduce particles  
into the air, usually using theatrical fog machines \[these would more accurately be hazers since  
particulate smoke would be too hazardous to health\] . . . If a laser beam is coming toward the viewer,  
the apparent brightness of the beam is increased. Beams that are perpendicular to the viewer are  
perceived as much less bright. Those going away from the viewer vary in apparent brightness depending  
upon the ambient light in the background. For creating successful beam shows, it is wise to plan the  
display as coming towards the audience.”  
● Animation projection. Dryer \(2005\) aptly describes animation projection created by laser scanning\:  
“Animated Neon! That’s an approximate description of laser scanning\: the richly colored line-drawing  
quality of a neon sign set in motion with equal contrast and even greater color saturation. It’s a medium **240** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS

that makes any message special. Laser scanners can project names, logos and animated imagery onto  
almost any surface including the side of a mountain, the curved dome of a planetarium, even a sheet of  
pulsating water . . . To do this, a laser produces a tiny linear beam of intense light that appears as a small  
dot when it strikes a surface. To make it move you have to ‘scan’ it by wiggling one or more mirrored  
surfaces. Once the dot of light moves fast enough, a phenomenon called persistence of vision causes your  
eye to perceive the movements of the dot as solid lines of light.” This movement is achieved through a  
combination of the laser projector’s hardware and special software.  
See Figure 6.3 for examples of different laser effects.  
# 6.2.3.4 Laser safety  
According to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency \(ARPANSA\)\:  
The eyes and skin are the organs primarily at risk from exposure to laser light. Health effects  
from exposure to laser light are generally divided into two categories\: radiation and non-  
radiation hazards. Radiation hazards include injury to the eyes and skin from direct exposure  
to the laser beam or any reflections. Momentary viewing of the beam from a Class 2 laser  
may cause temporary flash-blindness, similar in effect to viewing a photographic flash at close sPecial eFFects **241**  
range. However, unlike the photographic flash, a Class 2 laser can cause flash-blindness up  
to 50 m \[165 ft\] or more. Many non-radiation hazards arise from the use of lasers including  
electrical hazards, chemical hazards, burns from heated surfaces, production of fumes, vapors  
and airborne contaminants from materials within the beam.  
\(© Commonwealth of Australia 2013, as represented by the  
Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency \[ARPANSA\]\)  
Also, according to Laser Spectacles, Inc. \(2013\)\:  
In many parts of the world, lasers used in laser shows are scanned directly into the audience and  
over their eyes \(called audience scanning\). If the laser beam is being scanned quickly enough, and  
the power density of the laser beam, or irradiance, is not too high, there will be no damage to the  
eyes, because the beam never settles in one spot for long enough to burn. However, if a failure  
in the scanning apparatus occurs, the beam will stop moving, and there is a great potential for  
damage to be done if anyone is in the way of the beam. Experienced laser safety officers must take  
measurements and perform calculations before shows of this type can go on.  
.  
. . The primary  
means of laser light show safety in the USA is provided simply by keeping the beam away from  
the audience. There are two rules for doing this\: the ‘3 m \(10 ft\) vertical clearance’ rule, and  
the ‘2.5 m \(8.3 ft\) horizontal clearance’ rule. If there is an audience standing or seated in a  
given area, the laser beams used in a show must not drop lower than 3 m measured vertically  
above the surface that the audience is upon. Measured horizontally, the beams must not come  
any closer than 2.5 m to any place that the audience can reach. Audience barriers are required to  
ensure that the audience stays within this ‘safe zone,’ and danger/warning signs are required to  
be posted to inform people of the fact that laser radiation is present .  
.  
. To meet these distance  
requirements, laser light show companies must use simple devices called beam stops. Typically, a  
beam stop is a sheet of metal—or some other material that the laser can’t burn through—that  
can be adjusted for different venues so that no matter how the beam is scanned, or if there is a  
scanning failure, it will not come any closer to the audience than the distances prescribed above.  
The best way that producers can ensure laser safety is to require laser companies to adhere to current  
international and North American standards on the use of lasers. The following list includes the most  
important of these standards as well as other safety guides\:  
● IEC 60825-1\:2014\: Safety of laser products – Part 1\: Equipment classification and requirements. This is an  
international standard that introduces a classification system for lasers and laser products according to  
their degree of optical radiation hazard. Among other things, it also ensures, through labels and  
instructions, adequate warning to individuals of hazards associated with accessible radiation from laser  
products.  
● IEC 60825-1\:2008\: Safety of laser products – Part 3\: Guidance for laser displays and shows. This is an  
international guide that is a code of practice for the design, installation, operation, and evaluation of  
the safety of laser light shows and displays, and the equipment employed in their production. This guide  
is also intended for persons who modify laser display installations or equipment. The guide contains  
safety criteria for the protection of the public or persons in the vicinity of laser displays in the course of  
their employment. In some countries, there may be specific requirements, such as government  
permissions or notifications of shows, or prohibitions, such as against laser scanning of spectators  
without appropriate safeguards. This guide is not to be understood as in conflict with such requirements  
but merely to be supplementary.  
● ANSI Z136.1\(2014\)\: Safe Use of Lasers. This US standard provides guidance for individuals who work  
with high-power Class 3B and Class 4 lasers and laser systems and also provides a practical means for  
establishing a laser safety program to protect the employer, facility, and personnel. **242** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
● Code of Federal Regulations CFR 1040.10 \(2000\)\: Laser Product Regulation 21. This is a US regulation that  
classifies lasers and also sets standards for testing, signage, and safety.  
● Center for Devices and Radiological Health \(CDRH\)\: FDA Laser Notice 50. Part of the US Food and Drug  
Administration, the CDRH has issued Notice 50 to allow laser manufacturers to comply with certain  
parts of IEC 60825 and thereby try to eliminate the need for them to follow two separate sets of  
standards.  
As well as these, the International Laser Display Association, ILDA \(2014c\), provides a very succinct and  
common sense list of basic principles with respect to staging laser shows plus further references to papers,  
articles, and safety standards. Chapter 21 of Cooper \(2014\) also contains some excellent tips on setting  
up and running laser shows for special events, as well as specific references to safety standards in the  
United States. Both are good starting points for learning about safe shows.  
# 6.2.4 Fireworks and pyrotechnics  
Fireworks were the earliest use of explosives known to man, invented in China in the 7th century. Such  
important events and festivities as New Year’s and the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival were and still are times  
when fireworks are guaranteed sights. Nowadays, they can be seen around the world at festivals and regular  
celebrations, whether public or private. Chemically, they are classed as low explosive pyrotechnic devices  
in contrast to the infinitely more powerful high explosives such as TNT and the dynamites.  
# 6.2.4.1 Definitions  
There has always been some confusion about the difference between fireworks and pyrotechnics. The  
pyrotechnics industry uses the following definitions\:  
● Fireworks. Any composition or device for the purpose of producing a visible or an audible effect by  
combustion, deflagration, or detonation, and that meets the definition of consumer fireworks or display  
fireworks.  
● Pyrotechnics. Controlled exothermic chemical reactions that are timed to create the effects of heat, gas,  
sound, dispersion of aerosols, emission of visible electromagnetic radiation, or a combination of these  
effects to provide the maximum effect from the least volume.  
● Theatrical Pyrotechnics. Pyrotechnic devices for professional use in the entertainment industry. Similar  
to consumer fireworks in chemical composition and construction but not intended for consumer use.  
\(APA, 2014\)  
For definition in the special events industry, there is now fairly common usage that interprets pyrotechnics  
as indoor, close proximity, smaller devices that create effects of relatively short duration \(i.e. theatrical or  
proximate pyrotechnics as above\), and fireworks as outdoor, distant, larger devices that create effects of  
relatively long duration \(i.e. display fireworks\).  
# 6.2.4.2 Classifications  
In terms of classifications, there are very distinct differences. The US and Canadian governments have  
classified fireworks and pyrotechnics according to their potential hazards. The US government now  
classifies them according to their shipping hazards only, compared to the old system that classified based  
on shipping and use. The US system categorizes them as follows\:  
● Display fireworks \(i.e. outdoor\). Class 1.3G, with United Nations shipping category UN0335. This was  
the old Class “B” fireworks. sPecial eFFects **243**  
● Proximate pyrotechnics \(i.e. indoor, theatrical\). Class 1.4G and 1.4S, with United Nations shipping  
categories UN0431 and UN0432 respectively. This was the old Class “C” fireworks. Some may also fall  
under other classes, so all details of each class should be thoroughly understood.  
The Canadian government’s classifications are based on composition and roughly parallel the US categories.  
Class 7.2.2 represents display fireworks and Class 7.2.5 represents theatrical pyrotechnics. However, the  
United Nations shipping regulations for fireworks and pyrotechnics also apply in Canada.  
In the UK \(not Ireland\), classifications are according to use and fall under Category 1 \(for use indoors\),  
Category 2 \(for outdoor use in relatively confined areas\), Category 3 \(for outdoor use in large open spaces\),  
and Category 4 \(not intended for sale to the general public\). Category 1 would generally correspond to  
proximate pyrotechnics and Category 4 to display fireworks. Specific details can be found in the series of  
standards published by the British Standards Institute \(BSI\), BS EN 15947 – 1\:2010, through – 5\:2010,  
Pyrotechnic articles. Fireworks, Categories 1, 2 and 3. These standards specify details about categories, labeling,  
construction, and performance of the actual fireworks, but do not address safety or use.  
For other countries, classifications vary and producers should check with the appropriate authorities in  
those countries if details are needed.

# An interview with Mr. Kelly Guille  
President, Archangel Fireworks Inc.  
Winnipeg, MB, Canada  
www.archangelfireworks.com  
With over 20 years in the fireworks industry, Kelly Guille’s designs have won praise for their innov-  
ative approach to the art of fireworks. He has led Archangel Fireworks Inc. to three international  
wins in as many years taking home top honors at the 2007 and 2008 HSBC Celebration of Light in  
Vancouver, British Columbia, and in 2009 at Les Grands Feux Loto-Québec in Québec City, both  
major international fireworks competitions. Kelly has also traveled with Team Spain to other fire-  
works competitions in Germany, Vietnam, and most recently Macau. Besides fireworks, Archangel  
supplies snow machines, bubble machines, cryo jets, and confetti for special events. We talked  
about the state of the special effects industry today.  
**DM**\: Have you seen any major trends or changes in the use of special effects for special events in  
the last five to ten years, particularly in Canada but also in other countries?  
**KG**\: Probably one of the biggest changes is the widespread use of lasers that came about as a  
result of price reductions over the last ten years. Also, I think pyrotechnics are being used more  
effectively and responsibly.  
**DM**\: What do you see coming in the next five to ten years in special effects for events?  
**KG**\: There will probably be changes to the formulation of pyro, in other words the chemical com-  
position of the effects. This is due to environmental concerns and the need to make the products  
percholate-free \[percholates are the oxidizers that produce colors in fireworks and that some  
studies have been found to be toxic in groundwater—author\].  
**DM**\: With respect to safety, especially the safety of outdoor display fireworks and indoor proximate  
pyrotechnics, what specific safety regulations, standards, and/or guidelines do you as a company  
follow when providing pyro/fireworks in Canada and in other countries? **244** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 6.4** Archangel team preparing for a show  
Courtesy of Archangel Fireworks Inc., www.archangelfireworks.com  
**KG**\: Canada has one of the strictest sets of regulations in the world. There are separate ones for  
display fireworks and for indoor pyrotechnics, both published by the erd. In the usa, it is state  
by state. When we go anywhere outside of Canada we always work to the Canadian regulations  
due to their strictness, because in many countries there are no regulations at all.  
**DM**\: Have you or event producers/managers found that event liability insurance, especially for  
proximate pyrotechnics, is difficult to obtain, and if so, what have you done to make it easier to  
obtain?  
**KG**\: Insurance is as difficult to obtain as it is to afford. If you have enough money, you can get what  
you want. However, if you have a history without claims it is easier. We as a company have a policy  
that covers all our operations, all of which are considered high risk. Some fireworks insurers are  
now starting to team up to spread the risk around and lower the cost of insurance.  
**DM**\: Do you have any final words of wisdom for up-and-coming event producers/managers that  
would help to make your job easier? For example, is there a minimum knowledge base that they  
should possess to make it easier to understand, sell, and execute the various types of effects to  
enhance any special event?  
**KG**\: The toughest thing for fireworks companies is for the client or the person responding to an  
RFP to believe what the fireworks companies say. Sometimes the process \[of creating a show\] is not  
fully understood so there has to be an inherent trust on the part of the client \[e.g. event manager/  
producer\] that we will deliver the show we say we will. sPecial eFFects **245**  
# 6.2.4.3 Display fireworks \(outdoor\)  
Display fireworks make the wonderful outdoor shows we have come to love and of which we never seem  
to tire. They are often the climax of special events, whether they are public festivals for 100,000 persons  
or private corporate events with 100 VIPs. The two most important aspects of their use are how they work  
and safety. There are three kinds of display fireworks\: high-level, low-level, and ground-level.  
6.2.4.3.1 high-level  
The most impressive and best-known type of display fireworks are aerial or high-level fireworks. A single  
typical display or aerial firework is formed into a shell consisting of four components\:  
● Container or package. This is usually cardboard in the shape of a sphere or cylinder.  
● Stars. Stars are the primary component of an aerial shell. They create the breath-taking flashes of color  
and light in fireworks displays. They are usually shaped into small spheres, cubes, or cylinders and are  
composed of coloring and binding agents. The way in which the stars are packed into the shells dictates  
the exploding shape they will adopt. Helmenstine \(2014\) gives a good explanation of how the color is  
achieved.  
● Bursting charge. This is a packed, black powder charge at the center of the shell that is also sprinkled  
between the stars to help ignite them.  
● Fuse. The fuse functions as a time switch to make the shells burst at the right altitude. It is lit at the  
moment of launch and after burning for a certain time, the fire reaches the bursting charge in the center  
of the shell. The length of the fuse differs according to the size of the package.  
The shell is usually launched from a mortar. Mortars are generally made of FRE \(Fiber-Reinforced Epoxy\)  
or HDPE \(High-Density Polyethylene\). Some older mortars are made of sheet steel, but have been banned  
by most countries due to the problem of shrapnel produced during a misfire. The mortar also contains a  
lifting charge of black powder that explodes to launch the shell. When the lifting charge fires to launch the  
shell, it lights the shell’s fuse. The shell’s fuse burns while the shell rises to its correct altitude and  
then ignites the bursting charge so it explodes. Mortars range in size from 2 in. \(5 cm\) to 12 in. \(30 cm\)  
diameter but do come in diameters up to 16 in. \(40 cm\), the use of which requires special permission. See  
Figure 6.4 depicting a fireworks display being prepared. Note the large shells held by team members and  
the yellow and red mortars into which the shells will be placed.  
There are also complicated shells that burst in two or three phases, called multibreak shells. They may  
contain stars of different colors and compositions to create softer or brighter light, and more or fewer  
sparks. Some shells contain explosives designed to crackle in the sky, or whistles that explode outward  
with the stars. Multibreak shells sometimes incorporate a shell filled with other shells, or they may have  
multiple sections without using additional shells. The sections of a multibreak shell are ignited by different  
fuses. The bursting of one section ignites the next. The shells must be assembled in such a way that each  
section explodes in sequence to produce a distinct separate effect. The explosives that break the sections  
apart are called break charges, and the pattern that an aerial shell paints in the sky depends on the arrangement  
of star pellets inside each shell. Both Brain \(2000\) and Fireworks \(2014\) provide good descriptions and  
illustrations of some of the more common effects and noises.  
Occasionally, shells are launched into the air using rockets. A rocket can be considered as a “shell on a  
stick,” which instead of being fired into the air from a mortar tube, is mounted onto a rocket motor to  
which a stick is attached. Cylindrical in shape, the rocket has a cone-shaped head filled with stars. Upon  
ignition, the gases from the propellant erupt out of the bottom of the cylinder and the rocket rises high  
into the air. **246** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
6.2.4.3.2 low-level  
Besides high-level fireworks, display fireworks are actually divided into two other categories. The first is  
low-level or ground-to-air fireworks that either perform below approximately 200 ft \(60 m\) or begin their  
display at ground level and rise to complete their effect. Some examples of low-level fireworks are\:  
● Candles or Roman candles. A candle is a cardboard tube that contains alternating layers of compacted  
black powder and single stars. When lighted, candles eject a series of colored stars one by one into the  
air and often emit a shower of glowing sparks between each shot.  
● Cakes. A cake is a device consisting of a number of individual tubes of effects \(e.g. comets, mines, etc.\)  
set up together but not stacked as in a candle.  
● Comets. This is an effect. A special composition pellet is propelled from a mortar or shell and produces  
a long tailed effect. Large comets are constructed much like aerial display shells, with attached lift charge  
ready for loading into mortars.  
● Mines. This is a tubular device, comprised of a plastic bag containing a black powder lifting charge and  
a number of colored shells, balanced by a wooden or plastic base. The mine is designed to propel any  
number of items aloft\: stars, whistles, and floating fireworks.  
6.2.4.3.3 ground-level  
The last category is ground-level fireworks that function on the ground. Some examples of ground-level  
fireworks are\:  
● Fountains. Fountains are designed to project brilliant jets of sparks into the air much like a water  
fountain. Shaped like a cone or cylinder, the fountain’s pyrotechnic composition is pressed into the case  
in the same way as for a rocket motor, but on a short rather than a long central cavity. Both gold and  
silver are common in colored fountains.  
● Wheels and drivers. These are revolving pieces turned by drivers. Various effects can be attached to the  
wheel, such as colored lights and fountains. Horizontal wheels often have waterfall units and  
are positioned at the side of the barge or under water to form a “shower.” “Catherine” or “pin”  
wheels are small wheels spinning on a pole.  
● Gerbs. A gerb is a cylindrical preload intended to produce a controlled spray of sparks with a reproducible  
and predictable duration, height, and diameter. The pattern looks like a sheaf of wheat.  
● Lances and lancework set pieces. Lances are small flares used in the makeup of portraits, flags, and  
mottos known as lancework set pieces. The outline is constructed on a wood lattice and a design picked  
out in appropriate colors of lances. According to Raymond Greenwood, past chairman of the Vancouver  
Fireworks Society that originally brought the Symphony of Fire to Vancouver, Canada, lancework is very  
popular for sponsored events because it allows for sponsors’ logos and names to be more visibly  
identified with the show \(R. Greenwood, personal communication, December 10, 2014\).  
● Waterfalls. Waterfalls are a series of gerbs \(without nozzles\) suspended fuse side down from a wire or  
rope strung between two points. The gerbs are all ignited simultaneously and produce a curtain of  
sparks.  
Figure 6.5 illustrates a typical outdoor public fireworks display showing a clear distinction among high-  
level, low-level, and ground-level effects.  
Greenwood from Vancouver also mentions that display fireworks are available for daytime shows that  
incorporate mostly smoke and noise but can also include flags and logos \(R. Greenwood, personal  
communication, December 10, 2014\). Perhaps not as impressive as at night but certainly an option if the  
event schedule will not accommodate a nighttime show. sPecial eFFects **247**

# 6.2.4.4 Proximate or theatrical pyrotechnics \(indoor\)  
The use of explosions, flashes, smoke, or flames onstage is known as proximate pyrotechnics. Generally,  
pyrotechnics can be divided into categories based on the device’s main effects, among them bangs, flashes,  
flames, or smoke. A basic proximate pyrotechnic device generally consists of a container to hold the  
materials \(of an obviously hazardous nature\), a fuel, and an oxidizer, as well as additives to increase the  
strength of the bang or the flash.  
The best-known categories of proximate pyrotechnics are\:  
● Flash powders. Of all the effects used onstage, the flash effect is probably the most common. Most flash  
effects are created by igniting a fine-grained powder contained within a steel mortar. The resulting effect  
is a bright flash whose duration and color can be changed with various additives. The device in which  
the powder is typically used is called a flash pot. It should be noted that flash paper, unlike flash powder,  
is a form of nitrocellulose that burns quickly and completely with a bright flame, no smoke, and no ash.  
It is safe to use in handheld devices.  
● Noise effects. A noise effect is often used in conjunction with either smoke or flash. It is created by  
igniting a suitable compound within a confined area.  
● Airburst effects. These effects are intended to simulate outdoor aerial fireworks shells without hazardous  
debris. Airbursts are designed to be suspended in a lighting truss that is at least 6 \(small airburst\) to 8  
\(large airburst\) meters \(20–27 ft\) above the ground. They produce a ball-shaped flash that is cool before Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**248** reaching the lower levels or stage floor. There is very little smoke. An airburst that produces a flash of  
light and projects stars in all directions is called a starburst.  
● Gerb effects. This effect is the same as the ground-level gerb. Gerb effects are widely variable, with  
plumes of usually silver or gold, durations of 0.5 to 30 s, and heights of up to 30 ft \(9 m\). Accompanying  
whistling and crackling sounds can be created as well. Waterfalls \(upside-down gerbs without nozzles\)  
are used extensively in proximate pyro.  
● Line rockets. Also known as grid rockets, these are small whistling rockets that run along a steel cable.  
The cable must be securely fastened at each end, and is usually up to 50 m \(167 ft\) in length. The line  
rocket is attached to the line by a plastic tube, and takes between 2 and 4 s to travel the 50 m.  
● Flame effects. Flames are always an impressive effect no matter how they are used. Flame cannons shoot  
gigantic fireballs up to 35 ft \(10.6 m\) in the air. Flame bars can be used to emit flames from various shapes,  
whether it’s a flat bar, arch, or a custom shape. Flame projectors create a small tower of fire from a fixed  
point. Flames can also be colored. Flame effect machines are typically comprised of a canister containing  
flammable fuel \(usually a propane/butane mix or a color-specific ethanol/methanol mix\), an igniter, a  
nozzle, a box-like housing, and a control panel. Most are now controllable remotely by DMX.  
● Fire. Live fire in other forms \(e.g. torches, wands, finger-tips with special gloves\) is sometimes used to  
create uniquely choreographed entertainment. Figure 6.6 illustrates a choreographed fire act.

# 6.2.4.5 Fireworks and pyrotechnics safety  
Fireworks and pyrotechnics safety is extremely important. Most countries have stringent regulations that  
govern the permit requirements, setup, placement, loading, safe distances of audiences, cleanup, storage,  
and transportation of commercial display fireworks and indoor pyrotechnics. In this section, we will deal  
with safety only in the United States, Canada, and the UK. Producers in other countries should seek out  
their own applicable standards and regulations. As a start, it can be generally stated that the storage and  
transportation of display fireworks and proximate pyrotechnics are federally regulated, often through a  
country’s explosive regulations. However, the actual safety of the displays or shows is typically not  
regulated but many guides are available.  
6.2.4.5.1 display fireworks safety  
In the United States, the most important documents are\:  
● National Fire Protection Association standard NFPA 1123\: Code for Fireworks Display \(2014 Edition\). This code  
contains information on how to set up and operate professional outdoor fireworks displays in order to  
prevent injuries to both the workers handling the fireworks and to the viewing audience, as well as to  
prevent fires that could cause property damage.  
● NFPA 1124\: Code for the Manufacture, Transportation, Storage, and Retail Sales of Fireworks and Pyrotechnic  
Articles \(2013 Edition\). Although this has useful information on storage and transportation of fireworks,  
it is under review and has been temporarily withdrawn.  
As well, Chapter 20 of Cooper \(2014\) provides extensive guidelines and checklists for performances in the  
United States.  
In Canada, the comparable governing documents are\:  
● SOR/2013 – 211\: Explosives Regulations, 2013, Part 18 – Display Fireworks. These federal regulations cover  
the acquisition, storage, certification, and use of display fireworks. These are regulations and thus  
enforceable by law.  
● Display Fireworks Manual, Second Edition, 2010. Published by the Explosives Regulatory Division \(ERD\)  
of Natural Resources Canada, this is very comprehensive and contains extensive information on training  
and certification, fireworks and equipment, display site requirements, operation of the display, loading  
and firing fireworks, display dismantling, storage of fireworks, and transportation of fireworks.  
● Authorization Guidelines for Consumer and Display Fireworks\: Authorization, Sampling, Composition, General and  
Detailed Requirements for Type F.1 and F.2 Fireworks \(ERD 2010\). These guidelines describe the safety  
requirements for the design and performance of display fireworks.  
“In the UK, responsibility for the safety of firework displays is shared between the Health and  
Safety Executive \(HSE\), fire brigades, and local authorities. Currently, there is no national  
system of licensing for fireworks operators, but in order to purchase display fireworks,  
operators must have licensed explosives storage and public liability insurance”.  
\(Fireworks, 2014\)  
There are two related guides for display fireworks\:  
● HSE. \(2006\). Working together on firework displays\: A guide to safety for firework display organisers and operators  
\(also referred to as HSG 123\). This provides guidance for display organizers on issues such as managing  
crowds safely and what to do if something goes wrong as well as giving safety advice for those who are  
responsible for setting up and firing the fireworks. How to clear up correctly after a firework display is  
also covered. **250** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
● British Pyrotechnists Association \(BPA\) Display Guide\: Guidance for organisers of professionally fired firework  
displays, Rev. 1.3 – October 2010. This guide addresses changes in display design, rigging techniques,  
types of fireworks, risk assessments, and environmental concerns that have occurred since the  
publication of HSG 123 and should be read in conjunction with that document.  
Event producers in any country contemplating using display fireworks should obtain a current copy of the  
applicable federal documents, as well as local state, provincial, county, or municipal regulations, which  
may differ throughout each country. Generally speaking, a producer who wishes to hold an outdoor  
fireworks display must have the following in their possession, either personally or through their official  
fireworks contractor\:  
● license or certification to work with display fireworks \(typically state or federal\);  
● approval to purchase display fireworks \(usually federal and/or state\);  
● permit to hold a fireworks display \(usually the AHJ or authority having jurisdiction, such as local municipal  
fire, parks, or police department\)—occasionally, the permit and approval to purchase are the same,  
depending on the jurisdiction;  
● permission of land owner, lessee, or agent to hold a fireworks display;  
● insurance of a minimum amount and type as specified by contract \(i.e. the client/producer  
contract\) and local regulations \(usually the same organization that grants the permit\)—the most  
common minimum amount now required is \$5 million liability and reputable fireworks companies will  
have this;  
● a site plan with complete details of crowd and fireworks locations, emergency access and egress, water  
locations, etc. \(usually a requirement of the AHJ\).  
6.2.4.5.2 proximate pyrotechnics safety  
Proximate pyrotechnics can arguably be the most awesome of all special effects; however, they can also be  
extremely lethal. Since 2003, three nightclub fires in various countries \(one in the United States, one in  
Argentina, and one in Brazil\) that were started by pyrotechnics have caused the deaths of 530 people. It  
is little wonder that proximate pyrotechnics represent one of the areas of most concern for special event  
producers, particularly with respect to safety and the obtaining of liability insurance.  
In the United States, the most important documents are\:  
● National Fire Protection Association standard NFPA 1126\: Standard for the Use of Pyrotechnics before a  
Proximate Audience \(2011 Edition\). This standard provides requirements for the safe use of pyrotechnic  
special effects before a proximate audience at both indoor and outdoor locations to protect property,  
operators, performers, support personnel, and viewing audiences. Application includes use in  
conjunction with theatrical, musical, or similar performing arts productions in theaters, stadiums,  
concert halls, etc.  
● NFPA 1124\: Code for the Manufacturing, Transportation, Storage and Retail Sale of Fireworks and Pyrotechnic  
Articles \(2013 Edition\). As with display fireworks, this code provides historical information only as it has  
been temporarily withdrawn, with the next edition scheduled for 2017.  
● NFPA 160\: Standard for the Use of Flame Effects before an Audience \(2011 Edition\). This standard provides  
public safety officials, designers, performers, and operators of flame effects with the latest requirements  
for the protection of the audience, support personnel, performers, the operator, assistants, and property  
where flame effects are used.  
Once again, Chapter 20 of Cooper \(2014\) provides extensive guidelines and checklists for proximate  
performances in the United States. sPecial eFFects **251**  
In Canada, the comparable governing documents are\:  
● SOR/2013 – 211\: Explosives Regulations, 2013, Part 17 – Special Effect Pyrotechnics. These federal regulations  
cover the acquisition, storage, certification, and use of proximate or special effect pyrotechnics. These  
are regulations and thus enforceable by law.  
● Special Effect Pyrotechnics Manual, Edition 3, 2014. Published by the ERD, this extensive manual covers  
certification, storage, pre-event planning and precautions, insurance, firing and show execution, post-  
event procedures, and transportation of special effect pyrotechnics.  
● Standard for Pyrotechnic Special Effects\: Classification and Authorization – General and Detailed Requirements for  
F.3, 2008 Edition. Also published by the ERD, this standard specifies the requirements for obtaining a  
Canadian product authorization and classification. In addition, it specifies what must be declared by the  
manufacturer or the manufacturer’s representative. It also describes minimum requirements for the  
design, technical information, performance, primary package and labeling requirements, and  
corresponding test methods for the product.  
The UK has no federal regulations currently available that apply to proximate pyrotechnics safety. As  
mentioned earlier, this responsibility rests with local authorities. However, there are guides that cover the  
basics, as follows\:  
● HSE. \(2010\). The event safety guide \(Second edition\)\: A guide to health, safety and welfare at music and similar  
events \(also referred to as HSG 195\). Much like Cooper \(2014\) in the United States, this is the UK’s event  
safety “bible” and contains a fairly comprehensive section on the planning and execution of a proximate  
pyrotechnics show.  
● Special or visual effects involving explosives or pyrotechnics used in film and television productions, HSE Entertainment  
Information Sheet No 16 \(Revision 1\), \(2011\). While this is intended primarily for the TV and movie  
industries, the guidelines are applicable for special events. They discuss personnel competencies,  
hazards, control, and the very basics of executing a show.  
Again, and in general, any event producers contemplating using indoor pyrotechnics should obtain  
a current copy of, and be fully conversant with, the applicable federal documents, as well as local  
state, provincial, county, or municipal regulations which may differ throughout each country. To ensure  
proper risk management, event producers who wish to use indoor pyrotechnics must understand the  
following\:  
● Transportation. This is normally a federal regulation and producers should ensure that the  
pyrotechnics contractor is familiar with all requirements for the safe transportation of pyrotechnics  
products.  
● Possession and storage. This is also typically a federal responsibility.  
● Licensing and certification. This can be federal or state. Any producers who are planning shows with  
proximate pyrotechnics should always insist that the pyro contractor be fully certified.  
● Permits. In addition to proper licensing or certification, a permit to hold the proximate pyrotechnics  
show on a specific date in a specific location is often required. Permit issuance is normally the  
responsibility of the AHJ, which is typically the local fire department. Like licensing, permitting  
regulations vary greatly, from none to stringent requirements that include licensing, insurance,  
pre-performance testing, and the hiring of a fire watch \(generally a fireman who stands by during the  
performance to ensure that all necessary safety precautions are followed\). Permits are frequently  
obtained by the contracted pyrotechnics company rather than the event producer. For cases in which  
actual fire and open flames are used, AHJ regulations vary widely and may be governed by the type of  
fuel used, such as gas or propane. **252** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
As with display fireworks, there are other safety items that should be addressed when a proximate  
pyrotechnics show is planned\:  
● Insurance. The insurance industry is very concerned about, and may not fully understand, the scope and  
importance of proximate pyrotechnics in special events. It has occasionally proven to be difficult for  
producers to obtain sufficient insurance for events that incorporate pyrotechnics, yet all local regulations,  
and universally most contracts, require insurance \(the standard being \$5 million liability\). It is generally  
the responsibility of the fireworks contractor to provide this insurance and to name all parties as being  
co-insureds. According to Greenwood from Vancouver, some clients and even venues do not understand  
that the responsibility rests with the fireworks contractor to obtain this insurance \(R. Greenwood,  
personal communication, December 10, 2014\). It is up to that contractor to explain what is required  
and, as mentioned in this chapter’s “Voice of the Industry,” clients and venues must have an inherent  
trust in the company to do what they say they will do, and that includes taking all necessary safety  
precautions.  
● Venue concerns. Indoor venues are also very worried about the disaster potential of indoor pyrotechnics.  
The venue must be given all the necessary information about the show and producers must ensure that  
any décor or stage set pieces and any flammable parts of the venue or the venue décor \(e.g. drapes\) are  
completely flame-treated and the performance moved to safe distances.  
For producers, the key to the safe conduct of a pyrotechnics show is to completely understand and follow  
all federal, state/provincial, and municipal regulations, to be prepared with necessary documentation, and  
to cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities.

# Three pretty vocalists and some very scary pyro  
We were to culminate the formal segment of our railroad-themed dinner event with a pyrotechnic  
segue into an entertainment program beginning with three beautiful female vocalists. The  
segue was to begin with a costumed historical character, Lord Strathcona, striking a giant gold  
spike, a symbolic representation of both the past and the driving of the last spike. From the  
spike, a single line rocket would travel to the venue ceiling where it would hit a modern satel-  
lite, symbolizing the future, from which three more line rockets would travel down to the stage,  
ending up at the top of each of three magic reveal doors. From the doors would emerge the  
three vocalists through the smoke created by three flashpots, to begin their show, fittingly with  
the song, “Fire.”  
This all happened exactly as planned and was greeted by enthusiastic applause from the  
audience. However, there was a noticeable momentary uncertainty and slight staggering on  
part of the vocalists, as they emerged in their glamour through the smoke and began their first  
song somewhat hesitatingly, which was unusual as they had always been extremely professional  
onstage.  
We learned from them after the show that they had feared for their lives as they stood behind  
the doors waiting to begin and watching the line rockets speed toward them. Of course, as soon  
as the rockets got to the doors, the doors opened and the flashpots were set off. In hindsight we  
realized that the flashpots had probably been loaded with too big a charge, as there seemed to  
be excessive smoke and much too loud an explosion. The vocalists, to their credit, soldiered on in sPecial eFFects **253**  
spite of being terrified. What then was the problem? Since this was before the days of strict risk  
management assessments, we had not used a qualified pyrotechnician but another person who  
claimed to know the right charge to use in the flashpots. Also, we had failed to completely brief  
the vocalists about what to expect with these special effects. We were fortunate that the only result  
of this was a good story for the vocalists to tell their friends.

# 6.2.5 atmospherics  
This is the name applied to artificial snow, foam, bubbles, and water effects. Companies who deal in  
atmospherics, usually movie special effects firms, supply specialized machinery to create these natural  
elements. Although not used extensively in special events, there are occasions for atmospherics when they  
can add an element of realism to theme events.  
# 6.2.5.1 Snow  
Artificial snow can be an impressive special effect as a static part of set dressing or as a dynamic effect  
when falling from above. Thanks to the movie industry, there are now a number of different but highly  
effective ways to achieve these effects. Most artificial snow is made either of plastic, paper, or foam. Snow  
Business, a pioneering special effects company based in the UK, in fact makes over 200 different types of  
snow for various effects. The ones most commonly used for special events are the following\:  
● Falling snow. The most effective falling snow for special events is evaporative snow, made out of foam  
and blown out of snow machines with fans. The secret to this product is in the composition of the fluid  
that turns into “snow.” In reality, the snow is really soap bubbles that are created when the snow fluid  
is blown through a modulator inside the snow machine. With modern machines, the size of the flakes  
and the fall time can be controlled by varying an onboard switch and adding an external fan respec-  
tively. These machines can be daisy-chained and controlled using DMX, and mounted on either the  
floor or on flown trussing. One large machine, for example, can cover an area up to 24 ft x 80 ft \(7.2 m  
x 24.2 m\). The choice of fluid affects the dryness of the flakes and hence the length of time before  
complete evaporation. The snow produced is biodegradable, non-toxic, and flame-retardant. Other  
falling snow that remains on the ground and can be blown with fans to create a storm effect is made of  
paper or foam, and while it looks very realistic, it must also be cleaned up after an event, unlike  
evaporative snow.  
● Static or ground snow. For permanent snow cover on sets, stage, floor, or ground, there are many  
different compounds and styles. These include\:  
● Paper snow in two basic versions\: environmentally friendly paper snow with no chemical additives,  
to be used outdoors; inflammable paper snow for interior use. Paper snow can be ordered in various  
sizes and hues and it is stable and water-resistant.  
● Cellulose powder. Environmentally friendly and easy to clean, it does not require additional support  
surface priming, and looks like a thin layer of snow or frost, depending on the support surface.  
● Plastic snow. This is excellent for interior applications, photo shoots, etc. It is available in a great  
number of variants.  
● Starch snow. This is environmentally friendly and good for use in hard-to-reach locations as it does  
not require cleanup or removal. Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**254** ● Polymer snow. This is very attractive and behaves like natural snow. It increases volume on contact  
with water, is excellent when footprints are required, and may be formed into snowballs. Consistency  
may be adjusted between light down and watery slush.  
● Foam snow. The cheapest variety, this is excellent for a deep snow effect and for backgrounds with  
no action to focus on. It does not require cleanup.  
● Sparkling snow. This may be added to all the other types of snow for bright sparkling reflections effect.  
● Opalescent snow. This is plastic snowflakes giving a fairy-tale effect, used as an add-on for all the  
other types of snow.  
\(Bykowski and Gajzler, 2014\)  
Coverage with these types of snow can be achieved either by hand or by blowing or flocking it with special  
blowers. Some types also come as large snow blankets formed into rolls that can be placed by hand for  
realism. Note that some of these compounds are toxic and may cause eye, skin, and respiratory irritation.  
Data sheets should be reviewed for any such toxicity before use and warnings posted for guests or handlers.  
# 6.2.5.2 Foam and bubbles  
Actual foam, or more accurately concentrated soap bubbles, has become surprisingly popular for events.  
It is composed of similar compounds as evaporative snow but more concentrated. Although sometimes  
considered as dry foam, it is not dry but does have a water component, although there are variations in  
compounds to make it more or less watery. The foam products are non-toxic, hypoallergenic, non-staining,  
and environmentally friendly. The foam used for events is expelled out of large-volume cannons and can  
last for hours depending on the amount of human contact. Area coverage by a cannon can be up to 8,000  
cu ft \(227 cu m\), deposited in less than 10 min. See Figure 6.7.

# 6.2.5.3 Bubbles  
The venerable bubble machine is still as popular as ever, except now more modern. Today’s machines are  
high volume and incorporate variable-speed fans. They can be floor-mounted or rigged on trussing and can  
be remotely controlled using DMX. The concentrated bubble fluid is non-toxic and biodegradable but may  
cause slight irritation to eyes, skin, and membranes if inhaled.  
# 6.2.5.4 Water curtains  
Water curtains, also called water scrims, are created by very narrow streams of water falling from distribu-  
tion piping. The water is caught in a trough and re-circulated using pumps, back through the upper  
distribution piping. The distribution piping requires a truss to be set up for support. The curtain is then  
used as a projection medium for lighting, video, cinema, still, or laser images, although the projection is  
best from the rear due to the physics of projecting through water droplets. Water curtains have many  
different applications\: backdrops or sets for stages; corridor water walkways; part of exhibition stands; and  
as part of reveal sequences in which it is possible to turn off individual sections of the water instantaneously,  
allowing cars, people, or any type of product to be uniquely revealed. Water curtains are sometimes called  
rain curtains although these tend to be smaller with fewer nozzles and used primarily as architectural  
enhancements.  
At present, there are no known safety regulations or standards for the atmospherics described; however,  
possible risks might be water damage to materials or décor as a result of overspray or leaks, and some  
minor skin, eye, and respiratory irritation as mentioned.

# Staging and set design  
# l e a r n i n g o u t c o m es  
After reading this chapter you will be able to\:  
**1.** Understand the language of the stage that is shared between theater and special events.  
**2.** Describe the three main types of special events stages and how they are constructed.  
**3.** Describe the options and accessories available for stages.  
**4.** Determine the correct horizontal and vertical sizes of a stage for a given purpose.  
**5.** Describe the different types of stage curtains.  
**6.** Understand how stage sets are designed and how they can be used to enhance a special event.  
What is it about a stage that can cause exhilaration one minute and terror the next? Why is it that by  
physically raising a person or group of persons above the level of other people, the perception of that person  
or group by the other people instantly changes? Quite simply, over the centuries, we as human beings have  
come to subconsciously equate positions of power and higher social status than ourselves with a physical  
difference in height. Most political and religious leaders have always spoken publicly from raised positions  
or platforms, and hence we consider anyone who speaks or performs from such a position as special in our  
eyes. We attribute more credibility and importance to their utterances, whether those utterances are  
serious or humorous, true or false.  
In this chapter, we examine not the psychology of being on a stage, but the humble construction of that  
structure that has been so supportive of human social and theatrical drama since ancient times. In so doing,  
we cover the following topics\:  
● language of the stage;  
● types and construction of stages; **258** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
● placement and sizing of stages;  
● stage draping;  
● stage sets and set design;  
● risk and safety.  
# 7.1 the language of the stage  
In special events, nowhere is our shared heritage with the world of theater more obvious than in staging,  
and we have borrowed extensively from theater terminology. The first instance of this is the style of stages,  
which goes all the way back to the ancient Greeks. The second important instance is in the directions for  
performers and those using the stage.  
# 7.1.1 Styles of stage  
There are three main styles of stages that are used in theater with accompanying similar, but modified,  
types in special events. It is useful to know what these are and how they are constructed\:  
● Thrust stage. The stage projects into, and is surrounded on three sides by, the audience. The fourth side  
contains the scenery or backdrop. Entrances to the stage may be made from backstage or through the  
audience and up onto the front of the stage \(Figure 7.1\). This type of stage most closely resembles the  
ones commonly used for special events, especially corporate events, although the backstage entrances  
are sometimes not used as there is no backstage area available, and usually the audience only surrounds  
the stage on one side \(the front\), unless space is in short supply. In this case, it is referred to as an apron  
stage. An offshoot or slightly different version of the thrust stage is the catwalk or runway stage that is  
just a narrower version of the thrust portion of the stage and that usually projects further into the  
audience, thus allowing for better audience viewing and interaction with performers. Figure 7.5 \(left\)  
is a unique example of a catwalk stage.  
**Figure 7.1** Thrust stage

● Proscenium stage. In this configuration, the audience watches the action through a rectangular opening  
\(the proscenium arch\) that resembles a picture frame. Scenery or a backdrop typically fills the space behind  
and upstage of the actors or performers. Entrances to the performing space are made from backstage Staging and set design **259**  
**Figure 7.2** Proscenium stage  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
\(Figure 7.2\). This type of stage is most often found in modern theaters, but occasionally a reasonable  
facsimile is constructed for special events by using curtains to mask the backstage area that extend  
outwards to venue side walls from the fronts or near fronts of the stage. The proscenium arch per se,  
however, is non-existent.  
● Arena stage. This type of stage—sometimes called a theater-in-the-round—is completely surrounded by  
the audience and any entrances must be made through the audience to the stage \(Figure 7.3\). Stairs to  
the stage may be placed in the center of each side, on corners, or any other location desired. In special  
events, this type of stage is most often found in concert settings; however, even there, the stage more  
often resembles a thrust stage configuration. Occasionally, an arena-type stage will be constructed for  
other special events, but audio, lighting, and sight-line challenges can pose problems. There are usually  
no scenic elements on this type of stage. See Figure 7.5 \(right\) for an example.  
# 7.1.2 Stage directions  
The second area of theater language that we share is stage directions. Production of an event with  
entertainment and action on a stage involves constant references to specific locations on the stage. To  
properly direct the action, whether it is the simple movement of lights, re-locating a microphone, or  
movement of people, all participants must understand the directions. It has become standard custom to  
give stage directions as if one is on the stage looking at the audience. Hence, stage left is to the left and  
stage right is to the right, downstage is in front, and upstage is behind a person on the stage. These same  
directions provide the reference if one is off the stage as well, for example a show caller directing lighting  
cues or managing talent. The terms upstage and downstage probably evolved in the 16th or 17th centuries  
during the era of raked stages which were purposely sloped stages built that way to create the illusion of  
depth. Figure 7.4 shows these directions.  
# 7.2 types and construction of stages  
Temporary staging has come a long way from the rickety pageant wagons of Medieval England and the  
makeshift platforms of itinerant Commedia Dell’arte players in Renaissance Italy. Most staging used for  
special events today is one of three types\: manufactured proprietary decks and support systems, custom  
stages, or mobile stages. We will examine each of these types and their construction, and then review  
common accessories for stages and other optional indoor structures. **260** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS

# 7.2.1 manufactured decks and support systems  
This type of stage comes in standard sizes of decks \(sometimes called risers or platforms\) that connect  
with each other to form larger surfaces \(stages\). Depending on the specific manufacturer and the design,  
they may have legs as an integral part of them or separate legs that attach to them. Typical rectangular  
deck sizes are 8 ft x 4 ft, 4 ft x 4 ft, and 8 ft x 6 ft. Less common are 2 ft x 4 ft, 2 ft x 8 ft, and 4 ft x 6 ft.  
These are North American sizes and comparable metric sizes tend to be slightly different \(e.g. 244 cm  
x 122 cm, 122 cm x 122 cm, and 244 cm x 183 cm are the closest to the three most common  
sizes respectively\). However, not all manufacturers make all the different sizes and, due to proprietary  
designs, decks from one manufacturer are usually not compatible with decks from a different  
manufacturer. This means that it is unlikely that a large stage could be built using decking from  
two different manufacturers. Some manufacturers have begun to make decks in unusual shapes that  
allow for a larger variety of overall stage shapes than traditional rectangles. Most manufacturers  
now also make 45-degree corner sections, both square and rounded, and some add semi-circles and  
triangles as well as other shapes. This, of course, increases the number of creative stage design  
possibilities immensely.  
Manufactured decks typically consist of an extruded aluminum frame into which is fitted thick plywood  
sheeting, or a sandwich construction of cellulose honeycomb between thin sheets of plywood. Total  
thicknesses vary between about 3 and 4 in. \(7.5 and 10 cm\). Manufacturers usually offer optional surface  
treatment for the decks in the form of carpeting, varnished or unfinished wood, slip-resistant polypropylene,  
or fiberglass sheeting. Modern decking also has fixed holes or special fitting points in the top corners that  
will accept proprietary safety railings, as well as proprietary fittings on the underside for legs and supporting  
frames. Some decks are even reversible.  
Supporting legs and frames for staging are as different as the riser surface shapes. Again, depending on  
the manufacturer, the legs may be fixed in height or have variable height settings. There are two reasonably  
standard height systems in use, one that works with 6 in. increments \(e.g. standard leg heights of 6, 12,  
18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 in.\) and one that works with 8 in. increments \(e.g. standard leg heights of 8, 16, 24,  
32, 40, 48, 56, 72, and even 96 in.\), with comparable European sizes \(e.g. 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 mm,  
etc.\). Legs can be the only means of support, with a single leg supporting each corner, or they can be part  
of a larger frame system that incorporates horizontal and diagonal cross bracing. Many legs come with  
height-adjustable feet as well as more continuously variable height adjustments using cotter pins or special  
screws with indents at very small increments. Legs and frames are usually constructed of extruded  
aluminum. Some of the frames telescope and rotate for easier storage and some, besides telescoping,  
are permanently attached to stage decks for more efficient setup. Hotels and conference centers often  
purchase manufactured staging for use in special events, but event managers are usually charged for their  
setup and use.  
These types of manufactured stages are often used for purposes other than entertainment or ceremonial.  
Thanks to the variety of leg lengths, they can be perfect for temporary tiered flooring for seating or dining  
to afford audiences or guests better visibility for action taking place on other surfaces, in effect putting the  
audience on the stage and the show on the floor.  
Temporary circular stages are sometimes mounted on tracks and bearing assemblies and connected to  
motors that allow them to rotate. This is often seen in trade show situations to demonstrate products. It  
can also be very effective for entertainment presentations to achieve quick changes of stage sets; however,  
it is costly and for large stages must be strictly designed to permit sufficient loading and to determine the  
correct motor size. **262** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS

# 7.2.2 custom stages  
The ingenuity of event producers and expectations of clients will always maintain a demand for customized  
staging, for shapes and sizes that are not achievable with manufactured systems. In this particular genre  
of staging, specialized staging companies come into their own. There are numerous companies in the  
industry that build stages out of wood and customize them with paint or other finishes and surface  
materials. Often these companies also provide complete set-building capabilities as well, which we will  
discuss in Section 7.5. The advantage of custom staging is that it can be built to fit into any space, of any  
size or shape, and of any theme or material. Some examples of situations where customized staging may  
be used are\:  
● For covering of awkwardly shaped or dangerous surfaces. This might be ground with rocks, gardens, or  
other obstructions that cannot be covered easily by manufactured staging, or that is at too great a slope.  
It might also include water such as swimming pools or lakes.  
● To accomplish a unique design for an event. This is most often used in concert situations and for  
major award ceremonies where the set and stage design must be original and attention-grabbing.  
See Figure 7.5 \(left\).  
● For large stages in situations where there is insufficient manufactured staging available or for which the  
rental of such staging would be excessively expensive. This might occur again in a concert setting or in  
a convention facility that does not own sufficient staging.  
● To replace manufactured staging which may not be strong enough in a certain situation. For example,  
this might be to support heavy cars or trucks at a product launch.  
● To fit a stage into an awkward space. If an event is being held in an unusual venue with architecture  
that does not lend itself to the standard rectangular staging, custom-fitted staging may be necessary, or  
if a client wishes a stage to fit into an irregular space.  
● To extend an existing stage over existing seating in a theater or arena. This might entail  
constructing additional oddly shaped decking to butt against an existing stage, or to fit over  
seating that does not allow the regular spacing or fitting of support frames and legs of manu-  
factured staging. Staging and set design **263**  
# 7.2.3 mobile stages  
Arguably the genesis of large outdoor concert stages began with the questionably engineered  
stage of Woodstock in 1969. Many of those outdoor stages are now in mobile form and capable  
of moving from one city to the next literally as the contents of, and an integral part of, large  
trailer trucks.  
An entire series of easily erectable mobile stages is now available from several manufacturers in stage  
surface sizes ranging from about 24 ft x 20 ft \(7.3 m x 6.1 m\) to about 130 ft x 50 ft \(39.3 m x 15.2 m\).  
These stages are designed to fit entirely into, and as part of, a towable trailer. An onboard hydraulic system  
is used to literally fold the stage surface and roof into the trailer. These systems come equipped with  
trussing engineered to support full lighting and audio systems. Indeed, the largest stage mentioned above  
has a load rating of 75 tons \(i.e. 150,000 lb or 56,000 kg\). With most, there is a variety of accessories and  
options available, such as stage extensions, roof canopy extensions to cover equipment \(e.g. lights on the  
trussing\), stairs, ramps, safety rails, fire-retardant wind walls, vertical and horizontal banner supports,  
A-V screen support, generator, and heating and air conditioning. These mobile systems have greatly  
increased the efficiency of technical setups. See Figure 7.6 for an example of a fully erected 50 ft x 38 ft  
\(15.2 x 11.6 m\) mobile stage.

# 7.2.4 accessories for stages and other optional structures  
Staging for special events is more than just decks and legs. Particularly with safety in mind, there are  
accessories that make for safer work on stages and easier access to them, specifically stairs, ramps, safety  
railing, and deck covering. As well, there are other indoor temporary structures that fit easier classification  
under staging options, namely dance floors and choral/band risers.  
# 7.2.4.1 Stairs  
All stage manufacturers provide stairs that match their decking and leg heights in design and size. Some  
are equipped with wheels or casters that tilt out of the way when the stairs are in use. Most stairs have  
holes or attachment points to accept safety railing. For safety, the edges of stairs and stages are often  
marked with bright masking tape for better visibility.  
# 7.2.4.2 Ramps  
Some manufacturers provide optional ramps for wheelchair and disabled access, including safety  
railing. Occasionally, custom ramps need to be built to provide this access. In North America, all  
such ramps must conform to ADA \(Americans with Disabilities Act\) Standards for Accessible Design,  
Section 4.8, which specifies slope, width, landing, and handrail requirements. The maximum gradient in  
North America and most of the rest of the world is 1\:12, which equates to 1 foot of ramp for every inch of  
rise. For example, a 24 in. \(60 cm\) high stage would require a 24 ft \(7.3 m\) long ramp. Additionally, ADA  
limits the longest single span of ramp, prior to a rest or turn platform, to 30 ft \(9 m\). Ramps can be as  
long as needed, but no single run of ramp can exceed 30 ft, and no more than 10 m \(33 ft\) in Europe. The  
minimum width should be no less than 36 in. \(91 cm\), but 120 cm in Europe \(Express Ramps, 2014; and  
DFPNI, 2006\).  
# 7.2.4.3 Safety railing  
In the interest of good risk management, it is becoming increasingly necessary to provide safety railing  
\(also called guardrails\) on access stairs, ramps, and the backs and sides of stages themselves. Although  
there are no regulations or standards for the special events industry, worker safety standards from the  
United States and Canada do provide guidelines that are met by most manufacturers. In the United States,  
OSHA Code 1910.23\(e\) states that railing should have a nominal height of 42 in. \(100 cm\) and be able to  
bear a load at the top in any direction of 200 lb \(890 N\). The Canadian standard \(SOR/86-304, Sec. 2.12\)  
mirrors the US, stating that the height range should be 900 to 1,100 mm \(36 to 44 in.\) and load rating  
890 N. European/UK standards also are the same.  
Most manufacturers meet these standards. Typically, safety railing is constructed of tubular steel and  
comes in heights of 39 to 42 in. \(980 to 1,058 mm\). It also comes in fixed or adjustable lengths, depending  
on the manufacturer. Most railing attaches to the stage surface in one of two ways\: by fitting spigots  
into pre-drilled holes on the stage corners then placing the railing posts over the spigots; or by  
attaching a clamp or gripper-type adaptor with a spigot built onto it, to the stage surface that then  
accepts the railing post. Different railing designs have different load ratings and these should be  
checked before installation to ensure they are adequate for anticipated use and also meet standards.  
For example, one manufacturer \(Prolyte\) has two versions, one that is light duty and can resist only  
30 kg/m \(20 lb/ft\) of horizontal loading, and one heavy-duty version that can resist 100 kg/m \(67 lb/ft\)  
of horizontal loading. Any event in a public area should have only heavy-duty railing with a high load  
rating installed. Staging and set design **265**  
# 7.2.4.4 Deck surface covers  
Besides the finishes already discussed for stage surfaces, occasionally performers may demand that certain  
surfaces be provided for them. Dancers, especially ballet and contemporary, and some athletes, fall into  
this category. They require a surface that is forgiving yet is not too slippery and they may request a surface  
material generically known as a Marley carpet or flooring. The name comes from the company that originally  
manufactured it, but there are now different manufacturers with differently sized products.  
This type of flooring is composed of a layer of mineral fiber interply sandwiched between two layers of thin  
PVC with a smooth finish. It comes in rolls of widths between 63 and 78 in. \(1.6 to 2 m\) and thicknesses  
between 0.04 and 0.10 in. \(1.0 to 2.5 mm\). The smallest thickness is also good for tap dance performances.  
The products come in a variety of colors and some even in woodgrain. It must be rolled out on top of an  
existing stage \(hard surfaced, not carpeted\) and taped together. If dancers must dance on an existing stage,  
their preference is normally a smooth wooden surface with no uneven joints. This may mean that joints  
between deck sections must be taped to cover irregularities.  
# 7.2.4.5 Dance floors  
Dancers may also request a hard surface for tap dancing that can often be provided simply by placing  
sections of wooden dance flooring on top of existing carpeted staging. Standard dance floors typically come  
in 3 ft x 3 ft, 2 ft x 4 ft, 3 ft x 4 ft, or 4 ft x 4 ft sections \(depending on the manufacturer, although 3 ft x  
3 ft or 91 cm x 91 cm is the most common\) and interlock via tongue and groove aluminum edges on each  
section, sometimes with additional screws for extra safety. Outer edges have special bevel fittings to  
eliminate the possibility of tripping. Finishes are usually smooth varnished wood, or painted. Some have  
vinyl surfaces with simulated wood grain. Plexiglas surfaces and underlit LED floors are also available.  
Custom floors, like stages, can be made to almost any size and finish. There are a few manufacturers that  
make “sprung dance floors” which are really just shock absorbing, closed cell foam blocks that suspend  
the wooden floor above an existing, hard uncompromising surface.  
If a dance floor is actually being used for dancing for guests—on the ballroom/meeting room floor, not the  
stage—the correct size must first be determined. One starts by using an educated assumption that only  
about 33 to 50 percent of the guests will be dancing at any given time. Next, the average area occupied by  
a single dancer \(2 to 3 ft² per person\) is multiplied by the number of people. Let us assume, for example,  
that the total number of persons attending an event is 500 and that it is a crowd that enjoys dancing so  
we can use the high figure of 50 percent of them being on the dance floor at any given time. This means  
the dance floor area required will be between 500 ft² and 750 ft² \(depending on whether we use the 2 or  
3 ft² per person assumption\).  
Using another assumption that the dance floor available is comprised of 3 ft x 3 ft sections \(9 ft² per  
section\), then the total number of sections of dance floor required will be 55 to 84 \(i.e. 500/9 at the lower  
end of size, to 750/9 at the upper end of size\). If we wanted to make a square dance floor, using the larger  
size for safety, then each side would be nine sections long, or 81 ft, for an actual total area of 729 ft². How  
did we arrive at this number? First, we calculated the square root of the maximum number of sections we  
need since we want a square dance floor \(i.e. √84 = 9.17\), and the closest whole number to this is 9 so we  
will use nine sections per side.  
Instead of opting for a square dance floor, if we want to match the width of the dance floor to the width  
of the stage and the stage is 24 ft across, then the width of the dance floor will be eight sections \(24/3\)  
since each section is 3 ft wide. Thus the length of the other side of the dance floor will be ten sections or  
30 ft \(i.e. 84 sections/8 sections = 10.5 or 750 ft²/24 ft = approx. 31.25 ft or ten sections of 3 ft wide  
flooring\). Note that the numbers are rounded to obtain the closest number of sections, so that the final  
actual dance floor area will be 720 ft² \(24 ft wide x 30 ft deep\). **266** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 7.2.4.6 Choral and band risers  
Frequently, events utilize large choirs or choral groups, concert bands, and symphony orchestras as part  
of their entertainment programs. These large musical groups usually require specially designed risers  
for their members in order for them to easily see their director/conductor, and for the audience to see  
all of them. These risers are positioned on top of the event staging, but occasionally may be placed directly  
on the floor. Although the risers may be custom-made, they are more often manufactured in standard sizes.  
These types of risers are constructed similarly to stage decks in that they have separate decks that are  
attached to legs \(primarily steel\) and support frames \(steel or aluminum\). They can be configured in  
rectangular or curved shapes using pie-shaped sections of decking. Usually, the deck rise is 8 in. and there  
are two, three, or four tiers in total, giving a total rise of between 8 and 40 to 54 in. \(20 and 100 to  
136 cm\), depending on the manufacturer and whether the support legs are fixed height or fully adjustable  
respectively. Deck depths are usually 16, 18, or 21 in. \(40, 45, or 53 cm\) for choral risers and 36 or 48 in.  
\(91 or 121 cm\) for band risers, with widths being 6 or 8 ft \(1.8 or 2.4 m\) for band and 6 or 6.5 ft \(1.8 or  
2 m\) for choral risers, although some are tapered. Deck surfaces are often reversible with one side being  
non-slip textured polypropylene and the other carpeted. Decks themselves are usually laminated  
honeycomb. The entire assemblies fold up or dismantle into individual sections and are portable. Some  
are equipped with their own wheels and, of course, safety railing is available.

# An interview with Mr. Michael Reese  
Executive Vice President Creative, Barkley Kalpak Agency

With a Master of Fine Arts in theater design, Michael Reese has been a key member of the Barkley  
Kalpak team for over 11 years. Bka has won numerous awards for their creative corporate events  
and earned a well-deserved reputation for excellence. I spoke with Michael about how they do it.

Courtesy of Barkley Kalpak Agency, www.bka.net Staging and set design **267**  
**DM**\: Can you talk about how you approach set design and the idea of the “experiential event”?  
**mr**\: We bring people together for a shared experience to talk about something and often it is  
done as a story. It’s important to remember that the design is saying something about the client’s  
brand—their messaging—so you have to understand what they want to say. You have to ask a  
lot of questions. What’s the vibe, or impact desired? What does the client want the audience to  
experience or feel? What story do they want to tell? What relationship do they want the presenter  
to have with the audience?  
My personal style \[for set design\] is probably defined by using the fewest elements for the most  
impact. My work tends to be more sculptural and substantial. I had a design professor in grad  
school that talked about elegant solutions—use only what is necessary. And I’ve held onto that.  
Also in the proposal or courting phase, I try to keep in mind that the clients want the Ferrari. Even  
if their budget is a station wagon, they want the dream. So we focus on the rendering quality, or  
the feeling of the experience, not just the ground plan showing how big the projection screens  
are and how many chairs fit.  
**DM**\: How has the event experience changed for audiences?  
**mr**\: First, there is a lot less live entertainment because of the perceived cost. This came about after  
the economic crash in 2008. The main thing that has filled the void has been networking, spending  
time with each other. There is also more of an emphasis on shared cultural experiences in which  
clients want to get attendees out of the ballroom and experiencing local culture.  
**DM**\: How has set design then changed over the last five to ten years as a result, in terms of materi-  
als, incorporating technology, and following standards for safety and sustainability?  
**mr**\: There is a focus on multimedia and video presentation. Ten years ago we weren’t talking  
about screen resolution, picture-in-picture and video design nearly as much as we do now. There  
used to be more of a focus on the “theater” of the presentation space. It was even called “busi-  
ness theater.” But now it’s more about a personal connection; there is more of an attempt to be  
authentic, approachable. The designs are about supporting the presenter/attendee relationship.  
Safety is and has always been important. As we move to more authentic experiences in live events,  
the theatricality tends to have taken a back seat—which also relates to a sense of being needlessly  
expensive—so some of the safety concerns have been reduced. There’s less “flying in a Ceo from  
overhead rigging”!  
**DM**\: Can you give some examples?  
**mr**\: There is much less hardwood flat construction. Work tends to be more graphic with large  
format printing. There are also many more requests for wide-screen projection. The actual scenic  
design component has become minimal and there is more graphic design integrated into the  
multimedia. Often now, for example, we must move an onstage presenter in order to allow the  
screen presentations to be visible as they change. We are also seeing some gamification in which  
the audience becomes involved in the presentation. In fact, occasionally there is no screen at all  
and information is pushed directly to the mobile devices of attendees. However, there is a dark side  
to this and that is creating too much isolation when the main purpose is to bring people together  
for the shared experience.  
**DM**\: Regarding staging, do you tend to now custom-build stages more than before or just try to  
modify and work with manufactured staging? **268** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**mr**\: There are a lot of great rental solutions out there now, more than ever, and sometimes that’s a  
great option. I actually think it’s ego that prevents some designers from using more rental solutions.  
Just because you’ve seen it before, doesn’t mean the clients or attendees have seen it before.  
I would say most of the time I’m using some rental elements blending with some custom fabrication  
for a personal and impactful \(and budget-friendly\) solution. You can usually make some version  
of a rental solution work in order to be cost effective for your client. If you want a 20 ft diameter  
stage, but the only rental stage around is 18 ft, you can usually make that work.  
**DM**\: Do you have any final words of wisdom to give students of event production that would make  
your job easier if they became your client? For example, is there say a minimum knowledge base  
they should possess with respect to staging and the process and cost of set design?  
**mr**\: Be as honest as possible with the requirements and the budget. It will only save you time  
and frustration.  
We designers don’t tend to have our own agenda. We only want to help the client have the best  
event they can—and have fun. It’s a great opportunity to create something that has never existed  
before. And as much as possible leave the assumptions at the door. It doesn’t always have to start  
with, “Where is the screen going to be?”  
# 7.3 Placement and sizing of stages  
In Chapter 1 we discussed placement of stages with respect to the effective presentation of entertainment.  
The same options hold true for all other types of presentations, namely against a wall, in corners, or in the  
center of a venue. For that matter, a stage or stages can be placed anywhere in a venue that is convenient  
for those using it and those viewing the onstage activities. What is a little more complicated is determining  
the correct size for the stage.  
# 7.3.1 horizontal size  
Determining the correct area of a stage is sometimes more art than science. Unfortunately, event planners  
and managers often do not give it enough consideration. The horizontal area must accommodate any and  
all activities that will take place on it. Even though speeches may occupy 3 h and 55 min out of a 4-h  
program with only one speaker appearing at a time, but there is a finale with a 12-member dance ensemble,  
the stage has to be big enough from the outset to accommodate the dance ensemble. In other words, it  
must be large enough to allow for the activity that will require the most space, no matter how important  
or how long that activity is in relation to the rest of the staged program.  
For most activities, there are no golden rules. Every performing group usually has a minimum size of stage  
that will accommodate their performance and they should be consulted prior to event setup to ensure  
that the properly sized stage is ordered. Generally, for speakers at a lectern, a minimum of 15–20 ft²  
\(1.4–1.8 m2\) is required. Unfortunately, if the event consists of only speeches by one or two persons at a  
time such as an awards ceremony, having a small stage might not automatically be the correct choice. The  
stage size in relation to the size of the venue and also in relation to the size of the stage set and any  
additional décor or A-V equipment must be taken into consideration. For example, if an awards ceremony  
is to take place with a stage set up in the middle of a 150 ft \(45 m\) long wall, and two large A-V screens  
with surrounding drape are to extend to the side walls on either side of the stage, it does not make good  
design sense to have a stage that is only 8 or 12 ft \(2.4 or 3.6 m\) wide as it is completely out of proportion Staging and set design **269**  
to the remainder of the room’s décor and the scale of the entire venue. The stage must reflect the  
correct proportion, and should be more in the order of about one-third of the total width of the venue or  
50 ft \(15 m\) wide, in spite of the small number of persons occupying it at any given time. Part of the extra  
space may also be taken up purposely with a well-designed stage set.  
In the case of musical groups, it is better to compute an accurate size of stage based on fairly static area  
requirements for individual musicians. The following guidelines will assist in calculating stage sizes for  
musical groups\:  
● Electronic rhythm instruments. 25–30 ft² \(2.5 m2\) per musician \(e.g. guitar, bass, keyboards\) including  
amplifiers and equipment.  
● Acoustic instruments. 10–15 ft² \(1.3 m2\) per musician \(e.g. brass, woodwinds, strings\), including chairs  
and music stands.  
● Drummer. 50–70 ft² \(6 m2\), including all equipment. Drummers are often elevated on a small riser,  
usually 8 ft x 8 ft x 6 to 12 in. high \(244 cm x 244 cm x 30 cm\), for better visualization.  
● Spinet piano. 30 ft² \(2.5 m2\).  
● Full grand piano. 100 ft² \(9 m2\).  
● Vocalists. 10 ft² \(1 m2\) per vocalist if backup and not moving too much; 30–50 ft² \(4–5 m2\) per vocalist  
for a lead vocalist, and possibly more if part of a show band.  
As an example using Imperial units, a five-piece regular dance band with a single lead singer, a drummer,  
a keyboard player, a bass player, and a guitarist, would require approximately 155–210 ft² of space using  
the variable area extremes from the above list. This would equate to a stage with horizontal dimensions  
of 16 ft x 12 ft \(192 ft²\) for the absolute minimum-sized stage, and at least three choices for the stage that  
would accommodate the band in a roomier manner. These possibilities would be 16 ft x 16 ft \(256 ft²\),  
20 ft x 12 ft \(240 ft²\), or 20 ft x 16 ft \(320 ft²\), all assuming single riser dimensions of 8 ft x 4 ft. Since  
most musicians do not like to play beside a drummer but rather in front, and since a drum kit is  
approximately 8 ft deep, this means that the drummer occupies essentially the back or upstage 8 ft of the  
stage alone. Thus, there must still be at least 105 ft² of stage area remaining \(155 ft² minimum less 50 ft²  
minimum for the drummer\). If the stage size is 20 ft x 12 ft, that means there is only the front or upstage  
4 ft remaining for the rest of the band to play on, a total of only 80 ft² of space \(i.e. 20 ft wide x 4 ft deep,  
after subtracting the upstage 8 ft occupied by the drummer\), which is inadequate. Therefore, the correct  
stage size should be 20 ft wide x 16 ft deep, which would leave an ample 160 ft² \(i.e. 20 ft wide x 8 ft deep,  
after subtracting the upstage 8 ft occupied by the drummer\) for the rest of the band. Although this sounds  
complicated, it is an exercise that a producer must go through if an adequately sized stage is to be provided  
for the entertainment planned.  
In addition to drum risers for dance or show groups, larger musical ensembles such as symphony orchestras  
or big bands often specify tiered riser sections on top of the regular stage for the different orchestra  
sections, such as percussion, strings, brass, or woodwinds. The height and horizontal size of these risers  
is usually determined by the orchestra leader, and specified in their contract rider. Special band risers such  
as those described in Section 7.2.4.6 may need to be rented.  
# 7.3.2 vertical size  
The first assumption in determining the height of a stage is that the special event is not being held in a  
venue with a permanent stage such as a theater. Otherwise, the height is dependent on the size of the  
audience, whether they will be sitting or standing, and whether the ground or floor is level \(we will assume  
in this section that the surface is level\). Standing audiences can occur for concerts, receptions, dances, **270** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
trade shows, product launches, and others. Seated audiences can occur at dining events, award ceremonies,  
opening and closing ceremonies, meetings, and numerous others. We will deal with each of these.  
# 7.3.2.1 Standing audience  
In order to make an educated determination of the correct height for a standing audience, we must make  
some assumptions of human characteristic body dimensions and typical spacing between persons in a  
standing crowd. For purposes of this exercise only, let us assume that the average person is approximately  
5 ft 11 in. \(179 cm\) tall and that in a standing crowd, people will tend to space themselves no closer than  
2 ft \(0.6 m\) apart. Also, we must assume that persons in the crowd are able to maneuver themselves  
sufficiently to see over the heads of other persons two rows ahead of them \(i.e. about 4 ft, or 1.2 m in front  
of them\). If we further assume that at minimum any persons in the audience must see at least the top part  
of the head of an average person standing on the stage \(near the front or downstage edge of the stage\),  
then we can draw some sight lines to assist us with calculating the correct stage height that will relate  
directly to the size of the crowd. Figure 7.8 does just this. Note that at 25 ft \(7.6 m\) away from the stage,  
a person is able to see the top part of the head of someone onstage if the stage is 3 ft \(1 m\) in height.  
Likewise, at 50 ft \(15 m\) from the stage, the height must be raised to 4 ft \(1.2 m\) to achieve similar  
visibility and at 100 ft \(30 m\) away from the stage, the height must be at least 8 ft \(2.4 m\) for the same  
visibility. It is clear from this explanation that given a specific audience size and venue size, a stage  
should be constructed of sufficient height to enable the entire audience to view the stage in the worst case  
scenario. For example, even in the case of a standup reception at which there will be stage entertainment,  
the assumption must be made that during the entertainment, attendees will crowd the stage to the extent  
that they will be about 2 ft apart, even though when the entertainment is not on, this may not be true.

# 7.3.2.2 Seated audience  
For a seated audience, the height is also determined by the ability to see over the head of a person sitting  
directly across a table \(if dining\) or directly in front by two rows \(if theater-style\). We will illustrate the  
principle by using a dining situation in which diners are seated at 72 in. \(1.8 m\) diameter round tables,  
separated by 10 ft \(3 m\) center-to-center. Exactly the same principle applies as for the standing scenario,  
except that, because the distance from the observer to the person opposite is much greater than the critical  
distance in a standing crowd, the angle is lower and so the stage can be that much lower in height.  
Figure 7.9 illustrates the angles and can be used to calculate approximate stage heights. Once again, the  
worst case scenario must be assumed and if the tables are less than 72 inches in diameter \(e.g. 60 in. or  
1.5 m rounds\) then the calculation must be rechecked. Note also that because of the low angle, a constant  
stage height may be used for the nearest 50 ft \(15 m\) to the stage before the stage height really needs to  
be increased, unlike the standing situation. Staging and set design **271**  
**Figure 7.9** Stage height determination for a seated audience  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
It should be kept in mind that the variables in determining stage height are many \(e.g. slope of ground if  
outdoors, proximity of audience members to each other, whether performers stay on mainly the downstage  
portion of the stage\), so the above analyses are only intended to be general guidelines and not hard rules.  
Each situation will be different and in some cases, a lower stage might be adequate.

# One small detail . . .  
As part of a final night celebration for a large insurance convention, we were asked to produce  
a custom entertainment show in conjunction with the Sheraton San Diego. A professional, well-  
established technical production and staging company was also brought on board. This being the  
case, I felt that we would be in good hands.  
As the Sheraton wanted this show to be completely custom, the technical production and staging  
company began developing a total custom stage for the performance and we were brought  
in early so that our performance needs would be considered in the development of the stage.  
Conversations during the planning and construction of the stage included our requests for  
concealed stage entrances on stage left, stage right, and center stage, as well as reminders that  
the floor of the stage must be constructed using wood, and then covered in Marley or some such  
surface to ensure safety for the show’s dancers. We also took great care to indicate the kind of  
stairs to be used to ensure performer safety with their elaborate costumes.  
Months were spent developing the show creative, building the costumes, producing the orchestral  
tracks, casting, and rehearsing the show. We maintained contact throughout this period with the  
technical producer, including a check of stage drawings.  
On show day, we moved into the venue expecting the day to run smoothly. We had been rehears-  
ing offsite, and had taken great care to ensure that the costuming would work despite the  
choreography and show staging. We were ready. The stage too seemed ready when we entered  
the ballroom. Everything we talked about seemed to be included, except the most important  
element of all, the wooden floor with a Marley surface atop. To save money, and unbeknownst to  
us, the technical producer had changed his mind due to cost and used a low-pile carpet as a stage  
surface instead of what we had requested.  
Horrified due to the intricacy of the choreography and the safety of the performers, we immedi-  
ately showed our concern, which was met in a most disagreeable manner by the technical producer. **272** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
Clearly in the wrong, he began to shout at us, insisting that the carpet would be fine, and that we  
were simply too demanding. He just did not agree that there was a problem other than the one  
we were creating.  
Given that we had no more time to change the flooring and still be able to rehearse on the set,  
we determined that we would do the best we could under the circumstances, and dance on the  
carpet. We spent our onsite rehearsal time changing the choreography to work on carpet. This  
naturally only served to confuse the performers, who had spent weeks rehearsing.  
What should have been a smooth, well-rehearsed performance ended up looking somewhat reck-  
less and unrehearsed. We had spent tens of thousands of dollars and months preparing for this  
opportunity to wow our audience, and came up short thanks to a lack of communication on the  
part of the technical producer.

# 7.4 Stage draping  
Stages do not look good all alone. Because they are very short in stature when in a room full of people,  
they require higher embellishments to let people know where they are. For special events, this embellishment  
often takes the form of either draping or creative stage sets. In this section we will discuss the different  
types of stage draping.  
# 7.4.1 Backdrops  
Generally there are four types of fabric backdrops used for special event stages, apart from custom stage  
sets and technical backdrops like LED screens. These include the following\:  
● Regular drape. Drapes used for stage backdrops are usually constructed out of cotton or polyester velour,  
commando cloth, or Encore, the materials and support method for which are described in Section 2.2.4.2  
of Chapter 2. Also as mentioned in Chapter 2, stages may have decorative murals as backdrops rather  
than plain drapes, or hard sets, and these can be further dramatized through the use of scrims \(see  
below\).  
● Star drop. One unique fabric backdrop that has been around for some time but still finds use as a stage  
backdrop is a star drop or drape. This is a basic drape \(e.g. velour\) that has numerous small LED—or  
fiber optic—lights sandwiched between two layers of fabric. The lights come in color or white and the  
drapes themselves in a variety of sizes. The lights can be pre-programmed using DMX protocol and can  
fade or change patterns.  
● Cyclorama or cyc. A cyc is a large curtain or wall, often concave, positioned at the back of the stage area.  
It can be made of unbleached canvas \(larger versions\) or Muslin \(smaller versions\), or seamless  
translucent plastic \(often referred to as “Opera Plastic”\). Traditionally it is hung at 0 percent fullness  
\(flat\). When possible, it is stretched on the sides and weighted on the bottom to create a flat and even  
surface. As seams tend to interrupt the smooth surface of the cyc, it is usually constructed from extra-  
wide material. Cycs are most often used for dramatic lighting effects.  
● Scrim. A scrim in the theatrical sense as applied to special events is a gauze-like fabric made from cotton  
or flax\: “Scrims both reflect and transmit light. This means that if a light from a front-of-house position  
is shone at a scrim, then both the scrim and everything behind it will be lit. This can lead to a variety  
of interesting effects. Staging and set design **273**  
● A scrim will appear entirely opaque if everything behind it is unlit and the scrim itself is grazed by  
light from the sides or from above.  
● A scrim will appear nearly transparent if a scene behind it is lit, but there is no light on the scrim.  
● A dreamy or foggy look can be achieved by lighting a scene entirely behind a scrim.  
● If a light with a gobo is aimed at a scrim, the image will appear on the scrim, but also any objects  
behind the scrim will be lit by the pattern as well.”  
\(Scrim, 2013\)  
For most special event situations, a scrim will probably remain static as part of the stage backdrop design,  
although in theaters they are rigged to be raised or lowered to achieve a dramatic effect on cue.  
# 7.4.2 masking curtains  
The same regular drapery material used for backdrops is also used for masking curtains to hide parts of the  
stage and equipment. Masking curtains can be flat or pleated with fullness. Their size is usually determined  
by sight lines to minimize or eliminate any view to the backstage area. They are usually black as they are  
meant to become “invisible” when the lights are dimmed. The following are explanations of the different  
types of masking curtains\:  
● Borders hide lights and other equipment mounted above the stage. They are finished with fabric ties at  
the top and hang from the same trussing used for mounting the lights, on the audience side of the truss.  
● Legs or wings hide off-stage areas and provide passageways for entrances, change and preparation areas,  
and areas for sidelights. Their size and location is usually determined by keeping sight lines in mind.  
They are typically mounted on freestanding pipe and drape hardware as described in Chapter 2.  
● Mid-stage travelers or rear travelers are used as stage dividers to create a smaller space or to hide  
equipment or backdrops near the back wall. They may consist of two panels with a center overlap and  
open to the sides, or, depending on the available space, a traveler may be one panel and travel off stage  
on a curved track to one side. Travelers are usually mounted on a special drapery track \(like household  
drapes\) in turn mounted to trussing that allows them to be opened with rope pulls.  
# 7.4.3 Stage skirting  
One other use of stage draping is for skirting stages. Although most staging manufacturers sell matching  
skirting that is clipped onto the stage surface or attached by Velcro, some designers choose to match other  
décor by customizing skirting in a specific color or style. For this, they will generally use lightweight  
material and clip it or staple it onto the stage. Of course, drapery used as backdrops or wings can be further  
enhanced with lighting or decorations that can be hung from it or over it, such as signs, A-V screens, and  
other material, fabrics, and objects.  
Figure 7.10 illustrates a stage backdrop drape, drapery wing masking curtains, and stage skirting.  
# 7.4.4 Front curtains  
In special events, due to the temporary nature of the installation and to the fact that front drapes are  
traditionally very heavy and cumbersome to maneuver and install, they are seldom used unless the event  
is being held in a theater. However, there are two types of curtains that may be used for short-term events\:  
● Portable stage and drape system. Some companies are making portable, multi-contour front drape  
systems that can be installed in temporary situations but that resemble full theater draping. The Sico  
Insta-Theatre® \(www.sicoinc.com/portable\_theater.php\), for example, is actually a complete portable **274** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 7.10** General locations and names of stage drape components

stage setup with staging, lighting, and support trussing, drape backdrop, wings, front truss border, and  
draw-style front curtain.  
● Kabuki drop. “The Kabuki drop is a special effect in which a lightweight fabric \[usually rigged at or near  
the front of the stage\] is dropped swiftly from above to conceal or reveal a product, space, or performers  
. . . \[Most systems are capable of both single and double kabuki effects.\] The single Kabuki consists of  
either a concealing curtain dropping in, or a revealing curtain dropping to the floor. The double Kabuki  
is a two-step process which begins with the curtain stored above, out of sight. The first trip releases the  
curtain into its concealing position. A second trip releases the curtain to the floor for the reveal” \(Rose  
Brand Inc., 2014\).  
# 7.5 Stage sets and set design  
In Chapter 2 on Décor, we briefly discussed the use of sets as part of themed décor in a venue, which may  
have been stand-alone large set pieces or pieces used on a stage. These would not have been custom  
designed for the event but would have been existing set pieces available for rental from a prop house or Staging and set design **275**  
décor provider. In this chapter, we deal with the use of stage sets custom-designed specifically for a given  
event. Typical events at which these are used are product launches, sales meetings, incentive meetings,  
awards ceremonies, and association meeting general sessions. In these types of events, the stage and the  
set are the main, and probably only, focal point in the venue. Often the set and the stage are left in place  
for the duration of a meeting, which could be up to a week or so. Thus, they have to be attractive, durable,  
and versatile enough to be easily changed in a small way to create a new “look” for different sessions. Let  
us now examine the key considerations in achieving effective set design.  
# 7.5.1 Design procedure and criteria  
The design process typically begins with meetings among the client, set designer, and event producer to  
lay out the general goals of the design. Unlike a theater set design for which the goals are to establish a  
time and place, as well as the mood and spirit of a play, the goals of a corporate set design are invariably  
to reinforce the goals of the event itself and to deliver or emphasize a message. For example, it may require  
a futuristic design to reinforce a sales meeting’s theme of “Selling Effectively in the 21st Century.” It may  
require a giant three-dimensional representation of a company logo in the corporate colors to help motivate  
a group of employees on an incentive trip. It may require a series of framed screens that allow for the  
playback of video clips and winners at an awards show. Whatever the client’s goal, the set designer must  
have a clear understanding of it before proceeding.  
In addition to establishing the goals of the design, these meetings should also determine what will be  
happening onstage \(e.g. who and what will move on and off stage, and from and to where that movement  
will be\), the exact location of the event \(e.g. what room in what venue\), how long the setup time will be,  
and what the budget will be. With this, the designer can further proceed to the initial design phase. In this  
phase, the designer will\:  
● establish the size and shape of the set in relation to the stage size and to the location of the stage in the  
venue \(often requiring one or more visits to the venue to take measurements\);  
● locate entrances and exits to the stage, such as doors, ramps, stairs, or arches, being aware of audience  
sight lines so that no backstage or unnecessary areas are visible to the audience;  
● create a color palette and texture for the general background;  
● add logos, graphics, or openings for visual presentations to the set;  
● determine the number and location of scenic pieces or additional props if needed;  
● draft a ground or floor plan \(top view\), front elevation \(front view\), plus possibly an end or side elevation  
\(from the side of the stage\) of the set either by hand or by CADD;  
● develop a colored rendering by hand or using CADD.  
At some point in this process, the designer and producer will probably consult with the lighting company  
to ensure that appropriate colors and luminaires will be used to correctly light the set, and also to determine  
exactly where the luminaires are best placed and/or rigged. Occasionally, the designer may build a  
miniature three-dimensional model, although this tends to happen more in theater than in special events  
where time and budget are very limited. With possibly some iterations following until the exact design is  
found, the next step is for construction of the set, which the set designer has the responsibility to supervise.  
# 7.5.2 construction and installation of the set  
The set designer may or may not be the same person or the same company as the set builder. However,  
once the design is approved, the set must be built. Unlike theater, corporate event sets are usually stationary  
and are built of any one or more of the following structural components\: **276** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
● Flats. Flats are lightweight panels attached to frames made of wood or steel tubing and are used to make  
two-dimensional, painted scenery. They are normally covered with Muslin, plywood, door skin \(1/8 in.  
thick wood paneling\), paper, Masonite, velour, or other fabrics and materials. They vary in size from  
about 2 to 6 ft \(0.6 to 2 m\) in width, and 8 to 16 ft \(2 to 5 m\) in height. The frames are normally  
constructed of 1 in. x 3 in. \(2.5 cm x 7.5 cm\) wooden sections. For large sets, flats are screwed or hinged  
together. Often they are painted in perspective or with other trompe l’oeil to give the impression of three-  
dimensional objects. They are often anchored to the stage floor with wooden braces, held up with a  
combination of braces and weights such as sandbags, or braced with small L-shaped metal feet \(brackets\)  
on each side to make them freestanding.  
● Cutouts or silhouette flats. A cutout is a piece of thin wood or other firm material that is cut to represent  
an exterior outline of an object. It may be used on its own or attached to a flat frame; for example, a flat  
representing the edge of a forest might have a straight edge \(the flat\) along a tree trunk and then a  
cutout representing leaves higher up where the foliage begins.  
● Platforms. These are used to add levels to stages, whether a few steps up or a higher level representing  
a different location, and are made out of wood with construction that is similar to, but sturdier than,  
flats.  
● Murals, scrims, and cycloramas. Murals are discussed in Chapter 2 and scrims and cycs in Section 7.4.1  
above. They are more often used to augment a theme when onstage rather than convey a corporate  
message.  
● Projections. Projections have been used increasingly as integral parts of set designs. For corporate  
sets, projections might be still images, like PowerPoint, or moving images shot on video or film. They  
are typically projected onto a screen surface designed and built into the set. They are discussed in  
Chapter 4.  
Before installation, each flat or individual section of the set is constructed first. The set is then brought in  
section by section and screwed together. Final paint touchups may be required after construction and often  
time must be allowed for final painting to dry.  
Figure 7.11 shows two examples of finished stage sets. Of interest in the left image are the simplicity and  
symmetry of the set. Note also the repeated cutout flats on each side covered with stretched fabric, and  
also the small props decorating the front of the lectern and the back wall. The right image illustrates several  
elements\: a custom stage shape, unique curved flats that dramatically frame the set, several entrance and

exit stairs from backstage and from the audience, and two large, curved projection screens placed  
symmetrically on either side of the stage and acting as part of the actual set.  
# 7.6 risk and safety  
Because staging supports people—and sometimes automobiles and other heavy inanimate objects—of  
critical importance is the safe allowable loading for a given stage. Too many event producers and event  
managers are unaware of the fact that there are currently no North American standards for allowable  
loading. Why is this important? Consider the fact that, in the last ten years, at least 15 temporary stages  
have collapsed at special events in various countries around the world, and these were not roof structure  
collapses, which we will discuss in Chapter 9, but the actual stage decking. In many of these incidents,  
people were injured. Event producers must be aware of the allowable loading for any given stage design,  
and since there are no standards, it makes this point even more important because, as part of proper risk  
management, the stage provider, whether it is a venue or a subcontracted staging company, should be able  
to provide producers with the deck manufacturer’s figures for safe loading limits. In the case of customized  
staging, the builder should have made proper calculations or should provide proper calculations from a  
certified structural engineer to prove that the staging will be adequate for the loads anticipated. These  
limits should state allowable loads of several types\:  
● Uniformly distributed loads \(UDL\). Also called the maximum allowed load, this means how much weight  
the entire deck can support overall. This value decreases as stage height increases.  
● Pointload. This refers to the maximum weight that a single small point on the deck can support \(e.g. a  
car wheel or a truss tower beam\). This is often where problems occur. Typical regulations specify a point  
loading of 7 kN \(kiloNewtons\) for a “point” measuring 50 mm x 50 mm \(i.e. 2 in. x 2 in.\). In North  
American engineering terms, this load translates into just over 400 psi \(pounds per square inch\). Of  
course the upper limit to a pointload will be the UDL if the area of loading is greater than 4 in.2 \(2,500  
mm2\). Note that pointloads are different and usually less over the center portion of a deck than over  
the edge or corners where there are supporting beams.  
● Lateral forces. These forces occur due to movement on the stage such as dancing or jumping people,  
and moving set pieces, and also by force applied to protective handrails \(e.g. someone falling against  
it\). Regulations usually require a deck to be able to absorb 10 percent of the vertical loading on the  
horizontal plane. In other words, if the deck is stressed to support 4,000 lb UDL, then the allowable  
lateral force should be 400 lb. Put another way, if there are four supporting legs and the deck is stressed  
to 4,000 lb, each leg supports 1,000 lb of vertical force and must also support 10 percent of that or 100  
lb in lateral force before collapsing.  
The only known standards for recommended allowable stage loading \(including guardrails\) are\:  
● EN 13814\: Fairground and amusement park machinery and structures – Safety \(2004\) incorporates DIN 4112\:  
Temporary structures\: code of practice for design and construction, originally from Germany. It also applies to  
some other EU countries, as the name EN \(Euro Norm\) would suggest.  
● Temporary demountable structures. Guidance on procurement, design and use. \(Third Edition\) \(2007\), in the UK.  
● DIN 15920-11\: Entertainment Technology – Practical Types – Part 11\: Safety Regulations for Wooden Practicals,  
Ramps, Steps, Stairs and Stage Balustrades \(2011\). This standard, once again from Germany, provides  
structural and safety standards for the construction of ramps, railings, and stairs.  
The result of not having design safety standards is that staging is not manufactured to consistent load  
ratings, which means that one manufacturer’s staging may not be as strong as another’s. This may lead  
producers to make erroneous assumptions about the strength of a stage and/or its options \(e.g. guardrails\).  
Otherwise, for North America, the safety standards that pertain to workers using or building staging are **278** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
encompassed by the OSHA and WCB \(Workers’ Compensation Board\) standards in the United States and  
Canada respectively, copies of which should be in the possession of all producers.

Ever since humans developed to the point where they were able to construct their own shelters, they have  
sought to tame nature. Nomadic peoples were undoubtedly the first to realize that it would be more  
efficient to create a portable house that required less construction than a permanent one every time they  
decided to stop on their journeys. Their crude attempts at such shelters were the first known predecessors  
of today’s spectacular tented environments. Over the intervening millennia, tents have appeared in every  
conceivable situation, and today they enable special events to take place in locations that would have  
previously been inaccessible.  
In this chapter we will explore the use of tents in special events, starting with why they are used  
today. We will then explain and illustrate the different styles of modern tents used in events, includ-  
ing a look at the latest technology. Following this is an in-depth explanation of fabrics and accessories,  
followed by a review of setup considerations. We end with a review of risk and safety as it pertains  
to tenting. **280** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
# 8.1 Why use a tent for a special event?  
In Chapter 1 of Special Event Production\: The Process, we examined the underlying reasons why special events  
are held\: political, religious, educational, social, and commercial. These, however, are not necessarily the  
same reasons why one would choose to use a tent for a special event in today’s world. In essence, a tent  
is an alternative venue, nothing more, nothing less, but one with very special characteristics that sometimes  
make it more attractive than a traditional venue such as a conference center, a hotel, or another permanent  
structure. Because so many of today’s special event attendees have used traditional venues on a regular  
basis, they are looking to escape to a unique venue that takes advantage of the geography of the local area.  
Tents afford them the opportunity to do this, often enabling an event to take place in a locale where no  
buildings exist but that is an attractive setting in itself. Additionally, some destinations do not have  
facilities of sufficient size to accommodate larger groups and a tent may provide the only alternative for an  
event. In forming additional space, a tent can be placed closer to key activities that require support  
structures to enable them to take place at all. Examples are the large temporary tented corporate pavilions  
at air shows \(e.g. Paris and Farnborough Air Shows\) and automobile races.  
As a blank canvas, a tent starts with plain bare walls, ceiling, and floor. It therefore permits designers to  
transform it into a unique environment with décor and lighting, and even to design complete interiors as  
full working offices, restaurants, clubs, warehouses, and other unique uses such as prisons. The other  
primary advantage of tents is that they can expand or contract to the required area relatively rapidly and  
relatively cheaply when compared with more permanent structures.  
# 8.2 Styles and configurations of tents  
The Tent Rental Division of the Industrial Fabrics Association International \(IFAI\) defines a tent as  
“a temporary structure composed of a covering made of a pliable membrane or fabric, supported by such  
mechanical means as poles, metal frames, beams, columns, arches, ropes and/or cables” \(IFAI, 2015a\).  
The word “tent” is sometimes used interchangeably with “pavilion” and “canopy,” though a “canopy” can  
also refer to a tent without sidewalls, a small tent, or even an awning-like structure. In the UK and  
Australia, the term “marquee” is synonymous with the North American definition of “tent” \(meaning a  
variety of styles and sizes\) whereas a “tent” there is typically a small camping tent. A “marquee” in the  
United States, however, refers to a very specific hybrid style of tent as explained in Section 8.2.2. Indeed,  
tent styles are constantly changing and improving—generally meaning more user-friendly and practical—as  
tented events become more popular.  
# 8.2.1 traditional tent styles  
The explanations of the following four basic styles of tents are provided by the Industrial Fabrics Association  
International \(IFAI, 2015b\), and are used with permission. They are generic in nature and do not constitute  
an endorsement of a particular tent type, brand, or company.  
● Pole-supported tent. This is “a tent that features a set of individual poles arranged beneath the fabric  
roof to support and define the shape of the structure. The fabric roof is tensioned over the poles  
and attached to ropes and/or cables at designated spots around the fabric’s edges. The ropes or cables  
are anchored to the ground using stakes, augers, or weights around the perimeter of the tent. Pole-  
supported tents are the grandfather of the tent industry, and were once the only type of tent available.  
Although they have lost ground to newer designs, pole-supported tents remain popular in the United  
States and are still considered an important part of most tent rental inventories.”  
● Pipe frame-supported tent. This is “a tent with an assembled framework made of aluminum or steel  
pipes that supports the fabric roof and defines the shape of the structure \[and consequently the roof Tenting **281**  
line is usually more rigid and straight than that of a pole tent\]. The rigid framework allows the tent to  
be freestanding without additional support, but requires the same rope or cable anchoring system  
as a pole-supported tent to hold it in place, as specified by applicable fire or building codes. Pipe  
frame-supported tents are popular for events that require smaller tents. Most manufacturers make  
units as small as 10 ft x 10 ft \(3 m x 3 m\) that are easy to set up and tear down. They are also  
suitable for smaller events that require few, if any interior obstruction since the frame system  
makes interior supports unnecessary. Pipe frame-supported tents are available in a wide variety of styles  
and sizes.”  
● Box-beam frame-supported \(clearspan\) tent. This is “a type of tent that features an assembled framework  
of box beam \(or I-beam\) arches that support the fabric roof and define the shape of the structure in  
much the same way as a pipe frame-supported tent. The stronger construction of the aluminum or  
steelbox-beam frame makes these tents suitable for larger or longer-term applications than other types  
of tents. The box-beam framework also allows for large areas of unobstructed “clear span” space beneath  
the fabric roof. The larger structures require heavy equipment because of the size and weight of their  
parts. Popular in Europe, these tents come in widths ranging from 5–60 m \[16–200 ft\] wide.”  
● Tensile tent. This is “a type of tent that shares some characteristics with the pole-supported tent, but  
which relies more on the tensioning of the fabric roof \[over movable poles\] for its structural integrity  
and shape. The use of tensioned fabric to resist applied loads and shape the fabric membrane means  
less of a traditional support structure is needed to maintain it. One of the more modern tent designs,  
tensile tents tend to be more curvilinear and sculpted in appearance than traditional tents. This type of  
tent can be mass-produced or custom-designed as needed.” The concept for the tensile tent has been  
around for centuries in the form of the Bedouin tent used by the Middle-Eastern nomads of the same  
name.  
Figure 8.1 illustrates these basic styles.

# 8.2.2 hybrid and unique tent styles  
Increased client demand and manufacturers’ ingenuity have led to the development of some  
fascinating hybrid tent styles and some unique approaches to the idea of temporary shelter for  
special events\:  
● Peak tent. Depending on the manufacturer and country of origin, this extremely popular style of tent  
may also be called a marquee or pagoda. It is a hybrid that combines the smoothly curved, peak roof  
feature of a pole tent with the structure of a frame tent so that there are no obstructing internal poles  
supporting the roof. Most of these styles use a design of taut, structural cables that cross from the top  
corners of the walls to support vertical poles above them that form the roof’s shape, so that in a sense,  
they are also part tensile tents. They may require anchoring guy wires under some conditions. Footprints  
include square, rectangular, hexagonal, octagonal, and more, and all manufacturers design them to be  
erected as multiple joined units if desired. These are not to be confused with high peak pole tents, which  
are just large versions of the traditional pole tent.  
● Pop-up tent. Pop-ups are small, generally consumer tents at the lower end of special event tents. They  
are essentially frame tents but the frame that forms the roof is collapsible and comes as a single  
unit. The top is stretched over it and expandable poles attached at the corners. Different manufacturers  
make them slightly differently and may call them by different names \(e.g. the Bumbershoot & Presto!™  
Party Tent from Tentnology\). They may or may not require anchoring depending on the location, use,  
and design.  
● Saddlespan™ tent. Depending on the manufacturer, this style may also be called Arabesque™. This type  
of design is a unique form of clearspan tent that is in the shape of a saddle and supported by only  
two points on the ground in addition to guy wires. Specially shaped trussing forms the roof shape  
over which the roof material is stretched. These tents are designed such that multiple units can be  
joined together for very unique looks. They are also well designed acoustically and frequently used as  
stage backdrops.  
● Dome tent. A dome tent is based on the geodesic dome concept, which is “a spherical or partial-spherical  
shell structure or lattice shell based on a network of great circles \(geodesics\) on the surface of a sphere.  
The geodesics intersect to form triangular elements that have local triangular rigidity and also distribute  
the stress across the structure. When completed to form a complete sphere, it is a geodesic sphere”  
\(Geodesic dome, 2014\). For dome tents, the triangular elements \(struts\) are constructed of steel and  
are assembled from the top down to the bottom. Particular struts are joined with one screw into five-  
and six-armed joints or knots. \(Occasionally these struts are located on the outside of the dome with  
different manufacturers.\) The covering membrane is usually PVC polyester but other materials are  
available, as are transparent panels. A unique floor system enables mounting of the dome structure to  
the ground with steel pegs or with ballast weights located beneath the surface of the floor, which  
eliminates the need for external support. Tunnels designed with the same geodesic principle can be used  
to attach domes to each other, giving them a similar appearance to igloos. The strength of the frame  
design of the dome allows audio and lighting to be flown from it. Current dome tent sizes can be up to  
700 m2 \(7,600 ft2\) with a 30 m \(100 ft\) diameter and 15 m \(50 ft\) height. This specific size can  
accommodate 500 persons at a seated dinner. Note that these sizes are from Freedomes, at http\://

Another form of dome tent is a combination of frame and tensile tents, but is really just a variation of  
the peak tent. A domed roof shape is formed with curved aluminum poles that create the frame, over  
which the roof is stretched. Tenting **283**

# It just kept coming!  
A tented event was being held for 400 of a university’s top donors. With one eye on the weather  
\(a rain storm was predicted\), we proceeded to install all the elements necessary for a first-class  
event, including a fireworks finale.  
Due to the extreme heat that day, the decision had been made to increase the air-conditioning.  
Our logistics manager notified us only a few hours before the event that the main generator  
had failed, and it was necessary to bring in a replacement. Before the failed generator could  
be removed, smoke started pouring out of it. The smoke quickly turned to fire. Within seconds,  
our logistics manager was on the phone to 911. The production assistants evacuated the tents.  
Our executive producer called the client to inform her of the situation. A call was then placed  
from our office to the communications department. Because of the high-profile nature of this  
event, the press would most likely be on their way! Our office got in contact immediately with the  
client’s press office to strategize. The technical director and stage managers were sent to another  
space for script read-throughs. It was vital to maintain focus on the production aspects of the event  
scheduled to kick off only three hours later!  
Within 8 min the fire department and police were on the scene. Within 20 min the fire was largely  
put out and the immediate danger was over. Unfortunately, a new wrinkle appeared. A diesel fuel  
leak was discovered to be pouring into the ground underneath the catering tent. HAZmat tech-  
nicians took toxicity readings and concluded that the catering tent must be shut down. Hearing  
this, the president of the university determined the event should be canceled. We asked for a  
little more time to come up with a solution. With our rain plan in place, we had already erected  
a marquee tent for guest coverage as they walked to the main tent from the valet area. We  
enlisted the help of a 15-man crew to lift and carry it to the opposite side of the main tent onto  
a patio overlooking the campus fountain. Our original plan called for a fireworks finale to be  
staged there. However, with the diesel leak, that part of the program was canceled for safety  
reasons and catering was able to move to the newly established location. At 4\:20 pm, with 75 min  
until show time, the main tent was given a clean bill of health, catering and technical staff were  
brought back to complete the setup, the new generator had arrived, and all technical equipment  
was back on-line.  
At 4\:45 pm, the storm, our original worry, hit with a vengeance. Severe thunder, lightning, and a  
heavy downpour lasted for nearly 20 min. All workers were told once again to evacuate the tent.  
At 5\:05 pm, the storm cleared. Those who had evacuated returned. At 5\:30 pm the first guest  
arrived and cocktails were served as we wrapped up rehearsals in the main tent. The event was a  
success. Our entire production team, led by the executive producer, maintained focus and pulled  
off the show beautifully \(minus the fireworks\). The caterer was able to serve from the new location  
and the press stories were controlled.  
We credit this success to several things\: keeping cool no matter what; placing the safety of others  
first; respecting the authority of safety organizations and working with them as partners; and  
ultimately, being confident that there is always a solution!

● Yurt. Uncommon in North America but popular in Asia, the round yurt is “a portable, bent dwelling  
structure traditionally used by nomads in the steppes of Central Asia as their home. The structure  
comprises a \[wooden\] crown or compression wheel, usually steam bent, supported by roof ribs which  
are bent down at the end where they meet the lattice wall \(again, steam bent\). The top of the wall is  
prevented from spreading by means of a tension band which opposes the force of the roof ribs. The  
structure is usually covered by layers of fabric and sheep’s wool felt for insulation and weatherproofing”  
\(Yurt, 2014\). Although the yurts used in North America tend to be for semi-permanent installation as  
wilderness or camping lodges because of the length of time required to erect them, some are beginning  
to enter the more temporary special event market. These are still relatively small as event tents go, the  
largest currently being about 33 ft \(10 m\) in diameter and capable of seating about 90+ persons for a  
dinner, these figures coming from Little Foot Yurts \(www.lfy.ca\). This tent would take two days to set  
up, smaller ones a day, because structurally they are the same as the traditional yurts and just as strong,  
requiring no external support or anchoring. Covering for these is usually canvas.  
● Tipi. Both the yurt and tipi are currently most popular in the wedding market but it is surely only a  
matter of time before they expand to the corporate arena. The tipi—or Nordic kata—is constructed with  
large, straight wooden poles vertically angled in a circle and supported together at their tops to form  
the framework for a large, high conical tent structure. Most current tipis are covered with canvas and  
have expandable bottom sections. In some of the larger ones, up to 50 guests can be seated for a dinner.  
Another similar tent, the alachigh, is also round but formed out of curved poles rather than straight ones  
as in a tipi so that the final shape is more like a slice of a sphere. Originating in Iran, it is basically a  
cross between a yurt and a tipi. This type of tent has not yet achieved much popularity for special events  
but has great potential.  
● Inflatable tent. Relatively new is a variety of inflatable tents, which are not included in the IFAI  
definitions of tent styles. These seem to be almost exclusively manufactured in China, and are adaptable  
to most of the same uses as regular tents. However, they must be connected to a constant flow of air by  
means of a fan. These inflatables offer several advantages, including easy erection and dismantling, the  
fact that they are all clearspan, and their low cost. They also lend themselves to easy customization with  
color and graphics. Stability under wind loads, fire-retardant capabilities, air fan/pump requirements,  
and anchoring methods for these tents are as yet untested and unknown, although most offer optional  
guy wire anchoring. They are made of PVC tarpaulin material and come in a variety of sizes and shapes  
that somewhat mirror the more traditional tents already described.  
Figure 8.2 illustrates these hybrid and unique styles \(except the pop-up and alachigh\).  
# 8.2.3 modern tent technology  
Tent manufacturers have risen to the challenge of making tents as versatile and adaptable as possible.  
Materials have improved. More size options are available. Likewise, the variety of configurations available  
and the modularity of event tents allow them to be used almost anywhere, both indoors and out, and for  
almost any number of attendees. Let us examine what makes them so versatile and how best to take  
advantage of this versatility\:  
● Materials. It all starts with the material of the tent cover. The primary fabric for tents is a vinyl-laminated  
polyester, but a small percentage of use is still seen for canvas. The newer polyester fabrics are more  
durable and resistant to weather effects, including water and sunlight damage. All fabrics are treated  
with flame-retardants.  
Most event tent sidewalls \(pieces of fabric generally attached to the roof structure and used to enclose  
the sides of tents\) are made of lighter-weight vinyl-laminated polyester. They—and the roof structure—  
can be designed with clear vinyl as windows, and can be as large as the entire tent if desired, although Tenting **285**

with less strength and durability. However, now walls are also offered in hard material \(composites\)  
and real windows instead of fabric.  
● Sizing. Tented events have to be comfortable, and overcrowding is one of the serious errors that a  
producer can commit. Before expanding a tented event with different modules—or with a tent that is,  
conversely, too large—the first order of business is to determine the minimum size of basic tent\(s\)  
required. Depending on the type of event, what follows are some general guidelines and area allowances  
for doing this. These are also useful for planning indoor events. **286** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
● Stand-up reception or cocktail party. 6 ft² \(0.5 m2\) per person.  
● Sit-down dinner. 10–12 ft² \(0.9–1.1 m2\) per person, depending on whether the tables seat ten or eight  
persons respectively.  
● Buffet table or bar. 100 ft² \(9 m2\) per 8 ft \(2.4 m\) long table/bar.  
● Auditorium or theater-style seating. 6 ft² \(0.5 m2\) per person plus 4–6 ft \(1.2–1.8 m\) width for aisles.  
● Dance floor. 2–3 ft² \(0.2–0.3 m2\) per person, assuming 50 percent of guests are dancing at any given  
time.  
● Speaker stage or platform. 10 ft² \(0.9 m2\) per person.  
● Bandstand. The allowances required for musical groups are outlined in Section 7.3.1 of Chapter 7  
and may also be used for calculating tent sizes when such groups are planned to be within the tent.  
Obviously, for more complicated events such as trade shows, more specific measurements would have  
to be made.  
● Configurations and modularity. We have already seen how new styles have entered the market, many  
based on cultural influences \(e.g. tipi, yurt, tensile\). Astute manufacturers are making tents in a variety  
of new styles and sizes, and enabling them to mix and mingle. This means that a row of peak tents might  
very well be mixed with a couple of dome tents and even a large clearspan or tensile tent—and they will  
all look coordinated. Not only that, but manufacturers are adding components that enable very creative  
configurations, or temporary structure systems as one manufacturer, Höcker, calls them. Curved tent  
sections, partial sections \(e.g. half hexagons\), adjoining walkways, roof extensions and wings, and  
different roof shapes for the same tent \(e.g. curved, peak, A-frame\) that can also be joined together all  
increase versatility.  
Sizes are going out and up. First, in footprint anything goes. For clearspan tents, for example, size is  
limited only by width. Most large tent manufacturers make their clearspans in variable widths \(e.g.  
10–60 m, or 30–200 ft\) and sidewall heights \(e.g. 2.4–6.0 m, or 8–20 ft\). However, the modularity allows  
for unlimited lengths. Inside, the height at the apex of some of these behemoths is amazing, up to  
14 m \(46 ft\), and for some specialty tents such as the Galaxy tent from De Boer, an incredible 26 m  
\(almost 85 ft\) at its highest point. In fact, that particular tent is 60 m \(195 ft\) wide by 107 m \(almost  
350 ft\) long, dimensions that make it as big as a football field. This is enough space to accommodate  
4,000 to 10,000 guests.  
Not only are the structures expanding in the two horizontal dimensions, they are also expanding  
upwards. Tents are now available in multiple levels. Two- and three-storey tents are used frequently at  
large sporting events and trade shows. Features and options include internal and external stairways,  
various configurations of covered and uncovered terraces and balconies, picket fencing, railings, doors,  
and signage systems. See Figure 8.3.  
The very large tents, though, are not erected manually. Although portable, they do require large cranes  
to lift sections into place, and sometimes can take a day or more to fully set up.  
● Graphics and colors. Tents provide a blank canvas. Indeed, what better canvas for branding a corporate  
image than a huge blank white surface in often highly visible locations? Many companies have realized  
the possible marketing opportunities this presents and are attaching signage to the sides, ends, and tops  
of tent structures. According to Knight \(2005, pp. 173–177\), graphics are also being printed right onto  
tent fabrics, thanks to wide format digital printers\: “Graphics do not stop on the outside of the tent  
either. Interiors utilize extensive graphic merchandising displays, colorful murals, and pop-up displays  
to reinforce brand awareness . . . For special events on a smaller budget, mass-produced graphic  
backdrops can be affixed onto tent sidewalls.” To add to these options, more tents are appearing with  
a rainbow of possible colors. See Figure 8.3. Tenting **287**

International BV, www.deboer.com  
One area that has to date seen minimal influence is cross-cultural. Certainly, the influence of  
other cultures in basic tent shapes is beginning to be seen in such designs as yurts, domes, and an  
increasing variety of stretch tents. However, when it comes to purely decorating the outside and inside  
of the actual tent walls and roofs with culturally influenced graphics, there has been little seen, at least  
in North America and Europe. Specific examples here include the beautiful designs of Indian and Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**288** Kazakhstan tents, and the near works of art of Tibetan tents. Perhaps it will only be a matter of time.  
See Figure 8.3.  
# 8.3 tent accessories and options  
In keeping with the requirement for a tented environment to be as comfortable as possible, today’s tents  
offer options for styles and accessories that will make a tented event equivalent to a classy hotel ballroom.  
# 8.3.1 tops  
Although traditional white is still the norm for most tent tops, various colors and stripes are now making  
their way into the market in all tent sizes. For all sizes of tents, a clear top is now an option almost  
universally. Because of the vinyl used, clear tops are not as strong as regular material.  
# 8.3.2 Sidewalls  
Most tents come with optional sidewalls, which can be installed for weather protection. These can be plain  
white fabric \(or any color nowadays\), clear vinyl, clear French windows, screen, mesh, real glass, or rigid  
PVC. The degree of elegance, fire resistance, or security is up to the user. Manufacturers each have their  
own method of fastening fabric walls to frames, but most methods involve some sort of strap system.  
However, for larger tents, a relatively new method of attachment of walls and ceilings to tent frames is  
known as a keder system. In essence, this system allows walls and ceiling components to slide into frame  
rails rather than lacing up, thus saving considerable setup time and improving tent stability. For hard walls,  
some manufacturers offer complete interchangeability between hard walls, glass walls, and doors.  
# 8.3.3 gutters  
Most tents have optional gutter systems to prevent rain damage. Depending on the tent design,  
these come in vinyl and lace to the tent frame and some are hard plastic complete with plastic downspouts.  
# 8.3.4 Doors  
As with walls, fitted doors can be provided to have a finished look that works with the remainder of the  
tent, or they can be customized. Doors can be single or double, and they can have panic hardware installed.  
All doors should conform to the code standards for tents, including tempered glass inserts or French panes  
that may be placed in them. Smoked glass and sliding doors are also available options from some rental  
companies.  
# 8.3.5 lighting  
Standard tent lighting is usually achieved with bowl or globe lights made of PVC resin. They come as single  
units or as multiples in the form of simple chandeliers, and are used mostly for social events. Other  
industrial-style lights that use mercury vapor or halogen technology and are very bright are used more for  
trade shows and general lighting of larger areas. Generally, all styles are able to be mounted from tent  
frame components and also come as freestanding units. More elaborate chandeliers are available from some  
rental companies as well as string lights. Theatrical lighting is used extensively for tented events \(see  
Chapter 5\), but is normally designed and installed by a lighting company.  
Not to be forgotten is site lighting. Tents are often set up in unlit locations and if the event will extend  
past sunset, it will be necessary to light all access walkways, washroom areas, and paths connecting tents. Tenting **289**  
As with the inside of tents, industrial-type lights can be used on poles and connected to portable power  
generators, or lighted helium globes can be used. These are large tethered helium balloons with lights  
inside that float high over a site thus covering a large area.  
# 8.3.6 liners  
According to Tracey \(2005, pp. 33–34\)\:  
liners beautify tent interiors and mask a multitude of sins, including tent mechanics, wiring, out-  
dated lighting, and soiled tent tops. The tent liner, in effect, acts as a drop ceiling .  
.  
. Leg \[and  
pole\] drapes can be added to the tent in blouse or tailored styles to match the look of the ceiling  
liner .  
.  
. Liners offer other practical benefits. They help mitigate outdoor temperature fluctuations,  
so less power is needed to heat or cool the structure. The liner provides a sandwich of air between it  
and the tent that acts as a blanket of insulation .  
.  
. Liners are offered in pleated and smooth styles.  
Commonly used materials include taffeta polyester, muslin, duvateen, or any flameproof fabric.  
Liners also come in white, black, and up to 50 or more other colors. Most liners are installed and hoisted  
to the ceiling using a rope and pulley system, then affixed to the tent frame using hooks and tabs. Some  
are both functional and highly decorative.  
# 8.3.7 Flooring  
Today’s tent flooring comes in a multitude of options. For most special event applications, if there is any  
doubt whatsoever about weather conditions or if the event is being held on anything but the very firmest  
and flattest of surfaces, proper flooring should be a consideration. The use of flooring has the advantage of  
preventing water from accumulating on top of the walking surface by providing a path for drainage  
underneath it. As well, it provides a level, obstacle-free, and thus safer, surface. The two general categories  
of flooring are laydown and rollout. Laydown floors can be either stick-built or paneled. “Stick-built” refers to  
the now almost obsolete method of building a wooden floor using custom lumber construction to a specified  
height and over any obstacles. It has been replaced by plywood panel systems combined with adjustable  
aluminum legs that enable large areas to be covered even when the ground is uneven, thanks to the vertical  
adjustability of the legs. Some companies even have flooring systems that connect directly onto integrated  
base plates \(e.g. Röder HTS Höcker GmbH\), ensuring extra stability. A number of manufacturers also  
provide flat, interlocking plastic panels that are best used directly over paved or cement surfaces. These  
panels can be installed at roughly half the cost of plywood panels and much faster. Built into them are  
drainage channels and their modularity permits installation around trees, obstacles, or existing structures.  
They come in several colors. Most are extremely durable and strong enough for vehicular traffic.  
Similar to rigid plastic paneling is the first of the “rollout” options, hinged plastic panels. They literally  
come in rolls and roll out directly onto the ground, eliminating the intermediate step of physically having  
to interlock individual panels. The last type of flooring, and one that needs a dry flat surface to begin with,  
is carpeting. This is normally placed on top of pre-built flooring such as wooden or plastic paneling, or  
directly on top of pavement or concrete, as long as wet weather is not anticipated, to give a more elegant  
and finished appearance.  
See Figure 8.4 for a general illustration of tent accessories.  
# 8.3.8 heating, ventilation, and air conditioning \(hvac\)  
Correctly and adequately heating or cooling a tent is more complex than one might imagine at first glance.  
Prediction of the air conditioning load \(in tons \[t\]\) or heating load \(usually in British Thermal Units per hour **290** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 8.4** Tent accessories  
Image supplied by Röder Hts HöCker GmbH  
\[BTU/h\]\) requirement is based on several factors, including\: tent size \(volume\), number of persons in the  
tent, the thermal resistance \(i.e. insulation\) of the tent fabric, number of openings in the tent, the temperature  
difference between the desired internal tent temperature and the outside ambient temperature, wind speed,  
and even the number of luminaires in the tent. The results of combining these variables will determine the  
number of heating or cooling units required to meet the desired inside temperature for the entire tent. Most  
rental companies will have software or charts that accurately predict the load based on these variable  
parameters. However, to start with, it is useful to know the following \(these are only in Imperial units\)\:  
● 1 t of air conditioning equals 12,000 BTU/h.  
● One person adds 350 BTU/h of heat.  
● 1 W of lighting adds 3.5 BTU/h of heat.  
● 1 BTU/h equals 0.00029307111111 kW.  
To make this easier to understand, let’s look at an example \(also in Imperial units\) of a tent being used for  
an event in both winter and summer. We start with some necessary parameters. First, the client wishes to  
maintain a temperature inside the tent of 70º F no matter what the season. The dimensions of the tent are  
100 ft long x 50 ft wide. There will be 100 guests attending the event and it is expected that 5,000 W of  
lighting will be used. There will also be a 5 mph wind predicted and for the winter event the outside  
temperature will be 40º F, for the summer event 100º F. How much air conditioning or heating is required?  
First, we calculate the area of the tent, which is 5,000 ft2 \(100 x 50\). Next, we check the difference in  
temperature, which is 30º F in either winter or summer \(70 – 40, or 100 – 70 respectively\). The next step Tenting **291**  
is to go to a chart based on these parameters. This is what most equipment rental companies will have to  
assist with determining how many units are required. In this case, I will use a sample chart given by Markel  
\(2007\), which states that for these parameters, 95 BTU/ft2 are required. Since the tent is 5,000 ft2, this  
means that 475,000 BTU/h are required for heating \(95 x 5,000\) and approximately 40 t of air conditioning  
for cooling \(475,000/12,000\). However, we are still not finished. Since there are 100 guests, this means  
they are adding 35,000 BTU/h of heat \(100 x 350\), and also the lighting adds another 17,500 BTU/h of  
heat \(5,000 x 3.5\). Thus the total heat in the tent in summer that must be removed in one hour is 527,500  
BTU \(475,000 + 35,000 + 17,500\), and approximately 44 t of air conditioning is needed \(527,500/12,000\).  
Typical special event air conditioning units are rated in tons and come in sizes varying from 1 to 50 t, so  
at least one 50 t unit would be needed or possibly two 25 t units. It should also be noted that it may be  
desirable to use more smaller units placed around the perimeter of the tent in order to achieve better air  
distribution, rather than a single large unit placed at one end of the tent \(O’Dell, 2012\).  
For the winter event, since the people and lighting add heat, the requirement for heating will be 422,000  
BTU/h \(475,000 – 35,000 – 17,500\). Typical special event heaters are rated in BTU/h and come in sizes  
from less than 80,000 BTU/h to over 300,000 BTU/h. Mid-range are in the order of 175,000, so probably  
two 175,000 BTU/h units plus an 85,000 BTU/h unit would cover the heating requirement. Note that this  
is for a heating unit that runs on fuel \(see below\) whereas some models run on electricity as radiant heaters  
and their output is measured in kW. Therefore, using the conversion of earlier, 422,000 BTU/h would  
convert to a radiant heater output of approximately 124 kW. Electric heaters come in sizes varying  
from about 10 kW to 150 kW, so this would require either one 150 kW unit or two 50 kW units and  
one 25 kW unit.  
Before renting an air conditioning or heating unit, however, it is also wise to try to minimize heat loss—or  
cool air loss in summer—by tightening up the actual tent as much as possible. Markel \(2007\) offers some  
suggestions\:  
● Using a keder system of framing.  
● Using hard walls and glass doors and windows.  
● Sealing valances.  
● Using liners.  
● Using units that recirculate already heated or cooled air.  
● For air conditioning, placing outlet vents up high off the floor and return vents at floor level.  
● For heating, placing outlet vents at floor level and return vents higher.  
As far as the actual types of heating and air conditioning units, there are numerous options. For heating,  
there are mainly two options, the first being an electric resistive or radiant heater, and the second being a  
unit that runs on a fuel such as propane, natural gas, diesel, or kerosene. The fuel-powered units are usually  
capable of larger loads. These should be operated outside of the tent. Most local fire departments now  
prohibit the small, mushroom-shaped localized propane heaters and any other types that have the fuel  
source located within the tent, for safety reasons. Depending on size, radiant heaters usually require  
240 V, single-phase or 480 V, three-phase power. Fuel-powered units require 120 or 240 V, single-phase  
or 208 V, three-phase power.  
For air conditioning, besides a simple fan, there are units that operate on a variety of principles, including  
evaporative, refrigeration, and heat sink. As with heating, the units distribute cool treated air—or warm  
air in the case of heaters—via white Dacron ducts hung usually in the tent sidewalls, but sometimes in  
the ceiling. Machines using ducting are positioned outside the tent; however, there are other units that  
can be flush-mounted into the sidewalls and provide cooling via direct exchange of air within the tent  
structure \(these can be noisier than the others due to fan noise\). Air conditioning units, again depending **292** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
on size, have similar power requirements as heaters, with the very smallest ones needing only 120 V power.  
It should be noted that many units can provide both air conditioning and heating, depending on the  
manufacturer.  
Other accessories that may be required for a tented event such as fencing, portable washrooms, and  
temporary power are dealt with in more general terms in Chapter 9 since they also pertain to other areas  
of events besides just tenting.  
# 8.4 Setup considerations  
Planning for an efficient, safe, and accessible tent setup begins long before the event. The main consi-  
derations include the site itself and conducting a site survey, the weather and time of day of the event,  
accessibility and safety concerns and the associated permits, and finally, the plan for installation.  
# 8.4.1 Site and site survey  
Assuming that there is an optimum amount of time before the tented event, the tent rental  
company should be brought into the initial planning stage about six months prior to the event or  
sooner. In conjunction with the producer and/or event manager, they will conduct a site survey  
to determine\:  
● If the site is large enough to hold the tents and all the activities planned, including stages, tables, chairs,  
bars, dance floor, catering preparation tent\(s\), and washrooms.  
● The location of fire hydrants, fire and emergency vehicle access routes, access routes for supplier  
vehicles, existing washroom facilities, and existing power and its specifications. Fire trucks require a  
minimum of a 10 ft \(3 m\) wide access road throughout the site. At this time, tentative plans may also  
be made to augment any emergency services required such as planning for St. John’s Ambulance  
attendants to be onsite, and where they will be located.  
● The tentative location and orientation of all tents, any security fencing or barriers needed, entrances  
and exits to the site, temporary power setup, bus or vehicle drop-off points, and parking.  
● If the ground surface is one into which tent anchors can be safely placed. Many companies will  
test the soil to determine the type of staking required. If the surface is asphalt, gravel, concrete, or  
wood, special anchoring may be needed in the form of weighted blocks of some sort. Occasionally, the  
owners of asphalt surfaces may allow temporary holes as long as they are properly patched after  
the event.  
● If tent anchoring will disrupt unseen underground infrastructure such as telephone, gas, water, sewer,  
and hydro, or if overhead infrastructure will be too close to tents. Any tenting or anchoring must  
generally be at least 18 in. \(45 cm\) away from marked utility lines, and at least 10 ft \(3 m\) away from  
overhead power lines. Utility companies should be contacted at least two weeks before the event to  
mark underground lines. Property owners should also be asked to mark private underground lines such  
as sprinklers.  
● If the surface is level and will not present a problem for catering and seating. An uneven surface may  
require proper leveling and flooring.  
● If ground obstructions \(e.g. shrubbery, fountains, pavement, trees, buildings, etc.\) will get in the way  
of planned tent locations.  
Based on the results of the site survey, a tentative schematic site plan will be drawn up by the tent rental  
company or the producer. See Figure 8.5 for an example of an actual tent site plan that joins together a Tenting **293**

# 8.4.2 Weather and time of day  
The actual date of the event could have an effect on setup. Some climates are prone to rain, some locales  
are very dry and hot, some are windy, and some combine all of the above, not to mention varying lengths  
of daylight at different times of the year. As a result, the producer should know clearly what the likelihood  
is for any of these conditions to exist during the event and also how much daylight will be available without  
supplementing lighting. Here are the main areas of concern\:  
● Rain. In any potentially wet climate, there must be an allowance made for proper drainage, either by  
the use of a certain type of tent \(some provide better run-off than others\), installing sidewalls and  
gutters, or providing portable flooring.  
● Wind. Pole and frame tents can generally withstand winds of up to 30–35 mph \(50–55 km/h or kph\),  
whereas clearspan tents are generally safe in winds up to 70 mph \(115 kph\). If high winds are a  
possibility during the event, the choice of tent may have to be changed. Note that in many municipal  
jurisdictions, the special event department, if there is one, will, by law, require a qualified structural  
engineer to inspect and certify that the tent setup is structurally sound. This may be required in order  
to obtain final approval for the event and may not happen until after all tents are set up, so the correct  
choice of tent is critical ahead of time. **294** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
● Heat or cold. This is always a “what if” scenario, like rain. If any doubt exists at all, one should be  
prepared for the worst in terms of temperature extremes. If the event will go on after sunset, there is a  
good chance the temperature may also go down and the tent will need heat. If it is during a hot summer  
day, it will undoubtedly need air conditioning. As described earlier, all-season heating and cooling units  
may be the answer to wide temperature fluctuations.  
● Darkness. Since planning often begins six or more months before an event, the amount of ambient light  
available for the event may be much more or less than it is during initial planning. As well, sun direction  
may impact the amount of light and heat in a different way than it does at the time of the initial site  
survey. Therefore, light for the event should be anticipated ahead of time and the necessary interior tent  
and exterior site lighting planned using the options mentioned in Section 8.3.5.  
# 8.4.3 installation  
Once permits have been approved and site plans drawn up, the critical step of tent delivery and installation  
takes place. Installation must be done correctly from an engineering point of view or the tent may be  
unsafe. The Tent Rental Division of the Industrial Fabrics Association International has created a manual  
for just this purpose, based on significant research, entitled The IFAI Procedural Handbook for the Safe  
Installation and Maintenance of Tentage \(IFAI, 2014\). It can be obtained from their web site at www.bookstore.  
ifai.com. Essentially, a correct and safe installation involves proper layout and squaring, staking or  
anchoring, and erection and tightening of guy wires. For anything except the very smallest and simplest  
of tents, installation is normally the responsibility of the tent rental company. The explanations that follow  
are primarily for a simple pole tent; however, similar methods are followed for other tent styles, and IFAI  
\(2014\) provides extensive guidelines for those.  
● Layout and squaring. A properly squared tent is aesthetically pleasing and is more structurally  
sound. The purpose of the layout is to make the perimeter of the tent taut and the corners squared.  
There will always be excess fabric in the interior portion of the tent due to the amount of material  
needed to make up the pitch of the tent. The basic procedure is to literally lay the tent out on the ground,  
pull it taut, and then check diagonal dimensions to ensure it is square. This is followed by complete  
staking.  
● Staking and anchoring. Proper anchoring is a prerequisite for a safe tent event. According to IFAI \(2014,  
p. 9\), “anchoring is typically accomplished by fastening guy ropes to the tent at the top of the side poles  
and to stakes which are driven into the ground at some distance outboard from the side poles.” Both  
wind and rain can affect the shape of the tent and hence the forces on the stakes, so safety factors must  
be employed. Generally speaking, the holding power of stakes is affected by stake diameter \(bigger is  
better\), stake design, depth of the stake \(deeper is better\), soil type \(drier is better\), stake driving  
angle, and guy rope angle. Most good tent rental companies take the time to ensure that they are  
providing more than adequate anchorage for a tent by comparing the required anchor pounds with  
the total anchor pounds of the specific stakes they are using according to a formula that incorporates a  
safety factor. If necessary, more stakes should be added to ensure adequate holding power for the entire  
stake system.  
● Erection and guy wire tightening. Once stakes are in place \(with guy wires relatively loose\), the tent  
must be physically erected. Traditionally—and still today—smaller tents are erected by using sheer  
“muscle power.” A crew lifts poles and frames into position manually, and then tightens guy wires.  
However, for large tents, winches and cranes replace muscle power to lift tent panels into place. After  
the tent has been erected, traditional rope guy wires must be manually pulled and tightened. Once again,  
however, the tent industry has advanced and is now using ratchet-style tent straps in place of ropes.  
This makes it much easier and faster to tighten guy wires. Tenting **295**

# An interview with Mr. Mike Holland and Mr. Tom Markel  
Tent Rental Division, Industrial Fabrics Association International \(IFai\)  
Roseville, mn, usa  
www.ifai.com  
The IFai is an international advocacy, educational, and networking organization for companies and  
individuals working in the various areas of industrial fabrics. One of their divisions, the Tent Rental  
Division \(trd\), represents over 280 tent rental and manufacturing companies from across the  
globe. Mike Holland, Ceo of Chattanooga Tent Company \(www.chattanoogatent.com\), and Tom  
Markel, President of Bravo Events Expos Displays \(www.bravoeventrentals.com\), have well over 60  
years of combined experience in the special events industry and sit on the Steering Committee of  
the division. They are heavily involved with setting directions for the industry with respect to tent  
installation and the building and fire codes associated with tents.  
**Figure 8.6** Tented events

**DM**\: What major changes have you seen in both the design and use of special event tents in the  
last five to ten years?  
**mh**\: Variety of styles in tents and accessories \(e.g. glass, flooring types, etc.\) has been one major  
change. Design criteria in regards to meeting building codes have helped our industry grow by  
the ability to handle larger and more complex events \(e.g. double decker tents\).  
**tm**\: It’s gone both ways; more tents have been engineered for wind-rated designs including frame  
and/or hybrid frame and small pole tents. However, some smaller manufacturers have weakened  
their designs to lower prices, which makes their frame and pole tents more dangerous.  
**DM**\: What advances or changes do you see happening in the next five to ten years in both tent  
design and tent use \(rentals\), for special events?  
**mh**\: I hope to see a more realistic look into tents \[as\] “temporary structures” having their own  
codes and standards rather than trying to make them fit permanent building codes. I also believe  
we will see advances in labor savings in design of temporary structures. **296** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**tm**\: I see the codes and industry standards changing for the next five to ten years. Standards  
for non-wind rated tents will be tightening to provide a “number” for wind and therefore an  
evacuation “number” to clear tents for safety.  
**DM**\: With respect to safety, there are two areas of concern. The first is in the design of tents. Are  
most tents now manufactured to common standards in all countries or are there many differences?  
This may apply, for example, to fire retardancy or strength of materials, to common erection hard-  
ware \(e.g. keder\), or even common anchoring methods and standards.  
**mh**\: I believe basic design and fabric requirements are pretty much the same on an international  
basis. It is, however, becoming more common for cities, states, and countries to have their own  
requirements or seals . . . We need to continue to educate renters and end users on anchoring  
methods and standards. It is sometimes difficult to explain why you use a 1,000 lb concrete ballast  
and your competitor is proposing a water barrel.  
**tm**\: Fire retardancy has not been much of an issue except with code officials . . . Modern  
vinyls are inherently fire resistant but this fact is not well understood by code officials and  
they focus on it. The only exception is lower cost fabric from Asia that might not meet fire  
retardancy standards but is used by smaller manufacturers and rental companies without  
testing the material properly. For common standards, that really depends on the country and/or  
jurisdiction’s adoption of a code such as the IBC/IFC \(International Building Code/International  
Fire Code\) as well as other standards. The most pressing problem is anchoring tents whether  
staking or ballasting, both for the installer and the code officials. Many installers don’t follow  
industry standards developed by IFai-trd and code officials are not educated in proper  
anchoring requirements.  
**DM**\: Again with respect to safety, the second concern is regulations. Are there more stringent  
regulations in place now than say five years ago, and who, in general in most countries, is the  
controlling jurisdiction? This question could apply to the requirements for occupancy permits, it  
could apply to wind and weather loading, or it could apply to general site safety in which there  
may be many tents in place for a given event.  
**mh**\: Yes, the regulations are getting more stringent, and in most cases that is a good thing.  
Generally we will deal with building code and fire department officials in acquiring permits. There  
has also been a move towards having the tent stamped “site specific” rather than just handing  
the officials your engineering plans.  
**tm**\: The biggest changes are in Chapter 16 of the IBC and American Society of Civil Engineering  
\(asCE\) Code 7-10 for wind loads for structures which have become more stringent . . . Attempts  
were made to change the 2015 IFC and would have devastated the industry in the coming years  
and the same push is still there for change . . . the code changes for 2018 are in the works today  
. . . We have to be at the table today. The AHJ \(Authority Having Jurisdiction\) can vary from a  
state to a town, city, village, or county. On federal property it’s the Federal government . . . but  
some smaller jurisdictions don’t want or have resources to deal with events so they opt for state or  
county oversight. Code officials . . . are concerned with occupants getting out before something  
happens . . . This will probably evolve into a tier approach where . . . the regulations and the type  
of tent allowed will change with the increase in occupancy.  
**DM**\: As a followup to these last two questions, is it becoming harder or easier to obtain liability  
insurance to stage a special event with tents? Tenting **297**  
**mh**\: Insurance companies ask more questions about what we do and how we do it . . . I have  
spoken to some of our customers and they have seen rate increases in liability premiums due to  
exposure and weather-related events seen in the media recently.  
**tm**\: At this time the marketplace for insurance access has been stable but pricing is outpacing  
inflation . . . it impacts profitability \[in\] our industry. The industry has been trending to depressed  
pricing . . . The result is safety goes out the window which increases insurance rates and regulation  
because of the increasing accident rates.  
**DM**\: Do you have any words of wisdom for novice event producers? In other words, what should  
they probably know as a minimum knowledge base in order to make the job of tent rental com-  
panies that much easier?  
**mh**\: I think it is very important that they know what is required to host the event on the proposed  
site and \[what is required\] by the code officials prior to picking their vendors. All vendors that are  
working on the project should be made aware of the requirements. The best person to make sure  
all aspects of the event are in compliance is the producer/event manager.  
**tm**\: Whether novice or old hand, event producers are just as responsible for public safety as any  
other entity on the “team.” The notion that it is solely the tent rental company’s “responsibility” to  
do it right is wrong and dangerous. First they \[event producers\] are picking the vendor, the lowest  
price is not always the best vendor and frequently creates a more dangerous install for promoters  
and occupants at the event . . . Evacuation will, at a large event, be on the producer, not the tent  
rental company. They \[tent rental company\] might have some personnel there, but the plans and  
implementation at a large event are squarely in the promoter’s \[producer’s\] domain. The tent rental  
company is part of that process but not the end decider or implementer for evacuation.  
# 8.5 risk and safety  
As already mentioned, tented events have the potential to be highly risky if either the tent is not erected  
properly or weather causes serious problems. Both the tent rental company and the end user, which could  
be both the end client \(i.e. event manager/planner\) and the event producer, may be liable for damages or  
personal injury suffered as a result of a tent incident.  
# 8.5.1 Pre-occupancy inspection  
To ameliorate these particular risks, the tent installer \(i.e. rental company\) should, as a first step, perform  
the following inspection once the tent has been erected and anchored\:  
● Ensure all stakes are secure.  
● Ensure all guy lines/ropes are properly tensioned and all tent material set for proper drainage.  
● Determine that all poles are properly positioned, tied securely, and are structurally sound.  
● Ensure all sidewalls are properly secured.  
● Address all safety issues as soon as possible.  
# 8.5.2 occupancy permits  
There are also extensive safety regulations in effect in most municipal jurisdictions that must be met before  
an occupancy permit will be issued to hold a tented event. Occupancy permits should be sought no later **298** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
than about one month before the event. These regulations pertain exclusively to the tents themselves and  
the interior of the tents. Note that the IBC and IFC, as mentioned in the “Voice of the Industry,” may drive  
tent design and influence the requirements for occupancy permits, but it would still fall to the local  
authority to decide whether or not to reference these codes \(Kaminski, 2012\).  
Kucik \(2004\) provides an excellent checklist for producers and event managers who are seeking permits  
for tent installations. Some of the key questions included are the following, the answers to which producers  
would do well to have available for any tent permit requests \(note that these are for events in the United  
States\)\:  
● Will there be flammable or combustible materials within 10 ft \(3 m\) of the structure?  
● Will fire extinguishers be in clear view and accessible?  
● Will the exits, exit aisles, and exit discharge be clear and unobstructed?  
● Will there be a fire alarm system, public address system, or alternate method of occupant notification  
provided for occupant loads exceeding 300?  
● Is all tent fabric fire retardant and does it meet the requirements of NFPA 701\: Standard Methods of Fire  
Tests for Flame Propagation of Textiles and Films, 2010 Edition?  
● Are all tents/membrane structures provided with a minimum of 20 ft \(6 m\) perimeter space for  
emergency egress by the occupants and with a minimum 20 ft roadway for access by emergency  
personnel?  
● Are the tops of tent stakes blunt or covered so as to prevent injury?  
● Are there a minimum of two separate exits from any point in the structure where the occupant load is  
fewer than 500 persons; three exits for occupant loads between 500 and 999 persons; or four exits for  
occupant loads exceeding 1,000 persons?  
● Are changes of elevations at exits, exit access, or exit discharge in compliance with code?  
● Is panic hardware or an approved equivalent provided on all exit doors that are lockable?  
● Will exits remain accessible and unobstructed while the tent is occupied?  
● Are exits designed and arranged to be clearly recognizable and distinctly marked as a means of  
egress?  
● Are directional exit signs provided if exits are not readily visible from all points in the structure?  
● Is emergency lighting provided in the tent to illuminate the exit access ways?  
● Is the occupant load posted?  
● Do electrical installations comply with NFPA 70, National Electrical Code?  
● Are crowd managers/stewards being provided, with a means of emergency forces notification, at a ratio  
of 1 to 250 persons when occupant loads exceed 1,000 individuals?  
● Are cooking and/or open flames being brought into the structure? If yes, explain.  
● Are pyrotechnics being used in the structure? If yes, explain.  
● Are decorative or acoustic materials such as hay, straw, and woodchips being used in the structure? If  
yes, explain.  
● Are there motorized vehicles being brought into the structure? If yes, explain.  
● Is seating for assembly use accommodating more than 200 persons fastened together in groups of not  
less than three and not more than seven?  
● Are distances between tables and chairs in accordance with the local standards? Tenting **299**  
# 8.5.3 general safety regulations and standards  
Other than local regulations for occupancy, which can be very strict, in the United States the main safety  
standards of concern for tenting are produced by the National Fire Protection Association \(NFPA\) and  
include\:  
● NFPA 70®\: National Electrical Code® \(NEC®\) Softbound, 2014 Edition, pertinent to any electrical installations  
within tents.  
● NFPA 101®\: Life Safety Code®, 2015 Edition, applicable to the egress of people from tents, as well as other  
aspects of occupant safety and the duties of crowd managers.  
● NFPA 102\: Standard for Grandstands, Folding and Telescopic Seating, Tents, and Membrane Structures, 2011  
Edition, which covers the construction, location, protection, and maintenance of tents and air-supported  
structures.  
● NFPA 701\: Standard Methods of Fire Tests for Flame Propagation of Textiles and Films, 2010 Edition.  
In Canada, the equivalent information is covered in\:  
● Industry Guide to Canadian Requirements for Tents, 2010 Edition. Describes test methods for flammability  
of tent materials.  
● Hazardous Products \(Tents\) Regulations, SOR/90-245 \(Canada Consumer Product Safety Act\), 2014. Similar to  
the Industry Guide.  
● National Fire Code and the National Building Code, both 2010 editions, published by the National  
Research Council Canada, and the Canadian Electrical Code published by the Canadian Standards  
Association.  
In the UK, within the regulatory area, tents are often included in a special category of structures called  
temporary demountable structures \(TDS\), which include many of the other temporary structures used in  
special events such as trussing, staging, bleachers, and barriers, most of which are covered in Chapter 9.  
For now, some of the main documents for tent safety in the UK include\:  
● BS EN 13782\:2005, Temporary structures. Tents. Safety. This covers safety, installation, and maintenance.  
● Safe Use and Operation of Temporary Demountable Fabric Structures \(2013\) published by the Performance  
Textiles Association. It covers primarily site safety and public safety and makes reference to all other  
documents necessary for a tented event.  
● Temporary demountable structures. Guidance on procurement, design and use. \(Third Edition\) \(2007\). An excellent  
detailed guide published by the Institute of Structural Engineers.  
In Australia, regulations are apparently a state responsibility, although local municipal governments are  
the approval-granting authorities as in most other countries. One of the better guiding documents is  
Guidelines on the Application of the Health \(Public Buildings\) Regulations 1992, amended in 2002, and published  
by the Department of Health of Western Australia. Appendix 2 of this document is quite extensive and  
covers all safety aspects of a tented event.  
Producers from other countries should ensure they understand all applicable equipment and personnel  
safety standards and regulations from their own jurisdictions.  
Humanity’s love affair with tents extends back to prehistoric times, yet even though most cultures are well  
past a nomadic lifestyle, it continues unabated today as a means of remaining close to nature. Now, though,  
it is for more social and commercial reasons and in more comfortable surroundings. Survival is no longer  
the driving force for “pitching a tent.” Thanks to our inherent ingenuity, the venerable tent is not just  
getting old, it truly is getting better. **300** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS

# Miscellaneous technical  
# resources  
# l e a r n i n g o u t c o m es  
After reading this chapter, you will be able to\:  
**1.** Understand and explain how to calculate electrical power requirements for an event.  
**2.** Understand how electrical power distribution works.  
**3.** Understand what constitutes trussing structures and why their design and safety are important.  
**4.** Understand what rigging is, what equipment is used, and why it is used.  
**5.** Understand what scaffolding, bleachers, fencing, and portable toilets are and how they are used  
for events.  
Sometimes neglected in the rush to produce an event are critical resources and technicians that work  
behind the scenes to make everything else function smoothly. This chapter is devoted to these resources,  
which include electrical power, trussing, rigging, and temporary structures. If not dealt with knowledgeably,  
these resources may cause other elements to fail. We therefore want to ensure that producers have as  
complete an understanding as possible of them.  
# 9.1 electrical power  
Virtually everything at a special event nowadays requires electricity, from audio and lighting systems to  
catering hot plates. Ensuring that adequate power is available for the event is usually one of the duties of  
the producer. Although calculating the exact power required for all suppliers is not part of these duties,  
the producer should understand generally how to calculate the electrical power required and what the  
consequences may be if it is not available. In this section, we will therefore examine how to calculate **302** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
electrical service requirements, how electrical distribution works, when portable power must be used, and  
finally safety considerations for working with electrical power. It should be noted that the discussion in  
this section applies only to electrical power in North America. Due to the complexity of this subject and  
the large number of connector types in various countries, it is impossible to review them all. This is  
intended only as a starting point.  
# 9.1.1 Determining electrical service requirements  
Determining correct electrical service requires matching the power draws of the special event equipment  
\(e.g. lighting, audio, A-V\) with the power available in a given venue or at an event site. Power is distributed  
to large venues such as hotels, arenas, and convention centers in what is commonly referred to as single-  
phase or three-phase alternating current \(AC\). This power is usually available from venues in several optional  
“packages.” Each of these packages is defined by the voltage or electromotive force \(E\), the amperage or  
electrical current \(I\), and the power \(P\). Note that “P” can refer to either the power available from the venue  
or the power consumed by equipment. The key is to match the two and allow for a safety factor. The  
relationship amongst these variables is given by a derivative of Ohm’s Law for alternating current, namely\:  
P  
I =  
E x PF  
if a calculation for the amperage is sought, or alternatively\:  
P = I x E x PF  
if a calculation for power draw in watts is sought, where PF is the power factor. This is a number less than  
one that defines, in an alternating current circuit, the real power compared to the apparent power. Simply  
put, it reflects the fact that due to the way that alternating current works, the power that a device sees is  
less than the power that comes into the circuit, and it is device-dependent. Typically, for devices such as  
lights, this factor is in the order of 0.80 and this is a commonly used number. For purposes of simplicity  
only, this may be considered our safety factor. The above formula works for single-phase power, and here  
we need to explain the differences between single- and three-phase power. From this point on, we will be  
referring to the various electrical terms by their units of measurement\: voltage in volts \(V\), amperage in  
amps \(A\), and power in watts \(W\) or kilowatts \(kW\).  
In North America, most power connection points are 120 V, and are frequently referred to as 120/208 V  
three-phase, or 120/240 V single-phase. Single-phase power can be either 120 V, or 120/240 V. In 120 V  
single-phase service, there is only one leg of power feeding the service. In this case, the 120 V is known as  
the line-to-neutral voltage and it is found in single wall outlet receptacles in event venues and most North  
American homes. Since power is also defined by amperage, most common wall outlets deliver 15 A of  
electrical current and 120 V, thus allowing up to 1,440 W to be drawn safely using the above formula \(e.g.  
the equivalent of a good hair dryer\); however, this is insufficient for most special event applications and  
higher amperage connections must be used to provide enough power.  
In a 120/240 V single-phase service, there are two legs of power feeding the service\: two wires each  
carrying 120 V. Because of the way alternating current works, the V in each of these legs is always 180  
degrees out of phase with the other leg, making the available V appear as 240 V when the two legs are  
connected together, which is known as a line-to-line voltage.  
In a 120/208 V three-phase system, there are three legs of power—or three separate wires—each carrying  
120 V. A 120/208 V three-phase power connection actually requires five wires\: three hot \(live\) lines each  
carrying 120 V and a variable number of amps, one neutral wire, and one ground wire. In this system, the Miscellaneous teCHnical resources **303**  
three legs are 120 degrees out of phase and the actual available voltage is equivalent to √3 or 173 percent  
of the single-phase V \(i.e. 120 V x 173 percent = 208 V\). To account for this, the single-phase formula  
must be further modified for all calculations involving three-phase power to the following\:  
P  
I =  
1.73 x E x PF  
Now, let us look at how this is all applied for an event. To begin our example, let us consider that a venue  
offers the following electrical service packages, in ascending order of cost\:  
● 20 A, 120 V single-phase;  
● 30 A, 120/240 V single-phase;  
● 30 A, 120/208 V three-phase;  
● 60 A, 120/208 V three-phase;  
● 100 A, 120/208 V three-phase;  
● 200 A, 120/208 V three-phase.  
In this example, let us look at two different events using lighting, and we will assume that the lighting is  
not LED but older and less energy-efficient PAR cans. The first one is for eight PAR64, 500 W luminaires  
for a small stage show. To determine total power, in simple terms, it is a matter of adding up all the  
luminaires’ total wattage, assuming that we might want to connect them all together on a single dimmer  
system. For example, eight PAR64 stage luminaires each drawing 500 W will require 4,000 W, or in another  
term for the same thing, four kilowatts \(i.e. 4,000 W/1,000 W/kilowatt\) of power. Using the above formulas,  
the lighting designer \(LD\) will now calculate what electrical service package is required. The first  
assumption will be the use of the cheapest package, that of 20 A, 120 V single-phase. Knowing the total  
power draw of the lights, the required amperage can be calculated as follows\:  
4,000  
I =  
= 42 A  
120 x 0.80  
Obviously, the package offered is inadequate since it is only 20 A. The LD will now try the next feasible  
power package of 30 A, 240 V single-phase\:  
4,000  
I =  
= 21 A  
240 x 0.80  
This package will be safe for the intended lighting as the required amperage \(21\) is less than the amperage  
provided \(30\). Of course, another option is also the 60 A, three-phase service, but that is more expensive  
and is overkill.  
Now let us consider the second scenario, more of a concert-type show, with forty 1,000 W PAR64  
luminaires. The total power draw will be 40,000 W \(i.e. 40 kW\). The LD might begin by calculating the  
current required using a single-phase, 240 V service, as follows\:  
40,000  
I =  
= 208 A  
240 x 0.80  
Again, this is higher than any of the options, so three-phase service must be considered. The lowest  
possible option that may provide sufficient power is 200 A, 208 V, three-phase service. The calculation is\:  
40,000  
I =  
= 139 A  
1.73 x 208 x 0.80 **304** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
This option will therefore provide sufficient power for the lighting since the required amperage of 139 is  
less than the provided amperage of 200.  
Also a consideration for the LD is the voltage drop over their own cables between the luminaires and the  
dimmers and the console, but they will already have this calculated and have it built into their power  
requirements. The same holds true for other suppliers such as audio and A-V.  
# 9.1.2 electrical distribution  
Now that the amount of electrical power available is known, all that is needed is to connect to the power  
outlet in the venue using a matching connector and then distribute the necessary power to all equipment.  
We begin with connection and move to actual distribution.  
# 9.1.2.1 Accessing venue power  
Depending on the amount of power required as described above, the decision will have to be made by the  
equipment supplier \(e.g. lighting, audio, A-V\) whether single-phase will suffice or whether the load is  
going to be so great and/or the devices so many that three-phase will be needed. Let us first look at  
single-phase.  
9.1.2.1.1 single-phase conneCTions  
The most common connections for taking single-phase power from a venue are\:  
● NEMA 5 \(National Electrical Manufacturers Association\). This is also referred to as a Type B, North  
American 3-pin, and sometimes just a “wall plug,” or “Edison.” All NEMA 5 devices are three-wire  
grounding devices rated for 125 V maximum, coming in 5–15, 5–20, and 5–30 versions \(the second  
number refers to the amperage of the circuit\). The 5–15 is by far the most common electrical outlet in  
North America. The Type B plug is used in events only with 120 V single-phase and therefore small  
electrical loads. See Figure 9.1 \(top left; NEMA 5–15\).  
● NEMA 14. “The NEMA 14 devices are four-wire grounding devices available in ratings from 15 A to  
60 A. Of the straight-blade NEMA 14 devices, only the 14–30 and 14–50 are common. The 14–30 is  
used for electric clothes dryers and the 14–50 for electric cooking ranges. The voltage rating is a design  
maximum of 250 V . . . All NEMA 14 devices offer two hots, a neutral, and a ground, allowing for both  
120 V and 240 V \(or 120 V and 208 V if the supply system is three-phase rather than split-phase\). The  
14–30 has a rating of 30 A and an L-shaped neutral blade. The 14–50 has a rating of 50 A and a straight  
neutral blade sized so that it does not fit in the slot of a 14–30” \(NEMA Connector, 2014\). For events,  
the most common is the 14–50, often referred to as a range plug. It is used mainly for small audio and  
lighting systems. See Figure 9.1 \(top right; NEMA 14–30 plug and 14–50 receptacle\).  
● NEMA twist-lock. “Twist-locking connectors were first invented by Harvey Hubbell III in 1938 and  
‘Twist-Lock’ remains a registered trademark of Hubbell Incorporated, although the term is used  
generically to refer to NEMA locking connectors manufactured by any company. Locking connectors use  
curved blades. Once pushed into the receptacle, the plug is twisted and its now-rotated blades latch into  
the receptacle. To unlatch the plug, the rotation is reversed. The locking coupling makes for a more  
reliable connection in commercial and industrial settings, where vibration or incidental impact could  
disconnect a non-locking connector. Locking connectors come in a variety of standardized configurations  
that follow the same general naming scheme except that the designations include an ‘L’ for ‘locking.’  
Locking connectors are designed so that different voltages and current ratings cannot be accidentally  
intermated” \(NEMA Connector, 2014\). See Figure 9.1 \(bottom left; NEMA L5–20\). For special events, Miscellaneous teCHnical resources **305**  
**Figure 9.1** Single-phase electrical connections  
Clockwise from upper left, images courtesy of\: www.amazon.com; Doug Matthews \[plug\] and www.  
amazon.com \[receptacle\]; Entertainment Power Systems, www.entertainmentpowersystems.com;  
and www.amazon.com  
twist-lock connectors are used only for single-phase applications, typically in theaters, arenas, and  
occasionally in hotels and convention centers for relatively small lighting requirements. Twist-lock  
connectors are more common in Canada than the comparable stage pin connectors \(SPC\) in the United  
States.  
● Stage pin connector \(SPC\). A stage pin connector is a standard for theatrical lighting, although  
occasionally they can be used with something else. “These connectors are available in 120V and 250V  
versions for 20A, 30A, 60A, and 100A service” \(Cadena, 2009, p. 9\). “The primary advantage of the  
stage pin connector over the NEMA 5-15 connector \(commonly known as an Edison plug\) is its ability  
to lay flat on a stage lessening the likelihood of being a trip hazard. In addition the stage pin connector  
has an increased durability and resistance to damage due to its more robust construction” \(Stage pin  
connector, 2014\). See Figure 9.1 \(bottom right; Entertainment Power Systems SP-20 stage-  
pin connector\).  
9.1.2.1.2 Three-phase conneCTions  
Once it is determined that the power requirements are very large, suppliers will request hookup to three-  
phase power at the venue. This can come in one of two ways\:  
● Pin and sleeve. Pin and sleeve circular male connectors mate directly with female receptacles that are  
often present in major hotels and convention centers for high power applications. Depending on the  
venue, current ratings vary up to about 400 A and voltage ratings vary up to about 600 V AC. Contact  
arrangements are from three to five pins and differ in different countries. The contacts in the plug are  
pins and those in the receptacle are simple cylinders \(sleeves\). These connectors are often referred to Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**306** as Blue Hubbell after a manufacturer, although they come in different colors and configurations. The  
object of this connection is to take the house power and output it to compatible five-wire Cam lock  
connectors \(see Section 9.1.2.2\). It is typically the lighting company that will bring the male pin and sleeve  
connector to the venue and tie it into the female receptacle. In essence, the pin and sleeve connector is  
really no more than an adaptor.  
● Wall box. This situation also occurs in many venues. The three-phase power comes into the venue and  
is distributed to wall boxes that have five terminal lugs inside instead of a female pin and sleeve  
connection. For this type of tie-in, a qualified electrician is required \(usually from the venue\), who  
connects the lugs with the bare wire ends of female Cam lock connectors for the lighting or audio techs  
to use. Sometimes, the Cam lock connection has already been made in the venue. With a wall box  
situation, it is important to ensure that the correct voltage and amperage are present, and that all safety  
precautions are followed due to the high risk of serious injury or death. Nobody but a qualified electrician  
should be allowed to make these connections.  
# 9.1.2.2 Distributing three-phase power  
Once the tie-in has been made to the house three-phase power, connections must be made to distribution  
panels or boxes, sometimes also referred to as distro boxes, or in many cases, directly into a lighting dimmer  
pack.  
The primary connector for accomplishing this is the Cam lock connector. Cam lock connectors are attached  
to the ends of the pin and sleeve wiring or the direct wall box wiring. Cam lock connectors come in varying  
sizes based on amperage loads and are colored. The colors correspond to the different functions of the line,  
and are not arbitrary, as follows\: green \(ground\); white \(neutral\); black \(phase one\); blue \(phase two\); red  
\(phase three\). These are for North America. European colors may differ. Most Cam locks are weatherproof,  
with their colored rubber boots protecting innocent fingers when open and forming a watertight connection  
when connected. See Figure 9.2 top left and bottom left.  
With the house power now going into a distribution panel \(or dimmer pack as illustrated in Figure 9.2\),  
this power must be broken down into smaller circuits of single-phase power for use with the various  
lighting, audio, or A-V components \(and sometimes musical equipment\). That is the purpose of the  
distribution panel \(or dimmer pack when specifically for lighting as in this case\), which will usually contain  
a number of different connection options \(as described in Section 9.1.2.1.1\) as well as individual circuit  
breakers for each circuit.  
Figure 9.2 illustrates generally how house three-phase power is distributed. The upper left image illustrates  
a Blue Hubbell or pin-and-sleeve connector at one end, which takes three-phase power directly from the  
venue outlet, and then at the other end the five colored Cam lock connectors that connect into the lighting  
dimmer pack. The upper right image illustrates a 19-pin Socapex connector that connects with both non-  
DMX-controllable and DMX-controllable luminaires as described in Section 5.6 of Chapter 5. The bottom  
two images illustrate the lighting dimmer unit \(left—back; right—front\). This unit is modular and can  
incorporate a variety of lighting dimmer circuits, but also a variety of regular single-phase power output  
options. In this case, the overall unit is designed for lighting power distribution. In the bottom left image  
note first the Cam lock inputs \(green, white, red, blue, black\) from house power. Above these are four  
19-pin receptacles for the Socapex cables. Each of these connections provides single-phase power to six  
separate, 20A circuits for non-DMX-controllable luminaires \(see Figure 5.14 in Chapter 5\). The circuit  
breakers for these are found on the front of the unit in the middle \(Figure 9.2, bottom right\). Above these  
four outlets on the back is another module that provides a separate circuit for the chain motors used to  
raise the lighting truss, and above this are four more Socapex outlets to provide single-phase power to  
DMX-controllable luminaires. Finally, above these on the back \(bottom left image\) are two optical splitters Miscellaneous teCHnical resources **307**

which extend the number of DMX channels as described in Section 5.6 of Chapter 5. The front of these  
can be seen at the top of the unit in the bottom right image, along with the DMX dimming channels just  
below them.  
# 9.1.3 Portable power  
Whenever an event is held away from one of the standard event venues such as hotels, arenas, or convention  
centers, and particularly outdoors, there is a high probability that electrical service will not be readily **308** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
available. In these cases, portable generating units must be brought in. These units are typically trailer-  
towed and take the place of the house power that would be found indoors, and most come with at least  
some power distribution breakout. They come from various manufacturers and in various sizes that provide  
power up to 400 V AC and amperages from 250 to 2,400 \(Garber, 2002\). Most run on diesel fuel and  
nowadays, thanks to technological advances driven by the movie industry, are extremely quiet, allowing  
them to be placed fairly close to event guests—but hidden—without fear of too much noise interference.  
Two points bear mentioning in the use of portable generators. The first is that fuel levels must be monitored  
constantly to ensure that fuel does not run out, thus avoiding unexpected power outages. As noted by  
Garber \(2006\), some rental companies actually have global positioning systems \(GPS\) that enable them  
to monitor their rental units to check the fuel status. The second point is that for large events, a backup  
unit can act as insurance in case the first one goes down, and also to spread the electrical load more evenly  
\(Wenzel, 2014\).  
# 9.1.4 electrical safety considerations  
For personnel safety, the appropriate organizations in the United States are the Occupational Safety and  
Health Administration \(OSHA\) and the National Fire Protection Association \(NFPA\), as well as individual  
states. The NFPA has a safety standard \(NFPA 70E®\: Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace®, 2015  
Edition\) that is the document to which the OSHA adheres. Installation and general design standards for  
electrical equipment are covered in detail in the National Electrical Code \(NEC\), which in publication form  
is NFPA 70®\: National Electrical Code®, 2014 Edition, and although it is not law, most jurisdictions require  
compliance with the NEC. Additionally, specific design standards come from the National Electrical  
Manufacturers Associa­ tion \(NEMA\) and they “define a product, process, or procedure with reference to  
one or more of the following\: nomenclature, composition, construction, dimensions, tolerances, safety,  
operat­ ing characteristics, performance, rating, testing, and the service for which it is designed” \(NEMA,  
2014\). These are numerous and event producers should ensure that suppliers use equipment that meets  
these standards whenever there is a standard. Finally for the United States, as a general guide, Chapter 17  
of Cooper \(2014\) has some excellent checklists specifically for electrical safety at outdoor events.  
In Canada, responsibility for the electrical safety of personnel rests with the provinces and territories. Every  
province and territory adopts and enforces the same installation code, promulgated by the Canadian  
Standards Association \(CSA\) as CSA C22.1-12\: Canadian Electrical Code, Part I \(22nd Edition\), Safety Standard  
for Electrical Installations. The electrical codes are eventually incorporated into each jurisdiction’s regulations  
for enforcement. With respect to equipment design standards, these requirements are set through CAN/  
CSA-C22.2 NO. 0–10\: General Requirements – Canadian Electrical Code, Part II \(2010 Edition\). Again, they are  
adopted \(with or without modifications\) and enforced by the provincial and territorial electrical safety  
authorities. This ensures that equipment installed in conjunction with the CEC will be compatible and  
safe to use under the installation rules. CEC Part II contains a myriad of individual equipment standards,  
and event producers should ensure that the equipment from their suppliers meets the standards wherever  
applicable. Many are compatible with US standards.  
In the UK, standards are extensive, with the British Standards Institute \(BSI\) being responsible for creating  
them. Two guiding documents for special events are BS 7909\:2011\: Code of Practice for Temporary Electrical  
Systems for Entertainment and Related Purposes, and BS 7671\:2008+A3\:2015\: Requirements for Electrical  
Installation – IET Wiring Regulations. In Europe and generally most other countries, the international standard  
IEC 60364\: Electrical Installations for Buildings, promulgated by the International Electrotechnical Commission,  
is the main document. In fact, much of BS 7671 is taken from it.  
In Australia, Live Performance Australia, an advocacy and educational organization for special events, has  
developed a number of best practices guidelines. Their publication, Safety Guidelines for Live Entertainment Miscellaneous teCHnical resources **309**  
and Events\: Electricity \(2014 Edition\), is an excellent overall guide and starting point. It provides several  
detailed checklists and a list of references to other formal standards and regulations concerning electrical  
installations in Australia and also New Zealand.  
Other countries’ standards may vary and producers should ensure they understand all local, state/  
provincial, and federal standards.  
# 9.2 trussing  
Trussing, as we know it, started to develop at the end of the 1970s in response to the entertainment  
industry’s demand for lightweight, strong temporary structures that could span the width of a stage and  
be used to hang lighting and audio systems. Familiar with the spatial lattice structures found in bridges,  
scaffolding, and buildings, manufacturers used this as the basis for modern truss design. Today it is  
ubiquitous in the industry and comes in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, colors, and strengths. While it is  
the primary method of support for lighting systems, it has gone far beyond that to now also be the primary  
method of constructing and supporting large roofs and enclosures for outdoor stages. As such—and due  
to numerous deadly accidents and collapses of such structures regularly around the world—it has become  
the focus of much attention. This section and the next one on rigging are intended to inform producers  
and in so doing, help them to plan properly and prevent such accidents from ever occurring.  
# 9.2.1 general truss design  
Trussing is made of heavy-duty aluminum or aluminum alloy tubing and comes in a variety of sizes and  
shapes. The most common shapes in cross-section are box, rectangular, and triangular, varying from  
12 in. \(0.1 m\) square to more than 23 in. \(58 cm\) x 40 in. \(101 cm\) in rectangular cross-section.  
Section lengths vary from about 2.5 ft \(0.75 m\) to more than 118 ft \(36 m\), with tubing diameters of 1 in.  
\(2.5 cm\) to 3 in. \(7.5 cm\). Generally, different manufacturers make different sizes within these extremes.  
Lengths can be joined together to make longer, continuous truss lines. Trussing also comes in curved  
sections and, depending on the manufacturer, a variety of colors, thus enabling a limitless range of shapes  
and looks. As well, a great many accessories are available to allow different forms of attachment of truss  
sections, much like Meccano sets for those old enough to remember them.  
Trussing must be able to withstand loads imposed on it in shear \(i.e. force directed along the cross-section,  
such as high loads on top of a vertical truss section\) and in deflection \(i.e. force directed down and  
perpendicular to its horizontal access, such as too many luminaires clamped in one position\). The amount  
it can withstand depends of course on its size and rated load. Each type and size of truss is rated by the  
manufacturer for specific maximum loads under these conditions. It is therefore critical that riggers \(see  
Section 9.3\) know the exact loads that will be imposed on the truss in these conditions and what the total  
weight of the loaded truss will be so that the correct choice of supporting wire rope cable, slings, and chain  
motors may be made. Not only that, but the truss supplier for an event \(e.g. the lighting company\) is  
obligated to understand the load rating of their truss and to choose the proper truss accordingly, knowing  
in detail what the loading will be before the truss is ever rigged into position.  
Apart from simple sections of straight truss flown from venue ceilings \(see Section 5.4.3.2 of Chapter 5\),  
things get more complicated as truss configurations move to being self-supported from the ground.  
# 9.2.2 ground-supported truss configurations  
These types of truss configurations are found in two main scenarios\: indoors in large venues such as arenas  
and stadia for such events as concerts where the venue ceiling is too high or weak for practically rigging **310** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
and flying truss lines, especially in cases where lighting and set design are complex; and outdoors when  
large stages are needed, especially for festivals or other public events. While only the imagination of  
producers limits the different configurations, the following are the most common\:  
● Single rigging tower. This basically consists of a V-shaped truss base that supports an angled truss mast.  
The base acts as a stabilizer once the mast is in place. The tower is usually used to support lighting and  
audio but has no horizontal truss sections.  
● Simple support towers and grid. This system is designed to support a grid without the need for  
suspension points. It is typically set up in a box-like design of four vertical towers, each with outrigger  
feet for stability. Each vertical tower can support upwards of 2 to 4 tons \(4,000 to 8,000 lb\) of horizontal  
truss. The horizontal truss sections are raised and lowered by means of an electric motor and chains  
built into each tower. This type of system is often found indoors.  
● Roofs. This configuration consists of extra truss sections attached to the top of a tower and grid system.  
This roof structure is then covered with fire-retardant PVC or other material. The entire roof is raised  
with the remainder of the horizontal truss. Roof systems are used extensively for outdoor events for  
weather protection. Heights are variable, typically up to 30 ft \(approximately 10 m\) or so. Roof shapes  
vary considerably and can be flat, curved, or peaked, depending on the truss sections and accessories  
used for their construction.  
● Tunnel roof. This type of configuration does not rely on a vertical/horizontal grid for support but instead  
incorporates both into an overall roof design that resembles a tunnel constructed of trussing. It is very  
strong and compact and can be made from curved truss sections or short straight sections using  
appropriate connecting hardware.  
Figure 9.3 illustrates several different truss configurations.  
# 9.2.3 truss safety  
Since many ground-supported truss configurations are used outdoors, particularly important are unique  
loading scenarios that may be encountered. These include\:  
● Wind. Wind can cause damage to canopies and walls, it can overload trusses and towers due to the extra  
load of attached walls, and it can lift all or part of the complete structure.  
● Rain or snow. This can make trussing slippery for climbing, it can cause overloading of rooftops due to  
accumulation of snow or water, it can cause short-circuiting in control systems, and it can cause the  
support of saturated soils to weaken.  
● Lightning. This can cause severe personal safety risk if it hits towers.  
● Temperature. Solar heat can cause aluminum to become extremely hot, thus making it unsafe to the  
touch. It may also cause the safe temperature of any polyester sling covers to exceed their allowable  
limit \(e.g. surface temperature can reach 150ºC, greater than the normal safe limit for polyester of  
100ºC\).  
It is therefore imperative that such things as roofs be constructed properly and with due consideration of  
the expected weather conditions. For example, the inclusion of supporting guy wires, base distance frames  
to minimize compression loads, and adequate ballast is absolutely necessary. Additionally, heights of  
towers and roofs must be restricted to recommended maximums, both indoors and outdoors.  
However, structural problems are not confined to outdoor events. Numerous collapses of truss structures  
in recent years have occurred indoors as well. As a result of these ongoing problems, increased attention  
has been paid to the safety of such structures. In particular, in the United States, The Event Safety Guide  
\(Cooper, 2014, pp. 192–204\) provides an extensive review of safety requirements for truss structures, Miscellaneous teCHnical resources **311**  
**Figure 9.3** Examples of ground-supported truss configurations

Gearhouse sa \(Pty\) Ltd. and Louise Stickland  
including references to some of the most applicable standards. Producers who ever use truss structures  
for events are strongly advised to become familiar with it. Otherwise, two of the most important standards  
concerning truss structures in North America are\:  
● ANSI E1.2 – 2012\: Entertainment Technology – Design, Manufacture and Use of Aluminum Trusses and Towers.  
ANSI E1.2 describes the design, manufacture, and use of aluminum trusses, towers, and associated  
aluminum structural components, such as head blocks, sleeve blocks, bases, and corner blocks, used in  
the entertainment industry in portable structures.  
● ANSI E1.21 – 2013\: Entertainment Technology – Temporary Structures Used for Technical Production of Outdoor  
Entertainment Events. This document establishes a minimum level of design and performance parameters  
for the design, manufacturing, use, and maintenance of temporary ground-supported structures used  
in the production of outdoor entertainment events. The purpose of this guidance is to ensure the  
structural reliability and safety of these structures and does not address fire safety and safe egress issues. **312** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
In Europe, the following standard applies\:  
● CWA 15902-2\:2010\: Lifting and Load-bearing Equipment for Stages and other Production Areas within the  
Entertainment Industry – Part 2\: Specifications for design, manufacture and for use of aluminum and steel trusses and  
towers. Created by the European Institute for Standardisation \(CEN\), this standard covers design,  
manufacture, and use of aluminum and steel trusses, towers, and associated structural components such  
as tower head blocks, sleeve blocks, bases and corner blocks used in the entertainment industry. Trusses  
and truss constructions are used to support predominantly static loads or to serve purely decorative  
purposes. They can be hung, ground-supported, permanently installed, or used as a moving construction.  
In the UK, the main document is Temporary demountable structures. Guidance on procurement, design and use  
\(Third Edition\) \(2007\). It provides comprehensive details on TDS, including checklists for planning,  
construction, and use of TDS. Endorsed by the Health and Safety Executive \(HSE\), it is the industry-  
accepted guide for the safe management and use of temporary demountable structures.  
Suffice it to say, planning to erect a truss structure requires a through understanding and analysis of the  
risks, a full plan for the design and anchoring of the structure, and almost always a complete analysis of  
the expected loading on the structure. A properly qualified rigger and the truss supplier should be able to  
certify compliance with these requirements, although occasionally a qualified structural engineer may have  
to sign off. This chapter’s war story describes the consequences of what can happen when proper design  
of a truss structure is not completed.

# An interview with the Mendip District Council \(MDC\)  
Licensing Authority for the Glastonbury Festival  
Pilton, Somerset, England  
www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk  
Considering the critical importance of safety to the public and to event employees, especially  
at international outdoor festivals at which many major accidents have occurred in recent years,  
I decided to pose questions about this subject to several of the most prominent festivals in the world.  
My reasoning was that to be successful, festivals of this magnitude must be conscious of safety and  
I wanted to determine just how they did it. One, the Glastonbury Festival, responded in detail via  
their local licensing authority, the Mendip District Council \(mdC\). By way of introduction, Glastonbury  
began in 1970 and is now held annually on farmlands in Somerset, England. It attracts upwards of  
150,000 or more people each year and is regularly listed as one of the world’s biggest music festivals.  
**DM**\: For temporary structures such as stages, stage roofs, and bleachers, what standards and  
regulations is the festival required to meet?  
**MDC**\: We expect event organizers to follow the guidance in the Institution of Structural Engineers  
publication “Temporary demountable structures. Guidance on procurement, design and use, \(Third  
Edition\) \(2007\).” See this link – http\://shop.istructe.org/temporary-demountable-structures.html.  
In respect of structures, the Council’s building control team works with the festival to ensure com-  
pliance, etc. There is no single blanket legislation that covers an event such as Glastonbury, so we  
utilize best practice from a number of documents, and apply what is most practical and pragmatic  
depending on each individual venue’s use and size. These include\:  
● The Building Regulations.  
● Fifth edition of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds \(“The Green Guide”\). Miscellaneous teCHnical resources **313**

**DM**\: Are there specific requirements or configurations for front-of-stage barriers that the festival  
must follow or use?  
**MDC**\: The festival site comprises approximately 80 venues and stages ranging from the largest,  
“the Pyramid,” to much smaller and niche venues. There is not a one-size-fits-all approach and **314** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
the event organizer is required to risk assess each stage and determine the most appropriate  
front-of-stage barrier for that venue/stage and location. There is also an expectation that each  
barrier will be supplied, erected, signed off, and regularly checked during the course of the event  
by competent persons who will be commissioned by the organizer. A range of different barrier  
configurations is used at Glastonbury Festival. For the last few years an open double barrier has  
been used at the Pyramid Stage.  
The Council in discharging its Public Safety role does not specify or check technical drawings,  
calculations, or configurations. Rather the onus is on the Festival Organizer to manage tdm’s  
including barriers and the Council carries out an auditing role in terms of the Licensing function.  
Enforcement of Health and Safety at work for the event is split between the Health and Safety  
Executive and the Council.  
# 9.3 rigging  
In special events, there are frequent occasions when décor pieces, lighting equipment, audio speakers,  
visual presentation equipment, and even performers must be suspended or flown over a stage and/or an  
audience. Of course, since this may occur both indoors or outdoors and typically from truss structures,  
rigging goes hand-in-hand with truss design and safety.  
To safely rig and fly equipment, a thorough knowledge of rigging hardware and methodology is necessary.  
If items are improperly rigged and flown, people can be killed! The intent of this section is to present a  
general overview of rigging, an explanation of some of the equipment that is commonly used in the special  
event environment, and a brief review of safety.  
# 9.3.1 overview  
Rigging involves setting up the necessary physical support system so that equipment and/or people  
may be raised to a height above the ground. In so doing, the rigger or qualified technician must  
attach support cable and hoisting equipment to hanging points in the ceiling of a venue—and for  
easier understanding we will consider only indoor events for this section. These are specially  
strengthened structural locations in the building that permit the hanging of heavy objects up to  
certain load limits. Usually, the ceiling of a venue is equipped at these locations with bracketry or bolts  
for this purpose. Riggers need to know the proper methods of securing items like cable \(wire rope\) to  
this bracketry and then to other objects \(e.g. trussing for lighting\) without the possibility of slippage or  
cable or bolt breakage.  
Overloading a line \(e.g. cable\) poses a serious threat to the safety of personnel, not to mention the heavy  
losses likely to result through damage to material. To avoid overloading, the rigger must know the strength  
of the rigging system and components used in it. This involves three factors\: breaking strength, safe working  
load, and safety factor. Breaking strength refers to the tension at which a line will part when a load is  
applied. Breaking strength has been determined through tests made by cable manufacturers, and tables  
have been set up to provide this information. The safe working load \(SWL\) of a line is the load that can be  
applied without causing any kind of damage to the line. A wide margin of difference between breaking  
strength and SWL is necessary to allow for such factors as additional strain imposed on the line by jerky  
movements in hoisting or bending over sheaves in a pulley block. The safety factor of a line is the ratio  
between the breaking strength and the SWL. Safety factors will vary, depending on such things as the Miscellaneous teCHnical resources **315**  
condition of the line and the circumstances under which it is to be used. The safety factor is usually  
between four and ten.  
Rick Smith, the president of Riggit Services Inc. in Vancouver, Canada, a certified rigger with over 25 years  
of experience in event rigging, notes that before rigging begins, the load rating of the venue hanging points  
has to be in writing from either the venue or from an engineer. He cautions that too often the somewhat  
hazy corporate memory of either venue staff or older technicians is the source of a load rating, and that is  
neither professional nor safe \(R. Smith, personal communication, September 7, 2006\).  
# 9.3.2 rigging equipment  
Rigging and its ancestry derive from the theater world and go as far back as the ancient Greeks,  
with a myriad of ropes, cables, pulleys, and lifting equipment designed for that environment. For  
simplicity of understanding, we will restrict our discussion to basic attachment hardware and flying  
methods.  
# 9.3.2.1 Basic attachment hardware  
The most common hardware used for events includes\:  
● Wire rope. “Often called cable, this is the most common method of attaching gear to ceilings.  
Wire rope is a material made \[of several strands\] of thin steel wire groups. Different types of wire  
rope exist, the main differences being the arrangement of the wires, and the type of steel used. One  
type of wire rope used frequently is called hoisting cable, and is typically of 6 x 19 construction. This  
means that there are 6 larger strands of 19 wires each. Hoisting cable is often used in fly systems,  
as it is strong and flexible. Aircraft cable is another type of wire rope that is used often in theater  
applications. It is usually 7 x 19 construction, and is more flexible and stronger than hoisting  
cable. Aircraft cable is made out of specially processed steel that has a very high tensile strength”  
\(Richardson, 2000\).  
● Thimbles, wire rope clips, and swages. “Any time the wire rope needs to be attached to a hang point  
that would cause the cable to sharply bend, a device called a thimble must be used. Thimbles simply  
guide the cable into a natural curve shape and offer a degree of protection to the cable in the loop. To  
secure the end of the rope, wire rope U-clips are used. These clips provide an effective means for  
terminating cables . . . Another method for securing the ends of wire rope is through the use of swages,  
or nicopress sleeves. Small metal sleeves are pressed on to the wire rope with a special tool. These sleeves  
are permanent, but act much in the same way that clips do. When properly applied, swages can hold  
the full rated working load of the cable they are attached to” \(Richardson, 2000\).  
● Shackles, turnbuckles and hooks. “A wide variety of additional rigging hardware exists for various  
tasks. Turnbuckles are used in situations where small adjustments need to be made in the length of a  
cable. Usually turnbuckles are not used to bear load, but rather in tensioning guy wires. Shackles  
are often used with locking hooks to connect between wire rope and nylon harnesses or rope” \(Richardson,  
2000\).  
● Chain. Chain is typically used in conjunction with pulleys or chain motors to raise trussing on which  
luminaires, audio speakers, or other equipment may be attached. It is important to note that only  
welded-link steel chain should be used to bear loads, and the load capacity of the chain should be verified  
to ensure it can carry the anticipated load.  
● Slings. “One of the most common ways to hang truss for flying is through the use of slings made of a  
synthetic material such as polyester. A modern sling consists of a synthetic fiber core encased in a woven Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**316** synthetic casing, \[although slings may also be made of wire rope\]. Slings of this nature tend to be very  
strong and quite durable, and by nature conform to the shape of the load they are carrying . . . There  
are many acceptable methods for attaching slings to the truss to fly it. The most common involves the  
use of four slings. When the truss is flown point-down, a choker scheme is used, whereby the sling wraps  
through itself and around the truss” \(Richardson, 2000\).  
# 9.3.2.2 Flying methods  
There are generally two main methods used to fly equipment or people in special events\:  
● Chain and pulleys. In certain situations with relatively light loads, a pulley system is attached to the  
ceiling hanging point and a heavy-duty chain as described above is run through the pulleys. There are  
usually two pulleys or more on a length of truss if the length is a long one. The pulley system is  
mechanically advantaged which means that when it is pulled by hand to raise the trussing, the actual  
weight pulled is much less than the weight of the truss.  
● Chain motor. Likewise, a motor may be substituted for the pulleys. “A chain motor is simply a large  
electric motor with a gearbox and a chain drive mounted in one chassis. The chassis of the motor  
generally has a large hook mounted on its underside, to which loads are attached. An extremely  
heavy gauge chain with a hook at one end passes through the motor and into a chain bag. The hook  
of this chain is generally clipped to the shackle of a wire rope sling \[or other type\], which is attached  
to a load-bearing overhead beam \[or hanging point, usually an eye-bolt\]. Once the attachment has  
been made to an overhead hang point, the motors can have loads attached for flying” \(Richardson,  
2000\). The motor is then controlled to raise or lower the truss by handheld controls, sometimes  
called pickles, located on the floor. It is important, notes Smith of Riggit Services in Vancouver, to  
ensure that all phases of a chain motor are in synch. Otherwise the motor may inadvertently reverse  
when the switch is pushed, causing older motors with no safety mechanism to literally “eat” the chain  
and hook.  
See Figure 9.5 for an example of rigged trussing. Several points are worth noting in this example. In the  
top image, this rear truss \(the stage is to the right of, or in front of, the truss\) has already been fitted with  
chain motors. Three motors out of four total, along with their chain bags, can be seen above the truss with  
the chains extending to the ceiling. Note also that three A-V screens can be seen already attached via wire  
rope slings to the truss, in addition to some luminaires that are harder to see, and black masking drape on  
the front side of the truss. In the lower image, this long truss line can be seen fully raised at the rear of  
the stage and the four chain motors, five A-V screens, luminaires, two long drape sections, and masking  
drape that it supports are clearly visible. As well, there is a front truss with multiple luminaires and  
masking drape that was raised using only chains and pulleys, four of which can be seen mounted above  
the truss.  
When working with chain motor/truss combinations, technicians and producers must understand the  
exact definition of trim height, which is the final height above the ground or floor that the rigged equipment  
\(e.g. lighting truss\) must reside. There are as many as three different interpretations of the term and it is  
important that everyone involved understands the definition being used. As shown in Figure 9.6, the venue  
trim is the height above the floor to the lowest attachment point in the ceiling, the highest trim to truss or  
low trim is the distance from the floor to the bottom of a standard 16 in. \(40 cm\) truss, and the lighting trim  
is the distance from the floor to the lights or, in some cases, A-V equipment \(e.g. projectors\). Those  
involved have to understand that there must be space allowed for the wire ropes, hooks, chain motors, and  
chains between the ceiling and the truss. Miscellaneous teCHnical resources **317**

# P r od u c t i o n Wa r S t o ry  
# Stage roof collapse in Turkey  
When the roof first started going up for a multi-day festival in Turkey, I noticed a few things  
that worried me about the setup. Since all my rigging experience had been in ballrooms, tents,  
and convention centers and I had never worked with a self-climbing truss stage roof before,  
I didn’t feel qualified to raise issue with the setup. However, some things that seemed unsafe  
included\:  
● The tower feet were placed on 6 in. x 6 in. pieces of ½ in. ply, not much bigger than the feet  
themselves.  
● Truss was Thomas Supertruss and the crew wasn’t using the safety clips on the truss pins.  
● The roof was supported only at the peak. There were no support beams running from the peak  
to the sides, only a couple of steel cables in an “X.” Thus the roof sagged and collected water.  
The crew used a pole to push the roof up so that the water would run off!  
On the opening day of the festival, about an hour before the start, there was a sudden thunder-  
storm. There were massive lightning strikes in the mountains all around us \(imagine my anger when  
I found the grounding stake was attached to the generator with 12-gauge wire!\), and a massive  
amount of water started coming down. Everyone around the stage immediately got under the  
roof as the water coming down was as intense as anything I’d ever seen, including my times in the Miscellaneous teCHnical resources **319**  
Amazon basin. Within minutes there were large puddles of water all over the field and everything  
not under the roof was soaked.  
This went on for about 4–5 min. Suddenly, the rain turned to hail, about the size of dimes. And it  
was coming down hard! A cry went out to look at the roof. We looked up and there was a small  
lake on the roof, which was growing rapidly, with another on the other side but smaller. The sticks  
the crew was using earlier to clear water were now too short to reach the roof at trim, so they sent  
a couple of guys up into the truss to attempt to relieve the strain somehow. Within minutes the  
lake had grown to what I would estimate to be about 400 gal. The tarp was stretching between  
the peak and the side truss to allow this. One of the guys in the truss went to cut the tarp, but  
the company owner told him not to. It looked as if the tarp was going to break and dump a ton  
of water onto the stage.  
Suddenly, there was a “grrrunnnk” sound from the truss. I looked up to see that the truss piece  
creating the side of the roof had bent. At either end, near the corner blocks, the truss had bent,  
allowing the center section of the truss to pull inward about 2–3 ft. The upside-down boil on the  
tarp just kept growing as it stretched and filled with water and hail. At this point I decided to  
abandon ship and took a flying leap off the front of the stage. I turned around to see at least half  
the people still under the roof staring at the boil! I started screaming, “The roof is going to fall!  
Get out of the way,” but they didn’t listen. Thirty seconds later the roof collapsed on them. The  
bent section of truss gave way and we ended up with a huge mess. Amazingly, nobody died or  
was even hurt! And remember the two guys who were climbing the truss? They both jumped to  
safety! Thank God they weren’t wearing safety harnesses.

# 9.3.3 rigging safety  
As already mentioned, every year serious accidents occur around the world, from workers falling off  
platforms to trussing collapses, many resulting in serious injuries or death. In a lot of these cases, truss  
loads were not calculated properly, risks were not assessed, and standards were not followed, leading to  
lawsuits and frequently considerable grief. The person at the leading edge of ensuring that equipment is  
safely lifted above the ground is the rigger. Everything he or she does must be of the highest quality and  
must adhere to all safety regulations and standards.  
If equipment is to be rigged and flown at an event, it will often fall within the producer’s responsibility  
area to hire the rigging company either directly or through a subcontractor and to ensure that they are  
qualified. Indeed, everyone in the chain of command must ensure that correct safety factors are used, and  
that they incorporate the manufacturer’s design loading for the equipment, the truss supplier’s calculations  
for truss loading, the rigger’s calculations for safety factors and choice of supporting material that ensures  
the right factor, and finally, the producer’s guarantee that this has been done correctly. To avoid potential  
liability, this implies that the producer should demand a paper trail from the rigger and trussing supplier  
for all calculations and equipment load limits, preferably contractually, following the methodology  
explained in Chapters 6 and 8 of Special Event Production\: The Process.  
Fortunately, the rigging qualification process has improved from what it was ten years ago. There is  
now a North American, industry-wide certification program by the Entertainment Services and  
Technology Association \(ESTA, http\://etcp.plasa.org\). This program, called the Entertainment Technician  
Certification Program \(ETCP\), requires that riggers pass a knowledge exam as well as accumulating a **320** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
specific number of experience-based points. Most knowledge is acquired by experience in this field although  
some training programs are starting to emerge \(Tilson, 2014\). There are two certification categories\: ETCP  
Certified Rigger – Arena and ETCP Certified Rigger – Theatre. For the special events industry, the arena  
certification is the desired one. It encompasses rigging that employs chain hoists and truss systems to  
temporarily suspend objects from overhead structures in any environment. ETCP recognizes that these  
methods and hardware are used throughout the entertainment industry in arenas, convention and trade  
show spaces, and in theatrical venues. It is strongly recommended that producers only work with such  
qualified individuals.  
Otherwise, there are numerous standards and guidelines that have been developed over recent years to  
ensure safety in rigging operations. These include\:  
● Chapter 18 of Cooper \(2014\) on Rigging. This provides an excellent overview of what is involved in  
generating a rigging plan and what a producer should be aware of. It is applicable to the United States  
but is informative for other countries.  
● ANSI E1.1 – 2012\: Entertainment Technology – Construction and Use of Wire Rope Ladders.  
● ANSI E1.4-2014\: Entertainment Technology – Manual Counterweight Rigging Systems.  
● ANSI E1.6-1 – 2012\: Entertainment Technology – Powered Hoist Systems.  
● ANSI E1.6-2 – 2013\: Entertainment Technology – Design, Inspection, and Maintenance of Electric Chain Hoists  
for the Entertainment Industry.  
● ANSI E1.6-3 – 2012\: Selection and Use of Chain Hoists in the Entertainment Industry.  
● ANSI E1.6-4 – 2013\: Portable Control of Fixed-Speed Electric Chain Hoists in the Entertainment Industry.  
The above are US standards, and also apply to Canada. Interestingly, in Canada, only the province of  
Ontario appears to have developed unique safety guidelines that apply to the live performance industry  
\(see Ontario Ministry of Labour, 2013\). Europe and the UK have also developed similar standards as  
follows\:  
● CWA 15902-1\:2010\: Lifting and Load-bearing Equipment for Stages and other Production Areas within the  
Entertainment Industry – Part 1\: General requirements \(excluding aluminium and steel trusses and towers\). Created  
by the European Institute for Standardisation \(CEN\), this document applies to machinery and machinery  
installations with guided or unguided load bearing and load carrying equipment used in places of  
assembly and in staging and production facilities for events and theatrical productions \(stage machinery,  
for short\). Such facilities include\: theaters; multi-purpose halls and exhibition halls; film, television,  
and radio studios; concert halls; schools; bars and discotheques; open-air stages; and other rooms for  
shows and events.  
● DIN 56950-1\:2012\: Entertainment technology – Machinery installations – Part 1\: Safety requirements and  
inspections. This is also a European standard \(originally German\). Machinery installations are  
designed for use in events and the production setup of technical equipment and facilities which are used  
for lifting and lowering, holding and driving of loads \(e.g. decorative parts, trusses, lighting, sound, and  
visual technology equipment\). At least part of this standard may be included in the CWA 15902  
standards.  
● BS 7905-1\:2001\: Lifting equipment for performance, broadcast and similar applications. Specification for the design  
and manufacture of above stage equipment \(excluding trusses and towers\). This is a British standard and at least  
part of it may be included in the CWA standards.  
● Construction Design and Management \(CDM\) Regulations 2015. These are regulations created by the HSE  
in the UK. They lay down the general responsibilities and competencies for health and safety for all  
levels of construction projects. Those responsible include clients, designers, supervisors, contractors,  
and workers. Important to note is that these are regulations, and as such, are enforceable by law. Miscellaneous teCHnical resources **321**  
Although still in draft form at the time of this book’s writing, it is expected that they will be promulgated  
with few changes. They implement a European directive and expand on the previous regulations from  
2007 to now include the entertainment industry and hence special events. The ramifications could be  
far-reaching and serious for those companies not following strict risk management policies as far as  
temporary structures are concerned \(e.g. truss structures and the rigging that is entailed\). However, in  
the HSE’s own words, “duty-holders who currently have effective arrangements in place to manage risk  
arising from construction activities will need to do little more to comply with CDM 2015” \(HSE, 2014\).  
Whether similar regulations are put into place in other countries, including North America, remains to  
be seen.  
# 9.4 other temporary structures  
For outdoor events, there is one final technical area that occasionally falls under the supervision of the  
event producer and that is temporary structures \(other than tents, stages, and truss structures that have  
already been covered\). For this section, we will reserve discussion to scaffolding, bleachers, fencing or  
barricades, and portable washrooms, including a review of safety and design standards for each. By  
definition, the term demountable structures is often used in conjunction with temporary structures,  
particularly sectionalized ones, that can be assembled and disassembled easily and quickly for portability  
\(e.g. stages, tents, fencing, scaffolding, box truss arrangements, and bleachers\).  
# 9.4.1 Scaffolding  
Although the term is used in other contexts, scaffolding in our industry is a temporary framework used  
to support people and equipment. Some of these structures include stages with or without roofs  
\(similar to truss structures but with different components\), catwalks, bleacher seats, seating risers,  
audio speaker towers \(capped if necessary\), camera platforms, towers, ramps, and jumps. See Figure 9.7  
for examples.  
# 9.4.1.1 Construction  
Scaffolding is usually a modular system of metal pipes and wooden boards, although it can be made out  
of other materials. Pipes are either steel or aluminum. If steel they are either black or galvanized. The pipes  
come in a variety of lengths and a standard diameter of 1.90 in. \(known as 1.5 NPS pipe in North America\),  
or 48.3 mm. Couplers are the fittings that hold the pipes together. Boards provide a working surface for users  
of the scaffold. They are made of seasoned wood and come in various thicknesses and widths. As well as  
boards for the working platform, there are sole boards that are placed beneath the scaffolding if the surface  
is soft or otherwise suspect.  
The key elements of a scaffold are standards, ledgers and transoms. The standards, also called  
uprights, are the vertical tubes that transfer the entire mass of the structure to the ground  
where they rest on a square base plate to spread the load. The base plate has a shank in its centre  
to hold the tube and is sometimes pinned to a sole board. Ledgers are horizontal tubes which  
connect between the standards. Transoms rest upon the ledgers at right angles. Main transoms are  
placed next to the standards, they hold the standards in place and provide support for boards;  
intermediate transoms are those placed between the main transoms to provide extra support for  
boards.  
As well as the tubes at right angles, there are cross braces to increase rigidity. These are placed  
diagonally from ledger to ledger, next to the standards to which they are fitted. If the braces are  
fitted to the ledgers they are called ledger braces. To limit sway a facade brace is fitted to the face **322** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
of the scaffold every 30 m \[100 ft\] or so at an angle of 35º–55º running right from the base to  
the top of the scaffold and fixed at every level.  
\(Scaffolding, 2014\)  
# 9.4.1.2 Safety  
In the United States, the OSHA has very specific standards for the construction and use of scaffolding in  
the workplace, and many large commercial and government construction projects require all workers to  
have scaffold training and OSHA certification. The main standards applying to general industry \(i.e. special  
events\) are Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations \(CFR\) Part 1910.28\: Safety Requirements for Scaffolding and Title  
29 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1926, Subpart L\: Scaffolds. There are also a number of others that pertain  
to specific industries and producers should ensure that the correct standards are being followed by  
consultation with their subcontractors and the OSHA. Some of the OSHA regulations regarding construction  
of scaffolding include using specific types of lumber when not using steel, weight limitations based on the  
design of the scaffolding, and regular checks for weakened or broken sections.  
In Canada, the responsibility for scaffold safety rests with each province and each one has individual  
standards that require compliance, although SIAC \(2011\) provides an excellent and detailed checklist as  
a starting point. General safety guidelines are given by the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and  
Safety \(CCOHS\), but these are not enforceable, unlike the provincial standards. Producers should obtain  
copies of their provincial standards to ensure compliance.  
In the UK, there are several publications that cover both safety and design\:  
● HSG 150\: Health and Safety in Construction \(2006\) published by the HSE is the main standard for safety.  
● BS EN 12811 – 1\:2003 – Temporary works equipment. Scaffolds. Performance requirements and general design.  
This is both a UK and European standard for the construction of scaffolding.  
● TG20\:13 Good Practice Guidance for Tube and Fitting Scaffolding. This is a set of technical guidelines  
published in 2014 by the National Access and Scaffolding Confederation in the UK that incorporates an  
operational guide and a design guide. It is intended to facilitate compliance with BS EN 12811 and is  
backed by the HSE.  
In Australia, the guiding document for safety is the General guide for scaffolds and scaffolding work \(2014\)  
published by Safe Work Australia. It provides information for persons conducting a business or undertaking  
on how to manage the risks associated with scaffolds and scaffolding work at a workplace. It is also  
supported by specific guidance material for\: common types of scaffolds and scaffolding, suspended \(swing  
stage\) scaffolds, and scaffold inspection and maintenance. As well, a separate information sheet, Tower and  
mobile scaffolds, provides advice for small businesses and workers on managing the risks associated with  
tower and mobile scaffolds and related scaffolding work.  
# 9.4.2 Bleachers  
Bleachers used for outdoor events can be easily transportable, even with wheels attached, in small  
versions of three or four rows only, or transportable using a specially designed trailer in larger versions  
of up to about ten rows. Other higher capacity versions must be constructed in place \(see Figure 9.7\).  
They are not to be confused with the chair and riser combination that is used indoors mentioned in  
Chapter 7.  
# 9.4.2.1 Construction  
Although not completely consistent with all manufacturers, bleachers generally have a rise of 8 in. \(20 cm\)  
and seats have a rise above the tread or foot plank of 17 in. \(43 cm\). Low rise bleachers have a rise of 6 in. Miscellaneous teCHnical resources **323**  
**Figure 9.7** Examples of scaffolding structures for events

euroarenasport.com  
\(15 cm\). The run is the distance between seats, typically being 24 in. \(60 cm\), and is affected by the number  
of foot planks. Foot planks or rests for feet can be either single or double meaning that there is more room  
for one’s feet on a double plank. Seat sizes are 1.5 to 2.0 in. x 9.5 to 10.0 in., all usually constructed of  
anodized aluminum with end caps. Guardrails are usually anodized pipe, 1.5 to 1.675 in. \(3.75 to 4.2 cm\)  
diameter and 42 in. \(106 cm\) high. These are normally fitted to the backs, sides, stairs, and fronts of  
bleacher sections. Sections also come in more or less standard sizes of 3, 5, 10, and 15-row x 15 ft \(4.5 m\)  
sections, elevated or non-elevated, with various guardrail options, as well as accessibility options \(i.e. ramps\) **324** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
to meet Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\) requirements. Note that non-elevated bleachers are a type  
of bleacher that when seated on the first row, one’s feet are at ground level, whereas elevated bleachers  
have the first row elevated above the ground and accessible by stairs and/or a ramp. Supporting bleacher  
superstructure is generally of a scaffolding-type construction.  
# 9.4.2.2 Safety  
The current guiding standard for the design, construction, and inspection of portable bleachers in the  
United States is contained in ICC/ANSI 300-2012\: Standard for Bleachers, Folding and Telescopic Seating, and  
Grandstands. The International Code Council \(ICC\) initiated the development of this stand-alone  
standard to address bleacher safety, after the issue was highlighted when two US congressional  
representatives petitioned the Consumer Product Safety Commission to develop such regulations,  
following a study of deaths and injuries resulting from falls from bleachers. For example, in 1999 in the  
United States, there were an estimated 22,100 bleacher-associated injuries treated in hospital emergency  
rooms. Approximately 6,100 of these injuries were a result of the person falling from, or through, bleachers  
onto the surface below. Approximately 4,910 of these falls involved children under the age of 15 \(US  
Consumer Product Safety Commission, 2000\). In particular, the standard addresses the need for a solid  
riser plank to be mounted vertically under the seats and behind the foot plank in order to close the opening  
that would enable small children to fall to the ground. Also, any bleacher seats above 30 in. \(75 cm\) require  
guardrails. Obviously, event producers must be aware of and meet the requirements of this standard to  
avoid liability.  
One other important standard is NFPA 102\: Standard for Grandstands, Folding and Telescopic Seating, Tents, and  
Membrane Structures, 2011 Edition, which covers the design of bleachers from a safety point of view.  
In Canada, the National Building Code of Canada 2010 covers bleacher safety. Accessibility for persons with  
disabilities is covered by standards in both countries listed below, and must be followed for bleachers\:  
● 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design for the United States.  
● Canadian Standards Association \(CSA\) B651-12 – Accessible design for the built environment for Canada.  
In the UK, the main document would again be Temporary demountable structures. Guidance on procurement,  
design and use \(Third Edition\) \(2007\).  
In Australia, there appear to be no detailed guidelines, although the Employer Guide to Occupational Health  
and Safety \(2004\) published by the Australian Entertainment Industry Association \(AEIA\) further refers  
to HSG195 from the UK, The Purple Guide to Health, Safety and Welfare at Music and Other Events.  
# 9.4.3 Fencing and barriers  
For special events, especially those outdoors, temporary fencing and barriers are generally utilized for  
crowd control. Even for large indoor events, they can be critical to providing an organized, less stressful  
experience for guests and attendees. We will briefly look at the various types of fencing and barriers and  
then at safety.  
# 9.4.3.1 Categories and construction  
Crowd control fencing and barriers come in many designs but can be fitted into three main categories\:  
● Low height. This category of fence is most often used within an event space to delineate exhibits,  
ticketed sub-events, VIP areas, concessions, and such. There are generally two models, one regular and  
constructed of steel. Sections for this type are 8+ ft wide x 43 in. high \(2.4 m x 108 cm\). The second Miscellaneous teCHnical resources **325**  
type is an upscale model usually constructed of steel supports and wood, or steel supports and PVC.  
Sections are typically 6 ft \(1.8 m\) wide and 32 to 48 in. \(80–120 cm\) high. The sections of both types  
are designed to interlock.  
● Perimeter. The second category of crowd control fence is a higher, more durable design, used primarily  
as event perimeter fencing. This type is constructed of welded steel mesh and steel tubing of  
varying designs. Section heights are fairly standard at 7 ft 6 in. \(2.25 m\) and widths vary from 4 to  
10 ft \(1.2–3 m\). Accessories include interlocking clamps, heavy bases, gates \(with wheels\), and privacy  
screens that can be installed over the entire fence surface. These screens are made of a PVC-coated nylon  
mesh with an open weave to allow wind to pass through.  
● Barrier. Originally designed in Europe, the third category is often called a barrier and is used for heavy-  
duty crowd control typically at outdoor rock concerts in front of a stage. In this case it is called a  
front-of-stage barrier \(FOSB\), stage barrier, or crowd barrier. Barriers can come in lightweight or heavy-duty  
versions, usually constructed of aluminum or steel respectively, the steel type being used for larger  
events where higher spectator loading is anticipated. Modern barriers are of A-frame construction in  
profile, and rely on a tread plate \(ideally with a tapered lip to prevent tripping\) in front to maintain their  
stability and to withstand the forces associated with crowd crushes and surges. They are normally  
freestanding but if used outdoors, they may be fixed to a stage using couplers, providing the stage is  
also built to withstand the lateral crowd forces. The rear of the barrier is usually fitted with a step to  
enable crowd control officials \(called event stewards, who require certification in Europe\) to monitor  
crowd activity and to assist with lifting crowd surfers and audience members in distress out of harm’s  
way if necessary. Dimensions are nominally 4 ft \(1,200+ mm\) high x 43 in. \(1,070+ mm\) wide x 50 in.  
\(1,242+ mm\) deep, although there might be slight differences amongst manufacturers. Railings should  
be rounded or covered to prevent injury to persons leaning on them or being lifted over them. Lightweight  
aluminum barrier sections usually weigh in the order of 35–38 kg \(77–83 lb\) and can withstand  
horizontal forces of 2 kN \(450 lb\) or more, whereas heavy-duty steel barrier sections weigh about  
65 kg \(145 lb\) and can withstand horizontal forces of up to 8 kN \(1798 lb\) or more. Sections lock  
together and fold up for easy storage and transport.  
See Figure 9.8 for examples of the different categories of fencing and barriers.  
# 9.4.3.2 Safety  
For fencing and barriers, there are no current specific safety or design standards in North America, although  
most fencing is manufactured using approved steel or aluminum products. Chapter 23 of Cooper \(2014\)  
**Figure 9.8** Examples of fencing and barriers  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews **326** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
does, however, discuss the basics of working with fencing and barriers in the United States. The European  
design standard, EN 13200-3\:2005\: Spectator facilities – Part 3\: Separating elements – Requirements, appears to  
lead the way in this regard in Europe. As well, the Event Safety Guide \(see Säterhed et al., 2011\) from  
Sweden goes into extensive detail about barriers in particular.  
In addition, in the UK, there are several key references that offer guidance\:  
● Temporary Demountable Structures\: Guidance on design, procurement and use forms the basis for design and  
use of fencing and barriers.  
● HSG195\: The Purple Guide, also called The Event Safety Guide\: A Guide to Health, Safety and Welfare at Music  
and Similar Events, published by the HSE.  
● HSG154, Managing crowds safely\: A guide for organisers at events and venues \(2014\). This publication  
addresses very well how to manage crowds including the use of fencing and barriers. Also published by  
the HSE.  
● The HSE web site itself has a one-page summary of how to use stage barriers that is quite detailed \(visit  
www.hse.gov.uk/event-safety/stage-barriers.htm\).  
In Australia, the document Guidelines for concerts, events and organised gatherings \(2009\) published by the  
Department of Health in the Government of Western Australia provides extensive detail about crowd  
control including specifics about barriers, especially stage barriers and their allowable loading.  
Indeed, the most concern for crowd—and event worker—safety is associated not with the first two types  
of fencing described, but with stage barriers and their use at live music events, especially rock concerts.  
Rutherford-Silvers \(2013\), Van Der Wagen and Carlos \(2005\), Tarlow \(2002\), and Fruin \(1993\), in  
particular, discuss crowds and the types of disasters that can result from crowd mentality. To put the  
seriousness of the potential for disaster in perspective, Fruin \(1993, p. 103\) states\:  
Crowd forces can reach levels that are almost impossible to resist or control. Virtually all crowd  
deaths are due to compressive asphyxia and not the ‘trampling’ reported by the news media.  
Evidence of bent steel railings after several fatal crowd incidents show that forces of more than  
4500 N \(1000 lb\) occurred. Forces are due to pushing, and the domino effect of people leaning  
against each other .  
.  
. Horizontal forces sufficient to cause compressive asphyxia would be more  
dynamic as people push off against each other to obtain breathing space .  
.  
. Experiments to  
determine concentrated forces on guardrails due to leaning and pushing have shown that a force  
of 30% to 75% of participant weight can occur. In a US National Bureau of Standards study of  
guardrails, three persons exerted a leaning force of 792 N \(178 lb\) and 609 N \(137 lb\) pushing.  
In a similar Australian Building Technology Centre study, three persons in a combined leaning  
and pushing posture developed a force of 1370 N \(306 lb\). This study showed that under a simu-  
lated ‘panic,’ five persons were capable of developing a force of 3430 N \(766 lb\).  
Suffice it to say, crowd disasters are a very real and serious risk at live events where music or other  
entertainment generates psychological pressures as well as physical ones. In Europe, studies have been  
ongoing for years about the best configuration for FOSB and have resulted in the optimum configuration—  
to date—of a convex barrier arrangement in front of the stage, often with two or three layers of barrier  
\(Upton, 2004 and updated by Upton, 2010\). The minimum distance between the stage and the first barrier  
layer must, according to current regulations in many jurisdictions, be at least 1.0 to 1.5 m \(3 to 5 ft\) to  
permit event stewards, security, and emergency personnel free access and to permit the fast extraction of  
crowd members in distress. This shape also permits escape routes at either end of the convex shape and  
minimizes the locations where concentrated points of force may occur as would happen in a straight or  
concave shaped barrier. Figure 9.9 illustrates a simple single convex barrier configuration. The optional  
straight barrier may be used when low crowd pressure is anticipated. Miscellaneous teCHnical resources **327**  
**Figure 9.9** Simple FosB configuration  
Courtesy of Säterhed et al., 2011—redrawn by author  
However, there is more than just pressure toward the stage to be concerned about. According to Petter  
Säterhed from Sweden, one of the most potent dangers in a large audience is side-to-side movement. If  
crowd density exceeds approximately 7 persons/m2, parrying a crowd surge \(i.e. by taking a side step\) gets  
difficult, resulting in the crowd cratering \(i.e. many people falling, in a crater-like fashion\). When the fallen  
audience gets up again, the crowd closes. This has historically trapped slow members of the crowd who  
are still lying down, putting them in severe danger of being trampled. In these cases, designing the FOSB  
with a wave-breaker—sometimes called a finger or pier—in the middle can be very effective \(Säterhed et al.,  
2011, p. 100 and P. Säterhed, personal communication, March 16, 2015\). See Figure 9.10.  
**Figure 9.10** FosB with finger  
Courtesy of Säterhed et al., 2011—redrawn by author  
For larger crowds, wave-breakers are combined with splitting up the crowd by creating enclosures, also  
called cages or pits, for smaller numbers of people and using double or multiple barriers. However, it is  
important to calculate the angles of the barrier correctly so that no audience member gets trapped in a  
dead-end against the barrier \(P. Säterhed, personal communication, March 16, 2015, and Säterhed et al.,  
2011, pp. 100–101\). This concept is illustrated in Figure 9.11, which shows the cages along with the  
barriers and walkways/escape routes between them. Also, according to Säterhed, it is important to limit  
the size of any enclosure for the audience in order to avoid crowd turbulence or quake, as reported by Helbing  
and Mukerji \(2012\). This is a situation in which the dense crowd is subjected to unpredictable forces from  
varying directions that can build up and result in audience members falling and piling up, which in turn  
exacerbates the problem. **328** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 9.11** Example of cages and wave-breakers  
Courtesy of Säterhed et al., 2011—redrawn by author  
The number and spacing of FOSB arrangements is largely dependent on the total audience size and  
demographics as well as the nature of the event, and event stewards or security professionals with  
experience in this type of event should be consulted before producers make the final decision on FOSB  
arrangements.  
# 9.4.4 Sanitary facilities  
Creature comforts, or rather the lack thereof, can form a lasting negative impression in the minds of event  
attendees. To prevent this, adequate sanitary facilities must be provided, no matter where the event is held.  
For outdoor events—and even large indoor ones—portable toilets may be rented on a short-term basis  
where sewer-connected sanitation and water are not readily available or adequate. It is often the  
responsibility of the event producer to estimate toilet needs and to make arrangements for their delivery,  
placement, and servicing.  
# 9.4.4.1 Equipment, location, and servicing  
The basic equipment consists of the portable toilet units and service trucks. The toilet unit is a small toilet  
room built over a water-tight waste holding tank. The service truck has a pump and a large tank which is  
divided into two compartments, one for fresh charge for use in cleaning the units and the other for receiving  
and transporting the effluent for proper disposal. At special events, toilet units are placed on a site and  
picked up when the event is completed. For big events with a large number of units, the service truck may  
remain onsite to provide continuous standby maintenance service, especially if the duration is long.  
Portable toilets are large enough for a single occupant, usually about 90–118 cm \(35–46 in.\) on a side by  
210–236 cm \(7–8 ft\) high. They are held upright by the weight of the disinfectant liquid in the holding  
tank at the bottom. Nearly all include both a seated toilet and a urinal. Most include lockable doors,  
ventilation near the top, and a stovepipe vent for the holding tank. Single-sex units and larger units for Miscellaneous teCHnical resources **329**  
wheelchair access compatible with ADA requirements are available. All are available in different colors  
and designs, depending on the manufacturer. Plastic, freestanding hand-washing units with four wash  
stations \(one on each side\) and equipped with paper towels and soap are now part of most portable toilet  
orders. Luxury units with more amenities are popular for smaller or VIP audiences. These incorporate  
separate stalls with doors, vanities and make-up areas, washbasins, and towels, all packaged within an  
attractive interior design.  
The keys to the successful incorporation of portable toilets into an event are\:  
● Correct estimation of the number of units needed. HSE \(1999\) recommends that, when estimating the  
number of units required at an event, consideration should be given to the duration of the event, the  
perceived consumption of food and beverages \(particularly alcohol\) by the audience, timing of breaks  
in entertainment performances, provision for children or elderly who make take longer to use a facility,  
and weather conditions and temperature. In addition, the ratio of women to men is essential to correctly  
estimating numbers.  
Determining the number of toilets required for an event is far from an exact science and numbers vary  
considerably, depending on the source. As would be expected, suppliers’ numbers are much higher than  
those coming from unbiased sources. To provide reasonably accurate estimates, for the purposes of this  
book, five different sources have been consulted and the resulting numbers averaged. Figures 9.12 and  
9.13 represent these combined averages of the sources \(Cooper, 2014; Government of Western Australia,  
2009; PSAI, 2013; White House Sanitation, 2011; United Site Services, 2014\), and can be used for  
general estimates of toilet units required when alcohol is or is not being served at the event. Note that  
the straight lines in these graphs are the trend lines of the averages and it is these lines that should be  
used. The graphs assume that\: the event lasts 8 h, there is a 50/50 mix of men and women, one unit  
provides approximately 200 uses with 4 h between uses by a single person, and there is no pumping  
service provided. Thanks to mathematics, we can derive equations from these trend lines that can be  
used to more exactly predict the number of toilets needed, where y represents the number of toilets and  
x the attendance, so that for less than 30,000 attendees, the equations are\:  
● y = 0.0071x + 2, for an event with no alcohol; and  
● y = 0.0096x + 3, for an event with alcohol.  
For an event with up to 100,000 attendees, the equations would be\:  
● y = 0.0079x + 14, for an event with no alcohol; and  
● y = 0.0091x + 11, for an event with alcohol.  
In addition to the number of toilet units, hand-wash stations should be provided in the ratio of  
approximately 20 percent of the total number of toilets \(i.e. for 100 toilets, 20 hand-wash stations are  
needed\), although many deluxe toilets now incorporate a station into every unit. The Government of  
Western Australia \(2009\), in its extensive event guidelines, also further recommends that for events  
with different durations, the following changes in numbers should be made\:  
● More than 8 h, 100 percent increase over graph values.  
● 6–8 h, 80 percent of graph values.  
● 4–6 h, 75 percent of graph values.  
● Less than 4 h, 70 percent of graph values.  
By way of an example to illustrate, let us assume that a festival is expecting an attendance of 25,000  
people at a 7-h event in which alcohol will be available at a beer garden. The number of toilets needed  
would therefore be\:  
● y = 0.0096x + 3, or 0.0096 \(25,000\) + 3 = 243 toilets, less 20 percent if one follows the Australian  
suggested guidelines for a 7-h event rather than an 8-h event, for a total of 194 toilets. **330** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
**Figure 9.12** Portable toilet requirements for an 8-h event \(total attendance up to 30,000\)  
Courtesy of Doug Matthews  
According to National Construction Rentals \(2014\), in the United States, federal and state guidelines  
also require one ADA toilet unit for each “cluster” of toilets, which works out to approximately  
10 percent of the entire order that should be disabled units. Event workers and employees must  
have their own dedicated facilities that should be located near work areas, specifically backstage,  
near the mixer tower, next to catering areas and car parks, and near first aid and children’s  
areas. Toilets with hot and cold hand-washing facilities should be provided for food handlers and  
should be at least 50 m from the vendors but no more than 20 m from a service road \(Säterhed et al.,  
2011, p. 126\).  
● Correct location of the units. Where possible, toilets should be located at different points around the  
event site to minimize crowding and queuing problems. Attention should be given to accessibility for  
servicing and emptying. This may include temporary roadways and dedicated access routes, subject to  
the site layout.  
● Regular servicing schedule. Depending on the type, portable toilet units have waste storage tank  
capacities ranging from about 150 l \(40 gal\) to 250 l \(65 gal\). On average, a single usage will deposit  
approximately 1.4 l \(0.37 gal\) of waste. Based on another average of 54 to 75 seconds per use \(men  
versus women\), smaller units may therefore require major service and emptying of toilet receptacles as  
frequently as every 2 h, or as infrequently as 4 h, but this may need to be monitored if some units receive  
heavier usage than others due to their location. At a minimum, units should be cleaned and checked for  
supply replenishment \(e.g. toilet paper\) at 2-h intervals, and a plumber should at least be on call for  
short events and onsite for longer events. Major service procedure involves driving the service truck to  
within approximately 20 ft \(6 m\) of the portable toilet, pumping or evacuating the effluent from the  
portable toilet receptacle into the truck holding tank, recharging the portable toilet receptacle, and  
performing minor repairs to the portable toilet as needed. Miscellaneous teCHnical resources **331**  
**Figure 9.13** Portable toilet requirements for an 8-h event \(total attendance 30,000 to 100,000\)

# 9.4.4.2 Safety and health considerations  
There are no known specific standards for portable toilets used at events; however, standards do exist for  
portables used on construction sites. Some state and provincial jurisdictions now classify all portable toilet  
waste as septage \(untreated waste that has not gone through a stabilization process, such as processing at  
a sewage treatment plant\), and any group or organization that has portable toilets onsite must use a  
licensed waste hauler to dispose of their waste. Clients have the right to demand that a waste hauler  
produce proof of a license.  
As well, some jurisdictions \(HSE, 1999\) require stable and non-slip surfaces, protection from trip hazards,  
and adequate lighting \(80 to 100 lux, depending on the jurisdiction\).  
In general, Cooper \(2014\), Government of Western Australia \(2009\), and HSE \(1999\) provide good overall  
advice on the use of portable toilets at events.  
Even with the estimates of required numbers of toilets as described in this section and the above safety  
considerations, producers should check with local authorities for the correct interpretation of local  
regulations, if any, for the numbers, locations, and servicing requirements of sanitation facilities.  
# p r od u c t i o n c h a l l e n g es  
**1.** You want to check the calculations of your lighting designer who has called for 100 A, three-  
phase service out of the following options presented by a venue in which you are producing a  
stage show\: **332** Special Event Production\: The reSourceS  
● 20 A, 120 V single-phase;  
● 30 A, 120 or 208 V single- or three-phase;

the lights he plans to use are older and include 20 Par64s @500 W, 16 Par64s @1,000 W, ten  
Source Four ellipsoidals @500 W for gobo projection, and eight automated Vari-lites @1,200 W  
for excitement. He plans to use a single dimmer system. Did he choose the correct option for  
electrical service?  
**2.** Research online any two major accidents at events in which truss structures have collapsed over  
the last two years anywhere in the world. Explain what you think might have gone wrong and  
what, if anything, you would do to prevent the accidents if you had been the event producer.  
**3.** You are producing an aerial ribbon act above a 3 ft high stage in a venue that has a 30 ft high  
ceiling. The ribbon must be suspended from a 16 in. square truss section that will be rigged  
from the ceiling using chain motors. The ribbon is 20 ft long and the performer needs a clear  
16 ft of ribbon to work on. The chain motor, chain, and hooks require 4 ft of vertical space once  
they are fully trimmed. Will there be enough vertical space for the performer to work and what  
is the final highest trim to truss?  
**4.** You are to produce a large outdoor festival for about 20,000 alternative music fans in a farmer’s  
open field with a single road access. There will be six musical acts performing on a mobile stage  
during the festival which lasts for 4 h on a Sunday afternoon. It will be a non-alcoholic event.  
Consider what you might need in terms of scaffolding, bleachers \(if any\), fencing, FosB, and  
portable toilets. Describe how these would all be used, how much or how many of each you  
might need, and where they might all be placed.  
**5.** As a producer, you must be concerned with the safety both of your workers and of the audience.  
List at least one safety standard or guideline for each of the technical resources discussed in this  
chapter and describe for whom it is relevant.
