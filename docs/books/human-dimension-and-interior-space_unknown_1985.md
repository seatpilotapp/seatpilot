**/SOURCES** **FOREWORD**  
# Over the past 30 years, physical anthropologists have been concerned  
# with the documentation and description of human body size variability  
# and its application to design. A significant problem continues to exist,  
# however, in the communication of such knowledge to the wide variety  
# of potential users, the design community.  
# The diversity of this group of users is broad, ranging from designers of  
# workspaces such as aircraft cockpits or offices, through pattern makers  
# and clothiers, to designers of respirators and other personal protective  
# equipment. Equally as diverse are the needs of the users. For example,  
# a designer of an office has little use for a dimension such as neck  
# circumference, while a clothier or pattern maker may consider it vital.  
# Furthermore, users often need information about different segments  
# of the population, perhaps about children, coal miners, college  
# students, office workers, factory workers, etc., and each user may  
# require a different type of analysis or data presentation. It is, therefore,  
# extremely helpful for the anthropologist to communicate effectively  
# with each of the many specialists within the specific framework of their  
# particular design problems.  
# It is thus very gratifying to find that the authors of this book, both  
# experienced professionals in their field, have taken on the complex  
# task of bridging the gap not only by bringing to architects and interior  
# designers much valuable anthropometric information in usable form  
# but, more importantly, by conveying so persuasively the concept that  
# untapped resources of relevant body size information exist and that its  
# use has much potential impact on the improvement of workspace and  
# residential design. In their presentation, the authors strike an excellent  
**balance, avoiding the pitfalls of overwhelming the reader with needless** **technical complexities and resisting the simple-minded approach**  
# which has so often in the past conveyed the mistaken impression that  
# a few tables of summary values will provide the answers to specific  
# design problems.  
# I have long been an advocate of relating the basic anthropometric data  
# to a specific designer’s needs, and the authors’ clear treatment for a  
# special audience is particularly gratifying. The real beneficiaries,  
# ultimately, will be office workers, small children, and handicapped  
# persons, to name but a few of the many consumer groups with  
# specialized needs.

# OWLEDGMENTS  
# Without certain published anthropometric information, this book  
# could not have been written. For this, we would like to express our  
# appreciation to Dr. Howard Stoudt, formerly of the Harvard School of  
# Public Health, and his colleagues, who in conjunction with Jean  
# Roberts of the U.S. Public Health Service prepared a study of the  
# weight, height, and selected body dimensions of adults. This study now  
# constitutes one of the most current and comprehensive sources of  
# published anthropometric data on the civilian population. Our  
# adaptation and metrication of this survey serves as the basis for many  
# of the design reference standards developed in Part C of the book. We  
# would also like to thank Dr. Stoudt, presently a member of the faculty  
# of the department of community health science at Michigan State  
# University, for the additional data he shared with us and for the  
# encouragement he provided during the early stages of the preparation  
# of this book.  
# With respect to published anthropometric information, we would be  
# remiss in our acknowledgment if we did not mention the three-volume  
***Anthropometric Source Book*, brilliantly compiled and edited for the**  
# National Aeronautics and Space Administration by Dr. John McConville  
# and his colleagues at the Anthropology Research Project, Inc., Yellow  
# Springs, Ohio.  
# The Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air  
# Force Base, Ohio, has also served as a fountainhead of information. We  
# are indebted to Charles E. Clauser, who is presently responsible for the  
# U.S. Air Force’s Anthropometry Program, and his colleagues, Dr.  
# Kenneth Kennedy and Milton Alexander, for their comments and  
**encouragement and for making some of their data available to us.** **We would also like to express our appreciation to three distinguished**  
# human factors engineers whose stimulating articles and books relating  
# to anthropometry and human factors roused our interest and curiosity  
# in investigating the architectural and interior design applications of  
# anthropometric data\: Archie Kaplan, Charles Mauro, and Wesley  
# Woodson.  
# Finally, we would like to thank Carl P. Mason of the Bio-Engineering  
# Research Laboratory of the Veterans Administration Prosthetics  
# Center; Dr. John Fruin, Research Engineer of The Port of New York and  
**New Jersey Authority and author of *Pedestrian Planning and Design*;**  
# and Professor Michael Trencher of the School of Architecture, Pratt  
# Institute, for sharing their technical knowledge with us in connection  
# with certain aspects of our research.  
# On a more personal note, our amazement and gratitude must be  
# expressed to Jamie Panero, the young son of one of the authors, who  
# with the tenacity of purpose of a graduate research assistant helped in  
# gathering data and was responsible for the metrication of much of the  
# data. A special tribute must also be made to a former student of  
# interior design of both authors, Pamela Kingsbury, who has shouldered  
# the major responsibility for the illustrations, graphics, charts, and  
# layouts. Not only has her technical skill and resourcefulness been of  
# the highest quality, but her unending allegiance to the development of  
# this project has transcended any human understanding of the term  
**“dedication.”** **PREFA**  
# CE  
# A potential danger in writing a book of this type is dealing with an area  
# of study too large to be treated satisfactorily. Human dimension and  
# interior space, by its very nature, is quite conducive to such an error in  
# judgment. No great leap of the imagination is required to acknowledge  
# the multitude of disciplines implied\: ergonomics, anthropometry,  
# biomechanics, architecture, interior design, environmental  
# psychology. The list is almost endless. Each discipline and subareas of  
# those disciplines could in themselves all qualify as legitimate topics for  
# an entire network of books.  
# The problem, therefore, is to avoid erring in the direction of too large an  
# area of study and risking superficiality or to treat the subject within too  
# narrow a frame of reference by limiting the material too severely. We  
# are hopeful that we have avoided these obvious pitfalls. The measure  
# of success, however, can best be determined within the context of the  
# purpose of this book.  
# The architectural and interior design professions have an abundance of  
# reference material dealing with general planning and design criteria.  
# Not enough of this material, however, addresses itself specifically to  
# the actual physical fit, or interface, between the human body and the  
# various individual components of interior spaces. Of the available  
# material, much is based almost exclusively on trade practices, many of  
# which are outdated, or on the personal judgments of those preparing  
# the standards. With few exceptions, most reference standards are  
# simply not predicated on enough hard anthropometric data.  
# This is understandable, given the minimal amount of such data  
**available, the form in which most of these data are presented, the** **general inaccessibility of such data to the interior designer and**  
# architect, and, until very recently, the lack of centralized reference  
# sources for such information. In partial defense, however, of the  
# pragmatic approach underlying the preparation of much of the design  
# standards currently in use, it should be recognized that the use of  
# anthropometric data is no substitute for good design or sound  
# professional judgment. It should be viewed as one of many design  
# tools.  
# Within recent years and arising out of the pressing need for such  
# information on the part of the equipment designer, industrial designer,  
# and human factors engineer, anthropometric data have become more  
# available. Not all the data are necessarily presented in the form most  
# appropriate for use by the architectural or interior design professions.  
# Nor are all the data necessarily applicable to the nature of the particular  
# design problems peculiar to these professions. Moreover, its  
# availability is still in terms of sources relatively foreign to the architect  
# and interior designer and requires referral to a large variety of such  
# sources for what data there are.  
# The important fact, however, is that anthropometric data are slowly  
# becoming more available, both on a national and international basis.  
# As the world population continues to grow, as our explorations of outer  
# space increase, as international trade and marketing of services and  
# products expands, and as society generally places more priority on the  
# quality of life, it is expected that the inventory of such data will become  
# even more abundant. Architects and interior designers should avail  
# themselves of these data and become more knowledgeable concerning  
# its applicability to the design process. In addition, they should provide  
# the anthropometrist with input, relative to the type and form of data  
# the profession requires.  
# In elaborating on the role industrial designers will play in the future  
# development of engineering anthropometry, Mauro indicates the  
**thrust of that role “is in defining their needs in terms that the research** **anthropometrist can understand.” The same should apply to the**  
# architect and interior designer.  
# The general objectives of this book, therefore, are as follows\:  
# 1\. To develop an awareness on the part of the architect, interior  
# designer, builder, manufacturer, and user of the importance of  
# anthropometry as it relates to human fit and interior space.  
# 2\. To provide the architect and interior designer with a basic  
# understanding of anthropometry and the nature, origins,  
# limitations, and proper application of the data involved.  
# 3\. To provide the architect and interior designer with a source of the  
# anthropometric data relevant to the nature of those design  
# problems most frequently encountered by those professions and to  
# present those data in an appropriate form.  
# 4\. Based on these anthropometric data, to provide the architect and  
# interior designer with a series of graphic design reference standards,  
# involving the interface of the human body with the physical  
# components of some of the prototypical interior spaces in which  
# people live, work, or play.  
**Accordingly, the book is divided into three major sections. *Part A***  
# familiarizes the architect and interior designer with the elements of  
# anthropometry in terms of theory, limitations, and application. In  
# addition, the special anthropometric problems of physically  
**handicapped and elderly people and of seating are also discussed. *Part***  
***B* consists exclusively of hard anthropometric data in the form of tables**  
**and related illustrations. *Part C* consists of a series of design reference**  
# standards. These standards are in the form of plans and sections of  
# prototypical interior spaces, showing the proper anthropometric  
# relationship between the user and the space.  
# During the course of developing the necessary research for this book,  
# we found that many of our reasons concerning the need for the  
**architect and interior designer to utilize anthropometric data as a tool** **in the design process were continually and in some instances,**  
# dramatically, reinforced. The urgency for so doing became ever more  
# apparent. We wanted to share some of what we learned and also offer  
# some suggestions for appropriate action that might be taken.  
# Accordingly, the Epilogue contains some jolting examples of how  
# insensitivity to human dimension in the design of various aspects of  
# interior space can result not only in discomfort to the user but, in  
**certain cases, in bodily injury and even death.** **INTRODUCTIO**  
# N  
# The fascination of philosophers, artists, theoreticians, and architects  
# with human body size dates back many centuries. In the only complete  
# treatise on architecture surviving from antiquity, Vitruvius, who lived in  
**1st century B.C. Rome, wrote\:**  
# For the human body is so designed by nature that the face, from the chin to the top of the  
# forehead and the lowest roots of the hair, is a tenth part of the whole height; the open  
# hand from the wrist to the tip of the middle finger is just the same; the head from the  
# chin to the crown is an eighth, and with the neck and shoulder from the top of the breast  
# to the lowest roots of the hair is a sixth; from the middle of the breast to the summit of  
# the crown is a fourth. If we take the height of the face itself, the distance from the bottom  
# of the chin to the underside of the nostrils is one third of it; the nose from the underside  
# of the nostrils to a line between the eyebrows is the same; from there to the lowest roots  
# of the hair is also a third, comprising the forehead. The length of the foot is one sixth of  
# the height of the body; of the forearm, one fourth; and the breadth of the breast is also  
# one fourth. The other members, too, have their own symmetrical proportions, and it was  
# by employing them that the famous painters and sculptors of antiquity attained to great  
# and endless renown.  
# … Then again, in the human body the central point is naturally the navel. For if a man  
# be placed flat on his back, with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses  
# centred at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the  
# circumference of a circle described therefrom. And just as the human body yields a  
# circular outline, so too a square figure may be found from it. For if we measure the  
# distance from the soles of the feet to the top of the head, and then apply that measure to  
# the outstretched arms, the breadth will be found to be the same as the height as in the  
**case of plane surfaces which are perfectly square.1**  
# Not only was Vitruvius concerned with proportions of the body, but  
**with their metrological implications. In alluding to Greek temple design** **he tells us, “Moreover, they collected from members of the human**  
# body the proportionate dimensions which appear necessary in all  
**building operations, the finger or inch, the palm, the foot, the cubit.2**  
# During the Middle Ages, Dionysius, monk of Phourna of Agrapha,  
**wrote of man’s body size as “nine heads tall,”3 and Cennino Cennini, a**  
# 15th-century Italian, described the length of a man as equal to his  
**width with arms extended.4 During the Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci**  
# created his famous drawing of the human figure, based on the  
# Vitruvian norm-man \(Figure I-1\). In the mid-19th century John  
# Gibson and J. Bonomi were also to reconstruct the Vitruvian figure  
# \(Figure I-2\), and later, more than 2000 years after Vitruvius wrote his  
# ten books on architecture, Le Corbusier was to revive interest in the  
**Vitruvian norm with his creation of Modular No. 1 \(Figure I-3\).** ***Figure I-1. Leonardo da Vinci’s famous drawing of the human figure based on the Vitruvian***

# No discussion of body size and proportion, however, would be  
# complete without mention of the so-called Golden Section, the name  
# given in the 19th century to the proportion derived from the divisions  
**of a line into what Euclid in 300 B.C. Greece called “extreme and mean**  
**ratio.”5**  
# According to Euclid, a line is cut in such a ratio only when the  
# “whole line is to the greater segment, so is the greater to the less.”  
**Although three terms, at least, are required for any proportion, what is** **unique about the Golden Section is that the third term of the**  
# proportion is equal to the sum of the other two.  
# So fascinating was this notion of the Golden Section that in the early  
# part of the 16th century, Luca Paccoli, a close friend of Leonardo and  
# probably the most famous mathematician of the time, wrote a book  
**about it called *Divina Proportione*6 \(divine proportion\) in which he**  
# endowed the Golden Section with many varied mystical properties in  
# both science and art. He contended, for example, that he could detect  
# “an aesthetic principle which is found in architectural forms, in the  
**human body, and even in the letters of the Latin alphabet.”7**  
# It has been claimed that the proportion of the so-called Golden Section  
# is far superior to all other proportions. Actual experiments are said to  
# indicate a preference, on the part of most people, for those proportions  
# closest to Euclid’s extreme and mean ratio. While it was employed as a  
# conscious element in architectural design during the Renaissance, the  
# architecture of antiquity, as well as that of the Middle Ages, may also  
# have been designed according to the proportion of the Golden Section.  
# More recently, its most enthusiastic supporter was Le Corbusier, who  
# in 1948 wrote a book dealing with proportions based on it.  
# The most fascinating observation about the Golden Section, however,  
# involves the human figure. If a horizontal line is drawn through the  
# navel, three different body measurements are produced, as illustrated  
# in Figure I-4. One represents stature, or the distance from the top of  
# the head to the floor. Another represents the distance from the navel  
# to the floor, while the third represents the distance from the top of the  
# head to the navel. It is contended that if actual measurements are  
# substituted for the letters indicated, the ratio of stature to the height of  
# the navel above the floor usually approximates 1.618. The proportion  
# of the three measurements conforms fairly closely to Euclid’s extreme  
**and mean ratio.** ***Figure I-4. The human body and the Golden Section.***  
# Despite Vitruvius’s attempts to relate the human body to the system of  
# measurements employed by the Greeks in the design of temples,  
# humanity’s basic concern with the human figure historically has been  
# more aesthetic than metrological, more involved with proportion than  
# with absolute measurements and function. Over the last several  
# decades, however, concern for human dimensions and body size, as  
**critical factors in the design process, has steadily increased. Nowhere** **has this concern been greater than in the field of *human factors***  
***engineering*, as it is called in the United States, or *ergonomics*, as it is**  
# referred to in Europe. It should be noted, however, that concern for  
# body size is only one of several areas of interest to the human factors  
# engineer, or ergonomist, due to the extremely complex nature of those  
# disciplines. According to one definition, “human engineering \(human  
# factors engineering, ergonomics, biotechnology\) is not a single  
# scientific discipline but a synthesis which integrates the biological  
# sciences—psychology, anthropology, physiology, and medicine—with  
**engineering.”8**  
# Ergonomics has been defined in one instance as “the technology of  
# work design” that “is based on the human biological sciences\:  
**anatomy, physiology and psychology.”9 In another instance, it is**  
# defined more simply as “an interdisciplinary science which studies the  
**relationships between people and their environments.”10**  
# Most agree  
# that both terms “human engineering” and “ergonomics” may be used  
# interchangeably, and during the course of this book, both terms will be  
# so used.  
# The application of human factors engineering has been typically  
# associated with highly complex and limited technological problems in  
# machine and equipment design. The problems have usually involved  
# relatively sophisticated man-machine interface situations\: the design  
# of control centers, aircraft cockpits, electronic consoles, and endless  
# numbers and types of military air, ground, and sea vehicles. Yet today  
# human factors engineering relates to the civilian sector as well. The  
# design of consumer products, work environments, transportation  
# vehicles, to name a few, all require human factors input.  
# The field was given enormous impetus during the Second World War  
# due to the compelling need to reconcile human capabilities with the  
# technological sophistication of military equipment. The possibility of  
# human error had to be eliminated. Equipment had to be operated at  
# maximum efficiency under the most trying of circumstances. Problems  
**facing the ergonomist ranged in complexity from a simple control,** **such as the push button, to complicated console designs for use under**  
# battle conditions. More recently, the ergonomist has had to cope with  
# physiological, psychological, and anthropometric \(the study of human  
# body measurement, which will be thoroughly discussed in Part A\)  
# aspects of design problems inherent in space travel. Of greatest  
# significance, however, was the basic realization and acceptance of the  
# idea that consideration of human factors constituted an integral part  
# of the design process.  
# Among the most important of these human factors is body size and  
**dimension as it relates to the so-called ergonomic fit, or the *ergofitting*,**  
# of the user to the environment—one aspect of the so-called man-  
# machine interface to which the ergonomist constantly alludes.  
# Most applications of human engineering have, in fact, been in the  
# industrial and military sectors. Unfortunately, the more mundane  
# applications, such as those found in the design of the interior spaces  
# within our homes, offices, health facilities, schools, etc., have been  
# relatively ignored. This is particularly ironic since much of the  
# underlying philosophy of human engineering is based on the premise  
# that everything is designed for people. Where else can the concept of  
# “designing from the man, out” make more sense than in the field of  
# architecture and interior design?  
# It is the purpose of this book, therefore, to focus on the  
# anthropometric aspects of ergonomics and to apply the related data to  
# the design of interior spaces. The application will take the form of  
# anthropometrically oriented design reference standards structured to  
# ensure a proper ergofitting of people to the interior environments in  
# which they may live, work, or play. These interior environments are all  
# utilized by individuals of varying body sizes, weight, age, and physical  
# condition. On a global basis, users may also reflect a wide range of  
# races, cultures, and ethnic backgrounds.  
# Despite the variables involved, however, the interface between the user  
**and the designed interior environment, or ergofit, must ensure** **comfortable, safe, and efficient enjoyment of that environment. Work**  
# surface heights in a kitchen, office, or home workshop; allowances for  
# seating around a dining or conference table; heights for shelves in an  
# apartment or library; corridor widths in a home or public building—all  
# must reflect the human factor of body size. In certain situations, we  
# are, for a number of reasons, required to design for a large mixed user  
# population. At the other extreme, we may be obligated to design for a  
# single user. In still other situations, the user may constitute a specific  
# group—young children, elderly people, college students, physically  
# disabled people, etc. It is obvious that if we are to respond responsibly  
# and sensitively to the design needs of the user, we must become more  
**aware of the metrology of body size and its ergonomic implications.** **DIMENSIO**

# NTHROPOMETRY  
# People’s historic involvement with body size was discussed in the  
# Introduction. However, the science dealing specifically with the  
# measurement of the human body to determine differences in  
**individuals, groups, etc., is termed *anthropometry*. Pioneering work in**  
# this field dates back to the Belgian mathematician, Quetlet, who in  
**1870 published his *Anthropometrie* and is credited not only with**  
# founding and formalizing the science, but also with having created the  
# term “anthropometry” itself. The origins of physical anthropology can  
# be traced even further back to the late 18th century and Linne, Buffon,  
# and White, who first developed the science of comparative racial  
# anthropometry.  
# During the course of time, a significant amount of anthropometric  
# data has been amassed. Unfortunately for the designer, however, the  
# thrust of much of the efforts in this area was for taxonomic purposes,  
# physiological studies, etc., and not primarily for the ergonomic  
# implications of body size. It was not until the 1940s that the need for  
# anthropometric data, generated in a variety of industrial fields, but  
# primarily in the aircraft industry, began to develop and increase. The  
# Second World War naturally provided much of the impetus, and even  
# today it is in the military-industrial sector that much of the  
# anthropometric research is generated. Although the discipline has  
# fallen within the purview of the anthropometrist, anatomist, or  
# ergonomist, it is time for the architect and interior designer to become  
# more aware of the data available and its applicability to the design of  
# interior spaces.  
# If anthropometry is viewed mainly as exercises in simple measurement  
# and nothing more, one might conclude that the dimensional data  
# could be gathered simply and effortlessly. Nothing, however, could be  
# further from the truth. There are many complicating factors and  
# difficulties involved. One such factor is that body sizes vary with age,  
# sex, race, and even occupational group. For example, Chart 1-1 shows  
**statistics on the statures \(body height\) of samples from various** **national groups. The variation in stature is quite significant, ranging**  
# from 160.5 cm, or 63.2 in, for the Vietnamese to a high of 179.9 cm,  
# or 70.8 in, for the Belgian—a range of 19.4 cm, or slightly more than  
# 7.5 in.  
aMean values except where ranges are given.  
# Chart 1-1. Statistics on the statures in centimeters and certain other characteristics of 26  
***samples. From Chapanis, Ethnic Variables in Human Factors Engineering.*** **Perhaps an even more dramatic example of ethnic variability, however,**  
# is a comparison of the difference in stature of the smallest males on  
# record with the largest, as shown in Figure 1-1. D.F. Roberts notes that  
# the former, the Pigmies of Central Africa, have a mean stature of 143.8  
# cm, or about 56.6 in, while the tallest males, for whom records are  
# available, are the Northern Nilotes of Southern Sudan, with a mean  
**stature of 182.9 cm, or 72 in—a range of 39.1 cm, or about 15.4 in.1**  
# Figure 1-1. Comparison of difference in stature of the tallest Northern Nilote of Southern Sudan  
# with the stature of the smallest Pigmy of Central Africa. Data from Chapanis, Ethnic Variables in  
***Human Factors Engineering.*** **Age is another significant factor in body size. Full growth, with respect**  
# to body dimensions, peaks in the late teens and early twenties for  
# males and usually a few years earlier for females. Subsequent to  
# maturity, body dimension for both sexes actually decreases with age,  
# as illustrated in Figure 1-2. In terms of the anthropometry of elderly  
# people, a study in England suggested that body size of elderly women  
# was smaller than the body size of young women. It was also pointed  
# out, however, that to some extent the difference could be attributable  
# not only to the fact that the elderly sample was obviously drawn from  
# an earlier generation but to the aging process itself. Another  
# conclusion of the study was the reduction in upward reach among  
# elderly people.  
# Figure 1-2. Relative change in height with age over the mean for men and women aged 18-24  
***years. Data from National Health Survey.*** **Socioeconomic factors also impact significantly on body dimensions.**  
# The nutrition available to those with higher incomes creates, for  
# example, freedom from childhood disease and contributes to body  
# growth, as illustrated in Figure 1-3. Socioeconomic status also reflects  
# a relationship to the availability of higher education. Accordingly,  
# studies made of college students almost always indicate higher  
# statures than noncollege individuals. Yet, within the same group,  
# variations in body size are so significant that “averages” are not  
# necessarily meaningful or sufficient. To all this must be added such  
# other considerations as the actual physical conditions under which  
# data are recorded. Was the subject clothed or nude? If clothed, was the  
# clothing light or heavy? Was the subject barefooted?  
# Figure 1-3. Bar graphs showing mean height and weight for U.S. children 6 to 11 years by  
***annual family income and education of parents. Data from National Health Survey.*** **Although there have been some national and international attempts at**  
# standardization among anthropometrists, with regard to terminology  
# and definitions, the lack thereof very often complicates the  
# interpretation and significance of the data recorded. Studies, therefore,  
# must often include descriptions of techniques used and diagrams  
# necessary to clearly define the actual points from which  
# measurements were taken. There is no doubt that anthropometric  
# studies are no less sophisticated or tedious than other investigations  
# in the biological sciences. When one considers that the  
# anthropometrist must also be knowledgeable in the area of statistical  
# methodology, the complexity and tediousness of the discipline is  
# underscored even more. It is also obvious that those individuals taking  
# and recording body measurements must be properly trained.  
# To the interior designer, architect, and industrial designer, however, it  
# should be evident that the same factors that contribute to the  
# complexity and tediousness of the discipline of anthropometry also  
# necessitate a very cautious approach in the application of the data  
# generated. It is essential, therefore, that the designer have some  
# understanding of anthropometrics, its basic vocabulary, the nature of  
# the data available, the forms in which it is usually presented, and the  
**restraints involved in their application.** **1.2 SOURCES OF DATA**  
# Generally, the collection of anthropometric data is a costly, time-  
# consuming, and relatively cumbersome undertaking, requiring skilled  
# observers, particularly if the objective is to obtain a truly representative  
# national sampling. Accordingly, most of the research in this area has  
# been related to the military rather than the civilian sectors of the  
# world’s population. The reasons are obvious. First, it is within these  
# sectors that a compelling need for anthropometric data exists in order  
# to properly equip and clothe the respective armies, navies, and air  
# forces. Second, there exists a national and almost infinite reservoir of  
# available subjects. Third, the funds to implement the studies are  
# committed and made available by the governments involved.  
# The basic disadvantage in mass military surveys of this kind is usually  
# the restrictions of sex and age. In addition, the measurements have  
# often been limited to height and weight and in many instances have  
# been gathered by unskilled observers. In 1919, however, a survey was  
# made of some 100,000 American troops upon discharge from the  
# service. Reportedly, it was the first study to include measurements  
**other than height and weight.2 The study was intended for use as a**  
# guide in the design of clothing but was never actually used for that. It  
# did, however, during the period between the First and Second World  
# Wars, serve as a standard description of U.S. males.  
# Most of the early and more successful applications of anthropometry  
# to design actually took place during the Second World War and were  
# predicated on studies prepared by the United States Air Force, the  
# Royal Air Force, and the British Navy. Apparently, this period was a  
# turning point because since that time, the United States, in addition to  
# many other countries, has conducted extensive military  
# anthropometric studies. A 1946 study by Randall, Damon, Benton,  
# and Patt, “Human Body Size in Military Aircraft and Personnel  
**Equipment,” has been cited as a major contribution in this area.3** **Relatively few civilian anthropometric surveys, however, have been**  
# taken. Perhaps the most current and complete study of the civilian  
# population of the United States—the National Health Survey—was  
# prepared for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare \(HEW\)  
# by Dr. Howard W. Stoudt, Dr. Albert Damon, and Dr. Ross McFarland  
# formerly of the Harvard School of Public Health and Jean Roberts of the  
**U.S. Public Health Service.4 This study involved a nationwide**  
# probability sample of over 7500 nonmilitary and noninstitutionalized  
# people between the ages of 18 and 79 years, of which 6 672 were  
# examined.  
# Most anthropometric research, nevertheless, is still being done for the  
# military. All branches of the service have active programs, and in many  
# instances will share their data with professionals in the private sector.  
**An excellent example is the three-volume *Anthropometric Source***  
***Book* published by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.**  
# This book is probably the most comprehensive source of summarized  
**body size data currently in existence anywhere in the world.5**  
# Appendix  
# 1 lists military anthropometry laboratories, as well as other national  
# and international sources of anthropometric data. The designer should  
# use the data cautiously and, in instances where the nature of the  
# design problem requires more sophisticated data, consult with a  
**qualified professional in the field of anthropometry.** **1.3 TYPE OF DATA**  
# Human body dimensions that impact on the design of interior spaces  
**are of two basic types—structural and functional. *Structural***  
# dimensions, sometimes referred to as “static” dimensions, include  
# measurements of the head, torso, and limbs in standard positions.  
***Functional* dimensions, also referred to as “dynamic” dimensions, as**  
# the term suggests, include measurements taken in working positions  
# or during the movement associated with certain tasks. The former are  
# simpler and more readily obtained, while the latter are normally far  
# more complicated. Figures 1-4 through 1-6 illustrate the basic  
# anthropometric instruments usually employed in the measurement of  
# body parts and their use. There are more sophisticated measuring  
# devices and techniques, such as multiple probe contour devices,  
# photometric camera systems, andrometric camera systems,  
# stereophotogrammetry, but their use is not presently widespread.  
# A glance at any anatomy textbook is sufficient to suggest the endless  
# number of body dimensions possible. One recent publication contains  
**almost one thousand measurements.6 The number of possibilities and**  
# the exotic medical terminology involved can be somewhat intimidating  
# for the designer. For example, the “crinionmenton” is the term for the  
# distance between the hair line in the middle of the forehead and the  
# midpoint of the lower edge of the chin, while the “menton-  
# supramentale” is the distance from the angle between the chin and  
# the lower lip to the lower edge of the chin. Such data might be  
# extremely useful to a designer of a helmet for a pressurized spacesuit,  
**but would be of little value to an interior designer.** ***Figure 1-4. A common set of anthropometric instruments \(courtesy Pfister Import-Export Inc.,***

***the anthropometer.*** ***Figure 1-6. Interior design students at the Fashion Institute of Technology illustrating the use of***  
***the sliding compass for measuring hand breadth.*** ***Figure 1-7. Body measurements of most use to the designer of interior spaces.***  
# Similarly, “interpupillary diameter,” the distance between the centers  
# of the pupils, will be of far more value to the designer of optical  
# equipment than to an architect.  
# Damon et al. contend that “if one wishes to describe a group for  
# human engineering purposes, the ten most important dimensions to  
# obtain are in order\: height; weight; sitting height; buttock-knee and  
# buttock-popliteal lengths; breadths across elbows and hips, seated;  
**knee and popliteal heights; and thigh clearance height.”7 These ten**  
**measurements are equally essential to the design of interiors.** **Figure 1-7 indicates all those body measurements that are of the most**  
# significance to the architect, interior designer, or industrial designer.  
# The necessary data for these measurements are developed in the  
# various tables in Part B of this book. Table 1 in Part B, entitled  
# “Metrological Analysis,” defines the terms and discusses the  
**application and design implication of the data.** **1.4 PRESENTATIO**  
# N  
# OF DATA  
# Generally, anthropometric data for use by the designer may be  
# presented in graphic form, as in the well-known Dreyfuss figure \(Figure  
# 1-8\), or in a tabular form \(Figure 1-9\). When data are initially recorded,  
# however, their form, of necessity, is statistically disorganized. Figure 1-  
# 10 is an example of a form used to record initial data. Subsequently,  
# the data are then reorganized in a more orderly and logical manner.  
# With regard to anthropometric data, it is usually restructured to  
# indicate frequency, as illustrated in Figure 1-11. Since individual body  
# sizes and measurements vary greatly within any population, it is not  
# practical to design for the entire group. Consequently, statistical  
# distribution of body sizes is of great interest to the designer in  
**establishing design standards and making design decisions.** ***Figure 1-8. Anthropometric data of a standing adult female. Drawing from Henry Dreyfuss, The***

# of human figure to explain measurement. Diagram and table from Van Cott and Kinkale,  
# Human Engineering Guide to Equipment Design, 1972, p. 507.  
# The restructured array of data in the form of a frequency table, as  
# shown on Figure 1-11, begins to suggest the pattern of distribution.  
# The array of data lists, in order of magnitude from smallest to largest,  
# certain height intervals in inches for army aviators and the  
# corresponding number of instances in which such measurements  
# were observed. Certain information can be immediately noted. The  
# smallest height interval is from 158.8 to 160.5 cm, or 62.5 to 63.2 in,  
# while the tallest interval is between 191.3 and 193 cm, or 75.3 and  
# 76.0 in. It can also be observed that the number of cases in which  
# these particular extreme high and low measurements occurred were  
**minimal.** ***Figure 1-10. An example of a recording form used in an anthropometric study. From National***

# The data, however, particularly the nature of the distribution, can be  
# communicated more effectively by means of “column diagrams,” or  
# “frequency histograms,” as illustrated in Figure 1-12. The heights of  
# the bars vary in order to indicate the frequency or number of cases for  
# each interval, while the width of the bars are equal. It is also possible to  
# use a curve, in lieu of bars, by plotting the frequency against the  
# midpoint for each interval, as shown by the broken line in the figure.  
**This resulting configuration is known as a “frequency polygon.”** ***Figure 1-12. Example of a frequency histogram and polygon. From Roebuck, Kroemer, Thomson,***  
# Engineering Anthropometry Methods, 1975, p. 135.  
# Despite the variation, the general pattern of distribution of  
# anthropometric data, as with many other types of data, is fairly  
# predictable and approximates the so-called Gaussian distribution.  
# Such distribution, when presented graphically, in terms of frequency of  
# occurrence versus magnitude, usually resembles a bell-shaped  
# symmetrical curve. The significance of the bell-shaped configuration is  
# that the large percentage of the distribution is somewhere in the  
# middle, with a few extremes at either end of the scale, as illustrated in  
# Figure 1-13.  
# Figure 1-13. Example of areas under a normal curve. Most human dimensions, in a normally

***ASA, Anthropometric Source Book, vol. 1.*** **1.5 PERCENTILES**  
# Due to the significant variations in individual body size, “averages” are  
# obviously of little use to the designer and it is necessary, instead, to  
# deal with range. Statistically, it has been shown that human body  
# measurements in any given population will be distributed so that they  
# will fall somewhere in the middle, while a small number of extreme  
# measurements may fall at either end of the spectrum. Since it is  
# impractical to design for the entire population, it is necessary to select  
# a segment from the middle portion. Accordingly, it is fairly common  
# today to omit the extremes at both ends and to deal with 90 percent of  
# the population group.  
# Most anthropometric data, therefore, are quite often expressed in  
# terms of percentiles. The population is divided, for study purposes, into  
# 100 percentage categories, ranked from least to greatest, with respect  
# to some specific type of body measurement. The first percentile in  
# stature or height, for example, indicates that 99 percent of the study  
# population would have heights of greater dimension. Similarly, a 95th  
# percentile height would indicate that only 5 percent of the study  
# population would have heights greater and that 95 percent of the  
# study population would have the same or lesser heights. Percentiles  
# “indicate the percentage of persons within the population who have a  
**body dimension of a certain size \(or smaller\).”8 The *Anthropometric***  
***Source Book* published by the National Aeronautics and Space**  
# Administration \(N  
# ASA\) defines percentiles in the following manner\:  
# The definition of the percentiles is fairly simple. For any set of data—the weights of a  
# group of pilots, for example—the first percentile is a value which is, on the one hand,  
# greater than the weights of each of the lightest 1% of the pilots and is, on the other hand,  
# less than the weights of each of the heaviest 99% of these men. Similarly, the second  
# percentile is greater than each of the lightest 2% and less than each of the heaviest 98%.  
# Whatever the value of K—from 1 to 99—the K-th percentile is a value greater than each  
**of the smallest k% of the weights and less than the largest \(100 K\)%. The 50th** **percentile, which we encountered among the averages as the median, is a value dividing**  
**a set of data into two groups containing the smallest and largest 50% of the values.9**  
# A 50th percentile rating represents fairly closely the average value of a  
# dimension for a certain group, but under no circumstances should be  
# misinterpreted as suggesting that the “average man” has the body  
# dimension indicated. This fallacy of the “average man” will be amplified  
# later in Section 2.2.  
# When dealing with percentiles, two important factors should be kept in  
# mind. Firstly, anthropometric percentiles on actual individuals refer to  
# only one body dimension. This may be stature or sitting height, for  
# example. Secondly, there is no such thing as a 95th percentile or 90th  
# percentile or 5 percentile person. These are mythical figures. An  
# individual having a 50th percentile stature dimension might have a  
# 40th percentile knee height or a 60th percentile hand length, as  
# suggested in Figure 1-14. The graph in Figure 1-15, representing  
# actual data of three individuals, reinforces the mythical aspect of  
# percentile people with respect to all body dimensions. Examination of  
# the graph and its very pronounced angular and uneven path clearly  
# indicates that each of the three individuals has a differing percentile  
**ranking for each of the body dimensions shown.** ***Figure 1-14. Humans are not, in reality, normally distributed in all body dimensions. As the***  
# illustration indicates, a person with a 50th percentile stature may well have a 55th percentile  
***side arm reach.*** ***Figure 1-15. A graph indicating the percentiles for the various body dimensions of three actual***  
# individuals. Each graph line represents one person. Note that the individual represented by the  
# solid line, for example, shows a 70th percentile buttock-knee length, a 15th percentile knee-  
# height sitting, and a 60th percentile shoulder height. If all the body dimensions were equivalent  
# to the same percentile, that fact would be shown in a straight horizontal line across the graph.  
***Drawing from Roebuck, Kroemer, Thomson, Engineering Anthropometry Methods, 1975, p. 172.*** **1.6 VARIABILITY A**  
# ND RELIABILITY  
# As discussed earlier in this section, a number of factors can cause  
# significant variations in human body size. Individuals from one part of  
# the country may be taller and heavier than those from another part. A  
# socioeconomic study has indicated a significant difference in stature  
# between people having different occupations. A comparison in stature  
# between truck drivers and research workers, for example, indicated  
# that the latter, as a group, were taller than the former. The military, as a  
**group, differs anthropometrically from the civilian population.10**  
# Men  
# within the same group are usually taller and heavier than the women  
# within that group, and elderly people differ in body size from the  
# middle-aged \(Figure 1-16\). Moreover, measurements of general body  
# sizes within a country may change over a period of time. American  
# soldiers in the Second World War were proven to be taller and heavier  
# than soldiers of the First World War \(Figure 1-17\). It has been  
# demonstrated that ethnicity is also an extremely significant factor in  
# body size. This has been an area of such growing concern and interest  
# to ergonomists the world over that in 1972 the first international  
# symposium on “natural and cultural variables in human factors  
# engineering” was held in The Netherlands under the auspices of the  
# North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Body size was one of five topics  
# discussed. Papers delivered at that symposium revealed some very  
# substantial anthropometric differences among the various populations  
**of the world.** ***Figure 1-16. \(a\) The graph indicates that men as a group are generally taller than women as a***  
# group and that the height of both men and women decreases with age. From National Health

# measurement. The trend, referred to as “secular change,” indicates a growth in the stature of U.S.  
# males from generation to generation. A publication of the National Center for Health Statistics

# As suggested previously, a very serious error in the application of data  
# is to assume that the 50th percentile dimensions represent the  
# measurements of an “average man” and to create a design to  
# accommodate 50th percentile data. The fallacy in such an assumption  
# is that by prior definition 50 percent of the group may suffer. There  
# simply is no “average man.” Depending on the nature of the design  
# problem, the design should usually be conceived to accommodate the  
# 5th or the 95th percentile, so that the greatest portion of the  
# population is served.  
# Dr. H. T. E. Hertzberg, one of the country’s most distinguished research  
# physical anthropologists, in discussing the so-called average man,  
# indicated, “there is really no such thing as an ‘average’ man or woman.  
# There are men who are average in weight, or in stature, or in sitting  
# height, but the men who are average in two dimensions constitute  
# only about 7 percent of the population; those in three, only about 3  
# percent; those in four, less than 2 percent. There are no men average in  
# as few as 10 dimensions. Therefore, the concept of the ‘average’ man  
# is fundamentally incorrect, because no such creature exists. Work  
# places to be efficient should be designed according to the measured  
**range of body size.”1** **2.3 REA**

# ND ADJUSTABILITY  
# The selection of appropriate anthropometric data is based on the  
# nature of the particular design problem under consideration. If the  
# design requires the user to reach from a seated or standing position,  
# the 5th percentile data should be utilized. Such data for arm reach  
# indicates that 5 percent of the population would have an arm reach of  
# short \(or shorter\) dimension, while 95 percent of the population, the  
# overwhelming majority, would have longer arm reaches. If the design  
# in a reach situation can accommodate the user with the shortest arm  
# reach, obviously it will function for the users with longer reaches as  
# well; it is equally obvious that the opposite is not true, as shown in  
**Figure 2.1*a*.** ***Figure 2-1. \(a\) People of smaller body dimensions and, correspondingly, the lower-range***  
# percentile data should be used to establish dimensions where reach is the determining factor. \(b\)  
# Larger-size people and, correspondingly, the high percentile range data should be used in  
# establishing clearance dimensions.  
# In designs where clearance is the primary consideration, the larger or  
# 95th percentile data should be used. The logic is simple. If the design  
**will allow adequate clearance for the users with the largest body size, it** **would also allow clearance for those users with smaller body size. Here,**  
**too, it can be seen from Figure 2-1*b* that the opposite is not true.**  
# In other situations it may be desirable to provide the design with a  
# built-in adjustment capability. Certain chair types, adjustable shelves,  
# etc., are examples of such. The range of adjustment should be based  
# on the anthropometrics of the user, the nature of the task, and the  
# physical or mechanical limitations involved. The range should allow  
# the design to accommodate at least 90 percent of the user population  
# involved, or more.  
# It should be noted that all the foregoing examples were used primarily  
# to illustrate the basic logic underlying the selection of the body  
# dimensions involved and the particular percentiles to be  
# accommodated. Wherever possible, however, it is naturally more  
# desirable to accommodate the greatest percentage of the user  
# population. In this regard, there is no substitute for common sense. If  
# a shelf can just as easily be placed an inch or two lower, without  
# significantly impacting on other design or cost factors, thereby  
# accommodating 98 or 99 percent of the user population, obviously  
**that is the correct design decision.** **2.4 THE HIDDEN DIMENSIO**  
# NS  
# Applied anthropometry can serve as an extremely helpful tool in the  
# design process, if used intelligently and within the larger perspective of  
# all the other human factors that impact on that process. In fitting the  
# body to the environment, the factors involved in the tailoring of that fit  
# cannot be limited to measurements and distances in the absolute  
# sense of the meaning of those terms. Distance and, by extension,  
# clearance and space generally have many other more sophisticated and  
**subtle connotations.** ***Figure 2-2. Graphic illustration of the distance zones suggested by Hall, The Hidden Dimension,***  
# 1966.  
# There are, as Hall suggests, “hidden dimensions.” To assume that  
# people’s boundaries begin and end with the skin is to fail to “grasp the  
# significance of the many elements that contribute to man’s sense of  
# space.” Hall, by way of example, contends that people function within  
# four “distance” zones, each of which has a “near” and “far” phase. The  
**zone selected for use at any one time is predicated on the nature of the** **activity or social transaction in progress.2 Figure 2-2 illustrates the**  
# zones referred to by Hall as well as the activities usually associated with  
# each.  
# Some years ago, Horowitz et al. contended that each human being has  
# an internal projection of the space immediately around him or her.  
# They termed the space the “body buffer zone” and suggested that its  
# size, shape, and penetrability were related to the immediate  
# interpersonal events and the individual’s psychological and cultural  
# history. Individuals, they held, tend to keep a characteristic distance  
# between themselves and other people and inanimate objects. This  
# contention was demonstrated in an experiment they conducted at a  
# U.S. naval hospital. Under the pretext that their equilibrium was to be  
# studied, subjects were instructed to either “walk over to Smith \(or a  
# hatrack that was intentionally located in the area\) while we check your  
# equilibrium.” In actuality, however, measurements of the distance left  
# between the subjects and the person or hatrack, after completing their  
# approach across the room, were taken. The subjects were taken from  
# two groups. One consisted of 19 patients with an established diagnosis  
# of schizophrenia. The other group were non-schizophrenic people of  
# similar backgrounds. The results revealed that both groups  
# approached the hatrack significantly closer than they did the person. In  
# addition, the tests indicated that when approaching another person,  
**there was definitely an area beyond which they would not go,3 as**  
**indicated in Figure 2-3.** ***Figure 2-3. Horowitz et al. “body buffer zone.” The diagrams depict the mean of the approach of***  
# the subjects over a three-day period. Although the schizophrenic group had a significantly  
# greater buffer zone area, both groups approached the inanimate object more closely than the  
# animate object. No significant difference between approaches to male or female was found in  
# either group. One of the hypotheses emerging from the finding was that “an area of personal  
# space appears to surround every individual, which seems to be reproducible and may be regarded  
# as an immediate ‘body-buffer zone.’ ” Adapted from Archives of General Psychiatry.  
# Dr. John J. Fruin, in studying pedestrian movements and “queuing,”  
**talks of “touch,” “no-touch,” “personal comfort,” and “circulation”** **zones, as illustrated in Figures 2-4 through 2-7.4 The term “flight**  
# distance” has been used to describe the distance that organisms  
# usually place between themselves and other organisms. Sommer  
# studied “personal distance” and observed interaction between  
# subjects seated around a table in terms of their particular locations  
# around that table. Figure 2-8 shows the seating arrangement. It was  
# observed that the greatest frequency of conversation occurred across  
**the corners AB, AH, EF, and ED.5** **2.5 PEOPLE IN**  
# MOTIO  
# N  
# In an article dealing with design and human locomotion, Archie Kaplan  
# writes\:  
# Movement is the natural state of man and the basis of his being. Human life represents  
# no static state; from the blink of an eye to top speed running, in sleep or wakefulness,  
**man is in motion.…6**  
# With this in mind, it should be recognized that in addition to the  
# psychological factors, the dynamics of space also affect people’s  
# interface with the environment. People, as Kaplan suggests, are  
# constantly in motion. Even when not engaged in a particular activity or  
# task, the human body is never really completely still or at rest, and even  
# when considered to be rigid, the body will, in fact, sway to some extent  
# in all directions. The body is always pliable and can stretch. Limbs can  
# rotate and twist, and electrical energy from body muscles can be  
# harnessed to operate machines. One dramatic example of the relative  
# pliability and elasticity of the human body is the change it undergoes  
# during weightlessness. National Aeronautics and Space Administration  
# data indicate that astronauts “grow” about 3 percent in height during  
# the first few days in a zero-gravity environment. This increase typically  
# amounts to about 5 cm, or 2 in. This increase is caused primarily by a  
# lengthening of the spinal column due to the contraction and  
# expansion of the intervertebral discs. Upon reexposure to one gravity,  
**the process is reversed and the body returns to normal.7** ***Figure 2-4. Illustration of Fruin’s “touch zone” based on a “body elipse” buffer zone with a***  
# minor axis related to body depth and a major axis related to shoulder breadth, allowing a  
# queuing area of 3 sq ft, or 0.29 sq m, per person. Below this boundary the frequency of body  
# contact between pedestrians is increased. Figures 2-4 to 2-7 adapted from Fruin, Pedestrian  
# Planning and Design, 1971.

***36 in, or 91.4 cm, and a 7 sq ft, or 0.65 sq m, area per person. Fruin contends that body contact*** ***can be avoided between 3 and 7 sq ft, or 0.29 to 0.65 sq m, per person.***  
# Figure 2-6. Illustration of Fruin’s “personal comfort zone,” expanding the body buffer zone to a  
# 42-in, or 106.7-cm, diameter and a 10-sq ft, or 0.93-sq m, area. A full body depth separates  
***standees, allowing for limited lateral circulation by moving sideways.*** ***Figure 2-7. Illustration of Fruin’s “circulation zone,” expanding the body buffer zone to a 48-in***  
# or 121.9-cm, diameter and 13-sq ft, or 1.21-sq m, area. Fruin contends that 10 to 13 sq ft, or  
***0.93 to 1.21 sq m, per person would allow circulation without disturbing others.*** ***Figure 2-8. Sommer’s experiment at the Saskatchewan Hospital involved a seating arrangement***  
# as shown here. It was observed that greater interaction between people occurred across the  
# corners AB, A  
# H, EF, and ED. Adapted from Sociometry.  
# Changes in height, however, are not limited to zero gravity conditions.  
# Such changes are also observed on earth after a person has been in a  
# reclining horizontal posture for a period of time, such as when  
# sleeping, and then assumes a standing position. The human body is,  
# by its nature, a dynamic organism.  
# By contrast, however, much of the anthropometric data available are  
# based on static measurements taken of samples of larger populations  
# in various positions \(i.e., standing, sitting, with limbs extended, etc.\).  
# The static nature of most of the data is usually related more to the  
# anticipated body positions at the completion of a task rather than the  
# flow of body movements involved at arriving at those final positions.  
# Figure 2-9 illustrates the “spatial envelope” defined by body  
**movement in the performance of a simple task.** ***Figure 2-9. Spatial envelope defined by body movement in performance of a simple task.***  
# Photograph courtesy National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  
# In the application of hard-lined anthropometric data, therefore, the  
# designer must somehow reconcile the static nature of the data with  
# the reality of the dynamic aspects of body movements. At the very  
# least, he must be aware of the inherent limitations of the data. By way  
# of example, Figure 2-10 illustrates the classic anthropometric diagram  
**associated with arm reach measurement. It is such hard data on which** **the maximum distance of a shelf, or perhaps of a control, might be**  
# located to accommodate a majority of users. What other factors could  
# impact on the dynamics and/or the geometrics of the activity? Surely  
# the capability of the human body to stretch as well as the  
# idiosyncrasies of the individual user’s body posture will affect body  
# movement to some degree. In addition, what about the user’s actual  
# body positions and motions immediately preceding the flow of  
# movements associated with the execution of a specific task? The  
# position of the body as well as the momentum generated by the body  
# movements preceding that task are certainly bound to affect the user’s  
**reach.** ***Figure 2-10. Classic anthropometric diagram representing arm reach. From Damon, Stoudt,***  
# McFarland, The Human Body in Equipment Design, 1966, p. 96.  
# Anthropometric space requirements for walking clearances constitute  
# yet another excellent example of the importance of body movement  
# and its implications in the design process. Human stride and gait affect  
# the clearances to be allowed between people and physical  
**obstructions. Tables, unfortunately, do not reflect these factors.** **However, very little published research in this particular area is**  
# available.  
# Sitting, all too often, is viewed as a task that is essentially static in  
# nature. Nothing could be further from the truth. The act of sitting, in  
# actuality, involves almost continuous repositioning in order to respond  
# to the demands of the various activities to be performed in that  
# position. Moreover, one cannot deal exclusively with the body in the  
# seated position. The movements involved in getting into and out of the  
# seat must be considered. Also, the entire sitting process must be  
# perceived within a continuum of motion.  
# On balance, then, given all the other variables involved, many of which  
# have yet to be defined or measured, the designer should not always  
# interpret the anthropometric data too literally. Any attempt to simulate  
# graphically and in two dimensions the dynamic patterns of body  
# movements, which by their very nature involve time, space, and three  
**dimensions, is bound to lose something in the translation.** **2.6 RA**  
# NGE OF JOINT MOTIO  
# N  
# It is obvious that the extent to which the body’s joints can move or  
# rotate will impact greatly on the individual’s interface with the physical  
# environment. Movement of the head, for example, as illustrated in  
# Figure 2-11, will greatly increase the area of visibility. The ability to lean  
# forward, as illustrated in Figure 2-12, will increase functional reach, as  
# will the ability to kneel or to stand on one’s toes. It is helpful, therefore,  
# if not essential, that the designer have some knowledge of the range of  
# joint motion.  
# Figure 2-11. Range of head movements in the vertical plane increases area of visibility. From  
***Human Factors Engineering, 1977.*** ***Figure 2-12. The ability to lean forward, even slightly, increases functional reach.***  
# The angle formed by two body segments or by one such segment and a  
# vertical or horizontal plane usually defines the range of joint motion at  
# any given time. The total range is measured by the angle formed  
# between the two most extreme positions possible, given the normal  
# constraints of bone and muscle structure. The methodologies, devices,  
# and techniques necessary for accurately measuring the range of  
**motion of body joints are numerous and vary in complexity from a** **goniometer, a simple protractor-like device, to highly sophisticated**  
# photographic techniques. Joint motion can be more clearly understood  
# when considered in terms of the body linkage system shown in Figure  
# 2-13\. The links are theoretically viewed as straight line distances  
# between centers of joint rotation.  
# Movable joints are divided into three general types. The first involves a  
# single plane freedom of motion in one direction only from a starting  
# position. Termed hinge joints, the elbow and the knee are typical  
# examples. The second involves motion in two planes originating from a  
# zero starting position. This type of motion is typified by the wrist. The  
# third type of joint, the so-called ball and socket, allows three  
# dimensional, or rotary, motion as in the shoulder or hip.  
# The types of joint movement of particular concern to the designer are  
# flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial rotation, lateral  
# rotation, pronation, and supination. This classic terminology is defined  
# and illustrated in Table 9 in Part B of this book. Several factors can  
# affect the range of joint motion. Sex is a significant factor. A study in  
# this regard indicates that women, in general, exceed men in range of  
**joint motion measurements at all joints except the knee.8 The widest**  
# range of joint motion in both sexes, as would be expected, is found  
# among the most slender, while the least range of motion is found  
# among the fattest. Age, by itself, surprisingly, does not dramatically  
# decrease or otherwise inhibit joint motion. It has been observed that  
# between the first and seventh decades the mobility of joints decreases  
# by approximately 10 percent, with very little of that change occurring  
# after puberty. It should be noted, however, that arthritis, which usually  
# increases in incidence after middle age, will result in a general decrease  
**in average joint mobility of any population.** ***Figure 2-13. Body linkage system. Adapted from linkage system diagram, Anthropometric***

# It is important here to caution the student, the interior designer, or the  
# architect against viewing the anthropometric data presented as  
# information so precise and so “scientifically correct” as to be infallible.  
# It is stressed that anthropometry, at least at its present stage of  
# development, is not so exact a science as one might wish. The data  
# should be viewed, however, as one of many sources of information or  
# tools available to the designer of interior space. The danger is for the  
# designer to substitute tabular data for common sense, function, or  
# design sensitivity, which are all essential parts of the creative design  
# process. While the authors of this book have provided as much  
# anthropometric information as could be accumulated considering the  
# state of the art, more information is constantly being produced, and  
# undoubtedly, some may not be included here. This is due to the  
# incipient nature of the science of anthropometry and the lack of a  
# significant number of professionals involved in research in the area. In  
# fact, there is a vast amount of data yet unavailable, particularly with  
# respect to children and physically disabled and elderly people. In  
# addition, more information about functional dimensions is needed.  
# Finally, to place the use of the data presented in ultimate perspective,  
# one should consider the three-dimensional dynamics of “man in  
# motion,” the psychological aspects of space and the user, and the  
# proxemic factors involved. Obviously, physical body size is only one of a  
# vast number of human factors that impact on establishing the  
**dimensions of interior spaces.** **3 ELDERLY A**  
# ND PHYSIC  
**ALLY DISABLED PEOPLE** **3.1 ELDERLY PEOPLE**  
# It was noted in the Introduction that most available anthropometric  
# data are related to military populations and, of consequence, are  
# generally restricted in terms of age and sex. The National Health Survey  
# of the U.S. Public Health Service is probably the first large-scale study  
# prepared with respect to civilian populations and is based on a national  
# sampling of Americans between the ages of 18 and 79. If information  
# regarding the civilian population generally appears to be limited,  
# however, anthropometric data for specific segments of the population,  
# such as aged people, is sparser still.  
# When one considers that there are now close to 20 million Americans  
# over the age of 65, with the number increasing yearly, it becomes  
# apparent that the need for anthropometric data for this segment of the  
# population is critical. Moreover, the data are essential if we are to  
# respond sensitively in designing the interior spaces in which elderly  
# people are to function.  
# Some data are available and some conclusions have been drawn. The  
# most significant findings are as follows\:  
# 1\. Older people of both sexes tend to be shorter than younger people.  
# To a certain degree, however, the difference may be accounted for  
# because the older individuals are obviously representative of an  
# earlier generation, while recent studies indicate that body sizes  
# generally are increasing. It has also been suggested that the  
# decreases might be due to the selective survival of short, light  
# people—an extremely interesting speculation.  
# 2\. Reach measurements of older people are shorter than those of  
# younger people. There is also considerable variability in the degree  
# to which the reach of elderly people is impaired due to the incidence  
# of arthritis and other joint movement limitations. This is particularly  
**true of vertical grip reach.** **The basic problem with most of the available anthropometric data is**  
# the small size of the group studied. For example, data on “the  
# functional anthropometry of old men” \(Chart 3-1\) prepared by Damon  
**and Stoudt1 and “the functional anthropometry of elderly women”**  
**\(Chart 3-2 and Figure 3-1\) prepared by D. F. Roberts2 were based on**  
# 133 subjects and 78 subjects, respectively. Perhaps the best available  
# data, which are in a percentile form required by the designer, are given  
# in the National Health Survey, which includes data up to age 79. These  
**data are included in Part B.** ***Chart 3-1. Functional anthropometry of elderly men. From Damon and Stoudt, “The Functional***

# AIRBOUND PEOPLE  
# There are no large-scale data on the anthropometrics of chairbound  
# people. Such a study would be quite difficult in view of the many  
# variables involved\: the types of disabilities, the limbs or segments of  
# the bodies involved, the extent of paralysis, the degree of muscle  
# dysfunction, the cumulative effect on overall limb mobility due to chair  
# confinement, etc. All would have to be considered. For study purposes,  
# therefore, the assumption has been made that where limb mobility  
# has not been impaired, the range of movement would approximate  
# that of able-bodied people.  
# It is, however, important that in determining appropriate reach,  
# clearance, and other dimensions, the individual and the wheelchair be  
# viewed together. This requires some knowledge of the anatomy of the  
# wheelchair itself. Figure 3-2 provides some basic and useful data on  
# this.  
# With regard to the anthropometrics involved, there are many diagrams  
# in circulation illustrating body measurements of men and women in  
# wheelchairs. Caution should be exercised in interpreting, and  
# subsequently applying, the data indicated. In many instances, the  
# reach dimensions are qualified to indicate a so-called average  
# dimension. This notion of average was discussed in Section 2.2 and  
# proved to be fallacious. If reach is a critical factor in the particular  
# design, it is essential to base the design on those body dimensions  
# representative of the lower range of the population, not the average.  
# Consequently, the 5th percentile arm reach data should be used. If the  
# design were based on the so-called average reach, half of the  
# chairbound users simply could not function.  
# Figure 3-3, Chart 3-4, and Figure 3-4 illustrate the anthropometrics of  
# chairbound people. What should be noted, however, is that most  
**wheelchairs are not built to keep the body in an erect position.** **Accordingly, body parts are not strictly vertical or horizontal. In**  
# describing the geometrics involved, Dr. Herman L. Kamenetz states\:  
# From this imagined posture only the ankles keep their position of 90 degrees. The legs  
# are lifted by about 15 degrees so that the knees assume an angle of about 105 degrees,  
# and the back reclines by about 10 degrees, which results in an angle at the hip joints of  
# about 100 degrees. Finally, the body being kept in this relationship of its parts to one  
# another, the entire chair is as though it were tilted backward by about 5 degrees, so that  
# the seat is 5 degrees from the horizontal, the legs 20 degrees, and the back 15 degrees  
**from the vertical.4**  
# Figure 3-2. \(a\) Wheelchair dimensions. The source of the dimensions shown is the American  
# National Standards Institute \(A  
# NSI Pub. A117–1961, Revalidated 1971\). The measurements  
# indicated, however, vary with model and manufacturer, and each chair should be measured  
# individually. The length of the chair is of particular importance since it determines the turning  
# radius. It is essential also, when calculating clearances, to allow for the protrusion of the feet  
# beyond the edge of the footrests. A  
# NSI contends that the collapsible model wheelchair of tubular  
# metal construction with plastic upholstery for back and seat is the one most commonly used and  
***falls within the dimensions indicated.*** ***\(b\) Alternate wheelchair turning radii.*** ***Figure 3-3. Anthropometrics of chairbound people. The side view, showing user and chair,***  
# indicates some of the more critical anthropometric measurements for both men and women. All  
# reach dimensions are based on 2.5 percentile data to accommodate those users with smaller  
# body sizes. It is recommended that since the female body size is smaller than the male, the  
# female dimensions be used for the design of all reach situations. Dimensions involving clearance  
# problems are based on 97.5 percentile data. Since the male body size is larger, the dimensions for

# NT DISABLED PEOPLE  
# For ambulant disabled people, it is necessary to consider those users  
# functioning with crutches \(Figure 3.5\), walkers \(Figure 3.6\), canes  
# \(Figure 3.7\), and seeing-eye dogs \(Figure 3.8\). All these aids become,  
# in essence, a functional part of the individual’s body. Accordingly, both  
# aid and user should in almost every instance be viewed as a single  
# entity. For design purposes it is useful to know something not only of  
# the anthropometry involved, but of the total spatial considerations.  
# Figure 3-5. Crutches. The mode, gait, and speed of the user is impeded significantly by the use of  
# crutches. Changes of grade and circulation up or down stairs are extremely difficult and in some  
# situations almost impossible. The limited use of the user’s lower extremities as well as  
# manipulation and placement of crutches significantly limit the leverage that he or she can  
***develop, particularly as may be required in opening or closing doors and getting in and out of*** ***seats. The critical dimensions that impact on clearance include crutch swing \(A\), walking crutch***  
# swing \(B\), standing crutch span \(C\), body crutch span \(D\), and body crutch swing \(E\). For users  
# with severe arthritis and cerebral palsy, the clearances indicated may have to be increased.  
# Figure 3-6. Walker. The clearance required by a user employing the aid of a walker is more easily  
# defined by the inherent nature of the device and method of operation. The front view of the user  
***indicates a minimum of 28 in \(F\), or 71.1 cm.*** ***Figure 3-7. Canes. Canes may be utilized by someone who is blind, who has an injured limb, or***  
# who might be suffering from a host of afflictions such as varying degrees of aging, arthritis,  
# cerebral palsy, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and other maladies. The blind user, however, because  
# of the nature of the disability, would require the maximum space for clearance. The side and  
***front views of the user indicate the clearance allowances required.*** ***Figure 3-8. Seeing-eye dog. Given the many variables involved, the precise combined clearance***  
# data for user and dog are difficult to establish. A clearance of 30 in, or 76.2 cm, however, would

# NTHROPOMETRICS OF SEATING  
# The design of seating can be traced at least to antiquity. The stool, for  
# example, had already been developed into a valued article of furniture  
**by the Egyptians as far back as 2050 B.C. and the chair as far back as**  
**1600 B.C.1 Despite its ubiquity and long history, however, seating is still**  
# one of the most poorly designed elements of interior space. Industrial  
# designer Neils Diffrient has said that “Chair design is the acid test for  
**designers.”2**  
# One of the major difficulties in the design of seating is that  
# sitting is, quite frequently, viewed as a static activity while, in actuality,  
# it is a rather dynamic one. Accordingly, the application of static two-  
# dimensional data, alone, to solve a dynamic three-dimensional  
# problem, involving biomechanical considerations, is not a valid design  
# approach. Paradoxically, a chair that is anthropometrically correct may  
# not necessarily be comfortable as well. If the design, however, is simply  
# not responsive at all to human dimensions and body size, there is no  
# question that the seating will, in fact, be uncomfortable.  
# Another difficulty is that very little data are available with respect to the  
# biomechanics of chair design and practically no research has been  
# published with respect to “comfort.” All that can be provided in this  
# section, as well as in Part C, are some broad guidelines, basic concepts,  
**and recommendations.** **4.1 THE DYN**  
# AMICS OF SITTING  
# The dynamics of sitting can be more clearly illustrated by studying the  
# mechanics of the support system and the general bone structure  
# involved. According to Tichauer, “The axis of support of the seated  
# torso is a line in a coronal plane passing through the projection of the  
**lowest point of the ischial tuberosities on the surface of the seat.”3**  
# Figures 4-1 and 4-2 show the tuberosities. Branton makes two  
# observations in this regard. The first is that, when sitting, about 75  
# percent of the total body weight is supported on only 4 square inches  
**\(sq in\), or 26 sq cm, of these tuberosities.4 This constitutes an**  
# exceptionally heavy load, distributed over a relatively small area, and as  
# a result, very high compressive stresses are exerted on the areas of the  
# buttocks beneath. Tichauer indicated that these stresses have been  
**estimated at 85 to 100 pounds per square inch \(psi\).5**  
# Other data have  
# shown the compression pressures on the areas of the skin between the  
# buttocks and a hard seat pan as high as 40 to 60 psi and the pressure a  
**few inches away as only about 4 psi.6 These pressures cause fatigue**  
# and discomfort and result in a change in the sitter’s posture in an  
# attempt to alleviate the condition. Prolonged sitting, without change in  
# posture, under the compressive pressures cited may cause ischemia,  
# or an interference in the blood circulation, resulting in aches, pains,  
**and possible numbness.** ***Figure 4-1. A sectional view of the seated figure showing the ischial tuberosities.***  
# Figure 4-2. An enlarged posterior sectional view of the ischial tuberosities.  
# It becomes obvious that the design of seating should provide for the  
# distribution of the body weight supported by the ischial tuberosities  
# over a larger area. Proper padding on the seat pan can accomplish this.  
# It is apparent, too, that the design of the seating should also permit the  
# sitter to change posture when necessary to alleviate discomfort. In this  
# regard, proper anthropometric data are essential in determining the  
**proper measurements and clearances required.** **Branton’s second observation is that, structurally, the tuberosities**  
**form a two-point support system which is inherently unstable.7 The**  
# seat pan alone, therefore, is not sufficient for stabilization.  
# Theoretically, the legs, feet, and back, in contact with surfaces other  
# than the seat pan, should produce the necessary equilibrium. This  
# would presuppose that the center of gravity was directly over the  
# tuberosities. The center of gravity of the upright seated body, however,  
# is actually located outside the body, about 1 in, or 2.5 cm, in front of  
# the navel, as indicated in Figure 4-3. The combination of the two-point  
# support system, in addition to the position of the center of gravity, has  
# led Branton to suggest a scheme “in which a system of masses is  
**inherently unstable on the seat.”8 He further suggests that if the**  
# system is to remain as stable as it normally appears to be, some  
**internally active \(muscular\) forces must be assumed to be at work.** ***Figure 4-3. Center of gravity of the upright seated figure.***  
# Given the many body postures assumed during any sitting period, in  
# addition to the muscular activity involved, even when the body seems  
# to be at rest, sitting is not the static type of activity it frequently is  
# conceived to be. According to Branton, “the sitting body, therefore, is  
# not merely an inert bag of bones dumped for a time in the seat, but a  
**live organism in a dynamic state of continuous activity.”9** **It has also been contended that the many postures assumed while**  
# sitting are attempts to use the body as a lever system in an effort to  
# counterbalance the weights of the head and trunk. Stretching the legs  
# forward and locking the knee joints, for example, enlarges the base of  
# the body’s mass and reduces the effort of other muscles to stabilize  
# the trunk. Other postures, such as holding up the chin with the hand  
# while the elbow rests on the armrest or the lap, or supporting the head  
# by leaning it against the headrest, are still other examples of the body’s  
# attempt at stabillization, providing relief to the muscle system and, in  
# turn, alleviating discomfort. More significantly, these changes in  
# posture occur without deliberation. Branton attempts to explain this  
# phenomenon by suggesting the existence of an “internal ‘posture  
# program,’ which enables the body to strike a running compromise  
**between its twin needs for stability and variety.”10**  
# Of particular significance to the designer is the importance of the  
# location of back-, head-, and armrests as well as their size and  
# configuration, since it is these elements of the chair or seat that  
# function as stabilizers. If the seat does not provide for proper body  
# stabilization, the user must stabilize himself by assuming the various  
# postures mentioned earlier. This requires the expenditure of additional  
**energy due to the muscular effort involved and increases discomfort.** **4.2 A**  
# NTHROPOMETRIC C  
# O  
# NSIDERATIO  
# NS  
# In view of the elusive nature of sitter comfort and the fact that sitting is  
# more of a dynamic activity than a static one, the relative importance of  
# an anthropometrically oriented approach to seating design has  
# occasionally been challenged. Although, as mentioned earlier, there is  
# no guarantee that an anthropometrically correct chair will be  
# comfortable, there seems to be general agreement that the design  
# must, nevertheless, be based on properly selected anthropometric  
# data. If it is not, there is little doubt that the seating design will cause  
# the user discomfort. The essential anthropometric dimensions for  
# seating design are shown in Figure 4-4 and Chart 4.1.  
# It should also be noted, however, that the data cannot be applied in a  
# vacuum. In establishing chair dimensions, the anthropometric aspects  
# must be related to the biomechanical demands involved. It was  
# demonstrated previously, for example, that body stabilization involved  
# not only the seat pan, but the legs, feet, and back in contact with other  
# surfaces. In addition, some muscular force was also required. If,  
# through improper anthropometric design, the chair did not allow the  
# majority of users to, in fact, have foot or back contact with other  
# surfaces, body instability would be increased and additional muscular  
# force would have to be introduced in order to maintain proper  
# equilibrium. The greater the degree of muscular force or control  
# required, the greater the fatigue and discomfort.  
# It is necessary, therefore, that the designer become familiar with the  
# anthropometric considerations involved in the design of seating and  
# their relationship to the biomechanical and ergonomic imperatives  
# implied. To deal with one without knowledge of the others is to solve  
# only a part of the design problem. In this regard the generally accepted  
# basic dimensions required in the design of seating include seat height,  
# seat depth, seat width, backrest height, and armrest height and  
**spacing.** **4.3 SEAT HEIGHT**  
# One of the basic considerations in the design of seating is the height of  
# the top of the seat surface above the floor. If the seating surface is too  
# high, the underside of the thigh becomes compressed, as illustrated in  
# Figure 4-5. This can cause considerable discomfort as well as a  
# restriction in blood circulation. If the height of the seat does not permit  
# the soles of the feet proper contact with the floor surface, body stability  
# is weakened. If the height of the seat is too low \(Figure 4-6\), the legs  
# may become extended and positioned forward. The feet then are  
# deprived of any stability. By and large, however, a tall person would be  
# far more comfortable using a chair with a low seat height than a short  
# person using a chair with a seat height that is too high.  
***Figure 4-4. Key anthropometric dimensions required for chair design.*** ***Note\: No published anthropometric studies concerning lumbar height can be located. A British***  
# study \[H-D. Darcus and A.G.M. Weddel, British Medical Bulletin 5 \(1947\), pp. 31–37\], however,  
# gives a 90 percent range of 8 to 12 in, or 20.3 to 30.5 cm, for British men. Diffrient \(Humanscale  
# 1/2/3\) indicates that the center of forward curvature of the lumbar region for adults is located  
# about 9 to 10 in, or 22.9 to 25.4 cm, above the compressed seat cushion.  
# Chart 4-1. Selected body dimensions, taken from Tables 2 and 3 of Part B, useful in the design of  
# seating. Little detailed published data are available with regard to lumbar heights. Estimates,  
# however, vary from a range of 8 to 12 in, or 20.3 to 30.5 cm, and 9 to 10 in, or 22.9 to 25.4 cm.  
# Figure 4-5. A seat surface placed too high causes the thigh to become compressed and blood  
# circulation to be constricted. In addition, the soles of the feet are not permitted proper contact  
***with the floor surface, thus weakening body stability.*** ***Figure 4-6. A seat surface located too low may cause the legs to become extended and positioned***  
# forward, depriving them of any stability. In addition the movement of the body forward will also  
# cause the back to slide away from the backrest and deprive the sitter of proper lumbar support.  
# Anthropometrically, the popliteal height \(the distance taken vertically  
# from the floor to the underside of the portion of the thigh just behind  
# the knee\) should be the measurement in the tables used as reference  
# in establishing the proper seat height. The lower range of the table,  
# such as the 5th percentile data, would be appropriate since these will  
# serve the segment of the population with the smallest body  
# dimension. The rationale, as discussed earlier, is that a seat height that  
# will accommodate a person with a smaller popliteal height  
# measurement will also accommodate one with a larger measurement.  
# Chart 4-1 indicates a 5th percentile popliteal height of 15.5 in, or 39.4  
# cm, for men and 14.0, or 35.6 cm, for women. The measurements,  
# however, were recorded with the examinee stripped to the waist,  
# pockets emptied, without shoes, and wearing a knee-length examining  
# gown—hardly the kind of attire most people normally wear while  
# sitting. It is necessary, therefore, to compensate for these conditions  
# by increasing the measurements accordingly.  
# Since the items of clothing as well as the shoes are a function of  
# climate, time of day, location, socioeconomic class, age, culture, and  
**fashion, it is obvious that the factor to be added is, at best, an educated** **guess or reasonable approximation. Given the dangers involved in**  
# making the seat height too high, it would make sense to be  
# conservative in estimating this factor and to err on the smaller side. It  
# is suggested, therefore, that 1.5 in, or 3.8 cm, be added to both  
# measurements; the figures then become 17 and 15.5, or 43.2 and  
# 39.4 cm, respectively. These figures, however, could just as easily be  
# increased if boots or very high heels were assumed to be the footwear.  
# Similarly, the figures would be smaller if the user were lounging at  
# home in slippers and a bathrobe. Given the great variation possible in  
# popliteal height due exclusively to attire, not to mention body size, a  
# very strong argument can be presented for adjustability in all chair  
# types. It should be noted that in determining seat height the type,  
# resiliency, and sag of padding or upholstery should be considered.  
# Moreover, when the chair is used in conjunction with a table, desk, or  
# other work surface, or footrest, seat height dimensions can vary. These  
# conditions, as well as others involving the anthropometrics of seating,  
**will be examined graphically in Part C.** **4.4 SEAT DEPTH**  
# Another basic consideration in chair design is the depth of the seat. If  
# the depth is too great, the front surface or edge of the seat will press  
# into the area just behind the knees, cutting off circulation to the legs  
# and feet as shown in Figure 4-7. The compression of the tissues will  
# also cause irritation and discomfort. A greater danger, still, is the  
# possibility of blood clotting, or thrombophlebitis, if the user does not  
# change body position. To alleviate the discomfort in the legs, the user  
# may move his buttocks forward, in which case his back becomes  
# unsupported, body stability is weaker, and greater muscular force is  
# required to maintain equilibrium. The result is fatigue, discomfort, and  
# back pain. Too shallow a seat depth \(Figure 4-8\) may result in an  
# awkward situation where the user has the sensation of falling off the  
# front of the chair. In addition, a shallow seat depth will also result in a  
# lack of support of the lower thighs.  
***Figure 4-7. If the depth of the seat is too great, the seat front will press into the area just behind***  
***the knee, causing discomfort and problems with blood circulation.*** ***Figure 4-8. A shallow seat depth will deprive the sitter of proper support under the thighs. It may***  
# also give the sitter the sensation of tipping off the chair.  
# Anthropometrically, the buttock-popliteal length \(the horizontal  
# distance from the rearmost surface of the buttock to the back of the  
# lower leg\) is the measurement in the tables to be used to establish the  
# proper seat depth.  
# Chart 4-1 indicates a 5th percentile buttock-popliteal length of 17.3  
# in, or 43.9 cm, for men and 17.0 in, or 43.2 cm, for women, while the  
# smallest measurement indicated in Table 2K in Part B is the 1st  
# percentile female data, with a measurement of 16.1 in, or 40.9 cm.  
# Accordingly, a depth of seat measurement that exceeds about 16 in, or  
# 40.6 cm simply would not accommodate the very small user, while a  
# seat depth of 17 in, or 43.2 cm, for an easy chair, however, would  
**accommodate about 95 percent of all users.** **4.5 BA**  
# CKREST  
# Although the size, configuration, and location of the backrest is one of  
# the most important considerations necessary to ensure a proper fit  
# between user and chair, it is also the most difficult component to  
# dimension in reference to published anthropometric data. Despite the  
# availability of those body measurements required in dimensioning  
# basic chair parts, such as seat height, seat depth, seat width, and  
# armrest heights, there is a paucity of data relating specifically to the  
# lumbar region and spinal curvature. Accordingly, it will be necessary to  
# limit discussion of the backrest to guidelines and some  
**generalizations.** ***Figure 4-9. The primary function of the backrest is to provide support for the lumbar region or***  
# small of the back. Provisions should also be made for the protrusion of the buttock area.  
# There appears to be general agreement that the primary function of  
# the backrest is to provide support for the lumbar region, or small of the  
# back \(Figure 4-9\). This is the concave lower portion which extends  
# approximately from the waist to about the middle of the back. The  
# configuration of the backrest, therefore, should to some extent  
**accommodate the spinal profile, particularly in the lumbar area, as** **shown in Figure 4-10. Caution should be exercised, however, not to**  
# provide so close a fit as to prevent the user from shifting body position.  
# Figure 4-10. The lumbar region.  
# The overall height of the backrest may vary depending on the type and  
# intended use of the chair involved. It may be just sufficient to provide  
# lumbar support and little more, as in the case of the typical secretarial  
# chair; or it may extend all the way to the back of the head or nape of the  
**neck, as in easy chairs or reclining chairs, or possibly somewhere in** **between, as in general purpose seating. Provisions should also be**  
# made for necessary clearance to allow space for the protrusion of the  
# buttock area. This clearance may take the form of an open area or  
# recess between the seat surface and the lumbar support. Soft padding  
# in this area will also accommodate the protrusion in the buttock  
**region.** **4.6 ARMRESTS**  
# Armrests serve several functions. They support the weight of the arms  
# and assist the user in lowering himself into the seat or in pushing or  
# raising himself out of the seat. If the chair is used in conjunction with  
# some work task, for instance, one involving the manipulation of  
# sensitive console dials or controls the armrest can also function to  
# steady the arm during the performance of the particular activities.  
# Anthropometrically, several factors must be taken into consideration  
# in sizing and locating the armrests. For the height of the armrest, the  
# elbow rest height would appear to be the proper anthropometric  
# reference measurement to apply. This measurement is the dimension  
# from the tip of the elbow to the seat surface. The decision to be made is  
# the particular percentile data to be selected.  
# But consider the problem of one user with a large body breadth  
# dimension as opposed to another extremely slender person with a  
# relatively small body breadth dimension, who both have identical  
# elbow rest height measurements. It has been observed in such cases  
# that the user with the narrow body breadth would require higher  
# armrests, because as the arms swing outward to connect with the  
# armrest, the vertical distance from the elbow to the seat increases.  
# Since no basic relationship exists between transverse measurements  
# and those in the vertical plane, it has been suggested that the armrest  
# should accommodate the higher range elbow rest height. Those users  
# with shorter elbow rest heights can use the armrests by abducting the  
# arms or raising the shoulders. However, if the armrest is too high, the  
# user may have to force or lever the trunk out of the chair and round the  
# shoulders, resulting in fatigue and discomfort due to the muscular  
# activity generated. Chart 4-1 shows the highest measurement for  
# elbow rest height to be the 95th percentile male data, or 11.6 in, or  
# 29.5 cm. Such an armrest height would, in fact, be uncomfortable for  
**most people. The 70th percentile data would appear to be an optimal** **high range limitation and the 5th percentile the low limit. Most**  
# sources, therefore, recommend an armrest height between 7 and 10  
**in, or 17.8 and 25.4 cm.** **4.7 CUSHIO**  
# NING  
# The purpose of cushioning is essentially to distribute the pressure, due  
# to the weight of the body at the point of interface, over a larger surface  
# area. The danger, however, is for the designer to assume that the more  
# opulent, deeper, and softer the cushioning, the greater the degree of  
# comfort. This simply is not the case. All too often it is the very seating  
# that appears overstuffed that, in fact, can provide the most discomfort,  
# fatigue, and pain. Where the bone structures are closest to the skin are  
# the areas of greatest potential discomfort due to the compressive  
# stresses imposed on the body tissue. The ischial tuberosities in the  
# buttock area mentioned previously are an excellent example of a  
# sensitive area, in which the importance and need for proper cushioning  
# is shown.  
# If cushioning is not properly designed, it is possible that relief from  
# compressive stress may be obtained at the expense of body stability.  
# Branton suggests that a state could be reached whereby the  
# cushioning could deprive the body structure of support altogether. The  
# body would “flounder about” in the soft mass of cushioning with only  
# the feet resting on the floor, thereby increasing the burden of body  
**stabilization on internal muscular activity.11**  
# Still another source of discomfort may develop if the body weight  
# causes the front end of the seat cushion to elevate, placing pressure on  
# the bottom of the thigh and the nerves in that area. Similarly, if the  
# body sinks too deeply into the cushioning, the sides and possibly the  
# rear portions of the seat cushion may also elevate, producing  
# additional pressures on the various parts of the body involved. In  
# addition, the deeper the body sinks into the chair, the more effort is  
# required to get out of the chair.  
# It is obvious that hard, flat seats are uncomfortable for extended use. It  
**has also been suggested that excessively deep, soft cushioning can** **result in extreme discomfort. Although more research is required to**  
# objectively study the entire notion of sitter comfort, certain guidelines  
# for proper cushioning have been suggested. Diffrient recommends  
# that, for comfort, an average padded seat would have about 1.5 in, or  
# 3.8 cm, of medium foam padding over .5 in, or 1.3 cm, of firm closed-  
# cell padding, or a total of about 2 in, or 5.1 cm, with a maximum  
# allowable seat compression of about 1.5 in. The seat compression  
# allowance is based on a 172-lb, or 78-kg, male. For every 30 lb, or 13.6  
# kg, less, .25 in, or 6.4 mm, should be deducted. For every additional 30  
**lb, .25 in should be added.12 Croney recommends a depression of**  
**about ½ in, or 13 mm.13 Damon et al. suggest that 1 to 2 in, or 2.5 to**  
**5.1 cm, of compression would suffice.14** **A**

**NTHROPOMETRIC TABLES** **As discussed in Part A, there is a paucity of anthropometric data**  
# appropriate in both content and form, specifically for use by the  
# designers and builders of interior space. Much of the data available  
# were not originally gathered with either the designer or the builder  
# necessarily in mind. Accordingly, a large portion of the information in  
# circulation is limited in use, since it usually reflects a specific  
# population, age group, and sex not at all representative of the  
# customary design market. In most instances, with the exception of the  
# National Health Survey, the population is military, the age between 18  
# and 45 years, and the sex male—hardly a typical cross section of the  
# broad market served by the architectural and interior design  
# professions. To find all the data useful to the designer within a single  
# reference source is almost impossible.  
# After some research, an inventory of nearly one hundred  
# anthropometric studies involving almost one thousand different body  
# measurements was compiled. It was then necessary to scan this  
# inventory and filter out for presentation that information of most value  
# to the architect and interior designer. In certain instances, it was  
# necessary to modify the original form of the data so that they might be  
# used more efficiently by designers. Moreover, in all cases where metric  
# units were not indicated, necessary conversions were made. Where  
# appropriate, diagrams and figures were drawn to further illustrate and  
# explain the data. The result is the nine tables shown on the following  
# pages.  
# Every effort has been made to review all the data for errors and  
# inconsistencies. The quantity of statistics, the many different sources,  
# the lack of control over methodologies employed, the metrication  
# involved, the reproduction process, and the secondary nature of some

# In Part A, secular changes in the body size of populations, over periods  
# of time, were discussed. It was noted, for example, that the body size of  
# Second World War inductees was greater than that of First World War  
# inductees. A recent study by the U.S. Department of Health, Education,  
# and Welfare, taken in 1971–1974, indicates that relatively more men  
# and women are taller than those examined in the National Health  
# Survey of 1960–1962. Fifty-one percent of the men in the recent  
# survey were 175.3 cm, or 69 in, or taller as compared with 38 percent  
# in the 1960–1962 survey. Recognizing the significance of secular  
# change, as well as the length of the research and development cycle  
# associated with the design and production of various equipment—a  
# process typical of certain industries—projections of future body  
# measurements can at times prove extremely useful. At the very least  
# the inclusion of certain projections in these tables can, to some degree,  
# complete the spectrum of anthropometric data available to the  
# architect and interior designer. Table 5 includes such projections.  
# Selected anticipated female and male structural body measurements  
# for the year 1985 are shown. Only 5th and 95th percentile

# Flying Personnel conducted between 1950 and 1973. The data were  
# restricted to those from commissioned officers in the 23–25 age  
# range. The female measurements were estimated from a 1968 Air  
# Force Women’s survey. Unfortunately, there was no corresponding

# Flexion\: bending or decreasing the angle between the parts of the  
# body. Supplementing the more commonly measured arm and leg  
# flexions, several kinds of flexion have been identified to meet special  
**descriptive needs. These are *trunk lateral* flexion in which the trunk**  
# segments move so as to decrease the angle between them and the  
**right thigh; *radial* flexion, which refers to the movement of the thumb**  
# side of the hand toward the radial side of the forearm segments; and  
***ulnar* flexion, which refers to the opposite side of the hand’s**  
# movement toward the ulnar side of the forearm segment.  
# Extension\: straightening or increasing the angle between the parts of  
# the body. It is generally defined as the return from flexion. When a joint  
# is extended beyond the normal range of its movement, the movement  
# becomes known as “hyperextension.”  
# Abduction\: movement of a body segment away from the midline of the  
# body or body part to which it is attached.  
# Adduction\: movement of a body segment or segment combination  
# toward the midline of the body or body part to which it is attached.  
# Medial rotation\: turning toward the midline of the body.  
# Lateral rotation\: turning away from the midline of the body.  
# Pronation\: rotating the forearm so that the palm faces downward.  
# Supination\: rotating the forearm so that the palm faces upward.

**NDARDS** **The promise of easy answers associated with packaged solutions, rules**  
# of thumb, standards, and other presumably painless and time-saving  
# devices is understandably an appealing one. In certain situations,  
# reliance on such sources may be perfectly appropriate. In problems  
# dealing with such human factors as the interface between the human  
# body and the designed environment, however, the use of such sources  
# should be discouraged. The great variety of body sizes and dimensions  
# to be contended with and the almost infinite number of interface  
# scenarios possible make reliance on such sources sometimes  
# dangerous, often inappropriate, and usually unwise. In those instances  
# where so-called standards or rules of thumb may, in fact, be  
# appropriate, it is still more useful to understand the underlying  
# concepts, process, and rationale than to unquestioningly apply them  
**with only the end results in mind.** **INTENT**  
# In anticipation that the term “design reference standards,” the title  
# given to this section, should in any way be misconstrued to suggest the  
# promise of a handbook of ready-made design solutions, it is necessary  
# that the purpose of this section be made clear. It is definitely not  
# intended that the drawings on the following pages be viewed as design  
# solutions. They should serve simply as models or reference standards  
# in the development of a more anthropometrically based approach to  
# preliminary design, especially in areas involving the interface between  
# the human body and various design components of interior space. The  
# two areas of interface most commonly encountered in the average  
# interior design or architectural practice and the two explored in this  
# book are essentially of a physical and a visual nature. The physical  
# usually involves problems of clearance and reach. The visual involves  
# the field of vision in both the horizontal and the vertical planes. Both  
# are a function, directly or indirectly, of human dimension and the  
# range of joint motion. To intelligently resolve these problems, the  
# designer needs some basic knowledge of anthropometry, in terms of  
# both theory and application and an available data bank of body sizes  
# and dimensions. The former was the subject of Part A, the latter the  
**subject of Part B.** **THE DRAWINGS**  
# The drawings that follow identify various classic problems of interface  
# commonly encountered in the design of certain prototypical interior  
# spaces. By referring to the particular illustrations and the  
# accompanying drawing text, the designer will be able to undertake his  
# or her own individual analysis of any problem involving human  
# dimension and the quality of interface. To more clearly explain the  
# logic involved and to underscore the anthropometric aspect of the  
# process, it should be noted that each drawing contains certain  
# dimensional arrows drawn in solid line with code numbers written  
**above. The numbers represent certain standard body measurements.** **THE MATRICES**  
# The legend for translating these numbers into particular  
# anthropometric measurements is contained both in the master matrix  
# at the beginning of each section and in the matrix at the beginning of  
# each subsection. The dimension line indicates where the  
# measurement is taken. The following observations should make the  
# use of the matrix easier. One column lists the 24 body measurements.  
# The other column lists the various types of interior spaces. The circular  
# symbols indicate those specific measurements that are most  
# significant in the design of a particular space type. The darkened circles  
# signify that the measurement should be of the person having a larger  
# body size. The circles shown in outline indicate that the measurement  
# should be of a person having a smaller body size. The half darkened  
# circles suggest that both large and small body size data be considered.  
# The extended arrows identify the tables in Part B in which the related  
# body measurements can be found. The matrix at the beginning of each  
# subsection lists only those measurements relevant to that subsection.  
# The other column lists the basic activities involved, while the symbols  
# indicate those specific measurements most relevant to a particular  
**activity.** **THE CH**  
# ARTS  
# The arrows shown in broken line, with a letter above, indicate other  
# dimensional criteria that have been determined in order to comfortably  
# accommodate the designated body measurements. The charts on each  
# page are keyed to the letters and show the dimensions in both English  
# and metric systems.  
# Through the careful use of these drawings, tables, matrices, charts,  
# and text as a model, the designer of interior space should be able to  
# establish the dimensional requirements necessary to respond to the  
# anthropometric demands inherent in any type of interface situation  
# that includes the human body and that space. Preliminary design  
# assumptions so developed are sure to be far more responsive to  
# human dimension than arbitrary or often outdated standards or rules  
**of thumb.** **The design of seating, more than any other element of interior space,**  
# involves the elusive quality of user comfort. Since relatively little  
# research in this area has been undertaken, conflicting  
# recommendations abound for many of the dimensions involved. The  
# measurements indicated in the drawings on the following pages,  
# therefore, reflect basic anthropometric requirements and, within  
# reasonable parameters, generally accepted notions of comfort. The  
# intent of the diagrams is to indicate some of the more basic critical  
# dimensional requirements necessary to ensure a reasonable interface  
# between the human body and the seat and to establish an intelligent  
# point of departure for the design process. Part of this process, it should  
# be noted, involves the fabrication of full-size mockups and prototypes,  
# whereby function, esthetics, and user comfort can be properly  
# evaluated and design modifications made accordingly.  
# In many instances, seating is directly related to a table, desk, counter,  
# or a variety of special worksurfaces. However, the diagrams in this  
# section deal exclusively with the seat itself. The proper relationship  
# between the seat and other elements is included in those other  
# sections appropriate to the activity involved. For example, the  
# desk/chair relationship is included in Section 3 dealing with office  
# spaces; situations involving visibility and lines of sight from a seated  
# position are covered in the section on the design of audiovisual spaces.  
# The seating types included in the diagrams are executive chairs,  
# secretarial chairs, general purpose chairs, drafting stools, and  
# banquettes. The critical dimensions examined include seat height,  
# seat depth, seat width, seat angle, armrest height and spacing, and  
# backrest dimensions and slope.  
# It should be noted that the dimensions shown are taken from the  
# compressed seat padding or cushion surface. In the design of seating,  
# the relative resiliency and compressive qualities of the cushion are  
# therefore extremely important. Recommended seat compression  
**allowance varies, according to the source consulted, from ½ to 2 in, or** **1.3 to 5.1 cm, and is obviously a function of both the material used**  
# and the manner in which the padding is detailed. Section 4 of Part A  
# deals in greater detail with the question of cushioning and with the  
# general theory of seating design. This section should be consulted prior  
# to the application of any of the recommended dimensional  
**information shown in the following diagrams.** **The preceding diagram shows the more critical measurements to be**  
# considered in the design of the typical work or secretarial chair. To  
# function properly, its design must be responsive to human dimension.  
# Anthropometrically, the two most important measurements are  
# buttock-popliteal length and popliteal height. Provision for support of  
# the lumbar region by proper location of a backrest is essential for a  
# successful design.  
# The element of sitter comfort, however, is an elusive quality that defies  
# translation into simple dimensions. This factor alone, in addition to  
# the considerable variation in human body size, demands the exercise  
# of a great deal of personal judgment in establishing proper chair  
# dimensions. Currently used recommendations may vary, but they all  
# work and are generally responsive to anthropometric requirements.  
# For the most part, they are also within reasonable range of each other.  
# The authors felt it would be interesting, therefore, in addition to stating  
# their own dimensional suggestions, to present in the form of a chart  
# recommendations from a variety of respected sources. It should be  
**recognized, however, that the primary intent of the data presented is to** **provide the designer with a basis for initial preliminary design**  
# assumptions and mockups—not a final design solution.

# accommodate most adults, except very small females, who may

**K 23–29 58.4–73.7** **The following diagram shows the dimensions for an executive chair, a**  
# type intended for a longer duration of use. The buttock-popliteal  
# length governs the seat depth. This length, for 95 percent of both men  
# and women, is 17-in, or 43.2-cm, or more. A seat depth not exceeding  
# that should, therefore, accommodate a large majority of users. The  
# very large person, however, would find that such a depth might leave a  
# substantial portion of his thigh unsupported, while a very small person  
# would find that the edge of the seat might dig into the tissue behind  
**his or her knee.** **The easy chair, shown in the drawing above, is a difficult chair type to**  
# design, or establish guidelines for, since it is primarily intended for  
# relaxation and comfort—qualities which are highly personal.  
# Nevertheless, the drawing offers some basic dimensions for use in  
# making preliminary design assumptions. The following suggestions  
# should also prove helpful\: \(1\) The angle formed by thighs and trunk  
# should not be less than 105°. Angles significantly less than this will  
# cause discomfort. \(2\) Design should allow the user to change body  
# posture. \(3\) The front edge of the seat should be rounded to prevent  
# irritation. \(4\) The backrest should provide lumbar support by following  
# the spinal contour in the lumbar region. \(5\) The seat surface should tilt  
# backwards. Too severe an angle, however, may cause a person difficulty  
# in getting up from the chair, particularly for elderly people. A seat angle  
# of about 15° should be adequate. \(6\) If the angle formed by the

# CES  
# The various activities and elements of furniture usually associated with  
# living spaces result in many levels of interface between the human  
# body and the physical components of the space. The most obvious is  
# between the user and the chair or sofa. In this regard seat height must  
# take into consideration popliteal height, while seat depth must be  
# responsive to buttock-popliteal length. Circulation around seating  
# elements must accommodate maximum body breadth, while the  
# location of a coffee table in relation to a chair should be responsive to  
# human reach dimensions. The height at which a painting is hung on a  
# wall should be determined in relationship to eye height. The  
# possibilities are almost endless and the drawings on the following  
# pages explore only a few of the many design situations that require  
**knowledge of human dimensions. The matrix above indicates some of** **the anthropometric measurements to take into consideration to**  
**ensure the proper levels of interface.** **The drawings in the following pages examine the relationship of female**  
# and male body dimensions to sofa seating, in order to determine how  
# much space the seated body requires. The anthropometric  
# measurements of major interest here are maximum body breadth and  
# buttock-popliteal length.  
# The preceding drawing deals with male dimensions; based on 95th  
# percentile data, the maximum body breadth dimension is 22.8 in, or  
# 57.9 cm, with a nude subject. Allowing for clothing and some body  
# movement as well as change in posture and position, a minimum  
# dimension of 28 in, or 71.1 cm, is suggested as a width allowance for a  
# seated person. The overall dimension, therefore, includes the  
**individual width allowances and the width of a sofa arm construction,** **which obviously can vary depending on personal design preference. A**  
# range of 3 to 6 in, or 7.6 to 15.2 cm, is suggested. Using the buttock-  
# popliteal length of the smaller person and adding a similar allowance of  
# 6 to 9 in, or 15.2 to 22.9 cm, for backrest construction as well as a  
# minimum zone in front of the sofa for foot movement, an overall depth  
# dimension of 42 to 48 in, or 106.7 to 121.9 cm, is suggested.  
# The rationale for the drawing above dealing with female data is the  
# same. The information should prove not only useful in providing a  
# keener insight into the general relationship between body size and  
# furniture but of specific value in establishing preliminary design  
**assumptions for institutional seating in spaces designed exclusively for** **the use of males or of females. In spaces where seating is to be used by**

**it does accommodate human reach, permitting the seated person** **access to the coffee table without rising. The drawing also suggests a**  
# dimensional range for verbal conversation.  
# The drawing shown above illustrates a similar furniture arrangement  
# that would permit circulation with full head-on access. The clearance  
# indicated, however, to permit such access would make it impossible for  
# most people to reach the coffee table from a seated position. This  
# could be extremely undesirable in terms of food, beverages, and  
# cigarettes. Given the choice between full head-on access and the  
# accommodation of reach, the authors opt for reach and recommend  
# the smaller clearance.  
# The following drawing suggests an overall allowance for easy chair or  
# reclining chair seating, including footrest. The buttock-leg length of  
# the larger person is the most significant anthropometric measurement  
# in establishing this clearance. It should also be noted that the height of  
# the footrest is also a function of seat height. The footrest should be a  
**few inches below the height of the seat.** **The drawings above and on the following pages illustrate the**

# CES  
# In examining the relationship between human dimension and dining  
# spaces, the areas of most concern to the designer are the clearances  
# around the table and the number of people a table of a particular size  
# can accommodate. The clearance between the edge of the table and  
# the wall or any other physical obstruction must at the very least  
# accommodate two elements\: \(1\) the space occupied by the chair and  
# \(2\) the maximum body breadth of a person of larger body size as he  
# circulates between the chair and the wall. In dealing with the space  
# occupied by the chair, it should be noted that its position, relative to  
# the edge of the table, will change several times during the course of a  
# meal. Towards the end of a meal, perhaps while the person is engaged  
# in informal conversation or in an effort to change body posture, the  
# chair may be extended farther from the table. As a person leaves the  
**table, the chair may be located even farther away. Comfortable** **clearance should assume the chair to be at its farthest distance from**  
# the table.  
# Too often in calculating the number of people to be accommodated  
# around the table, the designer relies exclusively on plastic furniture  
# templates or on the application of a 24-in, or 61-cm, center to center  
# chair spacing, instead of considering the maximum body breadth of  
# the person of larger body size, the fact that the elbows may be  
# extended, and, finally, the size of the place setting itself. To ensure a  
# proper interface between the human body and the table during the  
# dining process, not only must the anthropometric considerations  
# discussed above be taken into account, but the human body, the chair,  
# the table, and the place setting must be viewed as a system. It should  
# also be noted that the size of the place setting will determine how  
# much table area will be available for centrally located shared elements,  
# such as beverages or serving dishes. The drawings on the following  
# pages examine all these conditions and should be helpful not only in  
# making preliminary design assumptions, but more importantly in  
**establishing an approach for individual design analysis.** **To determine table size it is helpful to view the table as consisting of**  
# two zones. The place setting zone represents the personal activity  
# space directly in front of the individual diner. Ideally, it should be of  
# adequate size to accommodate the necessary dinnerware, silverware,  
# glassware, etc., both in its original structured form and in its eventual  
# state of disarray during the course of its use. The width of this zone  
# should also accommodate the human dimension and body positions  
# assumed during the eating process. Etiquette aside, it should be  
# generous enough to allow for the inevitable projection of the elbows.  
# Anthropometrically, the maximum body breadth measurement of the  
# larger person should be considered. Accordingly, the optimal width  
# suggested for this zone, allowing for elbow projection, is about 30 in, or  
# 76.2 cm, and the minimal width about 24 in, or 61 cm. To allow for the  
# elements of the setting itself, the optimal and minimal depths  
# suggested for this zone are 18 and 16 in, or 45.7 and 40.6 cm,  
# respectively. The optimal place setting zone can be viewed as a  
# rectangle, 30 by 18 in, or 76.2 by 45.7 cm, and the minimal zone, 24  
# by 16 in, or 61 by 40.6 cm.

# purpose table for informal dining. Although the width and depth of the  
# place-setting zones are the same as in the larger rectangular tables,  
# their angular configuration reduces the area significantly as well as the  
# area of the shared access zone. To allow clearance for the chair and  
# head-on circulation behind the chair, a minimum distance of 48 in, or  
# 121.9 cm, must be maintained between the edge of the table and the  
# wall or nearest physical obstruction. A clearance of 36 to 42 in, or 91.4

# than the 36-in, or 91.4-cm, diameter table shown above. If used for

**person standing, arranging, or otherwise preparing food to be served.** **The relationship of the chair to the dining table is an important**  
# consideration. The drawing shown above explores two basic aspects of  
# this relationship. The first is the various locations of the chair in  
# relation to the table during the course of the meal and the clearances  
# involved; the chair may be relocated as many as four times during the  
# dining process. At the beginning, it is much closer to the table. Near  
# the end of the meal, perhaps while the person is sipping coffee and  
# attempting to relax by changing body position, the chair may be moved  
# away from the table about 24 in, of 61 cm. Intimate conversation may  
# cause the chair to be brought closer to the table than at the beginning.  
# Finally, as the person rises from the chair at the conclusion of the  
# meal, its final location may be as much as 36 in, or 91.4 cm away. The  
# drawing indicates that the edge of the table should be at least 36 in, or  
# 91.4 cm, away from the wall or nearest obstruction to accommodate  
# all these movements. The height of the seat above the floor should  
**allow the foot to rest firmly on the ground. If the seat height is too** **great, the foot will dangle and the area of the thigh just behind the**  
# knee will become pinched and irritated. A seat height of 16 to 17 in, or  
# 40.6 to 41.3 cm, should be adequate to accommodate most people.  
# Adequate clearance for the thigh should also be provided between the  
# top of the seat and the underside of the table. As indicated on the  
# drawing, 7.5 in, or 19.1 cm, is the minimum required. The backrest of  
# the chair should be properly located to give support to the lumbar  
# region of the back. The height of the table top from the floor should be  
# between 29 and 30 in, or 73.7 to 76.2 cm. The following drawing  
# indicates that to allow sufficient clearance for someone to pass or  
# serve, the table should be located between 48 and 60 in, or 121.9 to  
# 152.4 cm, from the wall.

# CES  
# The drawings on the following pages explore the relationship of human  
# dimension to the various components of sleeping spaces, the most  
# obvious being the bed itself, both in its conventional form and in its  
# overhead space-saving design. Often if a designer is preoccupied with  
# glamorizing the sleeping environment, some of the more basic  
# anthropometric considerations are ignored. Is there adequate space  
# around the bed not only to circulate but to make it or vacuum under it?  
# Is there adequate clearance between the bed and a dresser, with a  
# drawer extended for circulation? If a view to the exterior of the space is  
# important, what impact does the sill height have on the sight lines with  
# the human body in a reclining position? In the design of a bunk or loft  
# bed, how much clearance is required from the top of the lower bed to  
**the bottom of the bed above to accommodate the human body in a** **seated position? How much clearance should be allowed between rows**  
# of hanging garments in a walk-in closet for comfortable human  
# access? How high should a storage shelf be located to be within reach?  
# How high should the mirror be over a dressing table for comfortable  
# use?  
# Templates and rules of thumb as aids in designing the space can often  
# be misleading. What can be equally misleading is for the designer to  
# use himself or herself as a model in an attempt to simulate conditions  
# related to reach and clearance situations, since what may  
# accommodate the designer, may not accommodate the majority of  
# users. The following drawings examine human body size, in relation to  
# the various design situations mentioned, in terms of the  
**anthropometric considerations indicated in the above matrix.** **The drawings shown above illustrate standard variations of the typical**  
# single and double bed. The figures are shown simply to provide some  
# approximation of the space required by the human body in  
# relationship to the bed area. The drawings should not be taken too  
# literally. The body positions assumed while sleeping may, in fact, take  
# up far more space than shown. The clearances indicated to the edges  
# of the bed are also quite academic and are intended only to provide a  
# better sense of the bed sizes available and the general relationship of  
# body size to bed size.

# To conserve space, underbed storage may be used in many instances.  
# In such situations, it is essential that adequate clearance be provided  
# between the bed and the wall or the nearest physical obstruction to  
**ensure comfortable access.** **As indicated in the next drawing, a clearance of 46 to 62 in, or 116.8 to**

# kneeling position as well as the projection of a partially extended

# 37 to 39 in, or 93 to 99 cm, where a bed of low height is involved. Bed

# the strain on the back would be greatly reduced. Such a height,  
# however, does hot accommodate the seated user comfortably, as

# The bottom drawings show vertical clearances between the seat  
# surface and the underside of the table and between the seat surface  
# and the floor as well as the distance from the top of the desk to the  
# floor. The clearances between the seat surface and the underside of the  
# table should anthropometrically accommodate the thigh clearance of  
# the person of larger body size and the seat height should  
# accommodate the popliteal height of the larger person. The  
# relationship of seat height to worksurface is a classic one that also  
# applies to dining tables, conference tables, and office desks. The  
# following drawing shows the clearances required between a dresser  
**and the bed.** **Overhead sleeping facilities are a common space-saving device,**  
# particularly where the number of bedrooms or bedroom size is limited.  
# Although standard bunk beds are available on the market, it is often  
# necessary because of user preference or existing conditions within the  
# interior space to custom design the bed installation. The initial drawing  
# shows the vertical clearances necessary to accommodate an adult of  
# large body size. The most essential body measurement  
# anthropometrically is sitting height. If vertical space is extremely  
# critical, it would be wise to measure the actual sitting height of the  
# intended user in the hope that a few inches might be saved. It should  
# be noted that 95 percent of men between the ages of 18 and 79 have a

# The height of the upper bunk should be established as minimally

# ladder climb will not be greater than necessary. The following drawing  
# illustrates the vertical clearances necessary for a loft bed. To ensure

# critical anthropometric dimension is the stature of the person of larger  
# body size. Popliteal height and buttock-toe length are also useful in  
# approximating the degree of intrusion of the leg and the foot of the  
**seated person into the circulation space below.** **It should be noted that in design situations where space below the bed**  
# is used for a function other than circulation, such as dining or a desk-  
**related activity, the vertical clearances can be reduced accordingly.** **The two drawings above show the vertical clearances related to male**

# the closet shelf should be located within human reach. The height  
# shown for the high shelf has been established based on 5th percentile

# smaller body size. Any shelf located at a greater distance above the  
# floor should be used primarily for storage that requires only infrequent

# The height of a kitchen workcounter, the proper clearance between  
# cabinets or appliances for circulation, the accessibility to overhead or  
# undercounter storage, and proper visibility are among the primary  
# considerations in the design of cooking spaces. All must be responsive  
# to human dimension and body size if the quality of interface between  
# the user and the components of the interior space are to be adequate.  
# In establishing clearances between counters, the maximum body  
# breadth and depth of the user of larger body size must be taken into  
# account as well as the projections of the appliances. Refrigerator doors,  
# cabinet drawers, dishwashing machine doors, and cabinet doors all  
# project to some degree in their open position into the space within  
**which the user must circulate and must be accommodated.** **Standard kitchen counter heights manufactured are all about 36 in, or**  
# 91.4 cm. But such a height does not necessarily accommodate the  
# body dimension of all users for all tasks. Certain cooking activities, for  
# example, may be more efficiently performed from a standing position,  
# but with a counter height less than 36 in. In overhead cabinets the  
# upper shelves are usually inaccessible to the smaller person, while the  
# lower shelves are usually inaccessible to most without bending or  
# kneeling. The logical answer is the development of kitchen cabinet  
# systems capable of total adjustability to accommodate the human  
# dimension of the individual user. Such a system could accommodate  
# not only those of smaller and larger body size, but also elderly and  
# disabled people. The drawings on the following pages examine the  
# question of human dimension in terms of the anthropometric  
# measurements indicated in the above matrix. It should be noted,  
# however, that the drawings are intended merely to illustrate the  
# relationship of body size to clearances and reach situations and not to  
# suggest an overall functional plan for the kitchen or the ergonomic  
**relationship between workcenters.** **The drawings above illustrate some of the basic horizontal clearances**  
# required in a kitchen. The drawing at the top shows clearances  
# between two counters with base cabinets. A total clearance between  
# cabinets of 60 to 66 in, or 152.4 to 167 cm, will accommodate the  
# human body and an extended drawer or hinged cabinet door in the  
# workzone and in the circulation zone the maximum body breadth of a  
# person of larger body size. The B dimension of 48 in, or 121.9 cm, is a  
**recommended minimum clearance between cabinets when the full** **circulation zone shown is not desired. The bottom drawing also shows**

# One of the most dramatic examples of a design situation where little  
# consideration is given to the relationship of human dimension and  
# body size to the designed environment can be found in practically every  
# bathroom, private and public. Few designers, builders, and users give  
# any thought to the height above the floor of a lavatory. Hours, if not  
# days, may be spent in the selection of the appropriate color, fixture,  
# model, or trim. The height, however, is rarely specified and is simply left  
# to the contractor in the field, who automatically installs it at the height  
# that it has been installed for years simply because “that’s the way it’s  
# done.” The designer who does specify a height, in either a drawing or  
# written specifications, does nothing more than use the same criteria  
# employed in the field, but gives it more legitimacy by incorporating it  
**into the drawing.** **The fact is that it is not natural for the body to assume a stooped**  
# posture while washing the hands and face. This posture is  
# necessitated, however, because most basin heights are only about 30  
# in, or 76.2 cm, above the floor. It is interesting to note that 30 in is also  
# the average height of a desk or dining table, yet if a person were forced  
# to write or eat from a standing position, each of the surfaces would  
# have to be raised at least 6 to 12 in, or 15.2 to 30.5 cm. The drawings  
# on the following pages examine the relationship of body size to the  
# lavatory and other elements of bathroom spaces. The matrix above  
# indicates some of the more important anthropometric measurements  
**that should be considered in the design of bathrooms.** **The drawing shown first illustrates some of the basic anthropometric**  
# considerations related to the lavatory area. Perhaps the most obvious  
# problem concerns the height of the lavatory above the floor. For too  
# long this dimension has been established in the field on so-called  
# trade practice at 31 to 34 in, or 78.7 to 86.3 cm, and has little  
# relationship to the anthropometric requirements involved. Optimum  
# work height for the hands on a counter or work bench situation is  
# established at about 2 to 3 in, or 5 to 7.6 cm, below elbow height.  
# Published data show that only 5 percent of a male sampling measured  
# had an elbow height of 41.3 in, or 104.9 cm, or less, while 5 percent of  
# a female sampling had an elbow height of 38.6 in, or 98 cm.  
# Subtracting 3 in from the female measurement would place a  
# comfortable height for the lavatory at 35.6 in, or 90.4 cm.

# A clearance of 54 in, or 137.2 cm, between walls, as shown in the two  
# preceding drawings, will not only accommodate the variety of body  
# positions shown, but will also allow for a small 12-in, or 30.5-cm,  
# seating surface. The height of the adjustable shower head should be  
# within reach of the adult of smaller body size, but at the same time  
# high enough to clear the head of most people of larger body size. In  
# situations where children use the same facility, an adjustable shower  
**head is suggested in order to place it within reach of the child.** **The drawing shown above illustrates some of the basic clearances**  
# required for a combination shower and tub. Dimensions concerning

# considerations involved, however, will prove helpful in making the  
# appropriate selection. If the user enjoys reclining and soaking for  
# extended periods, a large-size tub may not necessarily be the wisest  
# selection. The length of the tub at the bottom surface should  
# approximate the buttock-heel length of the smaller user. This will  
# allow the feet to bear against the end of the tub and act as a brace to  
**prevent the body from sliding too far under the water.** **The following drawing illustrates that condition. The last drawing**

**L 56–60 142.2–152.4** **Since the 1950s, office design has become one of the major areas of**  
# specialization for the designer. Millions of square feet of office space  
# are designed each year. The proliferation of business and the ensuing  
# demand for large corporation headquarters resulted in the need to  
# plan spaces capable of housing hundreds and even thousands of  
# people within the same space. People spend nearly half their waking  
# hours within an office environment of one type or another. Some may  
# literally spend an entire lifetime in the employ of the same firm.  
# Expanding world markets will create an even greater demand for more  
# space. Moreover, as technology changes, its impact on the  
# methodology of transacting business and the systems involved will  
# necessitate further recycling of existing office spaces to respond to new  
# needs. Concurrently, spiraling costs of construction and land  
# acquisition, increasing scarcity of available urban building sites, and  
# higher production costs will place greater demands on the designer for  
# efficient, cost-conscious, and economical utilization of office space.  
# The reconciliation of economic imperatives and human factors within  
# the design process will require a greater sensitivity and awareness on  
# the part of the designer to the relationship of human dimension and  
# interior space. Accordingly, the anthropometric implications of  
# people’s relationship to various aspects of the office environment,  
# such as conference rooms, private and general offices, and reception  
# areas, are explored in the pages that follow. Clearances between desks,  
# heights of worksurfaces, human reach limitations, human  
# requirements for paths of circulation are all investigated and  
**diagrammed both in plan and section.** **3.1 THE PRIVATE OFFICE**  
# The design of certain aspects of private office spaces involves many of  
# the same considerations related to human dimension and body size as  
# were explored in certain aspects of residential spaces. The most  
# important component of the private office space, or any office space for  
# that matter, is the desk itself and related elements. Considering that  
# the user may well spend over half of his waking hours within the  
# immediate workspace, the importance of ensuring a designed  
# environment responsive to human dimension assumes added  
# significance.  
# The relationship of human dimension to the executive chair was  
# examined in detail in Section 1, while the general anthropometric  
# theory regarding seating was explored in Section 4 of Part A. Although  
**the drawings indicate the importance of certain body dimensions,** **including popliteal height and buttock-popliteal length related to the**  
# chair, it is the relationship of the seated person to the desk itself that is  
# stressed. In this regard, the importance of thigh clearance and knee  
# height in ensuring proper clearance from the top of the seat to the  
# underside of the desk is illustrated and minimum dimensions  
# suggested. Clearances around the desk, the importance of an  
# overhanging desk top for informal desk conferences, the clearances  
# behind the desk so that credenza and file can be within reach are all  
# reflected in the many design situations examined in the drawings on  
# the following pages. The more significant body measurements to be  
**considered are indicated in the matrix above.** **The drawing above illustrates the basic dimensional requirements of**  
# an executive workstation with visitor seating for three. While image  
# and scale often dictate the size of the executive desk and the  
# placement of the furniture around it, the generally accepted size  
# suggested is 30 to 45 by 66 to 84 in, or 76.2 to 114.3 by 167.6 to  
# 213.4 cm. The specific work habits of the executive and the nature of  
# his or her business must be considered in determining the appropriate  
# worksurface measurements.

**S 22–32 55.9–81.3** **Critical attention must be given to the selection, placement, and**  
# clearances provided for seating around the desk. Both drawings  
# indicate the need to carefully consider the buttock-knee length, hip  
# breadth, and maximum body breadth measurements. The dimensions  
# for the various zones and clearances, while predicated on basic  
# anthropometric considerations, are often a function of circulation  
# within the space and the furniture type.  
# Buttock-toe length as well as body depth determines placement of a  
# visitor’s chair in front of the desk, with the distance from the desk  
# often a function of whether the desk has an overhang. Placement of a  
# hanging fixture must relate to an appropriate determination of eye  
**level and sight lines.** **The use of the overhangs, shown with the preceding drawing, can**  
# make a desk suitable for a small conference. As indicated, both knee  
# and toe clearances are a factor. A 42-in, or 106.7-cm, minimum  
# dimension is recommended for the work/activity zone. However, if  
# filing or storage units are provided behind this zone, additional space  
# should be allocated for drawer extension and door swings. In many  
# instances, the work/activity zone distance is also determined by the  
# size of the executive chair, its tilt and swivel mobility, and the work  
# habits of the executive. Side arm reach, as shown in the following  
# drawing is often critical in establishing the work/activity zone if specific  
# business equipment, such as calculators, telephones, keyboards, must  
**be within easy reach.** **The height of the desk as well as that of the credenza behind it will vary**  
# from manufacturer to manufacturer. Popliteal height, knee height, and  
# thigh clearance should always be considered in establishing the  
# relationship between seat height and desk height.

# behind the desk, with vertical storage or shelving above. Assuming that  
# ease of access to the top shelf is of importance, it is recommended that  
# the maximum shelf height to accommodate male reach be no greater  
# than 72 in, or 182.9 cm, and for female reach no greater than 69 in, or

# not conform with the basic rectangular shape. Such a situation is  
# illustrated in the drawing at the top which shows a circular executive  
# desk. Such a desk is often selected if the executive in question plans to  
# hold conferences within the office and prefers the psychology of having  
# either visitors or employees gather around the worksurface in an  
# egalitarian fashion. While a minimum desk size of 48 in, or 121.9 cm,  
# is shown, this dimension is also influenced by the number of side  
# chairs to be grouped around the desk.

# In the general office as well as the private one, the interface between  
# the seated user and the desk is of central importance. The quality of  
# interface between user and workstation will determine the general  
# comfort and well-being of the office staff and the efficiency of  
# production within the office space.  
# The proper design of the secretarial chair, its seat height in relation to  
# the popliteal height of the user and the top of the typing return,  
# appropriate backrest design to ensure positive lumbar support, proper  
**height of overhead storage, side arm reach and forward arm reach** **dimensions of the majority of the users are all extremely critical**  
# anthropometric considerations to take into account in the design of  
# general office spaces. Clearance for circulation within general office  
# spaces should accommodate the maximum body breadth and depth of  
# those of larger body size. The relationship of human dimension and  
# body size of the seated person to the filing cabinet is yet another  
# consideration. Eye height of the standing and seated user in  
# relationship to the height of a low partition in an open plan system is  
# one more anthropometric factor to consider. Of importance also is the  
# recognition of the great range in body size between the large and small  
# male, the large and small female, and the large male and small female.  
# The foregoing considerations are included among the specific design  
# situations examined in the drawings on the following pages, and  
# dimensional data are suggested for use in making preliminary design

**considered are indicated in the matrix above.** **The basic workstation, as illustrated in both plan and section on this**

# anthropometric considerations for the planning and design of the  
# general office. The worktask zone must be large enough to  
# accommodate the paperwork, equipment, and other accessories that  
# support the user’s function. The work/activity zone dimension, shown  
# with the preceding drawing, is established by the space requirements  
# needed for use of the typical return. In no case should this distance be  
# less than the 30 in, or 76.2 cm, needed to provide adequate space for  
# the chair clearance zone. The visitor seating zone, ranging in depth  
# from 30 to 42 in, or 76.2 to 106.7 cm, requires the designer to

**swivels or if it has casters\) also influence these dimensions.** **The two elevations shown above illustrate the major anthropometric**  
# considerations for the seated male and female user at both

# In addition to providing appropriate clearance for seat rotation and  
# access to files, it is important to consider the circulation zone  
# requirement for passage behind the seat at the typical workstation.  
# The edge of this zone should take into account the movement of the  
# chair within the chair clearance zone to avoid obstruction of any people  
# circulating behind it. Minimal recommended clearance to allow for that  
# circulation is predicated upon the maximum clothed body breadth of  
# the larger user. Accordingly, this minimum dimension, allowing for the  
# circulation of only one person, should not be less than 30 in, or 76.2  
# cm. Based upon this minimum dimension and allowing for the  
# requirements of the worktask and chair clearance zones, the overall  
# distance from the front of the worksurface to the line of wall or  
# obstruction should fall between 94 and 114 in, or 238.8 and 289.6  
**cm.** **Anthropometrically, the circulation zone and the visitor seating zone**  
# must accommodate both maximum body breadth and buttock-toe  
# length measurements of the larger person. Note that in the illustration  
# shown, the visitor seating zone is within an initial range of 24 to 30 in,  
# or 61 to 76.2 cm. Allowing additional clearance from knee to edge of  
# workstation of 6 to 12 in, or 15.2 to 30.4 cm, an overall visitor seating

# This assumes that the individual in the visitor’s chair does not push it  
# back when coming or going, but will stand and then move laterally in  
# the space allocated. It should also be noted that the lack of a desk top  
# overhang does not provide an adequate interface between visitor and  
# desk for close-up conferences. The circulation zone dimension is  
# shown as a minimum of 36 in, or 91.4 cm. In addition to maximum  
# body breadth, the figure in this illustration is shown carrying an  
# attache case in his hand. The attache case is there to suggest that in  
# those circulation zones, where the carrying of objects \(documents,  
# trays, files\) is required, additional space must be allocated for that  
# function. The elevation at the bottom shows a circulation zone  
# adjacent to the worktask zone that is wide enough to permit clear

# Grouping the typical workstation in a U-shaped configuration is

# common responsibilities or work together on joint tasks or where the

# The drawing shown on the following page demonstrates the  
# relationship of the workstation with a circulation zone behind it, as well  
# as an allowance for full extension of the file drawer. The distance the  
# extended file drawer projects is a function of the type of file storage  
# unit. An overall dimension range of 48 and 56 in, or 121.9 and 142.2  
# cm, is provided to accommodate a circulation zone and the file drawer  
# in its extended position. It should be noted, however, that if constant  
# access to the file cabinets is necessary, the circulation zone will be  
# violated, in which case a different plan arrangement should be  
**considered.** **As the drawing above clearly demonstrates, an obstructed circulation**  
# zone results if appropriate consideration is not given to the extension  
# of the file drawer. Such a situation must be avoided at all costs, unless  
# the file cabinet in question is clearly used for dead files or the  
# circulation zone is one of limited usage. The following drawing,  
**however, shows proper filing and access clearances.** **Access to the extended drawer has been provided both from the side**  
# and from the front. The work zone, specifically provided for filing,  
# accommodates the anthropometric dimension of body depth, in  
# addition to allowing for the extended file drawer. Immediately  
# contiguous to the file work zone is a semiactive circulation zone of 36  
# in, or 91.4 cm, based upon maximum body breadth of the larger  
# person. A 36-in, or 91.4-cm, dimension should be utilized instead of

# The drawings on the following pages examine the relationship of  
# human dimension to the design of reception spaces. The three key  
# areas of concern include visitor seating, the reception desk, and  
# location of graphics or corporate identification. In regard to seating, the  
# clearances around the seating elements to accommodate circulation  
# are stressed more than the design of the individual seating unit itself,  
# which is examined in more detail in Section 4 of Part A and Section 1 of  
# Part C. Of particular importance is the design of the reception desk in  
# terms of its responsiveness to the anthropometric requirements of the  
# seated receptionist and the standing visitor within the context of a  
# high counter-type arrangement and a conventional desk arrangement.  
# The depth of the worksurface should accommodate the thumb tip  
**reach measurements of the user of smaller body size so that packages** **and correspondence can be exchanged. Of equal importance is eye**  
# height sitting to ensure visibility over the counter and eye contact with  
# the standing visitor. Eye height of both the seated and standing person  
# is also essential in establishing the height and location of corporate  
# signage or other graphic material to ensure its visibility. Details of such  
# elements of reception spaces are included in this section as well as  
# suggested clearances and other dimensions for use in preliminary  
# design assumptions. The key anthropometric measurements are  
**indicated in the above matrix.** **The corporate logo is often displayed within the reception room. Since**  
# it is used to graphically identify the tenant, it must be placed in a  
# visually prominent location. The drawing above indicates the critical  
# anthropometric measurements to be considered. The eye height of the  
# smaller and larger seated and standing viewer defines the visual ranges  
# to be considered. The specific vertical and horizontal dimensions of the  
# company identification or display should vary with the distance of the  
# viewer from the display as well as the design intent of the graphics.  
# \(Section 9 in Part C should be consulted for additional information on  
# sight lines.\)  
# Illustrated on the following page is the circular workstation sometimes  
# used in relatively large reception spaces. Two major factors that  
**influence the ultimate size of this element are the minimum radius to** **accommodate the receptionist within the inner circular area and the**  
# circumference of the outer perimeter available to accommodate  
# visitors.  
# The key anthropometric body dimensions required to accommodate  
# the receptionist are that of buttock-knee length and body depth,  
# permitting the movement and clearance of the chair. The minimum  
# recommended diameter is shown as 44 in, or 111.8 cm. The depth of  
# the worksurface, anthropometrically, should accommodate the side  
# arm reach and thumb tip reach dimensions of the smaller person. A  
# dimension in the range of 24 to 30 in, or 61 to 76.2 cm, is  
# recommended.

# The general approach in establishing conference table sizes is much  
# the same as that used for dining tables. Instead of the place setting  
# used with dining tables, a workzone to accommodate documents,  
# papers, and other reference materials should be taken into  
# consideration. The amount of material to be accommodated, however,  
# may vary greatly depending on the nature of the organization involved  
# and the type of meeting. The amount of perimeter space allocated to  
# each individual should at the very least be adequate to accommodate  
# the maximum body breadth, allow for the extension of the elbows  
# away from the body, and provide for documents and other material. If  
# public hearings or meetings involving a large degree of formality and  
# protocol are involved, allowances around the table may be increased so  
# significantly as to make the accommodation of human dimension  
**academic. The other factor to be considered in conjunction with seat** **spacing is its effect on sight lines directed at either end of the table.**  
# Clearances around the table for circulation should accommodate the  
# maximum body breadth of the user of larger body size and allow for the  
# space taken up by the chair itself. The drawings on the following pages  
# illustrate various table configurations and include dimensional data  
# suggested for use in making preliminary design assumptions. The key  
**anthropometric data to be considered is indicated in the above matrix.** **The preceding two drawings illustrate a square and a circular**  
# conference arrangement for four people. Such a minimal-size table  
# might be found within a small room or, more commonly, interspersed  
# within the framework of a larger space or open office plan. A  
# recommended distance of 18 to 24 in, or 45.7 to 61 cm, is shown for  
# the distance required from the edge of the table to the back of the  
**chair, with the chair in a normal position. Anthropometric** **considerations determining this dimension are buttock-knee length**  
# and maximum body depth measurements of people of larger body size.  
# The drawing on the following page shows the typical relationship of  
# two people sitting across from each other at a conference table.  
# The distance across the table becomes an important factor if papers  
# are to be exchanged. A width of 36 to 54 in, or 91.4 to 137.2 cm, is  
# recommended. Table height should also be analyzed for its  
# relationship to popliteal height, knee height, and thigh clearance. A  
# range of 29 to 30 in, or 73.7 to 76.2 cm, is preferred, with the smaller  
# dimension favored where writing tasks are emphasized.

# The actual dimensions of the conference table are a function of the  
# number of people to be seated. The square table illustrated provides for  
# eight people, with each side ranging from 54 to 60 in, or 137.2 to  
# 152.4 cm. The larger dimension is more appropriate to accommodate  
# people of larger body size and to allow for a more generous work zone  
# for each person. This translates into 30 in, or 76.2 cm, per person,  
# which constitutes a comfortable perimeter allocation. The circular  
# table on the following page comfortably accommodates five people  
# while allowing for a 30-in, or 76.2-cm, access zone between chairs. To  
# accommodate both sitting zone and circulation zone, a space with a  
# radius ranging from 72 to 81 in, or 182.9 to 205.7 cm, must be  
**provided.** **The drawing above represents a U-shaped conference table that might**  
# ordinarily be associated with a large-scale corporate board meeting or a  
# public hearing. Such an arrangement, in addition to the basic  
# anthropometric considerations mentioned on the previous pages,  
# must also accommodate access and circulation. In the situation  
# shown, the conference table work zone includes an internal circulation

# The spacing of chairs is not only important in terms of defining

# minimum of 72 in, or 182.8 cm, is recommended. \(Section 9,  
# Audiovisual Spaces, in Part C should be consulted for more specific  
**information.\)** **The first stores in this country were simply incorporated into the**  
# homes of the craftsmen who produced and sold their wares on the  
# premises. The shop was usually located in a front room, with quarters  
# for the family and apprentices at the rear or on another floor. By the  
# 19th century, however, a new breed of enterprising merchants  
# emerged who were primarily interested, not in the production of the  
# product, but in its purchase and resale to others. At first, they too  
# operated from their homes, but the storage requirements for their  
# inventory soon compelled them to take over the entire house for  
# business purposes. Eventually, they outgrew the house as a place of  
# operation and had to relocate in buildings that could be used for  
# warehousing as well as sales. Although sales was essential to their  
# operation, the building’s interior still looked and functioned as a  
# warehouse, not the store as it is perceived today. Ambiance, user  
# comfort, store image, display systems, and adjacency planning were  
# not considered. Customer convenience, in terms of building location  
# and design, was traded off for storage space and proximity to  
# transportation arteries. By the turn of the century, some thought was  
# given to the display of merchandise, and stores begn to lose some of  
# the warehouse look. After World War II, as large chain store operations  
# were created, as shopping centers and malls evolved as a new  
# prototype for mercantile space, and as new stores were constructed  
# throughout the country, emphasis was placed on the design of store  
# interiors, based on market research, buying habits, merchandising  
# theory, and customer convenience.  
# Today the essential function of mercantile spaces, small or large, is to  
# display and sell merchandise. If the quality of the interface between the  
# customer and the interior space is poor, the purpose of that space is  
# defeated. Likewise, if the quality of the interface between the store  
# personnel and that space is not adequate, the effectiveness of the store  
# will be diminished. The points of interface are too numerous to  
# examine thoroughly here, yet among the most obvious are the  
**interface between the customer and the display and between** **customer, display, and sales personnel. Human dimension and its**  
# impact on the quality of that interface will be examined in the drawings  
# on the following pages. The relationship, for example, among fields of  
# vision, eye height, and display is extremely important; the most  
# creative display is worthless if it can only be seen by a small percentage  
# of customers. The height of the counter so that it will accommodate  
# the body sizes of the majority of customers is equally important. The  
# location of shelving within reach of those of both small and large size is  
# another consideration. Clearance adequate to allow comfortable  
# circulation is yet another factor. To be responsive to these  
# considerations requires an understanding of the anthropometric  
**requirements involved.** **4.1 RETAIL SPA**  
# CES  
# In an interior environment such as a retail space, where customer  
# convenience and comfort are a matter of corporate policy, the  
# responsiveness of the design to human dimension and body size is  
# extremely critical. The interface between the user and the various types  
# of sales counters and shelf displays, for example, must be of the  
# highest quality. Included among the drawings on the following pages  
# are illustrations of various counter types for use from both seated and  
# standing positions, indicating the anthropometric considerations  
# involved and suggested dimensional clearances for use in making  
# preliminary design assumptions.  
# Proper visibility of displays both from within and from without is also  
# crucial to the successful design of a retail space. In this regard, the eye  
**height of the small and large viewer and the geometric implications of** **human vision must be accommodated. The height of a wrapping**  
# counter, the size of a dressing cubicle, the critical dimensions of a shoe  
# department, and circulation around and between merchandise  
# displays must all accommodate users of varying body size. Illustrations  
# of these aspects of retail spaces are also among the drawings included  
# in this section, together with suggested clearances. The  
# anthropometric measurements of significant importance are indicated  
**in this matrix.** **The drawing above shows the optimum height of viewing planes**  
# located at 12-in, or 30.5-cm, intervals, with the viewer stationed 12 in  
# away from the show window. Two sets of data are presented\: one  
# concerns the viewing planes related to a viewer of small body size, and  
# the other, planes related to a viewer of larger body size. The eye level of  
# the former was based on 5th percentile female data and the latter on  
# 95th percentile male data. As in other situations, the diagram should  
# not be taken too literally, since it does not take into account head  
# movement or the scanning capability of the eye, each of which can  
**significantly increase the area that the eye can see. By using the** **geometric approach implied in the diagram, the size of optimum**  
# viewing planes can be established with the viewer in different locations.

# The following drawing is of a low 30-in, or 76.2-cm, display counter  
# also for use by a seated customer. The anthropometric considerations  
# are the same. Although the counter height is responsive to the  
# anthropometric requirements of the seated customer, it is less than  
# ideal for the standing clerk. For the standing user’s optimum comfort,  
# the counter height should be about 2 or 3 in, or 5 to 7.6 cm, below  
# elbow height. This will allow a person to handle objects comfortably on  
# the counter surface or use the counter as support for his or her arms.  
**The 30-in height is too low to permit such use.** **The drawing above shows the clearances involved for a 42-in, or**  
# 106.7-cm, high counter to service a seated user. By filling the recess  
# with an additional display, however, the counter can also be used  
# exclusively as a typical sales counter. It should be noted, however, that  
# although sometimes used for special display situations, such a counter  
# height is not recommended. Both the customer and the sales clerk of  
# smaller body size would find coping with such a height uncomfortable  
# anthropometrically, particularly when one considers that the counter  
# would be higher than the elbow height of slightly over 5 percent of the  
# population. From a merchandising viewpoint, where customer  
# convenience is of paramount importance, it would be unwise to exceed  
# 39 to 40 in, or 99 to 101.6 cm, as a counter height.

# In addition, the smaller sales clerk forced to tend such a counter for  
# extended periods of time could be subjected to severe backaches and  
# pains. Getting on and off a high stool for elderly and disabled people or  
# those of smaller body size can be not only difficult, but hazardous. The  
**following drawing illustrates the clearances for a typical sales counter.** **Shelving is probably used more than any other single interior**  
# component for the storage and/or display of merchandise. Not only  
# must the merchandise be within reach anthropometrically, but it must  
# be fairly visible as well. The heights established must therefore be  
# responsive to vertical grip reach dimensions as well as to eye height. In  
# establishing height limits, the body size data of the smaller person  
# should be used. Since in retail spaces, departments may cater  
# exclusively to members of one sex or the other, two sets of data are

# wrapping counter. Given the nature of the activity involved, a counter  
# height of 35 to 36 in, or 88.9 to 91.4 cm, would accommodate the  
# majority of people. Horizontal clearances must accommodate the  
# maximum body depth of the larger person within the activity zone, and  
# the maximum body breadth of the larger person in the circulation  
# zone. Depending on the intensity of the operation and the number of  
# clerks, the circulation and the activity zone can be combined and the  
# clearance between the front and rear counter reduced to 30 in, or 76.2  
**cm.** **4.2 FOOD STORES**  
# When considering the implication of human dimensions in relation to  
# the design of self-service food stores, the shopping cart should be  
# viewed as an extension of the human figure and the combined  
# measurements as a unit to be accommodated for purposes of  
# establishing necessary clearances. This is more critical in terms of  
# overall length than width considerations, since the maximum body  
# breadth dimension, particularly of those of larger body size, is also  
# sufficient to accommodate the width of the cart itself. Height of  
# shelving for display of merchandise should be responsive to the reach  
# limitations of the smaller shopper, and the display of merchandise  
# should relate to the eye height of the majority of users. Depending on  
# store size and economics, width of aisles should include an activity  
# zone directly adjacent to the merchandise display unit adequate to  
# accommodate a standing or kneeling user, who is scanning shelves,  
# selecting goods, or loading a cart, as well as a circulation zone that  
**could accommodate two lanes of shoppers with carts. Clearances** **between checkout booths should be adequate to accommodate a**  
# wheelchair-bound shopper. The situations discussed are included  
# among the illustrations found on the following pages together with  
# dimensional suggestions for use in making preliminary design  
# assumptions. The anthropometric measurements of major  
**consideration are indicated in the matrix here.** **The drawing at the top left shows the overall clearance required**  
# by a customer and shopping cart to be about 42 in, or 106.7 cm.  
# The clearance required to accommodate a man and woman abreast is  
# illustrated in the drawing at top right and shown to be 60 in, or 52.4

# AIR STYLING  
# One of the most important considerations in making hair styling  
# spaces responsive to human dimension is that of adjustability. Given  
# the tremendous variability in body size, both in terms of the customer  
# and the stylist and the nature of the activity involved, it is virtually  
# impossible to accommodate the majority of people without some  
# degree of adjustability to compensate for the great variability in body  
# size. The range of adjustment possible in most standard chairs on the  
# market is not great enough. The styling operation, for example,  
# requires the operator to style the hair of the seated customer about the  
# lower head, neck, and shoulder areas. Not only is it essential that the  
# stylist have a clear view of the work area, but in many instances he or  
# she must be able to step back and check for smoothness and level of  
# cut. Even with the chair elevated to its maximum position, the taller  
# stylist must still stoop to perform his work. Until such time that more  
**chairs with a greater range of adjustability become available, the** **interior designer or architect should explore other ways to make the**  
# operation more responsive to the limitations imposed by human  
# dimension and body size.  
# Another area where much improvement is needed is the interface  
# among customer, chair, wash basin, and operator in the typical  
# shampoo station. Since most facilities do not permit comfortable neck  
# flexion, the most critical phase of the interface involves the head and  
# wash basin. Moreover, the hard, although rounded, edge of the basin  
# in direct contact with the back of the neck adds to the discomfort. The  
# quality of the interface could perhaps be improved by building  
# adjustment capability into the chair so that the body may be placed in a  
# more horizontal position. Within the limitations imposed by existing  
# equipment, the drawings on the following pages illustrate some of the  
# typical situations encountered in the design of hair styling spaces. The  
# anthropometric measurements of major concern are indicated in the  
**above matrix.** **A plan view showing two styling stations and required clearances is**  
# shown on the preceding drawing. To accommodate the seated  
# customer and provide for circulation and appropriate movement of the  
# hair stylist, a space of 95 to 105 in, or 241.3 to 266.7 cm, deep and 83  
# to 87 in, or 210.8 to 221 cm, wide is required for each station. To  
# conserve floor space, however, it is suggested that the spaces required  
# for the individual styling stations overlap each other by 24 in, or 61 cm.

**last drawing illustrates the chair in use by a female customer.** **The clearances shown in each drawing are about the same. It should be**  
# noted, however, that since the body size of the larger female is smaller  
# than the body size of the larger male, the clearance from the wall  
# required in the shampoo station exclusively catering to women could  
# be a few inches smaller. Since the difference is minimal, it would be  
# more practical to allow sufficient clearance to accommodate the male  
# customer of larger body size. However, in situations where space may  
# be extremely tight, the small clearance required for the female could be  
# helpful in conserving space. Of greatest importance anthropometrically  
# is that the chair have maximum flexibility in terms of both seat height  
# and backrest angle to ensure a comfortable body fit or interface  
**between the back of the neck and the basin.** **It has been estimated that somewhere in the vicinity of 46 million**  
# people in the U.S. eat out daily, with a median per capita expenditure of  
# more than \$3.50. As leisure time increases and the emerging so-called  
# leisure ethic becomes more firmly entrenched as a way of life, as the  
# number of single men and women continues to increase, as more  
# women return to the labor market, and as family incomes increase, the  
# amount of time and money spent eating outside the home will become  
# even greater.  
# The eating and drinking establishment is a necessity for some, a luxury  
# for others, and to many, perhaps, a brief escape from boredom or  
# loneliness. However, despite its raison d’etre or the contrasts in  
# ambiance that may exist among the neighborhood tavern, the singles  
# bar, and the elegant gourmet restaurant, the anthropometric  
# requirements of the user remain the one constant in the design  
# equation. The quality of the interface between the customer and the  
# various elements of the interior space determine the level of user  
# comfort and, in many cases, the eventual success or failure of the  
# establishment.  
# The diagrams and text on the following pages deal with those human  
# dimensions that relate to the design of bars, food counters, dining  
# areas, and other elements that constitute typical eating and drinking  
# spaces. The anthropometric requirements of those who work in these  
# spaces are also explored. In addition, the problems of the wheelchair-  
# bound patron are examined, particularly in terms of general  
**accessibility and interface with the table.** **5.1 BARS**  
# The drawings on the following pages illustrate in plan and section the  
# considerations that should make the design of bars more sensitive to  
# human body size. Clearances and other dimensional data for use in  
# making preliminary design assumptions are also indicated. The  
# anthropometric measurements of major concern are indicated in the  
# matrix above.  
# In earlier sections of the book, it was stated that anthropometry can  
# serve as an extremely helpful tool in the design process if used within  
# the larger perspective of all the other human factors that impact on  
# that process, such as the many psychological, sociological, and cultural  
# factors that the designer must also take into account. It seems  
# particularly appropriate while dealing with the subject of bar design to  
**reiterate the concept that in fitting the designed environment to the** **body, clearances and space also have more sophisticated and subtle**  
# implications. The clearances allowed for seating at the bar, for  
# example, could in many instances ensure an ideal body fit between  
# patron and bar and at the same time negate the very reason for the  
# particular drinking place or tavern. The greater the seating density and  
# the closer the seats, the greater the degree of social interaction. A  
# singles bar, for example, whose seating arrangement was overly  
# conservative and tended to insulate patrons from each other would  
# obviously not be very successful. However, there are many situations  
# where intense social interaction between patrons is, as a matter of  
# policy or personal preference, not a desirable objective, nor would the  
# patrons frequenting such places necessarily feel at ease under such  
**conditions.** **The distance between bar and back-bar should allow adequate**  
# workspace. A minimum of 36 in, or 90 cm, should provide space for  
# one bartender to serve and another to circulate behind him. Maximum  
# body depth and maximum body breadth are the primary  
# anthropometric considerations in establishing clearance. A one-  
# bartender operation would require a 30-in, or 75-cm, clearance.

# In regard to bar stools, clearance between the stool seats is more  
# critical than center line spacing, and it should allow patrons of larger  
# body size a comfortable side approach and departure from the stool  
# without body contact with the next person. A 12-in, or 30-cm, wide  
# stool on 24-in, or 61-cm, centers, which is quite common, will allow  
# only less than 5 percent of male users access to the stool without  
# disturbing the next patron, while a 30-in, or 75-cm, spacing will  
# accommodate 95 percent of the users. The tradeoff, however, would be  
# the loss of two seats for every 120 in, or 300 cm, of bar length. A  
# spacing of 12-in stools on 28-in, or 70 cm, centers is suggested as a  
# compromise. The ultimate decision is an individual one and must  
**reconcile human factors with economic viability.** **To ensure proper circulation and interface, adequate clearances in**  
# front of the bar are illustrated in the drawing shown above. A customer  
# activity zone of 18 to 24 in, or 45.7 to 61.0 cm, should be provided to

# circulation zone of at least 30 in, or 76.2 cm. If a supplementary  
# drinking surface or shelf is provided, a smaller activity zone of 18 in is

# The following drawing shows suggested clearances for 18 or 24 in  
**cocktail tables.** **Bar seating is a classic example where hidden dimensions, as well as**  
# anthropometric factors, must be considered in determining seat  
# spacing. Cultural differences, for example, may dictate proximity  
# between patrons. In one instance closeness may cause discomfort for  
# patrons, and in another case it may be desirable. The density of people  
# and the spacing of seats also impact on social interaction; the greater  
# the density, the greater the probability of such interaction. The

# and the possible density models. The preceding drawing illustrates a

# OUNTERS  
# The basic approach to ensuring a proper interface between customer  
# and food counter is similar to that used for a bar. Maximum body  
# breadth and depth should be taken into account in establishing  
# clearances for workspace behind the counter. The height of the shelves  
# and depth of the counters should accommodate the human reach  
# limitations of those of smaller body size, for such clearances will also  
# accommodate those of larger body size.  
# With respect to the public side of the counter, the relationship between  
# seat height and top of the counter should also accommodate the  
# human body properly. One common error is in the relationship of seat  
# height to footrest in relation to a high counter. In many instances, the  
# footrest is too low to accommodate the feet. The result is that the  
# customer’s feet simply dangle above the footrest without coming into  
**contact with its surface. This lack of contact does not provide the body** **with the stability it requires, so muscular forces must take over in order**  
# to maintain equilibrium, causing general discomfort, aches, and pains.  
# As if this were not bad enough, the weight of the dangling foot causes  
# pressure on the underside of the thigh just behind the knee, resulting  
# not only in irritation to the skin but obstruction of the circulation of  
# blood.  
# These conditions are included among the drawings on the following  
# pages, and suggested clearances and other dimensional data for use in  
# making preliminary design assumptions are indicated. The basic  
# anthropometric body measurements most frequently considered in  
**the design of food counters are indicated in the matrix on this page.** **The drawing above shows some of the basic clearances required for a**  
# typical counter\: 36 in, or 91.4 cm, for workspace behind the counter;  
# 18- to 24-in, or 45.7 to 61 cm, for the counter top; and 60 to 66 in, or  
# 152.4 to 167.6 cm, between the front face of the counter and the  
# nearest obstruction. The following drawing shows a section through  
# the counter and back counter. Most counters are about 42 in, or 106.7  
**cm, in height.** **The clearance from the top of the seat to the underside of the counter**  
# top and the depth of the counter top overhang are extremely  
# important. Buttock-knee length and thigh clearance are the key  
# anthropometric measurements to consider for proper body fit.  
# Footrest heights should take into consideration popliteal height. In  
# most cases this is ignored, and 42-in counters are provided with 7-in,  
# or 17.8-cm, footrests that are 23 in, or 58.4 cm, below the seat  
# surface, which cannot work. The popliteal height of the larger user,  
# based on 99th percentile data, is only about 20 in, or 50.8 cm.

# Therefore, the feet dangle unsupported several inches above the  
# footrest and the body is deprived of any stability. The footrest shown  
# on the drawing, although higher, only serves a portion of the seated  
# users and is intended primarily for standing patrons. The most logical  
**solution is a separate footrest, integral with the stool.** **The drawing above illustrates in section clearances required between**  
# counters when arranged parallel to each other. This is a rather  
# common situation, with counter layouts in a repetitive U  
# configuration. The overall clearance measured from the front edge of  
# one counter to the other is 60 to 72 in, or 152.4 to 182.9 cm. The  
# clearance between counters allows an activity zone for the seated  
# patron at each counter, in addition to a public circulation zone  
# between stools of 36 in, or 91.4 cm. Maximum body breadth is the  
# anthropometric measurement used in establishing the clearance for  
# circulation. Refer to the drawings on the preceding page for additional  
# information regarding the relationship and body fit of the user to the  
# stool, counter, and footrest, and the anthropometric measurements  
# involved. The drawing on the following page shows in section the  
# clearances required between a counter and a row of tables—another

# Proper clearances for circulation and service aisles, adequate knee and  
# thigh space between the top of the seat and the underside of the table,  
# accessibility for the wheelchair-bound person, and adequate clearance  
# around the perimeter of the table are the basic factors to take into  
# account to ensure the proper relationship between human dimension  
# and dining space. These considerations, all fairly straightforward, can  
# be accommodated fairly simply. The proper allowance per individual  
# seated diner along the table perimeter and, by extension, the table size  
# do require additional thought and in some instances individual  
# research.  
# All too often, however, the standard table size is simply accepted  
**without question as being adequate to accommodate the designated** **number of seated diners. The design problem is then viewed**  
# exclusively in terms of the number of such tables that can be located  
# within the given space. The fact is that most standard tables used in  
# public dining spaces are not adequate to comfortably accommodate  
# the user. In most instances the only factor taken into account in  
# selecting the size of the table is whether its length can accommodate  
# the width of the chair placed in front of it. The space necessary to  
# accommodate the individual diner should take into account several  
# factors\: \(1\) the width of the chair, \(2\) the maximum body breadth of a  
# diner of larger body size, plus an allowance for the extension of the  
# elbows away from the body, and \(3\) the size of the place setting.  
# Among other considerations examined in the drawings on the  
# following pages is the development of an incremental unit to be used  
# in allocating the proper space per diner. Various table sizes are then  
# established, based on optimal and minimal variations of this individual  
**place-setting zone.** **The place setting is made up of a studied arrangement of dinnerware**  
# and related accessories. During the dining process, it is transformed  
# into a state of disarray, covering a larger zone of the table than at the  
# beginning. This expanded zone occupies a minimum area of 14 by 24  
# in, or 35.6 by 61 cm. The first group of drawings figuratively labeled  
# shows these zones in relation to tables of varying depth, but of  
# constant minimal width of 24 in, or 61 cm. The center strips represent  
# the surface available for serving dishes, flowers, etc. If we allow for the  
# intrusion of these elements into contiguous zones, a depth of only 40  
# in, or 101.6 cm, is adequate for their comfortable placement.

# In the group of drawings on the following page, these same zones are  
# applied to a 30-in, or 76.2-cm, width. This is related to the maximum  
# body movement involved in the dining activity. Etiquette aside, a 24-in  
# width will allow the arms of the larger user to project beyond the table  
# into circulation lanes. The authors contend that a 30 by 40 in, or 76.2  
# by 101.6 cm, table is the optimum size to comfortably accommodate  
# two people. The 30-in dimension corresponds to human body  
# breadth. The 40-in dimension allows sufficient room for place setting  
**and accommodates horizontal reach.** **Both drawings deal with the height and clearance of dining tables.**  
# The drawing above relates to the plans on the preceding page and

# The following drawing deals with wheelchair access to a dining table.  
# Clearance from the floor to the underside of the table is critical if the  
# wheelchair-bound diner is to be accommodated. Unfortunately,  
# conflicting requirements, depending on the source consulted, show  
# this dimension to be 29 or 30 in, or 72.5 or 75 cm. The American  
# National Standards Institute \(A  
# NSI\) indicates the required height of  
# the armrest from the floor to be 29 in, or 72.5 cm. Some state  
# legislation requires 30 in, or 75 cm, to the underside of the table.  
# Unfortunately, a 30-in dimension would place the top of the table  
# surface at about 31 in, or 78.7 cm. Such a height would not  
# comfortably accommodate able-bodied diners of smaller size. To raise  
# the seat height would cause the feet of the smaller user to dangle  
# unsupported, and footrests would be somewhat impractical in a public  
**space. Since armrest heights of many wheelchairs do not, in fact,** **exceed 29 in, or 72.5 cm, and since most models have removable or**  
# adjustable arms, the authors recommend a 29-in clearance, instead of  
# 30 in. Such a dimension will accommodate both handicapped and  
# able-bodied users.

# inadequate. The following drawing illustrates a situation where chairs  
**abut a service aisle.** **The drawing is not intended to serve as a standard for aisle clearance,**

# the meal in an attempt to relax, one may move the chair away from the  
# table about 24 in, or 61 cm. During intimate conversation it may be  
# brought even closer to the table. Finally, in rising from the chair at the  
# conclusion of the meal, its final location may be as much as 36 in, or  
# 91.4 cm, away. If all intrusions are considered, the clearance between  
# tables could total as much as 108 in, or 274.3 cm, which may prove  
# uneconomical. Yet, to ignore the intrusions would be unrealistic. The  
# authors suggest that, as a reasonable compromise, a clearance

# Demand for health facilities continues to grow, in terms not only of

# Facilities are constantly being retrofitted and added to; and most  
# recently, the recycling and adaptation of buildings, originally intended

# taken to meet the growing needs for space.  
# As in other building types, the anthropometric considerations in the

# the work environment be of the highest quality.  
# All the following situations involve an understanding of human

# these spaces accessible to those confined in wheelchairs. The drawings  
# and related text on the following pages examine some of these typical  
# situations and provide the dimensional information necessary for  
**preliminary design assumptions.** **6.1 MEDIC**  
# AL TREATMENT ROOMS  
# The drawings on the following pages explore various elements of the  
# medical treatment room, including the examination tables, laboratory  
# tables, wash basins, and film viewing systems, in terms of the  
# clearances and other dimensional requirements necessary to ensure  
# their responsiveness to human body size. The heights of tables and  
# counters and their relationship to the heights of the seats used with  
# them are illustrated, and appropriate clearances and other  
# dimensional data to ensure a proper body fit are indicated. The  
# drawings also illustrate comparative relationships between the body  
# size of the female and male user in terms of the various interior  
# elements involved. The major anthropometric measurements to be  
# considered are indicated in the matrix above. Perhaps the most  
# interesting element, in terms of the anthropometric considerations, is  
# the wall-mounted film viewing system. In all probability the design  
# approach will also prove applicable to various other medical equipment  
**not included in the drawings. Of particular concern in any kind of** **viewing system is the eye height of the seated and standing male and**  
# female viewer of large and small body size. These data are extremely  
# useful, if not absolutely essential, in establishing the proper height  
# above the floor at which the unit must be located. The critical problem  
# is to establish a height that will accommodate the majority of users,  
# taking into account the significant difference in eye height between  
# people of small and large body size. Of the drawings that follow is a  
# series concerned exclusively with this aspect of human dimension.  
# One interesting observation is that the difference in eye height  
# between that of a viewer of very small body size and that of one of very  
# large body size is almost twice as much when both people are standing  
**than when both are in a seated position.** **The principal anthropometric considerations with film viewing systems**  
# involve eye height and human reach capability. The two drawings  
# shown above illustrate reach considerations for the tall and the short  
# user. The drawing at the left shows a small female with 5th percentile  
# reach measurements in contrast with a male of larger body size,  
# reaching over a 24-in, or 61-cm, counter top to make contact with the  
# system surface. The 24-in obstruction reduces the effective reach of  
# the smaller user. The drawing at the right shows that reducing the  
# counter depth below the viewing system to 18 in, or 45.7 cm, enables  
# the smaller user to more comfortably reach the system surface.  
# The following two drawings illustrate the viewing relationship of the  
# small and large male and female standing viewers to the system. It  
# should be noted that the female of smaller body size has the least  
**comfortable viewing position.** **The next two drawings compare the same pairs of viewers in a seated**  
# position with the top of the system located 52.5 in, or 133.4 cm, above  
# the floor. Note how the difference in eye heights between viewers of  
# small and large body size is much less when the viewers are seated  
**than when they are standing.** **The seated arrangement accommodates the majority of viewers with**  
# maximum comfort. For standing viewers a dimension of 72 in, or  
# 182.9 cm, from the top of the system to the floor accommodates most

# drawing at the left shows the relationship of a female of smaller body  
# size to the table and the wall cabinet above. The shelf should be  
# anthropometrically within the reach of the smaller person in a seated  
# position. Eye height sitting is also a useful measurement to consider,  
# in relation not only to the microscope, but to the visibility of any  
# displays that might be tacked on the facing wall surface. Within certain  
# limits, the adjustability of the seat can be used to raise and lower the  
# eye level as required to accommodate the height of the microscope  
# above the table surface. The drawing on the right illustrates the same  
**relationships for a male of smaller body size.** **The drawing shown above illustrates the relationship of a male user to**  
# an instrument and supply cabinet and a wash-up sink. With respect to  
# the former, eye height and reach are the key anthropometric  
# considerations. The material on the shelves should be accessible to the  
# person of smaller body size. Therefore, 5th percentile reach data  
# should be used to establish the height of the shelf above the floor. It is  
# also important that the depth of the wall cabinet and the distance of  
# the bottom of the cabinet from the top of the counter not obstruct the  
# user’s vision of the full counter surface. The overall height of the wall  
# cabinet should allow the user, with a minimum degree of eye and head  
# movement, to visually scan the contents of the cabinet with the least  
# amount of discomfort. For the wash-up sink, the anthropometric  
# measurements of greatest significance are eye height, to establish the  
**location of the mirror, and elbow height, to establish the height of the** **sink. Research has shown that 2 to 3 in, or 5 to 7.6 cm, below the**  
# elbow is a comfortable height for the top of the sink. Generally, sinks  
# are located too low, causing the user discomfort and back pain.

# Clearances and other dimensional data related to the typical dental  
# treatment room are shown in the drawings on the pages that follow.  
# Included among the drawings are illustrations in both plan and section  
# of laboratory and x-ray spaces as well as the chair area. Of greatest  
# interest anthropometricly is the almost complete range of adjustability  
# in the design of the patient’s chair and the dentist’s stool, providing  
# the possibility of creating an almost endless number of interface  
# options. The level of sophistication involved demonstrates clearly that  
# the technological capability necessary to apply the concept of  
# adjustability to other interior systems is available. The basic  
# anthropometric considerations of concern to the designer are not the  
# interface between the seated or standing dentist and the seated or  
# standing patient, but between the dentist and/or the paraprofessional  
# and the various support facilities in the dental treatment room.  
**Counters must be of proper height for comfortable and efficient use. If** **used from a seated position, the distance from the top of the seat to**  
# the underside of the counter must be sufficient to accommodate thigh  
# clearance and knee height. The depth of the counter and the location  
# of shelves either above or below should be related to the limitations of  
# reach of the user of smaller body size. Clearance between the dentist’s  
# chair and the wall or nearest physical obstruction, should be sufficient  
# to accommodate at the very least the maximum body breadth of the  
**person of large body size.** **Rapid technological advances in design and fabrication of dental**  
# equipment systems have resulted in dental treatment rooms of great  
# compactness and efficiency. In many instances, anthropometric  
# considerations must be reinterpreted to permit a closer interface  
# among dentist, dental assistant, and the dental equipment systems.  
# Shown in this section are the basic anthropometric and dimensional  
# considerations that should prove helpful to the designer in making  
**certain initial design and planning assumptions. In both drawings, the** **clearance provided between the dental chair and workcounter, referred**  
# to as the “dentist’s workzone,” is of critical importance in terms of  
# optimizing time/motion efficiency. A dimensional range of 18 to 24 in,  
# or 45.7 to 61.0 cm, is recommended; this overrides ordinary  
# circulation zone requirements. Most dentists have their own  
# preferences for the location and type of instrument delivery systems  
# and other related backup components. In addition, the rapidly evolving  
# dental equipment technology mandates that the designer research the  
# latest systems available.

# The diagrams that follow illustrate some of the more obvious  
# anthropometric concepts to be taken into account in the design of  
# patients’ rooms and nurses’ stations. Of the basic considerations, one  
# that has significant emotional impact on both patient and visitor is  
# seating visitors comfortably around the hospital bed. Unfortunately, in  
# many instances the clear overall depth of the room is not sufficient for  
# such accommodation. The design of nurses’ stations must also  
# respond to human dimension and body size. The height of the station  
# on the public side should relate to elbow height. The worksurface on  
# the nurses’ side should be desk height. The distance from the top of  
# the seat to the underside of the desk should allow sufficient room for  
# thigh clearance. Files should ideally be within reach of the person of  
# smaller body size. The room must also meet the needs of the person  
# confined to a wheelchair. For this, there should be sufficient space to  
# maneuver the chair and adequate clearance under a lavatory to allow  
**the arms of the chair to pass under the rim of the fixture.** **The drawing above shows a plan view of a typical nurses’ station and**  
# the clearances necessary to accommodate the human dimensions  
# involved. A space of 36 in, or 91.4 cm, is a preferred minimum  
# clearance between the desk and back counter. This will allow access to  
# the back counter by a second person while the nurse is engaged at the  
# desk; it also makes the files accessible to the nurse who swivels her  
# chair.

# The following drawing shows a section through the same station.  
# Anthropometrically, several considerations become apparent. The  
# surface of the rear face of the counter should be sloped slightly. The  
# more the sight line approaches a 90° angle with the display, the clearer  
# the visibility will be. The height of the counter should be comfortable  
# for the visitor and yet not obstruct the vision of the nurse. To ensure  
# the former, 2 to 3 in, or 5 to 7.6 cm, below elbow height should provide  
# a comfortable counter height. For the latter, eye height sitting should  
**be taken into account.** **The drawing above shows recommended clearances around an**  
# individual hospital bed. A space of 30 in, or 76.2 cm, will allow for  
# circulation and visitor seating around the bed. This clearance will also  
# be adequate to accommodate a standard medical wall unit on one side

**door widths are more than adequate to accommodate the wheelchair.** **The following drawing illustrates the door clearance necessary to allow**  
# the passage of a standard bed. In broken line, the drawing also

# appropriate for the passage of a bed is more than adequate to  
**accommodate the passage of a wheelchair.** **Rising incomes, shorter work weeks, longer vacations, more holidays,**  
# earlier retirement, increased longevity, smaller families, greater  
# affluence, and a host of other socioeconomic factors have resulted in a  
# change in lifestyle and value systems. For many, the so-called work  
# ethic has given way to the emerging leisure ethic. By the year 2000, for  
# example, it has been estimated that over 2 billion people will be  
# traveling and that tourism may well rank among the world’s largest  
# industries. Some \$160 billion were spent in 1977 on leisure and  
# recreation, and some sources contend that measured by people’s  
# spending, leisure time activities have become the nation’s number one  
# industry.  
# This leisure and recreation boom will increase the demand for the  
# design of private and commercial interior spaces to house the various  
# facilities and/or systems. These may range from traditional sports and  
# games to sophisticated exercise and body building equipment and  
# thermally controlled environments. Some may involve intensely  
# vigorous participation, while others may be relatively passive. Other  
# facilities may include arts and crafts and do-it-yourself activities. Some  
# pursuits of the future may be similar to those with which we are  
# familiar today. Many may not. For certain, all will involve human  
# dimension and interior space and the interface between people and  
# the components of that space. The height of a workbench or drawing  
# table for comfortable and practical use, the nature of the exercise  
# equipment, and the anthropometric requirements for the user’s  
# interface with that equipment are just a few of the factors that must be  
# considered.  
# Human body size and dimension are a particularly significant factor in  
# the more physical and active sports. The avid sports fan need not refer  
# to published anthropometric data to tell you that the size of the  
# professional athlete has undergone a dramatic increase over the last  
# forty years. The 176-lb, or 80-kilo, defensive football player, once  
**considered large, is now thought by many to be too small to play as a** **wide receiver. The tall 73-in, or 185-cm, basketball center of the**  
# 1930s is now too short to play the guard position. The Olympic track  
# records of forty and fifty years ago are now being easily broken by  
# women. The size, physical strength, speed skills, training methods, and  
# diet of today’s athlete have improved to such an extent that  
# dimensional standards and space requirements that once were  
**adequate must be recalculated.** **7.1 EXERCISE AREAS**  
# The drive for health and physical fitness has made exercise activities a  
# popular pastime for many and a major business enterprise for others.  
# Some activities require no equipment, while others involve equipment  
# ranging in levels of sophistication and cost from a simple set of fixed-  
# weight dumbbells to precision-engineered nine-station exercise  
# machines costing thousands of dollars. In all situations, however, the  
# spaces designated to house these activities must respond to human  
# dimension. The drawings on the following pages illustrate some of the  
# more fundamental exercise activities and suggest clearances and other  
# dimensional data for use in making preliminary design assumptions.  
# The major anthropometric measurements to consider are indicated in  
**the matrix on the preceding page.** **Saunas and hydrotherapeutic whirlpool equipment are also frequently**  
# provided within exercise spaces. A few representative models  
# illustrating the relationship of the human body to the equipment are  
# also included in the drawings in this section.  
# Most exercise spaces also include locker facilities of one type or  
# another and their design must respond to human dimension and body  
# size as well. The height of the benches must conform to the general  
# anthropometric requirements for seating. Of principal concern is the  
# popliteal height of the user. Buttock-heel length and/or buttock-toe  
# length data of the user having a larger body size are useful in  
# determining the extent to which the body of the seated user will  
# project into the space between the edge of the bench and the face of  
# the locker. This dimension plus the maximum body breadth of a larger  
# person can then be used in establishing a comfortable overall  
# clearance between bench and locker for circulation as well as  
**accommodation of the person seated on the bench.** **The drawing shown above indicates in side and front view the**  
# clearances required by the human body while engaged in sit-up  
# exercises. Although it is recommended that in establishing clearances,  
# the person of larger body size be used as a model, the ranges shown  
# reflect small and large male and female data. The 5th and 95th  
# percentile vertical grip reach measurements were used as the basis of  
# the dimensions, with an allowance to compensate for the fact that the  
# anthropometric measurement does not quite extend to the tip of the  
# fingers. The authors suggest that even if the design is intended for a  
# particular population of smaller body size, the larger measurements be  
# used. The largest clearance required would be for the large male, and is  
# shown as 91.5 in or 232.4 cm.

# ND GAMES  
# Aside from the basic anthropometric considerations involved to  
# accommodate most sports and game activities, certain of these  
# activities present some unique problems. Can basketball, for example,  
# be truly considered a “sport” if most players must have a 99th  
# percentile stature to participate? A player with a 90th or 95th  
# percentile stature, although possessing skills and agility, would be at  
# an obvious disadvantage for no reason but the body size of his  
# opponent. A tall player may use a stuff shot, since his tremendous  
# height enables him to jump high in the air. With both hand and ball  
# positioned slightly above the rim of the basket, he is then able in one  
# swift downward thrust to literally stuff the ball through the basket. A  
# proposal is presently under consideration to raise the height of the rim  
# to deny the tall player the use of this shot. It is doubtful that Dr. James  
# Naismath, when he conceived the game in 1891, envisioned an 84-in,  
# or 214-cm center, with the ability to forcefully stuff a round ball into a  
# wooden basket. This condition is one of the many explored in the text  
**and the drawings on the following pages. Perhaps the relationships** **between human dimension and the degree to which it impacts on the**  
# intended spirit of competitive sports should be studied across the  
# board in all areas of athletics—surely a novel and interesting  
# investigation for designer and anthropometrist alike.  
# The present lack of enforceable building code regulations to ensure  
# that the design of interior spaces housing active sports corresponds to  
# human dimension and the dynamics of people in motion constitutes a  
# potential threat to the safety of the participant. There are, for example,  
# no code regulations that establish the minimum space needed  
# between the basketball court boundary lines and the nearest

# Safety zones and clearances around the perimeter of a basketball court

# the public safety. In relatively passive sports and games, the problem is  
# not serious. In sports where the action is more intense, such as

# The following drawing suggests minimum clearances to allow the

**and space to decelerate and stop before colliding with the wall.** **The preceding drawing provides some useful information about**  
# human dimension and the sport of basketball. Aside from the  
# dimensional data indicated, the subject serves as an excellent example  
# of how anthropometric considerations relate to almost every facet of  
# our daily life and, in fact, to most human activity. Many of the top  
# professional basketball players have 99th percentile stature and reach  
# dimensions. The extraordinary height and reach of some of these  
**athletes, as well as jumping ability, enable them to do a so-called stuff** **shot. The player leaps high into the air, slightly above the rim of the**  
# basket, and literally stuffs the ball through. Such a player has a distinct  
# advantage, totally unrelated to skill. To compensate for this, a proposal  
# to raise the height of the rim on AAU and N  
# C  
# AA basketball courts is  
# presently under consideration. The drawing shows the present rim  
# height of 120 in, or 304.8 cm, and the proposed rim height of 144 in,  
# or 365.8 cm. It is interesting to note that the top of the head of a player

# The drawings on the following pages illustrate the clearances  
# suggested for use in making preliminary design assumptions about  
# various types of work and craft spaces. The types involved are areas  
# designed for painting, drafting, children’s arts and crafts, and general  
# workbench activities. It should be noted, however, that the drawings  
# are not necessarily intended to show all the work and craft space types  
# possible, nor in the spaces illustrated are all the tools or equipment  
# normally associated with the activities necessarily indicated. To do so  
# would require an entire volume of drawings dealing exclusively with  
# work and craft spaces. The spaces included, however, were selected as  
# representative of certain types of activities in order to illustrate some  
**typical interface situations and the anthropometric considerations** **involved. One interesting anthropometric problem that applies to any**  
# child-oriented work and craft space is the obvious, radical difference in  
# body size between the child and the instructor or teacher. If  
# worksurfaces are designed exclusively to accommodate the body  
# dimensions of the child, the height of the worksurface will be too low to  
# accommodate the adult during any instructional activity or individual  
# demonstration that involves the use of that surface. The approach,  
# therefore, is a design that will reconcile the differences in body size and  
# accommodate the needs of each. The problem is a difficult one and  
# perhaps there is no perfect solution. A higher worksurface height and  
# adjustable seat are one approach. Another may be of a more  
# architectural nature and involves changes in floor levels within the  
**space.** **Most artists have individual preferences regarding the arrangement of**  
# their particular studio or workplace. In regard to human dimension and  
# the artist’s interface with his or her space, the factors to consider also  
# vary greatly. Techniques, media, style, process all impact on the  
# anthropometric requirements. The preceding drawing, therefore,  
# should not be taken too literally. It is not intended to illustrate in detail  
# a specific plan that will necessarily be responsive to the personal needs  
# of all artists. It is intended simply to illustrate some of the components  
# of the space. The anthropometric considerations involved must be  
# examined with respect to the individual artist and the specific activities  
# involved.  
# There are, however, some basic considerations that apply in most  
# situations. Vertical reach from a standing and sitting position is helpful  
**in locating shelving for art supplies. Side and forward arm reach** **measurements can be useful in locating various components of the**  
# space, relative to each other and the artist, in the most efficient  
# manner possible. The eye height of a seated and standing person can  
# be used to determine the location of visual displays and reference  
# materials above the floor. Elbow height can be extremely helpful in  
# establishing the height of a utility table. The text related to  
# workbenches on the following pages of this section is also applicable to  
# the artist’s utility or prep table.

# use or instructional purposes can be arranged on the basis of  
# individual drafting tables, as shown in the preceding drawing, or as  
# cubicles or workstations, as indicated in the following drawing. The  
# preceding drawing shows the clearances involved between tables as  
# well as the clearances necessary for proper interface between the  
# seated and standing person and the table. A table height of 36 in, or  
# 91.4 cm, as opposed to regular desk height, will permit use of the table  
# from both a seated and a standing position. Proper minimum  
# clearance between the top of the seat surface and the underside of the  
# table, as shown, is essential. An adjustable stool can be extremely  
# helpful in compensating for variability in body size. Provisions for a  
# footrest are also a critical consideration. Because of the height of the  
# table, the distance of the seat above the floor will invariably be higher  
# than normal and exceed the popliteal height of most, if not all,  
# intended users. This will cause the feet to dangle above the floor,  
**resulting not only in a lack of proper body stability but pressure on the** **underside of the thigh just behind the knee. This pressure will cause**  
# irritation of the tissue involved and impede blood circulation, resulting  
# in considerable discomfort. The lack of body stability will require  
# compensatory muscular force to maintain equilibrium, resulting in  
# additional discomfort and pain.

# The limitations of human reach must also be taken into account in  
# locating overhead tool storage. The following drawing indicates some  
# of the critical dimensions related to an arts and crafts center for  
# children ranging in age from 6 to 11 years. The critical anthropometric  
# consideration is in making the design responsive to the body size of the  
# child as well as the adult. A teacher forced to bend to the surface of  
# tables scaled down to the body size of a child would suffer fatigue and  
# backache in a short time. Adjustability in both chair and table,  
**however, can reconcile the needs of differing requirements.** **Public spaces, such as corridors, lobbies, and concourses, are subject**  
# to a tremendous intensity of usage involving fluctuating peaks of  
# activity and human occupancy loads. In office buildings, peaks relate to  
# working hours. In transportation facilities patterns of usage are  
# dictated by arrival and departure activities. In theater, convention  
# centers, or sports centers, scheduling of events determines the periods  
# of occupancy. Adequate provisions for human locomotion through  
# these public spaces, as well as provisions for related convenience  
# facilities are important design considerations.  
# The quality of the interface between the human body and the interior  
# space impacts not only on the level of user comfort involved, but on  
# the public safety. To determine door widths, corridor widths, and stair  
# dimensions, body size must be the ultimate yardstick. Caution should  
# be exercised in accepting prevailing standards or rules of thumb to  
# establish critical clearances without questioning their anthropometric  
# validity, even though these standards may be incorporated into  
# existing codes or ordinances. It serves no purpose to conform to the  
# language and not the intent of these codes, which is to ensure the  
# public safety. The unit or increment of measurement that must be  
# applied to establish proper width clearances must reflect current  
# published maximum body breadth dimensions. The data selected  
# must accommodate the majority of users. This is too critical a factor to  
# be based on antiquated rules of thumb. The design of public rest  
# rooms must also reflect this unit of measurement if they are to  
# function properly. It is absurd, for example, to provide the number of  
# fixtures that may be required by codes if the spacing selected will only  
# allow half of them to be used simultaneously. In addition, public  
# spaces should be responsive to the needs of the disabled user. Controls  
# should be within reach of chair-bound people, stair design should  
# accommodate elderly people, and human locomotion for ambulant  
# disabled people should be barrier free. The drawings on the following  
# pages are intended to call attention to some of the anthropometric  
**factors to be considered in the design of public spaces. The first of** **these drawings deals with the basic unit of measurement\: the**

# Horizontal circulation spaces may include typical corridors found in  
# public buildings ranging from 60- to 144-in, or 152.4- to 365.8-cm  
# wide, lobbies, pedestrian promenades, plazas in enclosed shopping  
# malls, and large circulation and concourse areas in transportation  
# terminals. Planning these spaces can be a fairly sophisticated and  
# complicated matter, involving such factors as flow volume \(usually  
# expressed as pedestrians per foot width of walkway per minute\), time  
# and distance headways, walking speeds, queue lengths. The services of  
# a traffic engineer or pedestrian planning specialist are usually required  
# to properly design the larger spaces. Part of the process, no matter how  
# sophisticated, is consideration of the human factor of body size and  
# dimension. In addition some insight into physiological and  
# psychological factors is also required. The intent here is to focus  
# primarily on the anthropometric aspects, with the knowledge that this  
# constitutes but a small part of the entire design process. The drawings  
# on the following pages deal primarily with the human body and its  
**maximum body depth and breadth as the basic increment of** **measurement. This incremental unit is then applied within the context**  
**of queuing situations and corridors.** **In dealing with pedestrian locomotion, the human body must serve as**  
# the basic increment of measure and the larger-size person as the  
# model in establishing clearance dimensions. If such clearances  
# accommodate larger people, they obviously can accommodate those of  
# smaller body size. The preceding diagram shows three views of the  
# human figure, including critical 95th percentile dimensions of the  
# three anthropometric measurements. In establishing breadth and  
# depth dimensions, an allowance of 3 in, or 7.6 cm, for garments,  
# including heavy outer winter clothing, was used. The breadth  
# dimension assumes that the clothing consists of six layers.  
# Accordingly, the aggregate allowance of 3 in is assumed to be equally  
# distributed\: one layer on the inside and outside surface of both arms  
# and one layer on each side of the torso. The overall dimension so  
# calculated is 28.8 in, or 65.5 cm. Heretofore, the generally accepted  
**measurement was 22 in, or 55.9 cm, presumably based on the** **shoulder breadth of an average person. The authors contend that this**  
# is not a valid figure, since the critical anthropometric measurement to  
# be utilized should be body breadth, not shoulder breadth and  
# “average” data do not accommodate the majority of the population.  
# The following diagram and chart should also prove useful in the design  
# of circulation spaces. They have been adapted from a study of  
# pedestrian movement and queuing by Dr. John Fruin to establish  
# relative levels of service based on pedestrian density. The basic unit is  
# the human body, which is envisioned as a so-called body ellipse of 18  
**by 24 in, or 45.6 by 61 cm.** ***\*Chart adapted from John J. Fruin, Pedestrian Planning and Design \(New York\: Metropolitan***  
***Association of Urban Designers and Environmental Planners, 1971\).*** **The drawing above illustrates the two zones involved in walking. The**  
# pacing zone is the distance required to place one foot in front of the  
# other. This distance varies with the individual due to the many  
# psychological, physiological, and cultural factors involved, as well as  
# sex, age, and physical condition. Most adults, however, have a pacing  
# distance of between 24 and 36 in, or 61 and 91.4 cm. The sensory  
# zone is the distance required for perception, evaluation, and reaction in  
# sufficient time to avoid danger, all while the body is in motion. The  
# multitude of human factors involved makes measurement of this  
# distance extremely difficult. One indicator, however, might be the  
# distance one person has to be behind the other to observe him from  
# head to toe.

# suggested for a single lane with no physical obstructions on either side.  
# If carrying items or pushing a small cart is involved, the 36-in

# allow an able-bodied individual to walk along side or pass a wheelchair-  
**bound person. Ideally, rest stops should be provided where corridor** **lengths are particularly long. These may be in the form of properly**  
# designed alcoves along the circulation path; rest room lounges or  
# reception areas may be substituted if reasonably located. Maximum  
# distance between rest room stops should be about 100 ft, or 30.5 m.

**F 60 152.4** **The drawing shown above indicates that a 60-in, or 152.4-cm,**  
# clearance is necessary for a person on crutches to walk along side  
# or pass a person in a wheelchair. A 42-in, or 106.7-cm, clearance is  
# needed to accommodate a person standing sideways, while allowing a  
# wheelchair-bound person to pass. The following drawings indicate the  
# clearances necessary to accommodate a wheelchair in spaces where a  
# series of two doors are involved. One drawing illustrates a situation  
# where the two doors are in a row and the other where the doors are at  
# right angles. A clearance of 84 in, or 213.4 cm, is necessary to allow the  
# wheelchair to clear the first door as it swings shut. Since the length of  
# the wheelchair is 42 in, or 106.7 cm, the 84-in dimension would allow  
# for a door as wide as 36 in, or 91.4 cm, and an additional clearance of 6  
# in, or 15.2 cm, to spare. The 12-in, or 30.5-cm, minimum clearance  
# on either side of the door allows enough maneuvering room for the  
# wheelchair to approach the door at a slight angle and a person to grasp  
# the door knob or pull and then back away. This is helpful when  
**approaching the door from the in-swing side. When the doors are** **located at right angles to each other, it is essential that adequate space**  
# be provided to avoid interference between the two doors.

# No public space can function without adequate vertical circulation  
# systems. If these systems are not designed with human body size in  
# mind, however, the efficiency and use of these systems are diminished.  
# Moreover, the personal safety of the user is endangered. Nowhere is  
# this more critical than in stair design. Both the width of the stair and  
# the tread/riser relationship must reflect the human dimension. For  
# stair width, most prevailing standards and guidelines directly or  
# indirectly employ a unit of measurement of 22 in, or 55.9 cm, which  
# purportedly represents the width of a so-called average person, a basic  
# contention with which the authors disagree and which will be explored  
# in the drawings and text on the following pages. This 22-in increment,  
# however, is used as a basis for establishing lane width and has been in  
# use and unchallenged for at least 25 years.  
# Tread/riser relationships are also based on assorted rules of thumb  
# and formulas, many of which are in conflict with each other. One such  
# formula, over 400 years old, is incorporated into the building code of  
**the city of New York. That these formulas produce some kind of** **generally reasonable design is not disputed. What should be**  
# questioned is the quality of that design. How does a 9.5-in, or 24.1-  
# cm, tread, for example, accommodate a maximum shod foot length of  
# 14 in, or 35.6 cm? How much contact surface does the design provide?  
# How much human energy is consumed in ascending the stair? What  
# percentage of the user population is accommodated? If the stair is to  
# be used to evacuate the building in the event of fire, can we afford to  
# accommodate any less than 100 percent of the users? Does the  
# tread/riser relationship reflect the needs of elderly people? These  
# questions must be answered if designers are to be responsive to the  
# human factors involved. There is also no doubt that proper tread/riser  
# proportion involves other considerations as well, such as human gait,

# The term “public” toilet facility is to a large degree generic since it is  
# quite possible and proper to create subclassifications depending on the  
# user population it is intended to serve. A public facility located in an air,  
# bus, or rail terminal, for example, would serve a transient user as  
# opposed to a similar facility provided for the convenience of the  
# workers in a large midtown office building. These facilities may have  
# much and at the same time very little in common. To varying degrees  
# they both have peak periods of use. The anthropometric  
# considerations, particularly during these peak periods, are also quite  
# similar. Since the intent is to focus on human dimension as it relates  
# to interior space, no attempt has been made to establish a  
# classification system or to comment on the inherent design of the  
# fixtures themselves.  
# What is painfully obvious in the drawings on the following pages is that  
# most public toilet facility designs appear to be totally insensitive to  
**human dimension and body size. Most designs crowd the designated** **number of fixtures required by local agencies in the least amount of**  
# floor space possible. The fact is that the spacing of fixtures, particularly  
# urinals \(19 and 21 in, or 48.3 and 53.6 cm, on center is not  
# uncommon\), does not accommodate the majority of users. Published  
# anthropometric data, for example, indicates that only 5 percent of a  
# sample population measured has a maximum body breadth  
# dimension of 18.8 in, or 47. 8 cm, or less. When a clothing allowance is  
# added, it becomes obvious that a 19- or a 21-in, or a 48.3- or a 53.6-  
# cm, spacing would make it almost impossible for people to use the  
# urinals without coming into body contact with each other. The same  
# type of situation exists with regard to lavatory fixtures. When one  
# considers the hidden dimensions, body buffer zones, privacy factor,  
# such spacing becomes totally unacceptable. For this reason it is not  
# uncommon in public bathrooms to observe situations of extreme  
# crowding and congestion with people queued up waiting to use the  
# facilities while at the same time every other fixture may be unoccupied.  
# The drawings on the following pages examine these conditions and  
# such clearances and other dimensional data more responsive to  
# human body size and dimension, while the matrix above suggests  
# some of the more important anthropometric measurements to  
**consider in the design of public bathrooms.** **Stall urinals are available for battery installations on 21-in, or**  
# 53.3-cm, centers. The authors contend that such spacing will not  
# properly accommodate the majority of users. The larger-sized person  
# has a maximum clothed body breadth dimension of almost 26 in, or  
# 66 cm. Postures assumed while urinating, in addition to the space  
# taken up by partially opened garments, will increase this dimension  
# even more. Given the anthropometric realities and consideration of  
# personal space, a 32-in, or 81.3-cm, spacing is more responsive to  
# human factors. The stall partition should extend 8 to 10 in, or 20.3 to  
# 25.4 cm, beyond the face of the urinal, and an activity zone of 18 in, or  
# 45.7 cm, in front of the fixture should be assumed. A circulation zone  
# of 54 in, or 137.2 cm, will allow for pedestrian and wheelchair traffic.  
# Urinal stalls for wheelchair users should be a minimum of 36 in, or  
# 91.4 cm, wide for proper access. Minimum toilet stall dimensions  
# required for a front transfer approach by the wheelchair user are 42 by

# the width of most lavatory models usually specified for public rest  
# rooms. The body movements involved in the washing and grooming  
# process increase the space occupied by the user even more. Unless  
**adequate space is provided, body contact with the adjacent user will** **occur. A 32-in, or 81.3-cm, spacing as shown should provide for**

# variety of audiovisual systems required to transmit that information.  
# Applications can be found in almost every sector of the business and

# screening rooms in advertising agencies, conference rooms in  
# corporate offices, libraries, auditoriums, and lecture halls in  
# educational institutions are only a few of the many interior spaces for

# Projections for the future include the use of closed circuit television for

# between personnel of branch offices of large business corporations via  
# closed circuit television, already a reality, may become routine. The use  
# of audiovisual communications systems in the educational field is  
# increasing rapidly, and some speculate that students soon will receive  
# a greater portion of their education through film, slides, television, and  
# computers than through live instruction. In terms of residential

# movies all clearly indicate that sophisticated audiovisual  
# communications systems will become as much a part of tomorrow’s

# respect to vision, however, that anthropometrics are particularly  
# significant. Accordingly, the human eye and visual field serve as the  
# basis for the drawings and data on the following pages. The eye height  
# of short people compared with that of tall people in standing and  
# seated positions, the difference in eye heights between males and  
# females, the extent of a person’s visual field, comfortable viewing  
**zones, and the degree to which head movement and eye rotation can** **increase viewing capability are all essential factors in ensuring the**  
**proper interface between viewer and visual communication system.** **9.1 BASICS**  
# The quality of the interface between any visual communication system  
# and the viewer is, to a very large degree, a function of the extent to  
# which the design of that system and the interior space in which it is  
# housed responds to certain fundamental human capabilities and  
# constraints. The more important factors for the architect or interior  
# designer to consider involve the biomechanics of the human body and  
# the geometry of the visual field. A third factor, the eye heights of seated  
# and standing viewers, will also be discussed in the following section. In  
# regard to biomechanics, the area of particular concern centers on the  
# limits of the range of head movement. The degree to which the viewer  
# may rotate the head in the vertical and horizontal planes will quite  
# obviously widen or restrict his or her field of vision. The geometry of the  
# visual field is equally significant since this aspect of the eye establishes  
# the viewer’s cones of vision and related viewing angles. It should be  
# noted that in addition to head movement, the eyes themselves are  
# capable of rotation. The range of eye movement up or down or from  
**side to side adds to the viewer’s ability to scan visual displays. The** **drawings on the following pages deal with the basics\: the range of head**  
# movement in the horizontal and vertical planes and the visual field in  
**the horizontal and vertical planes.** **Joint motions and positions are usually recorded in three basic planes**  
# —sagittal, frontal or coronal, and transverse—or in planes parallel to  
# them. The sagittal plane is a vertical plane taken through the center of  
# the body and perpendicular to body breadth. The frontal or coronal  
# plane is also a vertical plane and is assumed to be taken through the  
# body and perpendicular to the sagittal plane. The transverse plane is a  
# horizontal plane perpendicular to the other two planes. For purposes  
# of biokinematic research, these three planes are viewed as an  
# orthogonal axis system centered on the pelvis.  
# The preceding drawing illustrates the range of head movement in the  
# transverse or horizontal plane. Anthropometrically, the motion is  
# referred to as “neck rotation” and a range of 45° to the left or right can  
# be achieved without strain or discomfort by most people. A simple trial  
# rotation by the reader will demonstrate the tremendous increase in the  
# area that can be scanned from a single fixed location. The following  
# drawing illustrates the range of head movement in the vertical or  
**sagittal plane.** **A range from 0° to 30° in either direction is possible without**  
# discomfort. Anthropometrically, the movement is termed “neck  
# flexion.” If measured downward, it is described as “ventral,” and if  
# measured toward the back or upward, it is described as “dorsal.”  
# International Standard Orthopaedic Measurements \(ISOM\), however,  
# refer to the downward motion as “flexion” and the upward motion as  
# “extension.” Again, a simple experiment by the reader illustrates the  
# tremendous increase in the field that can be scanned as a result of  
# head movement, even if that movement is only a few degrees in  
**magnitude.** **The visual field is that part of space, measured in angular magnitude,**  
# that can be seen when the head and the eye are absolutely still. The  
# visual field of the individual eye is termed “monocular vision.” Within  
# this field sharp images are not transmitted to the brain, causing  
# objects to appear unclear and diffused. When an object, however, is  
# observed by both eyes simultaneously, the visual field of each  
# individual eye overlaps, creating a central field of greater magnitude  
# than that possible by each eye separately. This central field of vision is  
# termed “binocular field” and, as indicated in the preceding drawing, is  
# about 60° in each direction. Within this field very sharp images are  
**transmitted to the brain, depth perception occurs, and color** **discrimination is possible. Within this central field, recognition of**  
# words and symbols also occurs\: 10° to 20° of the line of sight for the  
# former and 5° to 30° of the line of sight for the latter. Beyond these  
# respective limits, both words and symbols tend to disappear. The area  
# of the sharpest focus is actually about 1° either side of the sight line.  
# Depending on the particular color, color begins to disappear between  
# 30° and 60° of the line of sight.  
# As shown in the following drawing, the standard line of sight is  
# assumed to be horizontal and at 0°. A person’s natural or normal line  
# of sight, however, is actually below the horizontal and varies slightly  
# depending upon each individual and whether he is standing or sitting.  
# If standing, the normal line of sight is about 10° below the horizontal  
# and if sitting about 15°. In a very relaxed position, both standing and  
# sitting sight lines may drift to an even greater angle below the  
# horizontal\: about 30° and 38° respectively. The magnitude of the  
# optimum viewing zone for display materials is about 30° below the  
**standard line of sight.** **The preceding drawings serve to individually illustrate the range of**  
# head movement in the horizontal and vertical planes and the field of  
# vision in the horizontal and vertical planes. The following drawing  
# combines both the head and eye movements in the vertical plane  
# involved in sighting at various angles above and below the horizontal  
# plane. Although the diagram itself may be of little, if any, practical use  
# to the interior designer or the architect, it serves to stress the extent to  
# which the area that can be scanned is affected by the range of head and  
**eye movement.** ***Adapted from Human Factors Engineering,***

# The interior designer or architect is frequently faced with the design of  
# interior spaces and/or cabinet work that must incorporate a visual

# activity. The display material may be in the form of a television readout,  
# a film clip, or a transparency or x-ray negative to be viewed on a  
# backlighted surface. To design the installation properly, the designer  
# must be responsive to both the anthropometric and visual  
# considerations involved. Eye height, for example, sitting or standing is  
# clearly an anthropometric consideration, yet when applied to a visual  
# communication system design, it becomes indistinguishable from  
**what might be more appropriately categorized as an exclusively visual** **factor. It is the eye height measurement and the cone of vision**  
# springing from it that will help determine proper display location.  
# Consideration must also be given to the problem of a very tall viewer  
# and a very short viewer. Can the location of the display accommodate  
# both users? If the display is to be located over a workcounter or desk  
# surface, will the design accommodate the viewer with the shorter  
# reach? If the design accommodates the reach requirements, will it also  
# accommodate the human factor of the visual field and will the display  
# be legible to the viewer? The drawings and data that follow deal  
# exclusively with single-viewer, short-range displays and contain  
# information that will be helpful in resolving some of the design  
# problems posed. Note, however, that the information presented is not  
# intended as a design solution, but as guidelines that can serve as a  
# reasonable basis for preliminary design studies. When one considers  
# the great variety and types of visual displays possible and the extent to  
# which the visual field can be increased by a simple movement of the  
# head or eye rotation, the data can be placed in a proper perspective.  
# Moreover, it is customary in the design of workstations of this type to  
# have a full-scale mockup of the unit for testing prior to production of  
**the final unit.** **The need to include a visual display component as part of an individual**  
# workstation is not uncommon. In most cases the display takes the  
# form of some kind of computer readout arrangement. Whatever the  
# nature of the display, the distance between it and the eye and the  
# height and angle of the display is an important consideration. In  
# certain cases displays must be observed from a standing position, in  
# others from a seated position. The workstation must also  
# accommodate people having a wide range of body sizes. The drawings  
# here and on the following pages will explore some of the basic visual  
**and anthropometric factors involved.** **Distance of Display from the Eye**  
# Through the process of accommodation, the mechanism of the  
# human eye will automatically focus the eye on the display at the  
# required distance. Most sources place the minimum distance from  
# viewer to display between 13 and 16 in, or 33 and 40.6 cm; the  
# optimum distance between 18 and 22 in, or 45.7 and 55.9 cm; and  
# the maximum distance between 28 and 29 in, or 71.7 and 73.7 cm.  
# in cm  
# A 28–29 71.1–73.7  
# B 18–22 45.7–55.9  
# C 13–16 33.0–40.6  
# It should be noted, however, that the ranges cited are approximations  
# and vary with the size of the display material and lighting. Moreover,  
# the nearest point to which the eye can focus moves further away from  
# the eye with age. At age 16, for example, it is less than 4 in, or 10.2 cm,  
# away, while at age 40 it is over twice that distance away. By  
# comparison, however, the furthest point to which the eye can focus  
# shows relatively little change over the years. Accordingly, the  
# maximum range of 28 to 29 in, or 71.7 to 73.7 cm, is limited more by  
# the size of the characters and the reach limitations related to the  
# workstation counter or controls. The usual reading distance for printed  
**material is about 18 in, or 45.8 cm.** **Viewing Angle**  
# As a general rule for optimum viewing, a sight line from the bottom of  
# the display to the eye of the viewer should form an angle of not more  
# than 30° with the standard horizontal line of sight. In cases where a  
# seated observer is to function at the workstation for an extended  
# period of time, he would, after a while, assume a more relaxed position,  
# causing his head to rotate downward a few more degrees. The 30°  
**could therefore be increased to 33°.** **Height of Display**  
# Ideally, the height of the top of the display should relate to the eye  
# height of the viewer. The great variability in eye height measurements  
# and in certain cases the size of the specific display may make this  
# difficult. One solution to make the display within reach and within the  
# visual field of the smaller viewer is to increase his eye height by means  
# of a raised platform. Safety precautions, such as a railing, should be  
# provided to prevent accidents. The platform should be movable so that  
# it can be relocated at such times that the workspace is to be used by a  
# taller viewer. Another solution, although more costly, is to develop an  
# adjustable arrangement, whereby the display panel may be raised or  
# lowered to suit individual eye height. Where a seated viewer is involved,  
# the problem is less difficult. The variation in the eye heights of the tall  
# and short seated viewer above the seat surface is much less than that  
# of the eye heights above the floor of tall and short standing viewers.  
# The difference in eye heights of the latter is about 12 in, or 30.5 cm,  
# while the difference between eye heights of the former, as indicated by  
# the drawings, is less than 6 in, or 15.2 cm. Accordingly, the problem of  
# making the display within reach of the visual field of the smaller seated  
# user can be solved quite easily by the use of a chair with an adjustable  
**seat height.** **Display Angle**  
# Where possible, the angle of display should place the viewing surface  
# perpendicular to the normal line of sight.  
# Controls  
# Controls should be placed within reach of the smaller viewer and  
# located so that the body movement necessary for operation of the  
**controls will not obstruct visibility.** ***Adapted from Human Engineering Guide to Equipment Design, p. 393.***  
# The drawing shown above illustrates guidelines for use in establishing  
# preliminary design assumptions for a workstation display console.  
# Since the types of displays and the nature of the tasks associated with  
# those displays can vary considerably, the drawing cannot be taken too  
# literally. The configuration shown, however, is fairly representational.  
# Certain basic factors should be noted anthropometrically. The use of  
# an adjustable chair will permit the eye height of the seated viewer to be  
# raised or lowered to view the display, as may be required depending on  
# body size. An adjustment range between 15 and 18 in, or 38.1 and  
**45.7 cm, should be adequate to accommodate the eye height sitting** **requirements of about 90 percent of all viewers. Adjustability, however,**  
# will be of little value if the vertical distance between the underside of  
# the desk and the floor is insufficient to accommodate the knee height  
# and thigh clearance when the seat is adjusted to the appropriate  
# position. If such distance is not less than 26.5 in, or 67.3 cm, the  
# majority of viewers will be accommodated.

# The location of the top of the display should align with the standard

# can rotate within certain limitations and, in so doing, increase the area  
# that can be scanned, displays can be located above the standard sight  
# line when absolutely necessary. It should also be noted that the more  
# perpendicular the normal sight line is to the display plane, the greater  
# the viewing comfort. Accordingly, consideration should be given to  
# sloping the display plane since the normal sight line is about 15°

# Visual communication systems for group viewing present somewhat  
# different problems than those normally associated with systems  
# designed for the individual viewer. Ideal displays for the latter are  
# located so the viewing angle is generally below the horizontal line of  
# sight. However, due to the size and relationship of a group display,  
# such as a projection screen in a motion picture theater, to the viewer  
# and the obstruction of the visual field of one viewer by another, the  
# display is located so that the upper limit of the optimum viewing angle  
# is situated above the horizontal line of sight. The general layout and  
# configuration of the seating must be planned to ensure the greatest  
**visibility for the greatest number. The minimum distance the front row** **of seats can be from the display to allow adequate viewing must be**  
# considered in the planning of the interior space and general seating  
# layout. Seats must be planned to allow sight lines of one viewer to pass  
# above and between the viewer in front. The distance between rows  
# must allow adequate clearance for circulation and human movement.  
# Provisions for the disabled or wheelchair-bound viewer must also be  
# taken into account. In live situations, a lectern, pulpit, or bimah and  
# the speaker all must be considered as part of the communication  
# system. The design of the lectern should respond to the  
# anthropometric and visual requirements of the speaker. In addition,  
# the lectern-speaker as the display should bear the proper visual  
# relationship to the viewers. The drawings that follow explore various  
# aspects of the group viewing process and suggest clearances and other  
**data for use in preliminary design studies.** **The design of spaces for group viewing activities requires some**  
# knowledge of the anthropometrics of the tall and short standing and  
# seated viewer and the visual implications involved. The drawing above  
# shows that the basic 5th percentile and 95th percentile body  
# measurements of standing viewers are such that the line of sight of the  
# shorter viewer would be obstructed by the taller viewer. When the  
# same 5th and 95th percentile measurements are applied, the drawing  
# of the seated viewers indicates that the line of sight of the smaller  
# viewer just clears the midshoulder height of the larger viewer in front. It  
# should be noted that the difference in eye height between the larger  
# and smaller seated viewers is about half the difference in eye height  
# when the larger and smaller viewers are standing. The minimum  
# distance between the first row and the display can be determined by  
# drawing a sight line from the top of the projected image to the eye of  
# the viewer seated in the first row at an angle not less than 30° nor  
**more than 33°, as indicated in the following drawing.** **in cm**

**K 36.6 93.0** **Maximum visibility for the greatest number of seated viewers can be**  
# achieved by elevating their eye heights successively from front to back  
# row so that one viewer can look over the head of the person in front.  
# The ectocanthus to top of head measurement is the anthropometric  
# data most useful in determining the actual height by which the floor  
# must be stepped or sloped to achieve this condition. It is the distance  
# from the outer cornea of the eye to the level of the top of the head. The  
# 95th percentile data shows this measurement to be about 5 in, or 12.7  
# cm, and is the increment by which the floor is stepped. The preceding  
# drawing illustrates the “one-row vision” method of elevating eye  
# heights so that the viewer may have unobstructed vision over the  
# heads of those viewers in rows immediately ahead. The following  
# drawing illustrates the “two-row vision” method which prevents the  
**heads of all viewers two or more rows ahead from blocking visibility.** **The advantage of this method is that it minimizes the slope or number**  
# of steps. Its disadvantage is that it is not as effective as the one-row  
# scheme. Wider seats and a staggered plan, however, can improve  
# visibility by permitting a view between the heads of those directly in  
# front, as shown in the following drawing. In regard to the depths of

# reasonable incremental unit to use as a basis for seat width is the  
# maximum body breadth. The 95th percentile data for larger users is  
# 22.8 in, or 57.9 cm, taken with the subjects nude. The drawing above  
# shows three possible seat allowances\: 24 to 26 in, or 61 to 66 cm; 28  
# in, or 71.1 cm; and a possible minimum of 22 in, or 55.9 cm.  
# When one considers that an allowance for clothing and ritual-related

# ASA is presently planning a space vehicle that will “carry large  
# numbers of people of all nations and races, and of a wide range of body  
# sizes and ages, into and out of weightlessness.” It is anticipated that  
# such a transportation system will be followed by “space stations where  
# people will function for long periods, in an environment for which their  
# bodies were not designed.” In regard to the design process involved in  
# this massive scientific undertaking, scientist-astronaut Dr. William  
# Thorton writes\:  
# The quality of the interface which connects man with his machines frequently  
# determines the ability and the ultimate performance of the man-machine unit.… The  
# beginning of any man-machine interface is the objective knowledge of the full range of  
**man’s size, shape, composition and mechanical capabilities.1**  
# Apparently, Dr. Thornton has applied a concept that many of us, as  
# earthbound designers of interior space, for too long have failed to  
# recognize. It is ironic that, as designers involved deeply in situations  
# where the quality of people’s interface with the physical environment  
# is paramount, we have, as a profession, failed in our awareness,  
# exploration, understanding, and application of engineering  
# anthropometry—the most basic aspect of that interface.  
# In the research, writing, and general preparation of this book, we found  
# ourselves both stunned and frustrated at the lack of anthropometric  
# data generally available for use by architects and interior design  
# professionals—professionals who are primarily responsible for the  
# total design of the interior spaces in which people live, work, and play.  
# The frustration was compounded when we observed other  
**professionals, to their credit, impressively involved in the development** **and application of anthropometric data to the design of equipment**  
# and man-in-space environments at a time when the term itself was  
# still relatively foreign or unfamiliar to the majority of us in the interior  
# design and architectural professions. With a few exceptions, we have as  
# a group remained far too passive, when, in fact, by the very nature of  
# our professional mission, we should have been at the forefront of the  
# research in this area. As a consequence we have found that too much  
# of what is being designed today is still based on unchallenged and  
# outdated standards, rules of thumb, intuitive judgments, antiquated  
# trade practices, and manufacturer’s recommendations, many of which  
# are insensitive to human factors, in general, and body size and  
# dynamics, in particular. We feel it is incumbent upon the design  
# professions to take immediate action in this area and look forward to  
# the time when architectural anthropometry may possibly develop into  
# a discipline in itself or, at the very least, constitute a basic part of the  
# educational process for interior designers and architects.  
# Undoubtedly, many may question the level of importance we have  
# placed on the study of body size and human dimension as it relates to  
# interior design and architecture and the sense of urgency we have  
# placed on the accumulation of necessary anthropometric data.  
# Although body size would understandably be an important factor in  
# the design for the cockpit of a fighter aircraft or the limited confines of  
# a space vehicle in zero-gravity, some may argue that problems of fit  
# within typical civilian environments are not as critical and that to apply  
# such an approach to the design of civilian interiors would be like going  
# after a mouse with an elephant gun.  
# Although military and aerospace design applications of  
# anthropometric data may well involve more and different body  
# measurements and in some instances the tolerances of fit may be  
# more critical, many of the applications have equivalent civilian  
# counterparts. More importantly, however, we want to emphasize that  
# an improper fit between the individual and his environment, whether  
# that environment is in the military, aerospace, or civilian sector, can  
**impact dramatically not only on his comfort but on his personal safety.** **In some instances the quality of that interface can, in fact, be a matter**  
# of life and death.  
# To reinforce that statement, we must lay out certain facts and  
# misconceptions we have uncovered, as well as insights we have gained,  
# during the research for this book over the past two years. Some of this  
# material may have been implied in previous sections of the book, while  
# some may have been discussed in somewhat greater detail, and certain  
# material may not have been mentioned at all. We hope it will all serve  
# to underscore the present and very real danger faced by the user in his  
# interface with those components of interior space designed without  
# regard to human dimension and, at the very least, the urgent need for  
# additional research and reevaluation of many of the questionable  
# practices and standards in circulation today.  
# The most shocking information uncovered during the course of our  
# research involves children. A recent study indicated that the death rate  
# of children under one year of age from accidental suffocation related to  
# beds and cradles was 18.6 per 100,000 live births in 1965. The  
# implication is that a strong relationship exists between improperly  
# designed furniture and accidental death and injury. Other studies  
# imply that improper spacing of slats in cradles and playpens, which  
# would permit an infant’s head to pass through, is the cause of many of  
# the fatalities—a clear, although painful, example of the importance of  
# human dimension in the design process. Within a larger context, the  
# chilling statistics from the Consumer Product Safety Commission are  
# that upwards of 2 million children are injured each year in accidents  
# attributed to toys, playground equipment, bicycles, and other  
# children’s products. One can only speculate how many of these  
# accidents are caused by the designer’s insensitivity to human  
# dimension and the poor quality of the user-product interface. So  
# critical was the problem and so essential to its solution was  
# anthropometric data that the Consumer Product Safety Commission  
# funded a three-year study, the major purpose of which was to provide  
**basic selected measurement data on infants and children, particularly** **functional measurements, essential for the development of adequate**  
# product safety design standards.  
# Perhaps the greatest misconception we became aware of is the notion  
# of the so-called average man. There has been a tendency on the part of  
# those engaged in shaping our interior spaces to design to  
# accommodate the average user and, by extension, to mistakenly  
# assume that in so doing they are accommodating a majority of those  
# users. The reality is that no such human being exists. So-called  
# average dimensions are simply statistical means indicating that in the  
# sample population whose body measurements were recorded, about  
# 50 percent had a specific body measurement of a particular dimension  
# or less. Obviously, any design based on the accommodation of such  
# data would, in most instances, exclude at least 50 percent of the users  
# —a far cry from the majority the designer had originally intended to  
# accommodate.  
# Moreover, no person is average in all his body dimensions. He simply is  
# not built that way. This has been demonstrated by studies made of the  
# middle range of a sample of 4,000 males, which showed that of ten  
# body dimensions measured, only 25 percent were average in a single  
# dimension and less than 1 percent were average in five dimensions.  
# Despite this, we are constantly exposed to literature suggesting  
# designs to suit the average user. In addition, what little body size data  
# has heretofore been made available to us proudly declares that the  
# dimensions are that of an average person. To further compound the  
# error, the same data, usually in the form of a dimensioned figure, are  
# not limited to a single body measurement, but a host of  
# measurements. The human body, as indicated earlier, is simply not  
**proportioned so that all body measurements are average.** ***Figure E-1. Maximum body breadth.***  
# Another misconception, the perpetuation of which could impact on  
# personal safety, if not comfort, deals with a very basic body dimension,  
# that of maximum body breadth, illustrated in Figure E-1. Maximum  
# body breadth is measured with the nude subject standing erect and  
# with arms hanging relaxed at the sides. The dimension reflects the  
# horizontal maximum breadth across the body including the arms. We  
**decided to consult published anthropometric data to determine what** **the range of dimensions were in regard to this particular body**  
# measurement. Based on a study by Hertzberg, Emanuel, and Alexander  
# in 1956, the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile data were 18.8 in \(47.8  
# cm\), 20.9 in \(53.1 cm\), and 22.8 in \(57.9 cm\), respectively. Adding an  
# allowance for winter outer clothing of 3 in, or 7.6 cm, and rounding off  
# increased the figures to 22 in \(55.9 cm\), 24 in \(61.0 cm\), and 26 in  
# \(66.0 cm\), respectively. The startling revelation in this data can only be  
# fully appreciated when compared with what the actual maximum body  
# breadth allowances are in the various design standards in circulation  
# regarding corridor widths, door widths, spacing of plumbing fixtures,  
# and motor stair widths, to list only a few.  
# For example, many local, state, and national codes, in establishing  
# requirements for corridors, passageways, and walkways, use a 22-in, or  
# 55.9-cm, incremential factor. The underlying implication is that 22 in,  
# or 55.9 cm, represents the dimension required to accommodate an  
# additional pedestrian lane. Two additional lanes would require a total  
# of 44 in, or 111.8 cm. According to anthropometric data, however, only  
# 5 percent of the users would have a clothed maximum body breadth of  
# 22 in, or 55.9 cm, or less. Further research revealed that certain other  
# studies concerned with walking patterns and gait indicated that the  
# human body sways from side to side a distance of about 4 in, or 10.2  
# cm, making 22 in, or 55.9 cm, even more inadequate. A so-called two-  
# lane motor stair has a maximum width at rail height of 48 in, 121.9  
# cm, tapering to a 40-in, or 101.6 cm, clearance at the tread. Allowing  
# for the taper and recognizing that the body position of the passenger is  
# dictated also by the location of his foot in relation to the side of the  
# stair, we again found that only those passengers with the smaller range  
# of body sizes would, in fact, be accommodated.  
# Another rule of thumb presently circulating and actually suggested by  
# manufacturers is the center-to-center spacing of lavatories at 24 in, or  
# 61.0 cm. How many of us, in laying out public restrooms, have  
# unquestioningly applied this standard? During the course of our  
# research, we decided to test the validity of such spacing. An application  
**of anthropometric logic proved the spacing to be inadequate. The** **maximum clothed body breadth measurement of 26 in, or 66.0 cm,**  
# clearly indicates an error. A battery of lavatories spaced according to the  
# standard simply would not permit the user, with a larger body size,  
# access to a fixture without displacing the person next to him. It should  
# be noted, however, that maximum body breadth measurements are  
# taken with the subject’s arms at his sides, while actual use of the  
# lavatory requires the arms to be extended out from the body, thus  
# increasing the space required in front of the fixture and making the  
# 24-in, or 61.0-cm, spacing even more inadequate. Actually, less than  
# 50 percent of the users can be accommodated by such a spacing  
# standard—hardly a reasonable range of accommodation for a public  
# facility subjected to intense peak loads. It would seem that the spacing  
# requirement was based more on accommodating the maximum  
# number and sizes of lavatory types than the number and sizes of the  
# users it was supposed to serve.  
# A similar problem, for similar reasons, applies to recommended  
# spacing for urinals, except that due to the nature of the activity  
# involved and even more restricted spacing, the standards are even  
# more inadequate. Present rules of thumb, as well as actual  
# manufacturer’s recommendations, suggest spacing urinals, placed in a  
# battery arrangement, between 21 and 24 in, or 53.3 and 61.0 cm  
# apart. Given the maximum clothed body breadth dimension of 26 in,  
# or 66.0 cm, cited previously, the absurdity of such a spacing becomes  
# obvious. Curiously, most sanitary codes dictate the minimum number  
# of plumbing fixtures deemed acceptable, but do not specify any  
# requirements for minimum spacing. The designer may comply with  
# the language of the code, but by not questioning the anthropometric  
# implications, not its intent, since less than 50 percent of the users  
# could actually have access to the fixtures under peak load situations  
# without body contact.  
# On balance, it would appear that present standards allow the  
# manufacturer the greatest number and variety of his products to be  
# installed in the smallest space possible and the building owner to  
**reduce construction costs and maximize rental area while still** **complying with code requirements—all at the expense of the user and**  
# the quality of his interface with the interior environment. We conclude  
# that most currently used design guidelines which presumably should  
# reflect people’s maximum body breadth dimensions, simply cannot be  
# reconciled with published anthropometric data and that the designs  
# evolving from those guidelines are simply unacceptable. Anyone who  
# has used the crowded restrooms at an airport, sports stadium, or bus  
# terminal has observed the percentage of fixtures left unoccupied,  
# despite the great number of people waiting in line to use the facilities.  
# How often have you actually seen two people abreast facing the same  
# direction in a so-called two-lane motor stair or walking through a 44-  
# in, or 111.8-cm, opening? Very infrequently. The reason is quite  
# simple\: more often than not they simply cannot fit.  
# It should be noted that our arguments with present clearance  
# allowances is exclusively anthropometric. In order to present the most  
# conservative argument possible, we did not mention the hidden  
# dimensions. Surely the body buffer zone \(and the personal space  
# implied\), particularly with respect to the planning of public toilet  
# facilities, should be considered. The fact that people will walk so close  
# to a wall and no closer should be a factor in determining clearances.  
# Human gait and cultural influences also affect clearance allowances.  
# Personal comfort and the quality of life surely are other ingredients to  
# consider. If all these considerations are taken into account, as they  
# should be, present clearance allowances become even more  
# inadequate.  
# And what of personal safety? In many cases where inadequate  
# standards are used, the larger width of a certain opening, walkway, or  
# stairs, relative to the smaller width of similar openings, walkways, or  
# stairs, may suggest double lane traffic, when, in fact, two lanes cannot  
# be accommodated. The user whose sensory mechanism may not be  
# sophisticated enough to anticipate the inadequacy will attempt entry  
# into the perceived second lane. It is almost inevitable that body contact  
# with the adjacent pedestrian will result, or one of the two will be  
**obliged to side step to allow the other to pass. Either eventuality may** **result in an accident. During crowded conditions or an emergency such**  
# an accident could prove fatal. More serious still would be a situation  
# where a two-lane pedestrian traffic flow was essential to evacuate a  
# specified number of occupants from an interior space of public  
# assembly within a certain period of time. If incorrect maximum body  
# breadth data were used in determining the width of the corridors,  
# passageways, or stairs involved, it could result in a disaster.  
# We also discovered that present standards for tread-riser relationships  
# are to a large degree based on antiquated rules of thumb. Many codes  
# today still utilize an empirical formula that originated almost four  
# centuries ago. Some of the few studies made recently, both in this  
# country and abroad, indicate that many stair designs and standards  
# simply are not responsive to the anthropometric requirements  
# involved. Present minimum tread dimension requirements in  
# circulation do not provide enough contact surface to accommodate the  
# larger range of maximum shod foot length. Our own limited  
# investigation suggests that where conditions permit a 6.8-in, or 17.3-  
# cm, riser and an 11.3-in, or 28.7-cm, tread relationship maximizes  
# both comfort and safety and that a riser height of 7 in, or 17.8 cm, or  
# more should be avoided if at all possible. When one considers that  
# somewhere in the neighborhood of 4,000 stair-related fatalities take  
# place each year, the need for additional research in this area becomes  
# painfully evident.  
# While we are hopeful that this book will, to some degree, be helpful in  
# making the designer aware of the importance of human dimension in  
# the design process and in establishing a link between the discipline of  
# engineering anthropometry and the architectural and interior design  
# professions, it is a very modest beginning. There is much we must do  
# and much we need to know.  
# • We must first fully grasp the fundamentals and significance of  
# engineering anthropometry so that we can engage the  
# anthropometrist in intelligent discussion in order to define our  
**needs.** **• We must press for appropriate anthropometric data concerning the**  
# civilian population generally, since most of the present information  
# involves the military.  
# • We must also develop an inventory of data concerning specific groups  
# within the civilian sector, such as children, elderly people, and  
# physically disabled people.  
# • We must encourage research at the university level and by  
# independent design professionals and firms through professional  
# societies and government and private foundation grants. Studies of  
# the human body in motion should be high on the list of priorities.  
# • We must begin to question existing standards and guidelines.  
# • We must insist that anthropometry be included in professional  
# architectural and interior design curricula.  
# • As the largest specifiers of residential and contract furniture and  
# other components of interior spaces, we must demand from the  
# manufacturers of these products the highest quality of product-user  
# interface. We must encourage the manufacturer to reevaluate  
# product design in terms of responsiveness to human dimension,  
# body size, and corresponding variability. The degree to which  
# elements of interior space can be adjusted should be investigated.  
# • To implement the foregoing, a committee should be created within  
# the professional design organizations. Lines of communication  
# should be established with the anthropometrist, the educational  
# community, the manufacturer, the architect, and the interior  
# designer. A clearing house for data and research of interest to the  
# designer should be created. Lecture series dealing with  
# anthropometry should be initiated.  
# To conclude on an optimistic note, perhaps one of the most  
# encouraging developments with respect to the availability of  
# anthropometric data on civilian populations came about during the  
# writing of this book. It has long been contended that the degree to  
# which military data could be applied to civilian design situations was  
**relatively limited. In a paper delivered at the meeting of the American** **Psychological Association in August 1978, Charles Clauser of the**  
# AeroSpace Medical Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force  
# Base, Ohio, and Dr. John McConville of Anthropology Research  
# Projects, Inc. of Yellow Springs, Ohio, suggested that military data may  
# have a far greater level of applicability to nonmilitary situations than  
# previously thought. They stated that  
# Although relatively fewer and smaller surveys have been conducted on civilian subjects,  
# it can be demonstrated that large segments of the military and civilian populations of the  
# U.S. are comparable in body size and it is our conviction that much of the data from the  
# military surveys are equally applicable or adaptable to non-military uses. This is  
# particularly true of the vast body of anthropometric information which has been  
# assembled, edited and standardized by the anthropology group of the Aerospace Medical  
# Research Laboratory \(AMRL\) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base into a facility known as  
# the AMRL Anthropometric Data Bank, a resource which has grown over the last several  
# years till it now comprises a uniquely comprehensive source of both military and civilian  
**body size data.2**  
# Although Clauser and McConville concede that certain gaps in data  
# may exist for children and those older than 45, they do not view this as  
# a serious obstacle\:  
# There are obviously other segments of the population not represented adequately in the  
# data bank and there are undoubtedly data that are required by designers that have not  
# yet been collected. When significant gaps in samples or anthropometry are identified,  
# they can, in all likelihood, be filled by conducting relatively inexpensive studies of less  
# than 500 carefully chosen subjects \(Churchill and McConville, 1976\).  
# Despite the gaps, we believe that the AMRL Anthropometric Data Bank is a uniquely  
# comprehensive and functional anthropometric data base from which a great variety of  
# needed information can be readily obtained in usable form by commercial designers and  
# engineers.” \(We want to add architects and interior designers to the users of these data.\)  
# The major area of weakness, they advised, “remains at the point of  
# contact between the various users and the anthropologists who are  
**familiar with the existing data.”3** **As a profession we must generate the initiatives necessary to ensure**  
# proper contact. Above all, we must define and communicate our needs  
# if we are to intelligently utilize anthropometric data to establish the  
# proper relationship between human dimension and interior space. And  
# utilize these data we must, if we are to improve the quality, comfort,  
**and safety of our interior environments.** **E**
