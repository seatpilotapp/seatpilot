# You Don't Know JS Yet\: Scope  
# & Closures  
Kyle Simpson  
1 Foreword  
If I look over the books on my bookshelf, I can clearly see which of  
these titles are well loved. Well loved in this sense meaning they are  
a little worn. Their binding is broken, their pages are tattered, there  
might even be a spilled drink smear or two. What’s ironic to me is  
that the most loved of my books often look the least cared for,  
though honestly the opposite is true.  
Scope and Closures \(1st ed.\) is one of my most loved books. It’s  
small, but the binding is coming undone. The pages are worn and  
dog-eared. It’s a bit rumpled. It’s not a book I’ve read once. I’ve  
picked it up again and again in the many years since it was originally  
published.  
For me, it’s also been a benchmark for my own personal progression  
through JavaScript. When I first read it in 2014, I was familiar with  
the concepts but the depth of my understanding was admittedly not  
as deep as the thin volume.  
Over the years, even though I wasn’t necessarily feeling my own  
improvement on a day-to-day basis, each one of the concepts  
became more approachable. I’d smile to myself, realizing how far I’d  
come with the help of these guides. It became apparent there was  
an inverse correlation between how well I treated the book and how  
much I loved it.  
When Kyle asked me to write the Foreword for the 2nd edition, I was  
floored. It’s not often you’re asked to write about a book that’s been  
so formative for your own understanding and career, Scope and  
2 Closures in particular. I remember the day I first understood  
closures, the first time I used one well. The satisfaction was great, in  
part because the symmetry of the idea was compelling to me. Before  
I even picked this book up, I was already enamoured with closures.  
And yet, there’s a difference between being able to execute code  
successfully and fully explore the concepts with any depth. This book  
took my base understanding and drew it out, helped me master it.  
This book is deceptively short. It’s helpful that it’s small because it’s  
dense with useful knowledge. Since it is compact, I’d suggest you  
give yourself time to absorb each page. Take your time with it. Treat  
the book with care, and by that I mean, wear it down.

3 Preface  
Welcome to the 2nd edition of the widely acclaimed You Don’t Know  
JS \(YDKJS\) book series\: You Don’t Know JS Yet \(YDKJSY\).  
If you’ve read any of the 1st edition books, you can expect a  
refreshed approach in these new ones, with plenty of updated  
coverage of what’s changed in JS over the last five years. But what I  
hope and believe you’ll still get is the same commitment to  
respecting JS and digging into what really makes it tick.  
If this is your first time reading these books, I’m glad you’re here.  
Prepare for a deep and extensive journey into all the corners of  
JavaScript.  
If you are new to programming or JS, be aware that these books are  
not intended as a gentle “intro to JavaScript.” This material is, at  
times, complex and challenging, and goes much deeper than is  
typical for a first-time learner. You’re welcome here no matter what  
your background is, but these books are written assuming you’re  
already comfortable with JS and have at least 6–9 months  
experience with it.  
# The Parts  
These books approach JavaScript intentionally opposite of how The  
Good Parts treats the language. No, that doesn’t mean we’re looking  
at the bad parts, but rather, exploring all the parts.  
4 You may have been told, or felt yourself, that JS is a deeply flawed  
language that was poorly designed and inconsistently implemented.  
Many have asserted that it’s the worst most popular language in the  
world; that nobody writes JS because they want to, only because  
they have to given its place at the center of the web. That’s a  
ridiculous, unhealthy, and wholly condescending claim.  
Millions of developers write JavaScript every day, and many of them  
appreciate and respect the language.  
Like any great language, it has its brilliant parts as well as its scars.  
Even the creator of JavaScript himself, Brendan Eich, laments some  
of those parts as mistakes. But he’s wrong\: they weren’t mistakes at  
all. JS is what it is today—the world’s most ubiquitous and thus most  
influential programming language—precisely because of all those  
parts.  
Don’t buy the lie that you should only learn and use a small  
collection of good parts while avoiding all the bad stuff. Don’t buy the  
“X is the new Y” snake oil, that some new feature of the language  
instantly relegates all usage of a previous feature as obsolete and  
ignorant. Don’t listen when someone says your code isn’t “modern”  
because it isn’t yet using a stage-0 feature that was only proposed a  
few weeks ago!  
Every part of JS is useful. Some parts are more useful than others.  
Some parts require you to be more careful and intentional.  
I find it absurd to try to be a truly effective JavaScript developer while  
only using a small sliver of what the language has to offer. Can you  
imagine a construction worker with a toolbox full of tools, who only  
5 uses their hammer and scoffs at the screwdriver or tape measure as  
inferior? That’s just silly.  
My unreserved claim is that you should go about learning all parts of  
JavaScript, and where appropriate, use them! And if I may be so  
bold as to suggest\: it’s time to discard any JS books that tell you  
otherwise.  
# The Title?  
So what’s the title of the series all about?  
I’m not trying to insult you with criticism about your current lack of  
knowledge or understanding of JavaScript. I’m not suggesting you  
can’t or won’t be able to learn JavaScript. I’m not boasting about  
secret advanced insider wisdom that I and only a select few  
possess.  
Seriously, all those were real reactions to the original series title  
before folks even read the books. And they’re baseless.  
The primary point of the title “You Don’t Know JS Yet” is to point out  
that most JS developers don’t take the time to really understand how  
the code that they write works. They know that it works—that it  
produces a desired outcome. But they either don’t understand  
exactly how, or worse, they have an inaccurate mental model for the  
how that falters on closer scrutiny.  
I’m presenting a gentle but earnest challenge to you the reader, to  
set aside the assumptions you have about JS, and approach it with  
fresh eyes and an invigorated curiosity that leads you to ask why for  
every line of code you write. Why does it do what it does? Why is  
6 one way better or more appropriate than the other half-dozen ways  
you could have accomplished it? Why do all the “popular kids” say to  
do X with your code, but it turns out that Y might be a better choice?  
I added “Yet” to the title, not only because it’s the second edition, but  
because ultimately I want these books to challenge you in a hopeful  
rather than discouraging way.  
But let me be clear\: I don’t think it’s possible to ever fully know JS.  
That’s not an achievement to be obtained, but a goal to strive after.  
You don’t finish knowing everything about JS, you just keep learning  
more and more as you spend more time with the language. And the  
deeper you go, the more you revisit what you knew before, and you  
re-learn it from that more experienced perspective.  
I encourage you to adopt a mindset around JavaScript, and indeed  
all of software development, that you will never fully have mastered  
it, but that you can and should keep working to get closer to that end,  
a journey that will stretch for the entirety of your software  
development career, and beyond.  
You can always know JS better than you currently do. That’s what I  
hope these YDKJSY books represent.  
# The Mission  
The case doesn’t really need to be made for why developers should  
take JS seriously—I think it’s already more than proven worthy of  
first-class status among the world’s programming languages.  
But a different, more important case still needs to be made, and  
these books rise to that challenge.  
7 I’ve taught more than 5,000 developers from teams and companies  
all over the world, in more than 25 countries on six continents. And  
what I’ve seen is that far too often, what counts is generally just the  
result of the program, not how the program is written or how/why it  
works.  
My experience not only as a developer but in teaching many other  
developers tells me\: you will always be more effective in your  
development work if you more completely understand how your code  
works than you are solely just getting it to produce a desired  
outcome.  
In other words, good enough to work is not, and should not be, good  
enough.  
All developers regularly struggle with some piece of code not  
working correctly, and they can’t figure out why. But far too often, JS  
developers will blame this on the language rather than admitting it’s  
their own understanding that is falling short. These books serve as  
both the question and answer\: why did it do this, and here’s how to  
get it to do that instead.  
My mission with YDKJSY is to empower every single JS developer to  
fully own the code they write, to understand it and to write with  
intention and clarity.  
# The Path  
Some of you have started reading this book with the goal of  
completing all six books, back to back.  
I would like to caution you to consider changing that plan.  
8 It is not my intention that YDKJSY be read straight through. The  
material in these books is dense, because JavaScript is powerful,  
sophisticated, and in parts rather complex. Nobody can really hope  
to download all this information to their brains in a single pass and  
retain any significant amount of it. That’s unreasonable, and it’s  
foolish to try.  
My suggestion is you take your time going through YDKJSY. Take  
one chapter, read it completely through start to finish, and then go  
back and re-read it section by section. Stop in between each section,  
and practice the code or ideas from that section. For larger concepts,  
it probably is a good idea to expect to spend several days digesting,  
re-reading, practicing, then digesting some more.  
You could spend a week or two on each chapter, and a month or two  
on each book, and a year or more on the whole series, and you  
would still not be squeezing every ounce of YDKJSY out.  
Don’t binge these books; be patient and spread out your reading.  
Interleave reading with lots of practice on real code in your job or on  
projects you participate in. Wrestle with the opinions I’ve presented  
along the way, debate with others, and most of all, disagree with me!  
Run a study group or book club. Teach mini-workshops at your  
office. Write blog posts on what you’ve learned. Speak about these  
topics at local JS meetups.  
It’s never my goal to convince you to agree with my opinion, but to  
encourage you to own and be able to defend your opinions. You  
can’t get there with an expedient read-through of these books. That’s  
something that takes a long while to emerge, little by little, as you  
study and ponder and re-visit.  
9 These books are meant to be a field-guide on your wanderings  
through JavaScript, from wherever you currently are with the  
language, to a place of deeper understanding. And the deeper you  
understand JS, the more questions you will ask and the more you  
will have to explore! That’s what I find so exciting!  
I’m so glad you’re embarking on this journey, and I am so honored  
you would consider and consult these books along the way. It’s time  
to start getting to know JS.  
10 Chapter 1\: What’s the Scope?  
By the time you’ve written your first few programs, you’re likely getting  
somewhat comfortable with creating variables and storing values in them.  
Working with variables is one of the most foundational things we do in  
programming!  
But you may not have considered very closely the underlying mechanisms  
used by the engine to organize and manage these variables. I don’t mean  
how the memory is allocated on the computer, but rather\: how does JS  
know which variables are accessible by any given statement, and how  
does it handle two variables of the same name?  
The answers to questions like these take the form of well-defined rules  
called scope. This book will dig through all aspects of scope—how it  
works, what it’s useful for, gotchas to avoid—and then point toward  
common scope patterns that guide the structure of programs.  
Our first step is to uncover how the JS engine processes our program  
before it runs.  
# About This Book  
Welcome to book 2 in the You Don’t Know JS Yet series! If you already  
finished Get Started \(the first book\), you’re in the right spot! If not, before  
you proceed I encourage you to start there for the best foundation.  
Our focus will be the first of three pillars in the JS language\: the scope  
system and its function closures, as well as the power of the module  
design pattern.  
11 JS is typically classified as an interpreted scripting language, so it’s  
assumed by most that JS programs are processed in a single, top-down  
pass. But JS is in fact parsed/compiled in a separate phase before  
execution begins. The code author’s decisions on where to place  
variables, functions, and blocks with respect to each other are analyzed  
according to the rules of scope, during the initial parsing/compilation  
phase. The resulting scope structure is generally unaffected by runtime  
conditions.  
JS functions are themselves first-class values; they can be assigned and  
passed around just like numbers or strings. But since these functions hold  
and access variables, they maintain their original scope no matter where  
in the program the functions are eventually executed. This is called  
closure.  
Modules are a code organization pattern characterized by public methods  
that have privileged access \(via closure\) to hidden variables and functions  
in the internal scope of the module.  
# Compiled vs. Interpreted  
You may have heard of code compilation before, but perhaps it seems like  
a mysterious black box where source code slides in one end and  
executable programs pop out the other.  
It’s not mysterious or magical, though. Code compilation is a set of steps  
that process the text of your code and turn it into a list of instructions the  
computer can understand. Typically, the whole source code is transformed  
at once, and those resulting instructions are saved as output \(usually in a  
file\) that can later be executed.  
You also may have heard that code can be interpreted, so how is that  
different from being compiled?  
12 Interpretation performs a similar task to compilation, in that it transforms  
your program into machine-understandable instructions. But the  
processing model is different. Unlike a program being compiled all at  
once, with interpretation the source code is transformed line by line; each  
line or statement is executed before immediately proceeding to  
processing the next line of the source code.  
Fig. 1\: Compiled vs. Interpreted Code  
Figure 1 illustrates compilation vs. interpretation of programs.  
Are these two processing models mutually exclusive? Generally, yes.  
However, the issue is more nuanced, because interpretation can actually  
take other forms than just operating line by line on source code text.  
Modern JS engines actually employ numerous variations of both  
compilation and interpretation in the handling of JS programs.  
13 Recall that we surveyed this topic in Chapter 1 of the Get Started book.  
Our conclusion there is that JS is most accurately portrayed as a  
compiled language. For the benefit of readers here, the following  
sections will revisit and expand on that assertion.  
# Compiling Code  
But first, why does it even matter whether JS is compiled or not?  
Scope is primarily determined during compilation, so understanding how  
compilation and execution relate is key in mastering scope.  
In classic compiler theory, a program is processed by a compiler in three  
basic stages\:  
1\. Tokenizing/Lexing\: breaking up a string of characters into  
meaningful \(to the language\) chunks, called tokens. For instance,  
consider the program\: var a = 2;. This program would likely be  
broken up into the following tokens\: var, a,  
=  
, 2, and ;. Whitespace  
may or may not be persisted as a token, depending on whether it’s  
meaningful or not.  
\(The difference between tokenizing and lexing is subtle and  
academic, but it centers on whether or not these tokens are identified  
in a stateless or stateful way. Put simply, if the tokenizer were to  
invoke stateful parsing rules to figure out whether a should be  
considered a distinct token or just part of another token, that would be  
lexing.\)  
2\. Parsing\: taking a stream \(array\) of tokens and turning it into a tree of  
nested elements, which collectively represent the grammatical  
structure of the program. This is called an Abstract Syntax Tree  
\(AST\).  
14 For example, the tree for var a = 2; might start with a top-level  
node called VariableDeclaration, with a child node called  
Identifier \(whose value is a\), and another child called  
AssignmentExpression which itself has a child called  
NumericLiteral \(whose value is 2\).  
3\. Code Generation\: taking an AST and turning it into executable code.  
This part varies greatly depending on the language, the platform it’s  
targeting, and other factors.  
The JS engine takes the just described AST for var a = 2; and  
turns it into a set of machine instructions to actually create a variable  
called a \(including reserving memory, etc.\), and then store a value  
into a.  
NOTE\:  
The implementation details of a JS engine \(utilizing system memory  
resources, etc.\) is much deeper than we will dig here. We’ll keep our  
focus on the observable behavior of our programs and let the JS engine  
manage those deeper system-level abstractions.  
The JS engine is vastly more complex than just these three stages. In the  
process of parsing and code generation, there are steps to optimize the  
performance of the execution \(i.e., collapsing redundant elements\). In  
fact, code can even be re-compiled and re-optimized during the  
progression of execution.  
So, I’m painting only with broad strokes here. But you’ll see shortly why  
these details we do cover, even at a high level, are relevant.  
JS engines don’t have the luxury of an abundance of time to perform their  
work and optimizations, because JS compilation doesn’t happen in a build  
step ahead of time, as with other languages. It usually must happen in  
mere microseconds \(or less!\) right before the code is executed. To ensure  
15 the fastest performance under these constraints, JS engines use all kinds  
of tricks \(like JITs, which lazy compile and even hot re-compile\); these are  
well beyond the “scope” of our discussion here.  
Required\: Two Phases  
To state it as simply as possible, the most important observation we can  
make about processing of JS programs is that it occurs in \(at least\) two  
phases\: parsing/compilation first, then execution.  
The separation of a parsing/compilation phase from the subsequent  
execution phase is observable fact, not theory or opinion. While the JS  
specification does not require “compilation” explicitly, it requires behavior  
that is essentially only practical with a compile-then-execute approach.  
There are three program characteristics you can observe to prove this to  
yourself\: syntax errors, early errors, and hoisting.  
Syntax Errors from the Start  
Consider this program\:  
var greeting =  
"Hello";  
console.log\(greeting\);  
greeting =  
.  
"Hi";  
// SyntaxError\: unexpected token .  
This program produces no output \("Hello" is not printed\), but instead  
throws a SyntaxError about the unexpected . token right before the "Hi"  
string. Since the syntax error happens after the well-formed  
console.log\(..\) statement, if JS was executing top-down line by line,  
16 one would expect the "Hello" message being printed before the syntax  
error being thrown. That doesn’t happen.  
In fact, the only way the JS engine could know about the syntax error on  
the third line, before executing the first and second lines, is by the JS  
engine first parsing the entire program before any of it is executed.  
Early Errors  
Next, consider\:  
console.log\("Howdy"\);  
saySomething\("Hello"  
,  
"Hi"\);  
// Uncaught SyntaxError\: Duplicate parameter name not  
// allowed in this context  
function saySomething\(greeting,greeting\) \{  
"use strict";  
console.log\(greeting\);  
\}  
The "Howdy" message is not printed, despite being a well-formed  
statement.  
Instead, just like the snippet in the previous section, the SyntaxError  
here is thrown before the program is executed. In this case, it’s because  
strict-mode \(opted in for only the saySomething\(..\) function here\)  
forbids, among many other things, functions to have duplicate parameter  
names; this has always been allowed in non-strict-mode.  
The error thrown is not a syntax error in the sense of being a malformed  
string of tokens \(like ."Hi" prior\), but in strict-mode is nonetheless  
17 required by the specification to be thrown as an “early error” before any  
execution begins.  
But how does the JS engine know that the greeting parameter has been  
duplicated? How does it know that the saySomething\(..\) function is  
even in strict-mode while processing the parameter list \(the "use strict"  
pragma appears only later, in the function body\)?  
Again, the only reasonable explanation is that the code must first be fully  
parsed before any execution occurs.  
Hoisting  
Finally, consider\:  
function saySomething\(\) \{  
var greeting =  
"Hello";  
\{  
greeting =  
"Howdy"; // error comes from here  
let greeting =  
"Hi";  
console.log\(greeting\);  
\}  
\}  
saySomething\(\);  
// ReferenceError\: Cannot access 'greeting' before  
// initialization  
The noted ReferenceError occurs from the line with the statement  
greeting = "Howdy". What’s happening is that the greeting variable for  
that statement belongs to the declaration on the next line, let greeting  
= "Hi", rather than to the previous var greeting = "Hello" statement.  
18 The only way the JS engine could know, at the line where the error is  
thrown, that the next statement would declare a block-scoped variable of  
the same name \(greeting\) is if the JS engine had already processed this  
code in an earlier pass, and already set up all the scopes and their  
variable associations. This processing of scopes and declarations can  
only accurately be accomplished by parsing the program before  
execution.  
The ReferenceError here technically comes from greeting = "Howdy"  
accessing the greeting variable too early, a conflict referred to as the  
Temporal Dead Zone \(TDZ\). Chapter 5 will cover this in more detail.  
WARNING\:  
It’s often asserted that let and const declarations are not hoisted, as an  
explanation of the TDZ behavior just illustrated. But this is not accurate.  
We’ll come back and explain both the hoisting and TDZ of let/const in  
Chapter 5.  
Hopefully you’re now convinced that JS programs are parsed before any  
execution begins. But does it prove they are compiled?  
This is an interesting question to ponder. Could JS parse a program, but  
then execute that program by interpreting operations represented in the  
AST without first compiling the program? Yes, that is possible. But it’s  
extremely unlikely, mostly because it would be extremely inefficient  
performance wise.  
It’s hard to imagine a production-quality JS engine going to all the trouble  
of parsing a program into an AST, but not then converting \(aka,  
“compiling”\) that AST into the most efficient \(binary\) representation for the  
engine to then execute.  
Many have endeavored to split hairs with this terminology, as there’s  
plenty of nuance and “well, actually…” interjections floating around. But in  
19 spirit and in practice, what the engine is doing in processing JS programs  
is much more alike compilation than not.  
Classifying JS as a compiled language is not concerned with the  
distribution model for its binary \(or byte-code\) executable representations,  
but rather in keeping a clear distinction in our minds about the phase  
where JS code is processed and analyzed; this phase observably and  
indisputedly happens before the code starts to be executed.  
We need proper mental models of how the JS engine treats our code if we  
want to understand JS and scope effectively.  
# Compiler Speak  
With awareness of the two-phase processing of a JS program \(compile,  
then execute\), let’s turn our attention to how the JS engine identifies  
variables and determines the scopes of a program as it is compiled.  
First, let’s examine a simple JS program to use for analysis over the next  
several chapters\:  
var students = \[  
\{ id\: 14, name\: "Kyle" \},  
\{ id\: 73, name\: "Suzy" \},  
\{ id\: 112, name\: "Frank" \},  
\{ id\: 6, name\: "Sarah" \}  
\];  
function getStudentName\(studentID\) \{  
for \(let student of students\) \{  
if \(student.id == studentID\) \{  
return student.name;  
\}  
\}  
\}  
20 var nextStudent = getStudentName\(73\);  
console.log\(nextStudent\);  
// Suzy  
Other than declarations, all occurrences of variables/identifiers in a  
program serve in one of two “roles”\: either they’re the target of an  
assignment or they’re the source of a value.  
\(When I first learned compiler theory while earning my computer science  
degree, we were taught the terms “LHS” \(aka, target\) and “RHS” \(aka,  
source\) for these roles, respectively. As you might guess from the “L” and  
the “R”, the acronyms mean “Left-Hand Side” and “Right-Hand Side”, as  
in left and right sides of an = assignment operator. However, assignment  
targets and sources don’t always literally appear on the left or right of an  
=, so it’s probably clearer to think in terms of target / source rather than  
left / right.\)  
How do you know if a variable is a target? Check if there is a value that is  
being assigned to it; if so, it’s a target. If not, then the variable is a source.  
For the JS engine to properly handle a program’s variables, it must first  
label each occurrence of a variable as target or source. We’ll dig in now to  
how each role is determined.  
Targets  
What makes a variable a target? Consider\:  
students = \[ // ..  
This statement is clearly an assignment operation; remember, the var  
students part is handled entirely as a declaration at compile time, and is  
21 thus irrelevant during execution; we left it out for clarity and focus. Same  
with the nextStudent = getStudentName\(73\) statement.  
But there are three other target assignment operations in the code that  
are perhaps less obvious. One of them\:  
for \(let student of students\) \{  
That statement assigns a value to student for each iteration of the loop.  
Another target reference\:  
getStudentName\(73\)  
But how is that an assignment to a target? Look closely\: the argument 73  
is assigned to the parameter studentID.  
And there’s one last \(subtle\) target reference in our program. Can you  
spot it?  
..  
..  
..  
Did you identify this one?  
function getStudentName\(studentID\) \{  
A function declaration is a special case of a target reference. You can  
think of it sort of like var getStudentName = function\(studentID\), but  
that’s not exactly accurate. An identifier getStudentName is declared \(at  
compile time\), but the = function\(studentID\) part is also handled at  
compilation; the association between getStudentName and the function is  
22 automatically set up at the beginning of the scope rather than waiting for  
an = assignment statement to be executed.  
NOTE\:  
This automatic association of function and variable is referred to as  
“function hoisting”, and is covered in detail in Chapter 5.  
Sources  
So we’ve identified all five target references in the program. The other  
variable references must then be source references \(because that’s the  
only other option!\).  
In for \(let student of students\), we said that student is a target,  
but students is a source reference. In the statement if \(student.id ==  
studentID\), both student and studentID are source references.  
student is also a source reference in return student.name.  
In getStudentName\(73\), getStudentName is a source reference \(which  
we hope resolves to a function reference value\). In  
console.log\(nextStudent\), console is a source reference, as is  
nextStudent.  
NOTE\:  
In case you were wondering, id, name, and log are all properties, not  
variable references.  
What’s the practical importance of understanding targets vs. sources? In  
Chapter 2, we’ll revisit this topic and cover how a variable’s role impacts  
its lookup \(specifically, if the lookup fails\).  
# Cheating\: Runtime Scope Modifications  
23 It should be clear by now that scope is determined as the program is  
compiled, and should not generally be affected by runtime conditions.  
However, in non-strict-mode, there are technically still two ways to cheat  
this rule, modifying a program’s scopes during runtime.  
Neither of these techniques should be used—they’re both dangerous and  
confusing, and you should be using strict-mode \(where they’re disallowed\)  
anyway. But it’s important to be aware of them in case you run across  
them in some programs.  
The eval\(..\) function receives a string of code to compile and execute  
on the fly during the program runtime. If that string of code has a var or  
function declaration in it, those declarations will modify the current  
scope that the eval\(..\) is currently executing in\:  
function badIdea\(\) \{  
eval\("var oops =  
console.log\(oops\);  
'Ugh!';"\);  
\}  
badIdea\(\); // Ugh!  
If the eval\(..\) had not been present, the oops variable in  
console.log\(oops\) would not exist, and would throw a ReferenceError.  
But eval\(..\) modifies the scope of the badIdea\(\) function at runtime.  
This is bad for many reasons, including the performance hit of modifying  
the already compiled and optimized scope, every time badIdea\(\) runs.  
The second cheat is the with keyword, which essentially dynamically  
turns an object into a local scope—its properties are treated as identifiers  
in that new scope’s block\:  
var badIdea = \{ oops\: "Ugh!" \};  
with \(badIdea\) \{  
24 console.log\(oops\); // Ugh!  
\}  
The global scope was not modified here, but badIdea was turned into a  
scope at runtime rather than compile time, and its property oops becomes  
a variable in that scope. Again, this is a terrible idea, for performance and  
readability reasons.  
At all costs, avoid eval\(..\) \(at least, eval\(..\) creating declarations\) and  
with. Again, neither of these cheats is available in strict-mode, so if you  
just use strict-mode \(you should!\) then the temptation goes away!  
# Lexical Scope  
We’ve demonstrated that JS’s scope is determined at compile time; the  
term for this kind of scope is “lexical scope”. “Lexical” is associated with  
the “lexing” stage of compilation, as discussed earlier in this chapter.  
To narrow this chapter down to a useful conclusion, the key idea of “lexical  
scope” is that it’s controlled entirely by the placement of functions, blocks,  
and variable declarations, in relation to one another.  
If you place a variable declaration inside a function, the compiler handles  
this declaration as it’s parsing the function, and associates that  
declaration with the function’s scope. If a variable is block-scope declared  
\(let / const\), then it’s associated with the nearest enclosing \{ .. \}  
block, rather than its enclosing function \(as with var\).  
Furthermore, a reference \(target or source role\) for a variable must be  
resolved as coming from one of the scopes that are lexically available to  
it; otherwise the variable is said to be “undeclared” \(which usually results  
in an error!\). If the variable is not declared in the current scope, the next  
outer/enclosing scope will be consulted. This process of stepping out one  
level of scope nesting continues until either a matching variable  
25 declaration can be found, or the global scope is reached and there’s  
nowhere else to go.  
It’s important to note that compilation doesn’t actually do anything in terms  
of reserving memory for scopes and variables. None of the program has  
been executed yet.  
Instead, compilation creates a map of all the lexical scopes that lays out  
what the program will need while it executes. You can think of this plan as  
inserted code for use at runtime, which defines all the scopes \(aka,  
“lexical environments”\) and registers all the identifiers \(variables\) for each  
scope.  
In other words, while scopes are identified during compilation, they’re not  
actually created until runtime, each time a scope needs to run. In the next  
chapter, we’ll sketch out the conceptual foundations for lexical scope.  
26 Chapter 2\: Illustrating Lexical  
# Scope  
In Chapter 1, we explored how scope is determined during code  
compilation, a model called “lexical scope.” The term “lexical” refers  
to the first stage of compilation \(lexing/parsing\).  
To properly reason about our programs, it’s important to have a solid  
conceptual foundation of how scope works. If we rely on guesses  
and intuition, we may accidentally get the right answers some of the  
time, but many other times we’re far off. This isn’t a recipe for  
success.  
Like way back in grade school math class, getting the right answer  
isn’t enough if we don’t show the correct steps to get there! We need  
to build accurate and helpful mental models as foundation moving  
forward.  
This chapter will illustrate scope with several metaphors. The goal  
here is to think about how your program is handled by the JS engine  
in ways that more closely align with how the JS engine actually  
works.  
# Marbles, and Buckets, and Bubbles… Oh  
# My!  
One metaphor I’ve found effective in understanding scope is sorting  
colored marbles into buckets of their matching color.  
27 Imagine you come across a pile of marbles, and notice that all the  
marbles are colored red, blue, or green. Let’s sort all the marbles,  
dropping the red ones into a red bucket, green into a green bucket,  
and blue into a blue bucket. After sorting, when you later need a  
green marble, you already know the green bucket is where to go to  
get it.  
In this metaphor, the marbles are the variables in our program. The  
buckets are scopes \(functions and blocks\), which we just  
conceptually assign individual colors for our discussion purposes.  
The color of each marble is thus determined by which color scope  
we find the marble originally created in.  
Let’s annotate the running program example from Chapter 1 with  
scope color labels\:  
// outer/global scope\: RED  
var students = \[  
\{ id\: 14, name\: "Kyle" \},  
\{ id\: 73, name\: "Suzy" \},  
\{ id\: 112, name\: "Frank" \},  
\{ id\: 6, name\: "Sarah" \}  
\];  
function getStudentName\(studentID\) \{  
// function scope\: BLUE  
for \(let student of students\) \{  
// loop scope\: GREEN  
if \(student.id == studentID\) \{  
28 return student.name;  
\}  
\}  
\}  
var nextStudent = getStudentName\(73\);  
console.log\(nextStudent\); // Suzy  
We’ve designated three scope colors with code comments\: RED  
\(outermost global scope\), BLUE \(scope of function  
getStudentName\(..\)\), and GREEN \(scope of/inside the for loop\).  
But it still may be difficult to recognize the boundaries of these scope  
buckets when looking at a code listing.  
Figure 2 helps visualize the boundaries of the scopes by drawing  
colored bubbles \(aka, buckets\) around each\:  
29 Fig. 2\: Colored Scope Bubbles  
1\. Bubble 1 \(RED\) encompasses the global scope, which holds  
three identifiers/variables\: students \(line 1\), getStudentName  
\(line 8\), and nextStudent \(line 16\).  
2\. Bubble 2 \(BLUE\) encompasses the scope of the function  
getStudentName\(..\) \(line 8\), which holds just one  
identifier/variable\: the parameter studentID \(line 8\).  
30 3\. Bubble 3 \(GREEN\) encompasses the scope of the for-loop  
\(line 9\), which holds just one identifier/variable\: student \(line 9\).  
NOTE\:  
Technically, the parameter studentID is not exactly in the BLUE\(2\)  
scope. We’ll unwind that confusion in “Implied Scopes” in Appendix  
A. For now, it’s close enough to label studentID a BLUE\(2\) marble.  
Scope bubbles are determined during compilation based on where  
the functions/blocks of scope are written, the nesting inside each  
other, and so on. Each scope bubble is entirely contained within its  
parent scope bubble—a scope is never partially in two different outer  
scopes.  
Each marble \(variable/identifier\) is colored based on which bubble  
\(bucket\) it’s declared in, not the color of the scope it may be  
accessed from \(e.g., students on line 9 and studentID on line 10\).  
NOTE\:  
Remember we asserted in Chapter 1 that id, name, and log are all  
properties, not variables; in other words, they’re not marbles in  
buckets, so they don’t get colored based on any the rules we’re  
discussing in this book. To understand how such property accesses  
are handled, see the third book in the series, Objects & Classes.  
As the JS engine processes a program \(during compilation\), and  
finds a declaration for a variable, it essentially asks, “Which color  
scope \(bubble or bucket\) am I currently in?” The variable is  
designated as that same color, meaning it belongs to that  
bucket/bubble.  
31 The GREEN\(3\) bucket is wholly nested inside of the BLUE\(2\)  
bucket, and similarly the BLUE\(2\) bucket is wholly nested inside the  
RED\(1\) bucket. Scopes can nest inside each other as shown, to any  
depth of nesting as your program needs.  
References \(non-declarations\) to variables/identifiers are allowed if  
there’s a matching declaration either in the current scope, or any  
scope above/outside the current scope, but not with declarations  
from lower/nested scopes.  
An expression in the RED\(1\) bucket only has access to RED\(1\)  
marbles, not BLUE\(2\) or GREEN\(3\). An expression in the BLUE\(2\)  
bucket can reference either BLUE\(2\) or RED\(1\) marbles, not  
GREEN\(3\). And an expression in the GREEN\(3\) bucket has access  
to RED\(1\), BLUE\(2\), and GREEN\(3\) marbles.  
We can conceptualize the process of determining these non-  
declaration marble colors during runtime as a lookup. Since the  
students variable reference in the for-loop statement on line 9 is  
not a declaration, it has no color. So we ask the current BLUE\(2\)  
scope bucket if it has a marble matching that name. Since it doesn’t,  
the lookup continues with the next outer/containing scope\: RED\(1\).  
The RED\(1\) bucket has a marble of the name students, so the  
loop-statement’s students variable reference is determined to be a  
RED\(1\) marble.  
The if \(student.id == studentID\) statement on line 10 is  
similarly determined to reference a GREEN\(3\) marble named  
student and a BLUE\(2\) marble studentID.  
32 NOTE\:  
The JS engine doesn’t generally determine these marble colors  
during runtime; the “lookup” here is a rhetorical device to help you  
understand the concepts. During compilation, most or all variable  
references will match already-known scope buckets, so their color is  
already determined, and stored with each marble reference to avoid  
unnecessary lookups as the program runs. More on this nuance in  
Chapter 3.  
The key take-aways from marbles & buckets \(and bubbles!\)\:  
Variables are declared in specific scopes, which can be thought  
of as colored marbles from matching-color buckets.  
Any variable reference that appears in the scope where it was  
declared, or appears in any deeper nested scopes, will be  
labeled a marble of that same color—unless an intervening  
scope “shadows” the variable declaration; see “Shadowing” in  
Chapter 3.  
The determination of colored buckets, and the marbles they  
contain, happens during compilation. This information is used  
for variable \(marble color\) “lookups” during code execution.  
# A Conversation Among Friends  
Another useful metaphor for the process of analyzing variables and  
the scopes they come from is to imagine various conversations that  
occur inside the engine as code is processed and then executed. We  
can “listen in” on these conversations to get a better conceptual  
foundation for how scopes work.  
33 Let’s now meet the members of the JS engine that will have  
conversations as they process our program\:  
Engine\: responsible for start-to-finish compilation and execution  
of our JavaScript program.  
Compiler\: one of Engine’s friends; handles all the dirty work of  
parsing and code-generation \(see previous section\).  
Scope Manager\: another friend of Engine; collects and  
maintains a lookup list of all the declared variables/identifiers,  
and enforces a set of rules as to how these are accessible to  
currently executing code.  
For you to fully understand how JavaScript works, you need to begin  
to think like Engine \(and friends\) think, ask the questions they ask,  
and answer their questions likewise.  
To explore these conversations, recall again our running program  
example\:  
var students = \[  
\{ id\: 14, name\: "Kyle" \},  
\{ id\: 73, name\: "Suzy" \},  
\{ id\: 112, name\: "Frank" \},  
\{ id\: 6, name\: "Sarah" \}  
\];  
function getStudentName\(studentID\) \{  
for \(let student of students\) \{  
if \(student.id == studentID\) \{  
return student.name;  
\}  
34 \}  
\}  
var nextStudent = getStudentName\(73\);  
console.log\(nextStudent\);  
// Suzy  
Let’s examine how JS is going to process that program, specifically  
starting with the first statement. The array and its contents are just  
basic JS value literals \(and thus unaffected by any scoping  
concerns\), so our focus here will be on the var students = \[ .. \]  
declaration and initialization-assignment parts.  
We typically think of that as a single statement, but that’s not how  
our friend Engine sees it. In fact, JS treats these as two distinct  
operations, one which Compiler will handle during compilation, and  
the other which Engine will handle during execution.  
The first thing Compiler will do with this program is perform lexing to  
break it down into tokens, which it will then parse into a tree \(AST\).  
Once Compiler gets to code generation, there’s more detail to  
consider than may be obvious. A reasonable assumption would be  
that Compiler will produce code for the first statement such as\:  
“Allocate memory for a variable, label it students, then stick a  
reference to the array into that variable.” But that’s not the whole  
story.  
Here’s the steps Compiler will follow to handle that statement\:  
35 1\. Encountering var students, Compiler will ask Scope Manager  
to see if a variable named students already exists for that  
particular scope bucket. If so, Compiler would ignore this  
declaration and move on. Otherwise, Compiler will produce  
code that \(at execution time\) asks Scope Manager to create a  
new variable called students in that scope bucket.  
2\. Compiler then produces code for Engine to later execute, to  
handle the students = \[\] assignment. The code Engine runs  
will first ask Scope Manager if there is a variable called  
students accessible in the current scope bucket. If not, Engine  
keeps looking elsewhere \(see “Nested Scope” below\). Once  
Engine finds a variable, it assigns the reference of the \[ .. \]  
array to it.  
In conversational form, the first phase of compilation for the program  
might play out between Compiler and Scope Manager like this\:  
Compiler\: Hey, Scope Manager \(of the global scope\), I found a  
formal declaration for an identifier called students, ever heard  
of it?  
\(Global\) Scope Manager\: Nope, never heard of it, so I just  
created it for you.  
Compiler\: Hey, Scope Manager, I found a formal declaration for  
an identifier called getStudentName, ever heard of it?  
\(Global\) Scope Manager\: Nope, but I just created it for you.  
Compiler\: Hey, Scope Manager, getStudentName points to a  
function, so we need a new scope bucket.  
36 \(Function\) Scope Manager\: Got it, here’s the scope bucket.  
Compiler\: Hey, Scope Manager \(of the function\), I found a  
formal parameter declaration for studentID, ever heard of it?  
\(Function\) Scope Manager\: Nope, but now it’s created in this  
scope.  
Compiler\: Hey, Scope Manager \(of the function\), I found a for-  
loop that will need its own scope bucket.  
…  
The conversation is a question-and-answer exchange, where  
Compiler asks the current Scope Manager if an encountered  
identifier declaration has already been encountered. If “no,” Scope  
Manager creates that variable in that scope. If the answer is “yes,”  
then it’s effectively skipped over since there’s nothing more for that  
Scope Manager to do.  
Compiler also signals when it runs across functions or block scopes,  
so that a new scope bucket and Scope Manager can be instantiated.  
Later, when it comes to execution of the program, the conversation  
will shift to Engine and Scope Manager, and might play out like this\:  
Engine\: Hey, Scope Manager \(of the global scope\), before we  
begin, can you look up the identifier getStudentName so I can  
assign this function to it?  
\(Global\) Scope Manager\: Yep, here’s the variable.  
37 Engine\: Hey, Scope Manager, I found a target reference for  
students, ever heard of it?  
\(Global\) Scope Manager\: Yes, it was formally declared for this  
scope, so here it is.  
Engine\: Thanks, I’m initializing students to undefined, so it’s  
ready to use.  
Hey, Scope Manager \(of the global scope\), I found a target  
reference for nextStudent, ever heard of it?  
\(Global\) Scope Manager\: Yes, it was formally declared for this  
scope, so here it is.  
Engine\: Thanks, I’m initializing nextStudent to undefined, so  
it’s ready to use.  
Hey, Scope Manager \(of the global scope\), I found a source  
reference for getStudentName, ever heard of it?  
\(Global\) Scope Manager\: Yes, it was formally declared for this  
scope. Here it is.  
Engine\: Great, the value in getStudentName is a function, so  
I’m going to execute it.  
Engine\: Hey, Scope Manager, now we need to instantiate the  
function’s scope.  
…  
This conversation is another question-and-answer exchange, where  
Engine first asks the current Scope Manager to look up the hoisted  
38 getStudentName identifier, so as to associate the function with it.  
Engine then proceeds to ask Scope Manager about the target  
reference for students, and so on.  
To review and summarize how a statement like var students = \[  
.. \] is processed, in two distinct steps\:  
1\. Compiler sets up the declaration of the scope variable \(since it  
wasn’t previously declared in the current scope\).  
2\. While Engine is executing, to process the assignment part of the  
statement, Engine asks Scope Manager to look up the variable,  
initializes it to undefined so it’s ready to use, and then assigns  
the array value to it.  
# Nested Scope  
When it comes time to execute the getStudentName\(\) function,  
Engine asks for a Scope Manager instance for that function’s scope,  
and it will then proceed to look up the parameter \(studentID\) to  
assign the 73 argument value to, and so on.  
The function scope for getStudentName\(..\) is nested inside the  
global scope. The block scope of the for-loop is similarly nested  
inside that function scope. Scopes can be lexically nested to any  
arbitrary depth as the program defines.  
Each scope gets its own Scope Manager instance each time that  
scope is executed \(one or more times\). Each scope automatically  
has all its identifiers registered at the start of the scope being  
executed \(this is called “variable hoisting”; see Chapter 5\).  
39 At the beginning of a scope, if any identifier came from a function  
declaration, that variable is automatically initialized to its associated  
function reference. And if any identifier came from a var declaration  
\(as opposed to let/const\), that variable is automatically initialized to  
undefined so that it can be used; otherwise, the variable remains  
uninitialized \(aka, in its “TDZ,” see Chapter 5\) and cannot be used  
until its full declaration-and-initialization are executed.  
In the for \(let student of students\) \{ statement, students is  
a source reference that must be looked up. But how will that lookup  
be handled, since the scope of the function will not find such an  
identifier?  
To explain, let’s imagine that bit of conversation playing out like this\:  
Engine\: Hey, Scope Manager \(for the function\), I have a source  
reference for students, ever heard of it?  
\(Function\) Scope Manager\: Nope, never heard of it. Try the  
next outer scope.  
Engine\: Hey, Scope Manager \(for the global scope\), I have a  
source reference for students, ever heard of it?  
\(Global\) Scope Manager\: Yep, it was formally declared, here it  
is.  
…  
One of the key aspects of lexical scope is that any time an identifier  
reference cannot be found in the current scope, the next outer scope  
in the nesting is consulted; that process is repeated until an answer  
is found or there are no more scopes to consult.  
40 Lookup Failures  
When Engine exhausts all lexically available scopes \(moving  
outward\) and still cannot resolve the lookup of an identifier, an error  
condition then exists. However, depending on the mode of the  
program \(strict-mode or not\) and the role of the variable \(i.e., target  
vs. source; see Chapter 1\), this error condition will be handled  
differently.  
Undefined Mess  
If the variable is a source, an unresolved identifier lookup is  
considered an undeclared \(unknown, missing\) variable, which  
always results in a ReferenceError being thrown. Also, if the  
variable is a target, and the code at that moment is running in strict-  
mode, the variable is considered undeclared and similarly throws a  
ReferenceError.  
The error message for an undeclared variable condition, in most JS  
environments, will look like, “Reference Error\: XYZ is not defined.”  
The phrase “not defined” seems almost identical to the word  
“undefined,” as far as the English language goes. But these two are  
very different in JS, and this error message unfortunately creates a  
persistent confusion.  
“Not defined” really means “not declared”—or, rather, “undeclared,”  
as in a variable that has no matching formal declaration in any  
lexically available scope. By contrast, “undefined” really means a  
variable was found \(declared\), but the variable otherwise has no  
other value in it at the moment, so it defaults to the undefined value.  
41 To perpetuate the confusion even further, JS’s typeof operator  
returns the string "undefined" for variable references in either state\:  
var studentName;  
typeof studentName; // "undefined"  
typeof doesntExist; // "undefined"  
These two variable references are in very different conditions, but JS  
sure does muddy the waters. The terminology mess is confusing and  
terribly unfortunate. Unfortunately, JS developers just have to pay  
close attention to not mix up which kind of “undefined” they’re  
dealing with!  
Global… What!?  
If the variable is a target and strict-mode is not in effect, a confusing  
and surprising legacy behavior kicks in. The troublesome outcome is  
that the global scope’s Scope Manager will just create an accidental  
global variable to fulfill that target assignment!  
Consider\:  
function getStudentName\(\) \{  
// assignment to an undeclared variable \:\(  
nextStudent =  
"Suzy";  
\}  
getStudentName\(\);  
42 console.log\(nextStudent\);  
// "Suzy"  
-- oops, an accidental-global variable!  
Here’s how that conversation will proceed\:  
Engine\: Hey, Scope Manager \(for the function\), I have a target  
reference for nextStudent, ever heard of it?  
\(Function\) Scope Manager\: Nope, never heard of it. Try the  
next outer scope.  
Engine\: Hey, Scope Manager \(for the global scope\), I have a  
target reference for nextStudent, ever heard of it?  
\(Global\) Scope Manager\: Nope, but since we’re in non-strict-  
mode, I helped you out and just created a global variable for  
you, here it is!  
Yuck.  
This sort of accident \(almost certain to lead to bugs eventually\) is a  
great example of the beneficial protections offered by strict-mode,  
and why it’s such a bad idea not to be using strict-mode. In strict-  
mode, the Global Scope Manager would instead have responded\:  
\(Global\) Scope Manager\: Nope, never heard of it. Sorry, I’ve  
got to throw a ReferenceError.  
Assigning to a never-declared variable is an error, so it’s right that  
we would receive a ReferenceError here.  
Never rely on accidental global variables. Always use strict-mode,  
and always formally declare your variables. You’ll then get a helpful  
43 ReferenceError if you ever mistakenly try to assign to a not-  
declared variable.  
Building On Metaphors  
To visualize nested scope resolution, I prefer yet another metaphor,  
an office building, as in Figure 3\:  
Fig. 3\: Scope “Building”  
The building represents our program’s nested scope collection. The  
first floor of the building represents the currently executing scope.  
The top level of the building is the global scope.  
You resolve a target or source variable reference by first looking on  
the current floor, and if you don’t find it, taking the elevator to the  
next floor \(i.e., an outer scope\), looking there, then the next, and so  
on. Once you get to the top floor \(the global scope\), you either find  
44 what you’re looking for, or you don’t. But you have to stop  
regardless.  
# Continue the Conversation  
By this point, you should be developing richer mental models for  
what scope is and how the JS engine determines and uses it from  
your code.  
Before continuing, go find some code in one of your projects and run  
through these conversations. Seriously, actually speak out loud. Find  
a friend and practice each role with them. If either of you find  
yourself confused or tripped up, spend more time reviewing this  
material.  
As we move \(up\) to the next \(outer\) chapter, we’ll explore how the  
lexical scopes of a program are connected in a chain.  
45 Chapter 3\: The Scope Chain  
Chapters 1 and 2 laid down a concrete definition of lexical scope  
\(and its parts\) and illustrated helpful metaphors for its conceptual  
foundation. Before proceeding with this chapter, find someone else  
to explain \(written or aloud\), in your own words, what lexical scope is  
and why it’s useful to understand.  
That seems like a step you might skip, but I’ve found it really does  
help to take the time to reformulate these ideas as explanations to  
others. That helps our brains digest what we’re learning!  
Now it’s time to dig into the nuts and bolts, so expect that things will  
get a lot more detailed from here forward. Stick with it, though,  
because these discussions really hammer home just how much we  
all don’t know about scope, yet. Make sure to take your time with the  
text and all the code snippets provided.  
To refresh the context of our running example, let’s recall the color-  
coded illustration of the nested scope bubbles, from Chapter 2,  
Figure 2\:  
46 Fig. 2 \(Ch. 2\)\: Colored Scope Bubbles  
The connections between scopes that are nested within other  
scopes is called the scope chain, which determines the path along  
which variables can be accessed. The chain is directed, meaning the  
lookup moves upward/outward only.  
# “Lookup” Is \(Mostly\) Conceptual  
47 In Figure 2, notice the color of the students variable reference in the  
for-loop. How exactly did we determine that it’s a RED\(1\) marble?  
In Chapter 2, we described the runtime access of a variable as a  
“lookup,” where the Engine has to start by asking the current scope’s  
Scope Manager if it knows about an identifier/variable, and  
proceeding upward/outward back through the chain of nested  
scopes \(toward the global scope\) until found, if ever. The lookup  
stops as soon as the first matching named declaration in a scope  
bucket is found.  
The lookup process thus determined that students is a RED\(1\)  
marble, because we had not yet found a matching variable name as  
we traversed the scope chain, until we arrived at the final RED\(1\)  
global scope.  
Similarly, studentID in the if-statement is determined to be a  
BLUE\(2\) marble.  
This suggestion of a runtime lookup process works well for  
conceptual understanding, but it’s not actually how things usually  
work in practice.  
The color of a marble’s bucket \(aka, meta information of what scope  
a variable originates from\) is usually determined during the initial  
compilation processing. Because lexical scope is pretty much  
finalized at that point, a marble’s color will not change based on  
anything that can happen later during runtime.  
Since the marble’s color is known from compilation, and it’s  
immutable, this information would likely be stored with \(or at least  
accessible from\) each variable’s entry in the AST; that information is  
48 then used explicitly by the executable instructions that constitute the  
program’s runtime.  
In other words, Engine \(from Chapter 2\) doesn’t need to lookup  
through a bunch of scopes to figure out which scope bucket a  
variable comes from. That information is already known! Avoiding the  
need for a runtime lookup is a key optimization benefit of lexical  
scope. The runtime operates more performantly without spending  
time on all these lookups.  
But I said “…usually determined…” just a moment ago, with respect  
to figuring out a marble’s color during compilation. So in what case  
would it ever not be known during compilation?  
Consider a reference to a variable that isn’t declared in any lexically  
available scopes in the current file—see Get Started, Chapter 1,  
which asserts that each file is its own separate program from the  
perspective of JS compilation. If no declaration is found, that’s not  
necessarily an error. Another file \(program\) in the runtime may  
indeed declare that variable in the shared global scope.  
So the ultimate determination of whether the variable was ever  
appropriately declared in some accessible bucket may need to be  
deferred to the runtime.  
Any reference to a variable that’s initially undeclared is left as an  
uncolored marble during that file’s compilation; this color cannot be  
determined until other relevant file\(s\) have been compiled and the  
application runtime commences. That deferred lookup will eventually  
resolve the color to whichever scope the variable is found in \(likely  
the global scope\).  
49 However, this lookup would only be needed once per variable at  
most, since nothing else during runtime could later change that  
marble’s color.  
The “Lookup Failures” section in Chapter 2 covers what happens if a  
marble is ultimately still uncolored at the moment its reference is  
runtime executed.  
# Shadowing  
“Shadowing” might sound mysterious and a little bit sketchy. But  
don’t worry, it’s completely legit!  
Our running example for these chapters uses different variable  
names across the scope boundaries. Since they all have unique  
names, in a way it wouldn’t matter if all of them were just stored in  
one bucket \(like RED\(1\)\).  
Where having different lexical scope buckets starts to matter more is  
when you have two or more variables, each in different scopes, with  
the same lexical names. A single scope cannot have two or more  
variables with the same name; such multiple references would be  
assumed as just one variable.  
So if you need to maintain two or more variables of the same name,  
you must use separate \(often nested\) scopes. And in that case, it’s  
very relevant how the different scope buckets are laid out.  
Consider\:  
var studentName =  
"Suzy";  
50 function printStudent\(studentName\) \{  
studentName = studentName.toUpperCase\(\);  
console.log\(studentName\);  
\}  
printStudent\("Frank"\);  
// FRANK  
printStudent\(studentName\);  
// SUZY  
console.log\(studentName\);  
// Suzy  
TIP\:  
Before you move on, take some time to analyze this code using the  
various techniques/metaphors we’ve covered in the book. In  
particular, make sure to identify the marble/bubble colors in this  
snippet. It’s good practice!  
The studentName variable on line 1 \(the var studentName = ..  
statement\) creates a RED\(1\) marble. The same named variable is  
declared as a BLUE\(2\) marble on line 3, the parameter in the  
printStudent\(..\) function definition.  
What color marble will studentName be in the studentName =  
studentName.toUpperCase\(\) assignment statement and the  
console.log\(studentName\) statement? All three studentName  
references will be BLUE\(2\).  
With the conceptual notion of the “lookup,” we asserted that it starts  
with the current scope and works its way outward/upward, stopping  
51 as soon as a matching variable is found. The BLUE\(2\) studentName  
is found right away. The RED\(1\) studentName is never even  
considered.  
This is a key aspect of lexical scope behavior, called shadowing. The  
BLUE\(2\) studentName variable \(parameter\) shadows the RED\(1\)  
studentName. So, the parameter is shadowing the \(shadowed\)  
global variable. Repeat that sentence to yourself a few times to  
make sure you have the terminology straight!  
That’s why the re-assignment of studentName affects only the inner  
\(parameter\) variable\: the BLUE\(2\) studentName, not the global  
RED\(1\) studentName.  
When you choose to shadow a variable from an outer scope, one  
direct impact is that from that scope inward/downward \(through any  
nested scopes\) it’s now impossible for any marble to be colored as  
the shadowed variable—\(RED\(1\), in this case\). In other words, any  
studentName identifier reference will correspond to that parameter  
variable, never the global studentName variable. It’s lexically  
impossible to reference the global studentName anywhere inside of  
the printStudent\(..\) function \(or from any nested scopes\).  
Global Unshadowing Trick  
Please beware\: leveraging the technique I’m about to describe is not  
very good practice, as it’s limited in utility, confusing for readers of  
your code, and likely to invite bugs to your program. I’m covering it  
only because you may run across this behavior in existing programs,  
and understanding what’s happening is critical to not getting tripped  
up.  
52 It is possible to access a global variable from a scope where that  
variable has been shadowed, but not through a typical lexical  
identifier reference.  
In the global scope \(RED\(1\)\), var declarations and function  
declarations also expose themselves as properties \(of the same  
name as the identifier\) on the global object—essentially an object  
representation of the global scope. If you’ve written JS for a browser  
environment, you probably recognize the global object as window.  
That’s not entirely accurate, but it’s good enough for our discussion.  
In the next chapter, we’ll explore the global scope/object topic more.  
Consider this program, specifically executed as a standalone .js file  
in a browser environment\:  
var studentName =  
"Suzy";  
function printStudent\(studentName\) \{  
console.log\(studentName\);  
console.log\(window.studentName\);  
\}  
printStudent\("Frank"\);  
// "Frank"  
// "Suzy"  
Notice the window.studentName reference? This expression is  
accessing the global variable studentName as a property on window  
\(which we’re pretending for now is synonymous with the global  
object\). That’s the only way to access a shadowed variable from  
inside a scope where the shadowing variable is present.  
53 The window.studentName is a mirror of the global studentName  
variable, not a separate snapshot copy. Changes to one are still  
seen from the other, in either direction. You can think of  
window.studentName as a getter/setter that accesses the actual  
studentName variable. As a matter of fact, you can even add a  
variable to the global scope by creating/setting a property on the  
global object.  
WARNING\:  
Remember\: just because you can doesn’t mean you should. Don’t  
shadow a global variable that you need to access, and conversely,  
avoid using this trick to access a global variable that you’ve  
shadowed. And definitely don’t confuse readers of your code by  
creating global variables as window properties instead of with formal  
declarations!  
This little “trick” only works for accessing a global scope variable \(not  
a shadowed variable from a nested scope\), and even then, only one  
that was declared with var or function.  
Other forms of global scope declarations do not create mirrored  
global object properties\:  
var one = 1;  
let notOne = 2;  
const notTwo = 3;  
class notThree \{\}  
console.log\(window.one\); // 1  
console.log\(window.notOne\); // undefined  
54 console.log\(window.notTwo\); // undefined  
console.log\(window.notThree\); // undefined  
Variables \(no matter how they’re declared!\) that exist in any other  
scope than the global scope are completely inaccessible from a  
scope where they’ve been shadowed\:  
var special = 42;  
function lookingFor\(special\) \{  
// The identifier  
\`  
special\` \(parameter\) in this  
// scope is shadowed inside keepLooking\(\), and  
// is thus inaccessible from that scope.  
function keepLooking\(\) \{  
var special = 3.141592;  
console.log\(special\);  
console.log\(window.special\);  
\}  
keepLooking\(\);  
\}  
lookingFor\(112358132134\);  
// 3.141592  
// 42  
The global RED\(1\) special is shadowed by the BLUE\(2\) special  
\(parameter\), and the BLUE\(2\) special is itself shadowed by the  
GREEN\(3\) special inside keepLooking\(\). We can still access the  
RED\(1\) special using the indirect reference window.special. But  
55 there’s no way for keepLooking\(\) to access the BLUE\(2\) special  
that holds the number 112358132134.  
Copying Is Not Accessing  
I’ve been asked the following “But what about…?” question dozens  
of times. Consider\:  
var special = 42;  
function lookingFor\(special\) \{  
var another = \{  
special\: special  
\};  
function keepLooking\(\) \{  
var special = 3.141592;  
console.log\(special\);  
console.log\(another.special\); // Ooo, tricky!  
console.log\(window.special\);  
\}  
keepLooking\(\);  
\}  
lookingFor\(112358132134\);  
// 3.141592  
// 112358132134  
// 42  
Oh! So does this another object technique disprove my claim that  
the special parameter is “completely inaccessible” from inside  
56 keepLooking\(\)? No, the claim is still correct.  
special\: special is copying the value of the special parameter  
variable into another container \(a property of the same name\). Of  
course, if you put a value in another container, shadowing no longer  
applies \(unless another was shadowed, too!\). But that doesn’t mean  
we’re accessing the parameter special; it means we’re accessing  
the copy of the value it had at that moment, by way of another  
container \(object property\). We cannot reassign the BLUE\(2\)  
special parameter to a different value from inside keepLooking\(\).  
Another “But…!?” you may be about to raise\: what if I’d used objects  
or arrays as the values instead of the numbers \(112358132134,  
etc.\)? Would us having references to objects instead of copies of  
primitive values “fix” the inaccessibility?  
No. Mutating the contents of the object value via a reference copy is  
not the same thing as lexically accessing the variable itself. We still  
can’t reassign the BLUE\(2\) special parameter.  
Illegal Shadowing  
Not all combinations of declaration shadowing are allowed. let can  
shadow var, but var cannot shadow let\:  
function something\(\) \{  
var special =  
\{  
"JavaScript";  
let special = 42; // ..  
// totally fine shadowing  
57 \}  
\}  
function another\(\) \{  
// ..  
\{  
let special =  
"JavaScript";  
\{  
var special =  
// \^\^\^ Syntax Error  
"JavaScript";  
// ..  
\}  
\}  
\}  
Notice in the another\(\) function, the inner var special declaration  
is attempting to declare a function-wide special, which in and of  
itself is fine \(as shown by the something\(\) function\).  
The syntax error description in this case indicates that special has  
already been defined, but that error message is a little misleading—  
again, no such error happens in something\(\), as shadowing is  
generally allowed just fine.  
The real reason it’s raised as a SyntaxError is because the var is  
basically trying to “cross the boundary” of \(or hop over\) the let  
declaration of the same name, which is not allowed.  
That boundary-crossing prohibition effectively stops at each function  
boundary, so this variant raises no exception\:  
58 function another\(\) \{  
// ..  
\{  
let special =  
"JavaScript";  
ajax\("https\://some.url"  
,function callback\(\)\{  
// totally fine shadowing  
var special =  
"JavaScript";  
// ..  
\}\);  
\}  
\}  
Summary\: let \(in an inner scope\) can always shadow an outer  
scope’s var. var \(in an inner scope\) can only shadow an outer  
scope’s let if there is a function boundary in between.  
# Function Name Scope  
As you’ve seen by now, a function declaration looks like this\:  
function askQuestion\(\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
And as discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, such a function declaration  
will create an identifier in the enclosing scope \(in this case, the  
global scope\) named askQuestion.  
59 What about this program?  
var askQuestion = function\(\)\{  
// ..  
\};  
The same is true for the variable askQuestion being created. But  
since it’s a function expression—a function definition used as value  
instead of a standalone declaration—the function itself will not “hoist”  
\(see Chapter 5\).  
One major difference between function declarations and function  
expressions is what happens to the name identifier of the function.  
Consider a named function expression\:  
var askQuestion = function ofTheTeacher\(\)\{  
// ..  
\};  
We know askQuestion ends up in the outer scope. But what about  
the ofTheTeacher identifier? For formal function declarations, the  
name identifier ends up in the outer/enclosing scope, so it may be  
reasonable to assume that’s the case here. But ofTheTeacher is  
declared as an identifier inside the function itself\:  
var askQuestion = function ofTheTeacher\(\) \{  
console.log\(ofTheTeacher\);  
\};  
askQuestion\(\);  
// function ofTheTeacher\(\)...  
60 console.log\(ofTheTeacher\);  
// ReferenceError\: ofTheTeacher is not defined  
NOTE\:  
Actually, ofTheTeacher is not exactly in the scope of the function.  
Appendix A, “Implied Scopes” will explain further.  
Not only is ofTheTeacher declared inside the function rather than  
outside, but it’s also defined as read-only\:  
var askQuestion = function ofTheTeacher\(\) \{  
"use strict";  
ofTheTeacher = 42; // TypeError  
//..  
\};  
askQuestion\(\);  
// TypeError  
Because we used strict-mode, the assignment failure is reported as  
a TypeError; in non-strict-mode, such an assignment fails silently  
with no exception.  
What about when a function expression has no name identifier?  
var askQuestion = function\(\)\{  
// ..  
\};  
61 A function expression with a name identifier is referred to as a  
“named function expression,” but one without a name identifier is  
referred to as an “anonymous function expression.” Anonymous  
function expressions clearly have no name identifier that affects  
either scope.  
NOTE\:  
We’ll discuss named vs. anonymous function expressions in much  
more detail, including what factors affect the decision to use one or  
the other, in Appendix A.  
# Arrow Functions  
ES6 added an additional function expression form to the language,  
called “arrow functions”\:  
var askQuestion = \(\) =\> \{  
// ..  
\};  
The =\> arrow function doesn’t require the word function to define it.  
Also, the \( .. \) around the parameter list is optional in some simple  
cases. Likewise, the \{ .. \} around the function body is optional in  
some cases. And when the \{ .. \} are omitted, a return value is  
sent out without using a return keyword.  
NOTE\:  
The attractiveness of =\> arrow functions is often sold as “shorter  
syntax,” and that’s claimed to equate to objectively more readable  
code. This claim is dubious at best, and I believe outright misguided.  
62 NOTE\:  
We’ll dig into the “readability” of various function forms in Appendix  
A.  
Arrow functions are lexically anonymous, meaning they have no  
directly related identifier that references the function. The  
assignment to askQuestion creates an inferred name of  
“askQuestion”, but that’s not the same thing as being non-  
anonymous\:  
var askQuestion = \(\) =\> \{  
// ..  
\};  
askQuestion.name; // askQuestion  
Arrow functions achieve their syntactic brevity at the expense of  
having to mentally juggle a bunch of variations for different  
forms/conditions. Just a few, for example\:  
\(\) =\> 42;  
id =\> id.toUpperCase\(\);  
\(id,name\) =\> \(\{ id, name \}\);  
\(...args\) =\> \{  
return args\[args.length - 1\];  
\};  
63 The real reason I bring up arrow functions is because of the common  
but incorrect claim that arrow functions somehow behave differently  
with respect to lexical scope from standard function functions.  
This is incorrect.  
Other than being anonymous \(and having no declarative form\), =\>  
arrow functions have the same lexical scope rules as function  
functions do. An arrow function, with or without \{ .. \} around its  
body, still creates a separate, inner nested bucket of scope. Variable  
declarations inside this nested scope bucket behave the same as in  
a function scope.  
# Backing Out  
When a function \(declaration or expression\) is defined, a new scope  
is created. The positioning of scopes nested inside one another  
creates a natural scope hierarchy throughout the program, called the  
scope chain. The scope chain controls variable access, directionally  
oriented upward and outward.  
Each new scope offers a clean slate, a space to hold its own set of  
variables. When a variable name is repeated at different levels of the  
scope chain, shadowing occurs, which prevents access to the outer  
variable from that point inward.  
As we step back out from these finer details, the next chapter shifts  
focus to the primary scope all JS programs include\: the global scope.  
64 Chapter 4\: Around the Global  
# Scope  
Chapter 3 mentioned the “global scope” several times, but you may  
still be wondering why a program’s outermost scope is all that  
important in modern JS. The vast majority of work is now done inside  
of functions and modules rather than globally.  
Is it good enough to just assert, “Avoid using the global scope,” and  
be done with it?  
The global scope of a JS program is a rich topic, with much more  
utility and nuance than you would likely assume. This chapter first  
explores how the global scope is \(still\) useful and relevant to writing  
JS programs today, then looks at differences in where and how to  
access the global scope in different JS environments.  
Fully understanding the global scope is critical in your mastery of  
using lexical scope to structure your programs.  
# Why Global Scope?  
It’s likely no surprise to readers that most applications are composed  
of multiple \(sometimes many!\) individual JS files. So how exactly do  
all those separate files get stitched together in a single runtime  
context by the JS engine?  
With respect to browser-executed applications, there are three main  
ways.  
65 First, if you’re directly using ES modules \(not transpiling them into  
some other module-bundle format\), these files are loaded  
individually by the JS environment. Each module then imports  
references to whichever other modules it needs to access. The  
separate module files cooperate with each other exclusively through  
these shared imports, without needing any shared outer scope.  
Second, if you’re using a bundler in your build process, all the files  
are typically concatenated together before delivery to the browser  
and JS engine, which then only processes one big file. Even with all  
the pieces of the application co-located in a single file, some  
mechanism is necessary for each piece to register a name to be  
referred to by other pieces, as well as some facility for that access to  
occur.  
In some build setups, the entire contents of the file are wrapped in a  
single enclosing scope, such as a wrapper function, universal  
module \(UMD—see Appendix A\), etc. Each piece can register itself  
for access from other pieces by way of local variables in that shared  
scope. For example\:  
\(function wrappingOuterScope\(\)\{  
var moduleOne = \(function one\(\)\{  
// ..  
\}\)\(\);  
var moduleTwo = \(function two\(\)\{  
// ..  
function callModuleOne\(\) \{  
moduleOne.someMethod\(\);  
\}  
66 // ..  
\}\)\(\);  
\}\)\(\);  
As shown, the moduleOne and moduleTwo local variables inside the  
wrappingOuterScope\(\) function scope are declared so that these  
modules can access each other for their cooperation.  
While the scope of wrappingOuterScope\(\) is a function and not the  
full environment global scope, it does act as a sort of “application-  
wide scope,” a bucket where all the top-level identifiers can be  
stored, though not in the real global scope. It’s kind of like a stand-in  
for the global scope in that respect.  
And finally, the third way\: whether a bundler tool is used for an  
application, or whether the \(non-ES module\) files are simply loaded  
in the browser individually \(via \<script\> tags or other dynamic JS  
resource loading\), if there is no single surrounding scope  
encompassing all these pieces, the global scope is the only way for  
them to cooperate with each other\:  
A bundled file of this sort often looks something like this\:  
var moduleOne = \(function one\(\)\{  
// ..  
\}\)\(\);  
var moduleTwo = \(function two\(\)\{  
// ..  
function callModuleOne\(\) \{  
moduleOne.someMethod\(\);  
67 \}  
// ..  
\}\)\(\);  
Here, since there is no surrounding function scope, these moduleOne  
and moduleTwo declarations are simply dropped into the global  
scope. This is effectively the same as if the files hadn’t been  
concatenated, but loaded separately\:  
module1.js\:  
var moduleOne = \(function one\(\)\{  
// ..  
\}\)\(\);  
module2.js\:  
var moduleTwo = \(function two\(\)\{  
// ..  
function callModuleOne\(\) \{  
moduleOne.someMethod\(\);  
\}  
// ..  
\}\)\(\);  
If these files are loaded separately as normal standalone .js files in a  
browser environment, each top-level variable declaration will end up  
as a global variable, since the global scope is the only shared  
68 resource between these two separate files—they’re independent  
programs, from the perspective of the JS engine.  
In addition to \(potentially\) accounting for where an application’s code  
resides during runtime, and how each piece is able to access the  
other pieces to cooperate, the global scope is also where\:  
JS exposes its built-ins\:  
primitives\: undefined, null, Infinity, NaN  
natives\: Date\(\), Object\(\), String\(\), etc.  
global functions\: eval\(\), parseInt\(\), etc.  
namespaces\: Math, Atomics, JSON  
friends of JS\: Intl, WebAssembly  
The environment hosting the JS engine exposes its own built-  
ins\:  
console \(and its methods\)  
the DOM \(window, document, etc\)  
timers \(setTimeout\(..\), etc\)  
web platform APIs\: navigator, history, geolocation,  
WebRTC, etc.  
These are just some of the many globals your programs will interact  
with.  
NOTE\:  
Node also exposes several elements “globally,” but they’re  
technically not in the global scope\: require\(\), \_\_dirname,  
module, URL, and so on.  
69 Most developers agree that the global scope shouldn’t just be a  
dumping ground for every variable in your application. That’s a mess  
of bugs just waiting to happen. But it’s also undeniable that the  
global scope is an important glue for practically every JS application.  
# Where Exactly is this Global Scope?  
It might seem obvious that the global scope is located in the  
outermost portion of a file; that is, not inside any function or other  
block. But it’s not quite as simple as that.  
Different JS environments handle the scopes of your programs,  
especially the global scope, differently. It’s quite common for JS  
developers to harbor misconceptions without even realizing it.  
Browser “Window”  
With respect to treatment of the global scope, the most pure  
environment JS can be run in is as a standalone .js file loaded in a  
web page environment in a browser. I don’t mean “pure” as in  
nothing automatically added—lots may be added!—but rather in  
terms of minimal intrusion on the code or interference with its  
expected global scope behavior.  
Consider this .js file\:  
var studentName =  
"Kyle";  
function hello\(\) \{  
console.log\(\`Hello, \$\{ studentName \}!\`\);  
\}  
70 hello\(\);  
// Hello, Kyle!  
This code may be loaded in a web page environment using an inline  
\<script\> tag, a \<script src=..\> script tag in the markup, or even  
a dynamically created \<script\> DOM element. In all three cases,  
the studentName and hello identifiers are declared in the global  
scope.  
That means if you access the global object \(commonly, window in the  
browser\), you’ll find properties of those same names there\:  
var studentName =  
"Kyle";  
function hello\(\) \{  
console.log\(\`Hello, \$\{ window.studentName \}!\`\);  
\}  
window.hello\(\);  
// Hello, Kyle!  
That’s the default behavior one would expect from a reading of the  
JS specification\: the outer scope is the global scope and  
studentName is legitimately created as global variable.  
That’s what I mean by pure. But unfortunately, that won’t always be  
true of all JS environments you encounter, and that’s often surprising  
to JS developers.  
Globals Shadowing Globals  
71 Recall the discussion of shadowing \(and global unshadowing\) from  
Chapter 3, where one variable declaration can override and prevent  
access to a declaration of the same name from an outer scope.  
An unusual consequence of the difference between a global variable  
and a global property of the same name is that, within just the global  
scope itself, a global object property can be shadowed by a global  
variable\:  
window.something = 42;  
let something =  
"Kyle";  
console.log\(something\);  
// Kyle  
console.log\(window.something\);  
// 42  
The let declaration adds a something global variable but not a  
global object property \(see Chapter 3\). The effect then is that the  
something lexical identifier shadows the something global object  
property.  
It’s almost certainly a bad idea to create a divergence between the  
global object and the global scope. Readers of your code will almost  
certainly be tripped up.  
A simple way to avoid this gotcha with global declarations\: always  
use var for globals. Reserve let and const for block scopes \(see  
“Scoping with Blocks” in Chapter 6\).  
72 DOM Globals  
I asserted that a browser-hosted JS environment has the most pure  
global scope behavior we’ll see. However, it’s not entirely pure.  
One surprising behavior in the global scope you may encounter with  
browser-based JS applications\: a DOM element with an id attribute  
automatically creates a global variable that references it.  
Consider this markup\:  
\<ul id=  
\<li id=  
..  
\</ul\>  
"my-todo-list"\>  
"first"\>Write a book\</li\>  
And the JS for that page could include\:  
first;  
// \<li id=  
"first"\>..\</li\>  
window\["my-todo-list"\];  
// \<ul id=  
"my-todo-list"\>..\</ul\>  
If the id value is a valid lexical name \(like first\), the lexical variable  
is created. If not, the only way to access that global is through the  
global object \(window\[..\]\).  
The auto-registration of all id-bearing DOM elements as global  
variables is an old legacy browser behavior that nevertheless must  
remain because so many old sites still rely on it. My advice is never  
73 to use these global variables, even though they will always be  
silently created.  
What’s in a \(Window\) Name?  
Another global scope oddity in browser-based JS\:  
var name = 42;  
console.log\(name, typeof name\);  
// "42" string  
window.name is a pre-defined “global” in a browser context; it’s a  
property on the global object, so it seems like a normal global  
variable \(yet it’s anything but “normal”\).  
We used var for our declaration, which does not shadow the pre-  
defined name global property. That means, effectively, the var  
declaration is ignored, since there’s already a global scope object  
property of that name. As we discussed earlier, had we used let  
name, we would have shadowed window.name with a separate global  
name variable.  
But the truly surprising behavior is that even though we assigned the  
number 42 to name \(and thus window.name\), when we then retrieve  
its value, it’s a string "42"! In this case, the weirdness is because  
name is actually a pre-defined getter/setter on the window object,  
which insists on its value being a string value. Yikes!  
With the exception of some rare corner cases like DOM element ID’s  
and window.name, JS running as a standalone file in a browser page  
has some of the most pure global scope behavior we will encounter.  
74 Web Workers  
Web Workers are a web platform extension on top of browser-JS  
behavior, which allows a JS file to run in a completely separate  
thread \(operating system wise\) from the thread that’s running the  
main JS program.  
Since these Web Worker programs run on a separate thread, they’re  
restricted in their communications with the main application thread,  
to avoid/limit race conditions and other complications. Web Worker  
code does not have access to the DOM, for example. Some web  
APIs are, however, made available to the worker, such as  
navigator.  
Since a Web Worker is treated as a wholly separate program, it does  
not share the global scope with the main JS program. However, the  
browser’s JS engine is still running the code, so we can expect  
similar purity of its global scope behavior. Since there is no DOM  
access, the window alias for the global scope doesn’t exist.  
In a Web Worker, the global object reference is typically made using  
self\:  
var studentName =  
"Kyle";  
let studentID = 42;  
function hello\(\) \{  
console.log\(\`Hello, \$\{ self.studentName \}!\`\);  
\}  
self.hello\(\);  
// Hello, Kyle!  
75 self.studentID;  
// undefined  
Just as with main JS programs, var and function declarations  
create mirrored properties on the global object \(aka, self\), where  
other declarations \(let, etc\) do not.  
So again, the global scope behavior we’re seeing here is about as  
pure as it gets for running JS programs; perhaps it’s even more pure  
since there’s no DOM to muck things up!  
Developer Tools Console/REPL  
Recall from Chapter 1 in Get Started that Developer Tools don’t  
create a completely adherent JS environment. They do process JS  
code, but they also lean in favor of the UX interaction being most  
friendly to developers \(aka, developer experience, or DX\).  
In some cases, favoring DX when typing in short JS snippets, over  
the normal strict steps expected for processing a full JS program,  
produces observable differences in code behavior between  
programs and tools. For example, certain error conditions applicable  
to a JS program may be relaxed and not displayed when the code is  
entered into a developer tool.  
With respect to our discussions here about scope, such observable  
differences in behavior may include\:  
The behavior of the global scope  
Hoisting \(see Chapter 5\)  
76 Block-scoping declarators \(let / const, see Chapter 6\) when  
used in the outermost scope  
Although it might seem, while using the console/REPL, that  
statements entered in the outermost scope are being processed in  
the real global scope, that’s not quite accurate. Such tools typically  
emulate the global scope position to an extent; it’s emulation, not  
strict adherence. These tool environments prioritize developer  
convenience, which means that at times \(such as with our current  
discussions regarding scope\), observed behavior may deviate from  
the JS specification.  
The take-away is that Developer Tools, while optimized to be  
convenient and useful for a variety of developer activities, are not  
suitable environments to determine or verify explicit and nuanced  
behaviors of an actual JS program context.  
ES Modules \(ESM\)  
ES6 introduced first-class support for the module pattern \(covered in  
Chapter 8\). One of the most obvious impacts of using ESM is how it  
changes the behavior of the observably top-level scope in a file.  
Recall this code snippet from earlier \(which we’ll adjust to ESM  
format by using the export keyword\)\:  
var studentName =  
"Kyle";  
function hello\(\) \{  
console.log\(\`Hello, \$\{ studentName \}!\`\);  
\}  
77 hello\(\);  
// Hello, Kyle!  
export hello;  
If that code is in a file that’s loaded as an ES module, it will still run  
exactly the same. However, the observable effects, from the overall  
application perspective, will be different.  
Despite being declared at the top level of the \(module\) file, in the  
outermost obvious scope, studentName and hello are not global  
variables. Instead, they are module-wide, or if you prefer, “module-  
global.”  
However, in a module there’s no implicit “module-wide scope object”  
for these top-level declarations to be added to as properties, as there  
is when declarations appear in the top-level of non-module JS files.  
This is not to say that global variables cannot exist or be accessed in  
such programs. It’s just that global variables don’t get created by  
declaring variables in the top-level scope of a module.  
The module’s top-level scope is descended from the global scope,  
almost as if the entire contents of the module were wrapped in a  
function. Thus, all variables that exist in the global scope \(whether  
they’re on the global object or not!\) are available as lexical identifiers  
from inside the module’s scope.  
ESM encourages a minimization of reliance on the global scope,  
where you import whatever modules you may need for the current  
module to operate. As such, you less often see usage of the global  
scope or its global object.  
78 However, as noted earlier, there are still plenty of JS and web  
globals that you will continue to access from the global scope,  
whether you realize it or not!  
Node  
One aspect of Node that often catches JS developers off-guard is  
that Node treats every single .js file that it loads, including the main  
one you start the Node process with, as a module \(ES module or  
CommonJS module, see Chapter 8\). The practical effect is that the  
top level of your Node programs is never actually the global  
scope, the way it is when loading a non-module file in the browser.  
As of time of this writing, Node has recently added support for ES  
modules. But additionally, Node has from its beginning supported a  
module format referred to as “CommonJS”, which looks like this\:  
var studentName =  
"Kyle";  
function hello\(\) \{  
console.log\(\`Hello, \$\{ studentName \}!\`\);  
\}  
hello\(\);  
// Hello, Kyle!  
module.exports.hello = hello;  
Before processing, Node effectively wraps such code in a function,  
so that the var and function declarations are contained in that  
wrapping function’s scope, not treated as global variables.  
79 Envision the preceding code as being seen by Node as this  
\(illustrative, not actual\)\:  
function Module\(module,require,  
var studentName =  
"Kyle";  
dirname,...\) \{  
\_\_  
function hello\(\) \{  
console.log\(\`Hello, \$\{ studentName \}!\`\);  
\}  
hello\(\);  
// Hello, Kyle!  
module.exports.hello = hello;  
\}  
Node then essentially invokes the added Module\(..\) function to run  
your module. You can clearly see here why studentName and hello  
identifiers are not global, but rather declared in the module scope.  
As noted earlier, Node defines a number of “globals” like require\(\),  
but they’re not actually identifiers in the global scope \(nor properties  
of the global object\). They’re injected in the scope of every module,  
essentially a bit like the parameters listed in the Module\(..\) function  
declaration.  
So how do you define actual global variables in Node? The only way  
to do so is to add properties to another of Node’s automatically  
provided “globals,” which is ironically called global. global is a  
reference to the real global scope object, somewhat like using  
window in a browser JS environment.  
80 Consider\:  
global.studentName =  
"Kyle";  
function hello\(\) \{  
console.log\(\`Hello, \$\{ studentName \}!\`\);  
\}  
hello\(\);  
// Hello, Kyle!  
module.exports.hello = hello;  
Here we add studentName as a property on the global object, and  
then in the console.log\(..\) statement we’re able to access  
studentName as a normal global variable.  
Remember, the identifier global is not defined by JS; it’s specifically  
defined by Node.  
# Global This  
Reviewing the JS environments we’ve looked at so far, a program  
may or may not\:  
Declare a global variable in the top-level scope with var or  
function declarations—or let, const, and class.  
Also add global variables declarations as properties of the  
global scope object if var or function are used for the  
declaration.  
81 Refer to the global scope object \(for adding or retrieving global  
variables, as properties\) with window, self, or global.  
I think it’s fair to say that global scope access and behavior is more  
complicated than most developers assume, as the preceding  
sections have illustrated. But the complexity is never more obvious  
than in trying to nail down a universally applicable reference to the  
global scope object.  
Yet another “trick” for obtaining a reference to the global scope  
object looks like\:  
const theGlobalScopeObject =  
\(new Function\("return this"\)\)\(\);  
NOTE\:  
A function can be dynamically constructed from code stored in a  
string value with the Function\(\) constructor, similar to eval\(..\)  
\(see “Cheating\: Runtime Scope Modifications” in Chapter 1\). Such a  
function will automatically be run in non-strict-mode \(for legacy  
reasons\) when invoked with the normal \(\) function invocation as  
shown; its this will point at the global object. See the third book in  
the series, Objects & Classes, for more information on determining  
this bindings.  
So, we have window, self, global, and this ugly new  
Function\(..\) trick. That’s a lot of different ways to try to get at this  
global object. Each has its pros and cons.  
Why not introduce yet another!?!?  
82 As of ES2020, JS has finally defined a standardized reference to the  
global scope object, called globalThis. So, subject to the recency  
of the JS engines your code runs in, you can use globalThis in  
place of any of those other approaches.  
We could even attempt to define a cross-environment polyfill that’s  
safer across pre-globalThis JS environments, such as\:  
const theGlobalScopeObject =  
\(typeof globalThis !=  
"undefined"\) ? globalThis \:  
\(typeof global !=  
"undefined"\) ? global \:  
\(typeof window !=  
"undefined"\) ? window \:  
\(typeof self !=  
"undefined"\) ? self \:  
\(new Function\("return this"\)\)\(\);  
Phew! That’s certainly not ideal, but it works if you find yourself  
needing a reliable global scope reference.  
\(The proposed name globalThis was fairly controversial while the  
feature was being added to JS. Specifically, I and many others felt  
the “this” reference in its name was misleading, since the reason you  
reference this object is to access to the global scope, never to  
access some sort of global/default this binding. There were many  
other names considered, but for a variety of reasons ruled out.  
Unfortunately, the name chosen ended up as a last resort. If you  
plan to interact with the global scope object in your programs, to  
reduce confusion, I strongly recommend choosing a better name,  
such as \(the laughably long but accurate!\) theGlobalScopeObject  
used here.\)  
# Globally Aware  
83 The global scope is present and relevant in every JS program, even  
though modern patterns for organizing code into modules de-  
emphasizes much of the reliance on storing identifiers in that  
namespace.  
Still, as our code proliferates more and more beyond the confines of  
the browser, it’s especially important we have a solid grasp on the  
differences in how the global scope \(and global scope object!\)  
behave across different JS environments.  
With the big picture of global scope now sharper in focus, the next  
chapter again descends into the deeper details of lexical scope,  
examining how and when variables can be used.  
84 Chapter 5\: The \(Not So\) Secret  
# Lifecycle of Variables  
By now you should have a decent grasp of the nesting of scopes,  
from the global scope downward—called a program’s scope chain.  
But just knowing which scope a variable comes from is only part of  
the story. If a variable declaration appears past the first statement of  
a scope, how will any references to that identifier before the  
declaration behave? What happens if you try to declare the same  
variable twice in a scope?  
JS’s particular flavor of lexical scope is rich with nuance in how and  
when variables come into existence and become available to the  
program.  
# When Can I Use a Variable?  
At what point does a variable become available to use within its  
scope? There may seem to be an obvious answer\: after the variable  
has been declared/created. Right? Not quite.  
Consider\:  
greeting\(\);  
// Hello!  
function greeting\(\) \{  
85 console.log\("Hello!"\);  
\}  
This code works fine. You may have seen or even written code like it  
before. But did you ever wonder how or why it works? Specifically,  
why can you access the identifier greeting from line 1 \(to retrieve  
and execute a function reference\), even though the greeting\(\)  
function declaration doesn’t occur until line 4?  
Recall Chapter 1 points out that all identifiers are registered to their  
respective scopes during compile time. Moreover, every identifier is  
created at the beginning of the scope it belongs to, every time that  
scope is entered.  
The term most commonly used for a variable being visible from the  
beginning of its enclosing scope, even though its declaration may  
appear further down in the scope, is called hoisting.  
But hoisting alone doesn’t fully answer the question. We can see an  
identifier called greeting from the beginning of the scope, but why  
can we call the greeting\(\) function before it’s been declared?  
In other words, how does the variable greeting have any value \(the  
function reference\) assigned to it, from the moment the scope starts  
running? The answer is a special characteristic of formal function  
declarations, called function hoisting. When a function  
declaration’s name identifier is registered at the top of its scope, it’s  
additionally auto-initialized to that function’s reference. That’s why  
the function can be called throughout the entire scope!  
One key detail is that both function hoisting and var-flavored  
variable hoisting attach their name identifiers to the nearest  
86 enclosing function scope \(or, if none, the global scope\), not a block  
scope.  
NOTE\:  
Declarations with let and const still hoist \(see the TDZ discussion  
later in this chapter\). But these two declaration forms attach to their  
enclosing block rather than just an enclosing function as with var  
and function declarations. See “Scoping with Blocks” in Chapter 6  
for more information.  
Hoisting\: Declaration vs. Expression  
Function hoisting only applies to formal function declarations  
\(specifically those which appear outside of blocks—see “FiB” in  
Chapter 6\), not to function expression assignments. Consider\:  
greeting\(\);  
// TypeError  
var greeting = function greeting\(\) \{  
console.log\("Hello!"\);  
\};  
Line 1 \(greeting\(\);\) throws an error. But the kind of error thrown is  
very important to notice. A TypeError means we’re trying to do  
something with a value that is not allowed. Depending on your JS  
environment, the error message would say something like,  
“‘undefined’ is not a function,” or more helpfully, “‘greeting’ is not a  
function.”  
87 Notice that the error is not a ReferenceError. JS isn’t telling us that  
it couldn’t find greeting as an identifier in the scope. It’s telling us  
that greeting was found but doesn’t hold a function reference at  
that moment. Only functions can be invoked, so attempting to invoke  
some non-function value results in an error.  
But what does greeting hold, if not the function reference?  
In addition to being hoisted, variables declared with var are also  
automatically initialized to undefined at the beginning of their scope  
—again, the nearest enclosing function, or the global. Once  
initialized, they’re available to be used \(assigned to, retrieved from,  
etc.\) throughout the whole scope.  
So on that first line, greeting exists, but it holds only the default  
undefined value. It’s not until line 4 that greeting gets assigned the  
function reference.  
Pay close attention to the distinction here. A function declaration is  
hoisted and initialized to its function value \(again, called function  
hoisting\). A var variable is also hoisted, and then auto-initialized to  
undefined. Any subsequent function expression assignments to  
that variable don’t happen until that assignment is processed during  
runtime execution.  
In both cases, the name of the identifier is hoisted. But the function  
reference association isn’t handled at initialization time \(beginning of  
the scope\) unless the identifier was created in a formal function  
declaration.  
Variable Hoisting  
88 Let’s look at another example of variable hoisting\:  
greeting =  
"Hello!";  
console.log\(greeting\);  
// Hello!  
var greeting =  
"Howdy!";  
Though greeting isn’t declared until line 5, it’s available to be  
assigned to as early as line 1. Why?  
There’s two necessary parts to the explanation\:  
the identifier is hoisted,  
and it’s automatically initialized to the value undefined from the  
top of the scope.  
NOTE\:  
Using variable hoisting of this sort probably feels unnatural, and  
many readers might rightly want to avoid relying on it in their  
programs. But should all hoisting \(including function hoisting\) be  
avoided? We’ll explore these different perspectives on hoisting in  
more detail in Appendix A.  
# Hoisting\: Yet Another Metaphor  
Chapter 2 was full of metaphors \(to illustrate scope\), but here we are  
faced with yet another\: hoisting itself. Rather than hoisting being a  
concrete execution step the JS engine performs, it’s more useful to  
think of hoisting as a visualization of various actions JS takes in  
setting up the program before execution.  
89 The typical assertion of what hoisting means\: lifting—like lifting a  
heavy weight upward—any identifiers all the way to the top of a  
scope. The explanation often asserted is that the JS engine will  
actually rewrite that program before execution, so that it looks more  
like this\:  
var greeting; // hoisted declaration  
greeting =  
"Hello!"; // the original line 1  
console.log\(greeting\); // Hello!  
greeting =  
"Howdy!"; // \`  
var  
\` is gone!  
The hoisting \(metaphor\) proposes that JS pre-processes the original  
program and re-arranges it a bit, so that all the declarations have  
been moved to the top of their respective scopes, before execution.  
Moreover, the hoisting metaphor asserts that function declarations  
are, in their entirety, hoisted to the top of each scope. Consider\:  
studentName =  
greeting\(\);  
// Hello Suzy!  
"Suzy";  
function greeting\(\) \{  
console.log\(\`Hello \$\{ studentName \}!\`\);  
\}  
var studentName;  
The “rule” of the hoisting metaphor is that function declarations are  
hoisted first, then variables are hoisted immediately after all the  
functions. Thus, the hoisting story suggests that program is re-  
arranged by the JS engine to look like this\:  
90 function greeting\(\) \{  
console.log\(\`Hello \$\{ studentName \}!\`\);  
\}  
var studentName;  
studentName =  
"Suzy";  
greeting\(\);  
// Hello Suzy!  
This hoisting metaphor is convenient. Its benefit is allowing us to  
hand wave over the magical look-ahead pre-processing necessary to  
find all these declarations buried deep in scopes and somehow  
move \(hoist\) them to the top; we can just think about the program as  
if it’s executed by the JS engine in a single pass, top-down.  
Single-pass definitely seems more straightforward than Chapter 1’s  
assertion of a two-phase processing.  
Hoisting as a mechanism for re-ordering code may be an attractive  
simplification, but it’s not accurate. The JS engine doesn’t actually  
re-arrange the code. It can’t magically look ahead and find  
declarations; the only way to accurately find them, as well as all the  
scope boundaries in the program, would be to fully parse the code.  
Guess what parsing is? The first phase of the two-phase processing!  
There’s no magical mental gymnastics that gets around that fact.  
So if the hoisting metaphor is \(at best\) inaccurate, what should we  
do with the term? I think it’s still useful—indeed, even members of  
TC39 regularly use it!—but I don’t think we should claim it’s an actual  
re-arrangement of source code.  
91 WARNING\:  
Incorrect or incomplete mental models often still seem sufficient  
because they can occasionally lead to accidental right answers. But  
in the long run it’s harder to accurately analyze and predict  
outcomes if your thinking isn’t particularly aligned with how the JS  
engine works.  
I assert that hoisting should be used to refer to the compile-time  
operation of generating runtime instructions for the automatic  
registration of a variable at the beginning of its scope, each time that  
scope is entered.  
That’s a subtle but important shift, from hoisting as a runtime  
behavior to its proper place among compile-time tasks.  
# Re-declaration?  
What do you think happens when a variable is declared more than  
once in the same scope? Consider\:  
var studentName =  
"Frank";  
console.log\(studentName\);  
// Frank  
var studentName;  
console.log\(studentName\); // ???  
What do you expect to be printed for that second message? Many  
believe the second var studentName has re-declared the variable  
\(and thus “reset” it\), so they expect undefined to be printed.  
92 But is there such a thing as a variable being “re-declared” in the  
same scope? No.  
If you consider this program from the perspective of the hoisting  
metaphor, the code would be re-arranged like this for execution  
purposes\:  
var studentName;  
var studentName; studentName =  
"Frank";  
console.log\(studentName\);  
// Frank  
// clearly a pointless no-op!  
console.log\(studentName\);  
// Frank  
Since hoisting is actually about registering a variable at the  
beginning of a scope, there’s nothing to be done in the middle of the  
scope where the original program actually had the second var  
studentName statement. It’s just a no-op\(eration\), a pointless  
statement.  
TIP\:  
In the style of the conversation narrative from Chapter 2, Compiler  
would find the second var declaration statement and ask the Scope  
Manager if it had already seen a studentName identifier; since it  
had, there wouldn’t be anything else to do.  
It’s also important to point out that var studentName; doesn’t mean  
var studentName = undefined;, as most assume. Let’s prove  
93 they’re different by considering this variation of the program\:  
var studentName =  
"Frank";  
console.log\(studentName\); // Frank  
var studentName;  
console.log\(studentName\); // Frank \<--- still!  
// let's add the initialization explicitly  
var studentName = undefined;  
console.log\(studentName\); // undefined \<--- see!?  
See how the explicit = undefined initialization produces a different  
outcome than assuming it happens implicitly when omitted? In the  
next section, we’ll revisit this topic of initialization of variables from  
their declarations.  
A repeated var declaration of the same identifier name in a scope is  
effectively a do-nothing operation. Here’s another illustration, this  
time across a function of the same name\:  
var greeting;  
function greeting\(\) \{  
console.log\("Hello!"\);  
\}  
// basically, a no-op  
var greeting;  
typeof greeting; // "function"  
94 var greeting =  
"Hello!";  
typeof greeting; // "string"  
The first greeting declaration registers the identifier to the scope,  
and because it’s a var the auto-initialization will be undefined. The  
function declaration doesn’t need to re-register the identifier, but  
because of function hoisting it overrides the auto-initialization to use  
the function reference. The second var greeting by itself doesn’t  
do anything since greeting is already an identifier and function  
hoisting already took precedence for the auto-initialization.  
Actually assigning "Hello!" to greeting changes its value from the  
initial function greeting\(\) to the string; var itself doesn’t have any  
effect.  
What about repeating a declaration within a scope using let or  
const?  
let studentName =  
"Frank";  
console.log\(studentName\);  
let studentName =  
"Suzy";  
This program will not execute, but instead immediately throw a  
SyntaxError. Depending on your JS environment, the error  
message will indicate something like\: “studentName has already  
been declared.” In other words, this is a case where attempted “re-  
declaration” is explicitly not allowed!  
95 It’s not just that two declarations involving let will throw this error. If  
either declaration uses let, the other can be either let or var, and  
the error will still occur, as illustrated with these two variations\:  
var studentName =  
"Frank";  
let studentName =  
"Suzy";  
and\:  
let studentName =  
"Frank";  
var studentName =  
"Suzy";  
In both cases, a SyntaxError is thrown on the second declaration.  
In other words, the only way to “re-declare” a variable is to use var  
for all \(two or more\) of its declarations.  
But why disallow it? The reason for the error is not technical per se,  
as var “re-declaration” has always been allowed; clearly, the same  
allowance could have been made for let.  
It’s really more of a “social engineering” issue. “Re-declaration” of  
variables is seen by some, including many on the TC39 body, as a  
bad habit that can lead to program bugs. So when ES6 introduced  
let, they decided to prevent “re-declaration” with an error.  
NOTE\:  
This is of course a stylistic opinion, not really a technical argument.  
Many developers agree with the position, and that’s probably in part  
why TC39 included the error \(as well as let conforming to const\).  
96 NOTE\:  
But a reasonable case could have been made that staying  
consistent with var  
’s precedent was more prudent, and that such  
opinion-enforcement was best left to opt-in tooling like linters. In  
Appendix A, we’ll explore whether var \(and its associated behavior,  
like “re-declaration”\) can still be useful in modern JS.  
When Compiler asks Scope Manager about a declaration, if that  
identifier has already been declared, and if either/both declarations  
were made with let, an error is thrown. The intended signal to the  
developer is “Stop relying on sloppy re-declaration!”  
Constants?  
The const keyword is more constrained than let. Like let, const  
cannot be repeated with the same identifier in the same scope. But  
there’s actually an overriding technical reason why that sort of “re-  
declaration” is disallowed, unlike let which disallows “re-declaration”  
mostly for stylistic reasons.  
The const keyword requires a variable to be initialized, so omitting  
an assignment from the declaration results in a SyntaxError\:  
const empty; // SyntaxError  
const declarations create variables that cannot be re-assigned\:  
const studentName =  
"Frank";  
console.log\(studentName\);  
// Frank  
97 studentName =  
"Suzy"; // TypeError  
The studentName variable cannot be re-assigned because it’s  
declared with a const.  
WARNING\:  
The error thrown when re-assigning studentName is a TypeError,  
not a SyntaxError. The subtle distinction here is actually pretty  
important, but unfortunately far too easy to miss. Syntax errors  
represent faults in the program that stop it from even starting  
execution. Type errors represent faults that arise during program  
execution. In the preceding snippet, "Frank" is printed out before  
we process the re-assignment of studentName, which then throws  
the error.  
So if const declarations cannot be re-assigned, and const  
declarations always require assignments, then we have a clear  
technical reason why const must disallow any “re-declarations”\: any  
const “re-declaration” would also necessarily be a const re-  
assignment, which can’t be allowed!  
const studentName =  
"Frank";  
// obviously this must be an error  
const studentName =  
"Suzy";  
Since const “re-declaration” must be disallowed \(on those technical  
grounds\), TC39 essentially felt that let “re-declaration” should be  
disallowed as well, for consistency. It’s debatable if this was the best  
choice, but at least we have the reasoning behind the decision.  
98 Loops  
So it’s clear from our previous discussion that JS doesn’t really want  
us to “re-declare” our variables within the same scope. That probably  
seems like a straightforward admonition, until you consider what it  
means for repeated execution of declaration statements in loops.  
Consider\:  
var keepGoing = true;  
while \(keepGoing\) \{  
let value = Math.random\(\);  
if \(value \> 0.5\) \{  
keepGoing = false;  
\}  
\}  
Is value being “re-declared” repeatedly in this program? Will we get  
errors thrown? No.  
All the rules of scope \(including “re-declaration” of let-created  
variables\) are applied per scope instance. In other words, each time  
a scope is entered during execution, everything resets.  
Each loop iteration is its own new scope instance, and within each  
scope instance, value is only being declared once. So there’s no  
attempted “re-declaration,” and thus no error. Before we consider  
other loop forms, what if the value declaration in the previous  
snippet were changed to a var?  
var keepGoing = true;  
while \(keepGoing\) \{  
var value = Math.random\(\);  
99 if \(value \> 0.5\) \{  
keepGoing = false;  
\}  
\}  
Is value being “re-declared” here, especially since we know var  
allows it? No. Because var is not treated as a block-scoping  
declaration \(see Chapter 6\), it attaches itself to the global scope. So  
there’s just one value variable, in the same scope as keepGoing  
\(global scope, in this case\). No “re-declaration” here, either!  
One way to keep this all straight is to remember that var, let, and  
const keywords are effectively removed from the code by the time it  
starts to execute. They’re handled entirely by the compiler.  
If you mentally erase the declarator keywords and then try to  
process the code, it should help you decide if and when  
\(re-\)declarations might occur.  
What about “re-declaration” with other loop forms, like for-loops?  
for \(let i = 0; i \< 3; i++\) \{  
let value = i \* 10;  
console.log\(\`\$\{ i \}\: \$\{ value \}\`\);  
\}  
// 0\: 0  
// 1\: 10  
// 2\: 20  
It should be clear that there’s only one value declared per scope  
instance. But what about i? Is it being “re-declared”?  
100 To answer that, consider what scope i is in. It might seem like it  
would be in the outer \(in this case, global\) scope, but it’s not. It’s in  
the scope of for-loop body, just like value is. In fact, you could sorta  
think about that loop in this more verbose equivalent form\:  
\{  
// a fictional variable for illustration  
let \$\$i = 0;  
for \( /\* nothing \*/; \$\$i \< 3; \$\$i++\) \{  
// here's our actual loop  
\`i\`!  
let i = \$\$i;  
let value = i \* 10;  
console.log\(\`\$\{ i \}\: \$\{ value \}\`\);  
\}  
// 0\: 0  
// 1\: 10  
// 2\: 20  
\}  
Now it should be clear\: the i and value variables are both declared  
exactly once per scope instance. No “re-declaration” here.  
What about other for-loop forms?  
for \(let index in students\) \{  
// this is fine  
\}  
for \(let student of students\) \{  
101 // so is this  
\}  
Same thing with for..in and for..of loops\: the declared variable  
is treated as inside the loop body, and thus is handled per iteration  
\(aka, per scope instance\). No “re-declaration.”  
OK, I know you’re thinking that I sound like a broken record at this  
point. But let’s explore how const impacts these looping constructs.  
Consider\:  
var keepGoing = true;  
while \(keepGoing\) \{  
// ooo, a shiny constant!  
const value = Math.random\(\);  
if \(value \> 0.5\) \{  
keepGoing = false;  
\}  
\}  
Just like the let variant of this program we saw earlier, const is  
being run exactly once within each loop iteration, so it’s safe from  
“re-declaration” troubles. But things get more complicated when we  
talk about for-loops.  
for..in and for..of are fine to use with const\:  
for \(const index in students\) \{  
// this is fine  
\}  
for \(const student of students\) \{  
102 // this is also fine  
\}  
But not the general for-loop\:  
for \(const i = 0; i \< 3; i++\) \{  
// oops, this is going to fail with  
// a Type Error after the first iteration  
\}  
What’s wrong here? We could use let just fine in this construct, and  
we asserted that it creates a new i for each loop iteration scope, so  
it doesn’t even seem to be a “re-declaration.”  
Let’s mentally “expand” that loop like we did earlier\:  
\{  
// a fictional variable for illustration  
const \$\$i = 0;  
for \( ; \$\$i \< 3; \$\$i++\) \{  
// here's our actual loop  
const i = \$\$i;  
// ..  
\`i\`!  
\}  
\}  
Do you spot the problem? Our i is indeed just created once inside  
the loop. That’s not the problem. The problem is the conceptual \$\$i  
that must be incremented each time with the \$\$i++ expression.  
That’s re-assignment \(not “re-declaration”\), which isn’t allowed for  
constants.  
103 Remember, this “expanded” form is only a conceptual model to help  
you intuit the source of the problem. You might wonder if JS could  
have effectively made the const \$\$i = 0 instead into let \$ii = 0,  
which would then allow const to work with our classic for-loop? It’s  
possible, but then it could have introduced potentially surprising  
exceptions to for-loop semantics.  
For example, it would have been a rather arbitrary \(and likely  
confusing\) nuanced exception to allow i++ in the for-loop header to  
skirt strictness of the const assignment, but not allow other re-  
assignments of i inside the loop iteration, as is sometimes useful.  
The straightforward answer is\: const can’t be used with the classic  
for-loop form because of the required re-assignment.  
Interestingly, if you don’t do re-assignment, then it’s valid\:  
var keepGoing = true;  
for \(const i = 0; keepGoing; /\* nothing here \*/ \) \{  
keepGoing = \(Math.random\(\) \> 0.5\);  
// ..  
\}  
That works, but it’s pointless. There’s no reason to declare i in that  
position with a const, since the whole point of such a variable in that  
position is to be used for counting iterations. Just use a different  
loop form, like a while loop, or use a let!  
# Uninitialized Variables \(aka, TDZ\)  
104 With var declarations, the variable is “hoisted” to the top of its scope.  
But it’s also automatically initialized to the undefined value, so that  
the variable can be used throughout the entire scope.  
However, let and const declarations are not quite the same in this  
respect.  
Consider\:  
console.log\(studentName\);  
// ReferenceError  
let studentName =  
"Suzy";  
The result of this program is that a ReferenceError is thrown on the  
first line. Depending on your JS environment, the error message may  
say something like\: “Cannot access studentName before  
initialization.”  
NOTE\:  
The error message as seen here used to be much more vague or  
misleading. Thankfully, several of us in the community were  
successfully able to lobby for JS engines to improve this error  
message so it more accurately tells you what’s wrong!  
That error message is quite indicative of what’s wrong\: studentName  
exists on line 1, but it’s not been initialized, so it cannot be used yet.  
Let’s try this\:  
studentName =  
// ReferenceError  
"Suzy"; // let's try to initialize it!  
105 console.log\(studentName\);  
let studentName;  
Oops. We still get the ReferenceError, but now on the first line  
where we’re trying to assign to \(aka, initialize!\) this so-called  
“uninitialized” variable studentName. What’s the deal!?  
The real question is, how do we initialize an uninitialized variable?  
For let/const, the only way to do so is with an assignment  
attached to a declaration statement. An assignment by itself is  
insufficient! Consider\:  
let studentName =  
"Suzy";  
console.log\(studentName\); // Suzy  
Here, we are initializing the studentName \(in this case, to "Suzy"  
instead of undefined\) by way of the let declaration statement form  
that’s coupled with an assignment.  
Alternatively\:  
// ..  
let studentName;  
// or\:  
// let studentName = undefined;  
// ..  
studentName =  
"Suzy";  
106 console.log\(studentName\);  
// Suzy  
NOTE\:  
That’s interesting! Recall from earlier, we said that var  
studentName; is not the same as var studentName =  
undefined;, but here with let, they behave the same. The  
difference comes down to the fact that var studentName  
automatically initializes at the top of the scope, where let  
studentName does not.  
Remember that we’ve asserted a few times so far that Compiler  
ends up removing any var/let/const declarators, replacing them  
with the instructions at the top of each scope to register the  
appropriate identifiers.  
So if we analyze what’s going on here, we see that an additional  
nuance is that Compiler is also adding an instruction in the middle of  
the program, at the point where the variable studentName was  
declared, to handle that declaration’s auto-initialization. We cannot  
use the variable at any point prior to that initialization occuring. The  
same goes for const as it does for let.  
The term coined by TC39 to refer to this period of time from the  
entering of a scope to where the auto-initialization of the variable  
occurs is\: Temporal Dead Zone \(TDZ\).  
The TDZ is the time window where a variable exists but is still  
uninitialized, and therefore cannot be accessed in any way. Only the  
execution of the instructions left by Compiler at the point of the  
original declaration can do that initialization. After that moment, the  
107 TDZ is done, and the variable is free to be used for the rest of the  
scope.  
A var also has technically has a TDZ, but it’s zero in length and thus  
unobservable to our programs! Only let and const have an  
observable TDZ.  
By the way, “temporal” in TDZ does indeed refer to time not position  
in code. Consider\:  
askQuestion\(\);  
// ReferenceError  
let studentName =  
"Suzy";  
function askQuestion\(\) \{  
console.log\(\`\$\{ studentName \}, do you know?\`\);  
\}  
Even though positionally the console.log\(..\) referencing  
studentName comes after the let studentName declaration, timing  
wise the askQuestion\(\) function is invoked before the let  
statement is encountered, while studentName is still in its TDZ!  
Hence the error.  
There’s a common misconception that TDZ means let and const  
do not hoist. This is an inaccurate, or at least slightly misleading,  
claim. They definitely hoist.  
The actual difference is that let/const declarations do not  
automatically initialize at the beginning of the scope, the way var  
does. The debate then is if the auto-initialization is part of hoisting, or  
108 not? I think auto-registration of a variable at the top of the scope \(i.e.,  
what I call “hoisting”\) and auto-initialization at the top of the scope \(to  
undefined\) are distinct operations and shouldn’t be lumped together  
under the single term “hoisting.”  
We’ve already seen that let and const don’t auto-initialize at the  
top of the scope. But let’s prove that let and const do hoist \(auto-  
register at the top of the scope\), courtesy of our friend shadowing  
\(see “Shadowing” in Chapter 3\)\:  
var studentName =  
"Kyle";  
\{  
console.log\(studentName\);  
// ???  
// ..  
let studentName =  
"Suzy";  
console.log\(studentName\);  
// Suzy  
\}  
What’s going to happen with the first console.log\(..\) statement?  
If let studentName didn’t hoist to the top of the scope, then the first  
console.log\(..\) should print "Kyle", right? At that moment, it  
would seem, only the outer studentName exists, so that’s the  
variable console.log\(..\) should access and print.  
But instead, the first console.log\(..\) throws a TDZ error, because  
in fact, the inner scope’s studentName was hoisted \(auto-registered  
109 at the top of the scope\). What didn’t happen \(yet!\) was the auto-  
initialization of that inner studentName; it’s still uninitialized at that  
moment, hence the TDZ violation!  
So to summarize, TDZ errors occur because let/const declarations  
do hoist their declarations to the top of their scopes, but unlike var,  
they defer the auto-initialization of their variables until the moment in  
the code’s sequencing where the original declaration appeared. This  
window of time \(hint\: temporal\), whatever its length, is the TDZ.  
How can you avoid TDZ errors?  
My advice\: always put your let and const declarations at the top of  
any scope. Shrink the TDZ window to zero \(or near zero\) length, and  
then it’ll be moot.  
But why is TDZ even a thing? Why didn’t TC39 dictate that  
let/const auto-initialize the way var does? Just be patient, we’ll  
come back to explore the why of TDZ in Appendix A.  
# Finally Initialized  
Working with variables has much more nuance than it seems at first  
glance. Hoisting, \(re\)declaration, and the TDZ are common sources  
of confusion for developers, especially those who have worked in  
other languages before coming to JS. Before moving on, make sure  
your mental model is fully grounded on these aspects of JS scope  
and variables.  
Hoisting is generally cited as an explicit mechanism of the JS  
engine, but it’s really more a metaphor to describe the various ways  
JS handles variable declarations during compilation. But even as a  
110 metaphor, hoisting offers useful structure for thinking about the life-  
cycle of a variable—when it’s created, when it’s available to use,  
when it goes away.  
Declaration and re-declaration of variables tend to cause confusion  
when thought of as runtime operations. But if you shift to compile-  
time thinking for these operations, the quirks and shadows diminish.  
The TDZ \(temporal dead zone\) error is strange and frustrating when  
encountered. Fortunately, TDZ is relatively straightforward to avoid if  
you’re always careful to place let/const declarations at the top of  
any scope.  
As you successfully navigate these twists and turns of variable  
scope, the next chapter will lay out the factors that guide our  
decisions to place our declarations in various scopes, especially  
nested blocks.  
111 Chapter 6\: Limiting Scope  
# Exposure  
So far our focus has been explaining the mechanics of how scopes  
and variables work. With that foundation now firmly in place, our  
attention raises to a higher level of thinking\: decisions and patterns  
we apply across the whole program.  
To begin, we’re going to look at how and why we should be using  
different levels of scope \(functions and blocks\) to organize our  
program’s variables, specifically to reduce scope over-exposure.  
# Least Exposure  
It makes sense that functions define their own scopes. But why do  
we need blocks to create scopes as well?  
Software engineering articulates a fundamental discipline, typically  
applied to software security, called “The Principle of Least Privilege”  
\(POLP\). 1 And a variation of this principle that applies to our current  
discussion is typically labeled as “Least Exposure” \(POLE\).  
POLP expresses a defensive posture to software architecture\:  
components of the system should be designed to function with least  
privilege, least access, least exposure. If each piece is connected  
with minimum-necessary capabilities, the overall system is stronger  
from a security standpoint, because a compromise or failure of one  
piece has a minimized impact on the rest of the system.  
112 If POLP focuses on system-level component design, the POLE  
Exposure variant focuses on a lower level; we’ll apply it to how  
scopes interact with each other.  
In following POLE, what do we want to minimize the exposure of?  
Simply\: the variables registered in each scope.  
Think of it this way\: why shouldn’t you just place all the variables of  
your program out in the global scope? That probably immediately  
feels like a bad idea, but it’s worth considering why that is. When  
variables used by one part of the program are exposed to another  
part of the program, via scope, there are three main hazards that  
often arise\:  
Naming Collisions\: if you use a common and useful  
variable/function name in two different parts of the program, but  
the identifier comes from one shared scope \(like the global  
scope\), then name collision occurs, and it’s very likely that bugs  
will occur as one part uses the variable/function in a way the  
other part doesn’t expect.  
For example, imagine if all your loops used a single global i  
index variable, and then it happens that one loop in a function is  
running during an iteration of a loop from another function, and  
now the shared i variable gets an unexpected value.  
Unexpected Behavior\: if you expose variables/functions whose  
usage is otherwise private to a piece of the program, it allows  
other developers to use them in ways you didn’t intend, which  
can violate expected behavior and cause bugs.  
113 For example, if your part of the program assumes an array  
contains all numbers, but someone else’s code accesses and  
modifies the array to include booleans and strings, your code  
may then misbehave in unexpected ways.  
Worse, exposure of private details invites those with mal-intent  
to try to work around limitations you have imposed, to do things  
with your part of the software that shouldn’t be allowed.  
Unintended Dependency\: if you expose variables/functions  
unnecessarily, it invites other developers to use and depend on  
those otherwise private pieces. While that doesn’t break your  
program today, it creates a refactoring hazard in the future,  
because now you cannot as easily refactor that variable or  
function without potentially breaking other parts of the software  
that you don’t control.  
For example, if your code relies on an array of numbers, and  
you later decide it’s better to use some other data structure  
instead of an array, you now must take on the liability of  
adjusting other affected parts of the software.  
POLE, as applied to variable/function scoping, essentially says,  
default to exposing the bare minimum necessary, keeping everything  
else as private as possible. Declare variables in as small and deeply  
nested of scopes as possible, rather than placing everything in the  
global \(or even outer function\) scope.  
If you design your software accordingly, you have a much greater  
chance of avoiding \(or at least minimizing\) these three hazards.  
Consider\:  
114 function diff\(x,y\) \{  
if \(x \> y\) \{  
let tmp = x;  
x = y;  
y = tmp;  
\}  
return y - x;  
\}  
diff\(3,7\); // 4  
diff\(7,5\); // 2  
In this diff\(..\) function, we want to ensure that y is greater than or  
equal to x, so that when we subtract \(y - x\), the result is 0 or larger.  
If x is initially larger \(the result would be negative!\), we swap x and y  
using a tmp variable, to keep the result positive.  
In this simple example, it doesn’t seem to matter whether tmp is  
inside the if block or whether it belongs at the function level—it  
certainly shouldn’t be a global variable! However, following the POLE  
principle, tmp should be as hidden in scope as possible. So we block  
scope tmp \(using let\) to the if block.  
# Hiding in Plain \(Function\) Scope  
It should now be clear why it’s important to hide our variable and  
function declarations in the lowest \(most deeply nested\) scopes  
possible. But how do we do so?  
115 We’ve already seen the let and const keywords, which are block  
scoped declarators; we’ll come back to them in more detail shortly.  
But first, what about hiding var or function declarations in scopes?  
That can easily be done by wrapping a function scope around a  
declaration.  
Let’s consider an example where function scoping can be useful.  
The mathematical operation “factorial” \(notated as “6!”\) is the  
multiplication of a given integer against all successively lower  
integers down to 1—actually, you can stop at 2 since multiplying 1  
does nothing. In other words, “6!” is the same as “6 \* 5!”, which is the  
same as “6 \* 5 \* 4!”, and so on. Because of the nature of the math  
involved, once any given integer’s factorial \(like “4!”\) has been  
calculated, we shouldn’t need to do that work again, as it’ll always be  
the same answer.  
So if you naively calculate factorial for 6, then later want to calculate  
factorial for 7, you might unnecessarily re-calculate the factorials of  
all the integers from 2 up to 6. If you’re willing to trade memory for  
speed, you can solve that wasted computation by caching each  
integer’s factorial as it’s calculated\:  
var cache = \{\};  
function factorial\(x\) \{  
if \(x \< 2\) return 1;  
if \(!\(x in cache\)\) \{  
cache\[x\] = x \* factorial\(x - 1\);  
\}  
return cache\[x\];  
\}  
116 factorial\(6\);  
// 720  
cache;  
// \{  
// "2"\: 2,  
// "3"\: 6,  
// "4"\: 24,  
// "5"\: 120,  
// "6"\: 720  
// \}  
factorial\(7\);  
// 5040  
We’re storing all the computed factorials in cache so that across  
multiple calls to factorial\(..\), the previous computations remain.  
But the cache variable is pretty obviously a private detail of how  
factorial\(..\) works, not something that should be exposed in an  
outer scope—especially not the global scope.  
NOTE\:  
factorial\(..\) here is recursive—a call to itself is made from  
inside—but that’s just for brevity of code sake; a non-recursive  
implementation would yield the same scoping analysis with respect  
to cache.  
However, fixing this over-exposure issue is not as simple as hiding  
the cache variable inside factorial\(..\), as it might seem. Since  
we need cache to survive multiple calls, it must be located in a  
scope outside that function. So what can we do?  
117 Define another middle scope \(between the outer/global scope and  
the inside of factorial\(..\)\) for cache to be located\:  
// outer/global scope  
function hideTheCache\(\) \{  
// "middle scope"  
var cache = \{\};  
, where we hide  
\`  
cache  
\`  
return factorial;  
// \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
function factorial\(x\) \{  
// inner scope  
if \(x \< 2\) return 1;  
if \(!\(x in cache\)\) \{  
cache\[x\] = x \* factorial\(x - 1\);  
\}  
return cache\[x\];  
\}  
\}  
var factorial = hideTheCache\(\);  
factorial\(6\);  
// 720  
factorial\(7\);  
// 5040  
118 The hideTheCache\(\) function serves no other purpose than to  
create a scope for cache to persist in across multiple calls to  
factorial\(..\). But for factorial\(..\) to have access to cache,  
we have to define factorial\(..\) inside that same scope. Then we  
return the function reference, as a value from hideTheCache\(\), and  
store it in an outer scope variable, also named factorial. Now as  
we call factorial\(..\) \(multiple times!\), its persistent cache stays  
hidden yet accessible only to factorial\(..\)!  
OK, but… it’s going to be tedious to define \(and name!\) a  
hideTheCache\(..\) function scope each time such a need for  
variable/function hiding occurs, especially since we’ll likely want to  
avoid name collisions with this function by giving each occurrence a  
unique name. Ugh.  
NOTE\:  
The illustrated technique—caching a function’s computed output to  
optimize performance when repeated calls of the same inputs are  
expected—is quite common in the Functional Programming \(FP\)  
world, canonically referred to as “memoization”; this caching relies  
on closure \(see Chapter 7\). Also, there are memory usage concerns  
\(addressed in “A Word About Memory” in Appendix B\). FP libraries  
will usually provide an optimized and vetted utility for memoization  
of functions, which would take the place of hideTheCache\(..\) here.  
Memoization is beyond the scope \(pun intended!\) of our discussion,  
but see my Functional-Light JavaScript book for more information.  
Rather than defining a new and uniquely named function each time  
one of those scope-only-for-the-purpose-of-hiding-a-variable  
situations occurs, a perhaps better solution is to use a function  
expression\:  
119 var factorial = \(function hideTheCache\(\) \{  
var cache = \{\};  
function factorial\(x\) \{  
if \(x \< 2\) return 1;  
if \(!\(x in cache\)\) \{  
cache\[x\] = x \* factorial\(x - 1\);  
\}  
return cache\[x\];  
\}  
return factorial;  
\}\)\(\);  
factorial\(6\);  
// 720  
factorial\(7\);  
// 5040  
Wait! This is still using a function to create the scope for hiding  
cache, and in this case, the function is still named hideTheCache, so  
how does that solve anything?  
Recall from “Function Name Scope” \(in Chapter 3\), what happens to  
the name identifier from a function expression. Since  
hideTheCache\(..\) is defined as a function expression instead of a  
function declaration, its name is in its own scope—essentially the  
same scope as cache—rather than in the outer/global scope.  
That means we can name every single occurrence of such a function  
expression the exact same name, and never have any collision.  
120 More appropriately, we can name each occurrence semantically  
based on whatever it is we’re trying to hide, and not worry that  
whatever name we choose is going to collide with any other  
function expression scope in the program.  
In fact, we could just leave off the name entirely—thus defining an  
“anonymous function expression” instead. But Appendix A will  
discuss the importance of names even for such scope-only  
functions.  
Invoking Function Expressions Immediately  
There’s another important bit in the previous factorial recursive  
program that’s easy to miss\: the line at the end of the function  
expression that contains \}\)\(\);.  
Notice that we surrounded the entire function expression in a set of  
\( .. \), and then on the end, we added that second \(\) parentheses  
set; that’s actually calling the function expression we just defined.  
Moreover, in this case, the first set of surrounding \( .. \) around the  
function expression is not strictly necessary \(more on that in a  
moment\), but we used them for readability sake anyway.  
So, in other words, we’re defining a function expression that’s then  
immediately invoked. This common pattern has a \(very creative!\)  
name\: Immediately Invoked Function Expression \(IIFE\).  
An IIFE is useful when we want to create a scope to hide  
variables/functions. Since it’s an expression, it can be used in any  
place in a JS program where an expression is allowed. An IIFE can  
be named, as with hideTheCache\(\), or \(much more commonly!\)  
unnamed/anonymous. And it can be standalone or, as before, part of  
121 another statement—hideTheCache\(\) returns the factorial\(\)  
function reference which is then = assigned to the variable  
factorial.  
For comparison, here’s an example of a standalone IIFE\:  
// outer scope  
\(function\(\)\{  
// inner hidden scope  
\}\)\(\);  
// more outer scope  
Unlike earlier with hideTheCache\(\), where the outer surrounding  
\(..\) were noted as being an optional stylistic choice, for a  
standalone IIFE they’re required; they distinguish the function as  
an expression, not a statement. For consistency, however, always  
surround an IIFE function with \( .. \).  
NOTE\:  
Technically, the surrounding \( .. \) aren’t the only syntactic way to  
ensure the function in an IIFE is treated by the JS parser as a  
function expression. We’ll look at some other options in Appendix A.  
Function Boundaries  
Beware that using an IIFE to define a scope can have some  
unintended consequences, depending on the code around it.  
Because an IIFE is a full function, the function boundary alters the  
behavior of certain statements/constructs.  
122 For example, a return statement in some piece of code would  
change its meaning if an IIFE is wrapped around it, because now the  
return would refer to the IIFE’s function. Non-arrow function IIFEs  
also change the binding of a this keyword—more on that in the  
Objects & Classes book. And statements like break and continue  
won’t operate across an IIFE function boundary to control an outer  
loop or block.  
So, if the code you need to wrap a scope around has return, this,  
break, or continue in it, an IIFE is probably not the best approach.  
In that case, you might look to create the scope with a block instead  
of a function.  
# Scoping with Blocks  
You should by this point feel fairly comfortable with the merits of  
creating scopes to limit identifier exposure.  
So far, we looked at doing this via function \(i.e., IIFE\) scope. But  
let’s now consider using let declarations with nested blocks. In  
general, any \{ .. \} curly-brace pair which is a statement will act as  
a block, but not necessarily as a scope.  
A block only becomes a scope if necessary, to contain its block-  
scoped declarations \(i.e., let or const\). Consider\:  
\{  
// not necessarily a scope \(yet\)  
// ..  
// now we know the block needs to be a scope  
123 let thisIsNowAScope = true;  
for \(let i = 0; i \< 5; i++\) \{  
// this is also a scope, activated each  
// iteration  
if \(i % 2 == 0\) \{  
// this is just a block, not a scope  
console.log\(i\);  
\}  
\}  
\}  
// 0 2 4  
Not all \{ .. \} curly-brace pairs create blocks \(and thus are eligible  
to become scopes\)\:  
Object literals use \{ .. \} curly-brace pairs to delimit their key-  
value lists, but such object values are not scopes.  
class uses \{ .. \} curly-braces around its body definition, but  
this is not a block or scope.  
A function uses \{ .. \} around its body, but this is not  
technically a block—it’s a single statement for the function body.  
It is, however, a \(function\) scope.  
The \{ .. \} curly-brace pair on a switch statement \(around the  
set of case clauses\) does not define a block/scope.  
Other than such non-block examples, a \{ .. \} curly-brace pair can  
define a block attached to a statement \(like an if or for\), or stand  
alone by itself—see the outermost \{ .. \} curly brace pair in the  
previous snippet. An explicit block of this sort—if it has no  
124 declarations, it’s not actually a scope—serves no operational  
purpose, though it can still be useful as a semantic signal.  
Explicit standalone \{ .. \} blocks have always been valid JS syntax,  
but since they couldn’t be a scope prior to ES6’s let/const, they are  
quite rare. However, post ES6, they’re starting to catch on a little bit.  
In most languages that support block scoping, an explicit block  
scope is an extremely common pattern for creating a narrow slice of  
scope for one or a few variables. So following the POLE principle,  
we should embrace this pattern more widespread in JS as well; use  
\(explicit\) block scoping to narrow the exposure of identifiers to the  
minimum practical.  
An explicit block scope can be useful even inside of another block  
\(whether the outer block is a scope or not\).  
For example\:  
if \(somethingHappened\) \{  
// this is a block, but not a scope  
\{  
// this is both a block and an  
// explicit scope  
let msg = somethingHappened.message\(\);  
notifyOthers\(msg\);  
\}  
// ..  
125 recoverFromSomething\(\);  
\}  
Here, the \{ .. \} curly-brace pair inside the if statement is an even  
smaller inner explicit block scope for msg, since that variable is not  
needed for the entire if block. Most developers would just block-  
scope msg to the if block and move on. And to be fair, when there’s  
only a few lines to consider, it’s a toss-up judgement call. But as  
code grows, these over-exposure issues become more pronounced.  
So does it matter enough to add the extra \{ .. \} pair and  
indentation level? I think you should follow POLE and always \(within  
reason!\) define the smallest block for each variable. So I recommend  
using the extra explicit block scope as shown.  
Recall the discussion of TDZ errors from “Uninitialized Variables  
\(TDZ\)” \(Chapter 5\). My suggestion there was\: to minimize the risk of  
TDZ errors with let/const declarations, always put those  
declarations at the top of their scope.  
If you find yourself placing a let declaration in the middle of a  
scope, first think, “Oh, no! TDZ alert!” If this let declaration isn’t  
needed in the first half of that block, you should use an inner explicit  
block scope to further narrow its exposure!  
Another example with an explicit block scope\:  
function getNextMonthStart\(dateStr\) \{  
var nextMonth, year;  
\{  
let curMonth;  
126 \[ , year, curMonth \] = dateStr.match\(  
/\(\\d\{4\}\)-\(\\d\{2\}\)-\\d\{2\}/  
\) || \[\];  
nextMonth = \(Number\(curMonth\) % 12\) + 1;  
\}  
if \(nextMonth == 1\) \{  
year++;  
\}  
return  
\}-01\`  
\`\$\{ year \}-\$\{  
String\(nextMonth\).padStart\(2,  
"0"\)  
;  
\}  
getNextMonthStart\("2019-12-25"\); // 2020-01-01  
Let’s first identify the scopes and their identifiers\:  
1\. The outer/global scope has one identifier, the function  
getNextMonthStart\(..\).  
2\. The function scope for getNextMonthStart\(..\) has three\:  
dateStr \(parameter\), nextMonth, and year.  
3\. The \{ .. \} curly-brace pair defines an inner block scope that  
includes one variable\: curMonth.  
So why put curMonth in an explicit block scope instead of just  
alongside nextMonth and year in the top-level function scope?  
Because curMonth is only needed for those first two statements; at  
the function scope level it’s over-exposed.  
127 This example is small, so the hazards of over-exposing curMonth  
are pretty limited. But the benefits of the POLE principle are best  
achieved when you adopt the mindset of minimizing scope exposure  
by default, as a habit. If you follow the principle consistently even in  
the small cases, it will serve you more as your programs grow.  
Let’s now look at an even more substantial example\:  
function sortNamesByLength\(names\) \{  
var buckets = \[\];  
for \(let firstName of names\) \{  
if \(buckets\[firstName.length\] == null\) \{  
buckets\[firstName.length\] = \[\];  
\}  
buckets\[firstName.length\].push\(firstName\);  
\}  
// a block to narrow the scope  
\{  
let sortedNames = \[\];  
for \(let bucket of buckets\) \{  
if \(bucket\) \{  
// sort each bucket alphanumerically  
bucket.sort\(\);  
// append the sorted names to our  
// running list  
sortedNames = \[  
...sortedNames,  
...bucket  
\];  
128 \}  
\}  
return sortedNames;  
\}  
\}  
sortNamesByLength\(\[  
"Sally"  
,  
"Suzy"  
,  
"Frank"  
,  
"John"  
,  
"Jennifer"  
,  
"Scott"  
\]\);  
// \[ "John"  
,  
// "Scott"  
,  
"Suzy"  
,  
"Frank"  
"Jennifer" \]  
,  
"Sally"  
,  
There are six identifiers declared across five different scopes. Could  
all of these variables have existed in the single outer/global scope?  
Technically, yes, since they’re all uniquely named and thus have no  
name collisions. But this would be really poor code organization, and  
would likely lead to both confusion and future bugs.  
We split them out into each inner nested scope as appropriate. Each  
variable is defined at the innermost scope possible for the program  
to operate as desired.  
sortedNames could have been defined in the top-level function  
scope, but it’s only needed for the second half of this function. To  
avoid over-exposing that variable in a higher level scope, we again  
follow POLE and block-scope it in the inner explicit block scope.  
129 var and let  
Next, let’s talk about the declaration var buckets. That variable is  
used across the entire function \(except the final return statement\).  
Any variable that is needed across all \(or even most\) of a function  
should be declared so that such usage is obvious.  
NOTE\:  
The parameter names isn’t used across the whole function, but  
there’s no way limit the scope of a parameter, so it behaves as a  
function-wide declaration regardless.  
So why did we use var instead of let to declare the buckets  
variable? There’s both semantic and technical reasons to choose  
var here.  
Stylistically, var has always, from the earliest days of JS, signaled  
“variable that belongs to a whole function.” As we asserted in  
“Lexical Scope” \(Chapter 1\), var attaches to the nearest enclosing  
function scope, no matter where it appears. That’s true even if var  
appears inside a block\:  
function diff\(x,y\) \{  
if \(x \> y\) \{  
var tmp = x; x = y;  
y = tmp;  
// \`tmp  
\` is function-scoped  
\}  
return y - x;  
\}  
130 Even though var is inside a block, its declaration is function-scoped  
\(to diff\(..\)\), not block-scoped.  
While you can declare var inside a block \(and still have it be  
function-scoped\), I would recommend against this approach except  
in a few specific cases \(discussed in Appendix A\). Otherwise, var  
should be reserved for use in the top-level scope of a function.  
Why not just use let in that same location? Because var is visually  
distinct from let and therefore signals clearly, “this variable is  
function-scoped.” Using let in the top-level scope, especially if not  
in the first few lines of a function, and when all the other declarations  
in blocks use let, does not visually draw attention to the difference  
with the function-scoped declaration.  
In other words, I feel var better communicates function-scoped than  
let does, and let both communicates \(and achieves!\) block-  
scoping where var is insufficient. As long as your programs are  
going to need both function-scoped and block-scoped variables, the  
most sensible and readable approach is to use both var and let  
together, each for their own best purpose.  
There are other semantic and operational reasons to choose var or  
let in different scenarios. We’ll explore the case for var and let in  
more detail in Appendix A.  
WARNING\:  
My recommendation to use both var and let is clearly controversial  
and contradicts the majority. It’s far more common to hear  
assertions like, “var is broken, let fixes it” and, “never use var, let is  
the replacement.” Those opinions are valid, but they’re merely  
opinions, just like mine. var is not factually broken or deprecated; it  
131 WARNING\:  
is around.  
has worked since early JS and it will continue to work as long as JS  
Where To let?  
My advice to reserve var for \(mostly\) only a top-level function scope  
means that most other declarations should use let. But you may still  
be wondering how to decide where each declaration in your program  
belongs?  
POLE already guides you on those decisions, but let’s make sure we  
explicitly state it. The way to decide is not based on which keyword  
you want to use. The way to decide is to ask, “What is the most  
minimal scope exposure that’s sufficient for this variable?”  
Once that is answered, you’ll know if a variable belongs in a block  
scope or the function scope. If you decide initially that a variable  
should be block-scoped, and later realize it needs to be elevated to  
be function-scoped, then that dictates a change not only in the  
location of that variable’s declaration, but also the declarator  
keyword used. The decision-making process really should proceed  
like that.  
If a declaration belongs in a block scope, use let. If it belongs in the  
function scope, use var \(again, just my opinion\).  
But another way to sort of visualize this decision making is to  
consider the pre-ES6 version of a program. For example, let’s recall  
diff\(..\) from earlier\:  
132 function diff\(x,y\) \{  
var tmp;  
if \(x \> y\) \{  
tmp = x;  
x = y;  
y = tmp;  
\}  
return y - x;  
\}  
In this version of diff\(..\), tmp is clearly declared in the function  
scope. Is that appropriate for tmp? I would argue, no. tmp is only  
needed for those few statements. It’s not needed for the return  
statement. It should therefore be block-scoped.  
Prior to ES6, we didn’t have let so we couldn’t actually block-scope  
it. But we could do the next-best thing in signaling our intent\:  
function diff\(x,y\) \{  
if \(x \> y\) \{  
// \`tmp  
\` is still function-scoped, but  
// the placement here semantically  
// signals block-scoping  
var tmp = x;  
x = y;  
y = tmp;  
\}  
return y - x;  
\}  
133 Placing the var declaration for tmp inside the if statement signals to  
the reader of the code that tmp belongs to that block. Even though  
JS doesn’t enforce that scoping, the semantic signal still has benefit  
for the reader of your code.  
Following this perspective, you can find any var that’s inside a block  
of this sort and switch it to let to enforce the semantic signal already  
being sent. That’s proper usage of let in my opinion.  
Another example that was historically based on var but which should  
now pretty much always use let is the for loop\:  
for \(var i = 0; i \< 5; i++\) \{  
// do something  
\}  
No matter where such a loop is defined, the i should basically  
always be used only inside the loop, in which case POLE dictates it  
should be declared with let instead of var\:  
for \(let i = 0; i \< 5; i++\) \{  
// do something  
\}  
Almost the only case where switching a var to a let in this way  
would “break” your code is if you were relying on accessing the  
loop’s iterator \(i\) outside/after the loop, such as\:  
for \(var i = 0; i \< 5; i++\) \{  
if \(checkValue\(i\)\) \{  
break;  
134 \}  
\}  
if \(i \< 5\) \{  
console.log\("The loop stopped early!"\);  
\}  
This usage pattern is not terribly uncommon, but most feel it smells  
like poor code structure. A preferable approach is to use another  
outer-scoped variable for that purpose\:  
var lastI;  
for \(let i = 0; i \< 5; i++\) \{  
lastI = i;  
if \(checkValue\(i\)\) \{  
break;  
\}  
\}  
if \(lastI \< 5\) \{  
console.log\("The loop stopped early!"\);  
\}  
lastI is needed across this whole scope, so it’s declared with var. i  
is only needed in \(each\) loop iteration, so it’s declared with let.  
What’s the Catch?  
So far we’ve asserted that var and parameters are function-scoped,  
and let/const signal block-scoped declarations. There’s one little  
exception to call out\: the catch clause.  
135 Since the introduction of try..catch back in ES3 \(in 1999\), the  
catch clause has used an additional \(little-known\) block-scoping  
declaration capability\:  
try \{  
doesntExist\(\);  
\}  
catch \(err\) \{  
console.log\(err\);  
// ReferenceError\: 'doesntExist' is not defined  
// \^\^\^\^ message printed from the caught exception  
let onlyHere = true;  
var outerVariable = true;  
\}  
console.log\(outerVariable\); // true  
console.log\(err\);  
// ReferenceError\: 'err' is not defined  
// \^\^\^\^ this is another thrown \(uncaught\) exception  
The err variable declared by the catch clause is block-scoped to  
that block. This catch clause block can hold other block-scoped  
declarations via let. But a var declaration inside this block still  
attaches to the outer function/global scope.  
ES2019 \(recently, at the time of writing\) changed catch clauses so  
their declaration is optional; if the declaration is omitted, the catch  
block is no longer \(by default\) a scope; it’s still a block, though!  
136 So if you need to react to the condition that an exception occurred  
\(so you can gracefully recover\), but you don’t care about the error  
value itself, you can omit the catch declaration\:  
try \{  
doOptionOne\(\);  
\}  
catch \{ // catch-declaration omitted  
doOptionTwoInstead\(\);  
\}  
This is a small but delightful simplification of syntax for a fairly  
common use case, and may also be slightly more performant in  
removing an unnecessary scope!  
# Function Declarations in Blocks \(FiB\)  
We’ve seen now that declarations using let or const are block-  
scoped, and var declarations are function-scoped. So what about  
function declarations that appear directly inside blocks? As a  
feature, this is called “FiB.”  
We typically think of function declarations like they’re the  
equivalent of a var declaration. So are they function-scoped like var  
is?  
No and yes. I know… that’s confusing. Let’s dig in\:  
if \(false\) \{  
function ask\(\) \{  
console.log\("Does this run?"\);  
137 \}  
\}  
ask\(\);  
What do you expect for this program to do? Three reasonable  
outcomes\:  
1\. The ask\(\) call might fail with a ReferenceError exception,  
because the ask identifier is block-scoped to the if block scope  
and thus isn’t available in the outer/global scope.  
2\. The ask\(\) call might fail with a TypeError exception, because  
the ask identifier exists, but it’s undefined \(since the if  
statement doesn’t run\) and thus not a callable function.  
3\. The ask\(\) call might run correctly, printing out the “Does it run?”  
message.  
Here’s the confusing part\: depending on which JS environment you  
try that code snippet in, you may get different results! This is one of  
those few crazy areas where existing legacy behavior betrays a  
predictable outcome.  
The JS specification says that function declarations inside of  
blocks are block-scoped, so the answer should be \(1\). However,  
most browser-based JS engines \(including v8, which comes from  
Chrome but is also used in Node\) will behave as \(2\), meaning the  
identifier is scoped outside the if block but the function value is not  
automatically initialized, so it remains undefined.  
Why are browser JS engines allowed to behave contrary to the  
specification? Because these engines already had certain behaviors  
138 around FiB before ES6 introduced block scoping, and there was  
concern that changing to adhere to the specification might break  
some existing website JS code. As such, an exception was made in  
Appendix B of the JS specification, which allows certain deviations  
for browser JS engines \(only!\).  
NOTE\:  
You wouldn’t typically categorize Node as a browser JS  
environment, since it usually runs on a server. But Node’s v8 engine  
is shared with Chrome \(and Edge\) browsers. Since v8 is first a  
browser JS engine, it adopts this Appendix B exception, which then  
means that the browser exceptions are extended to Node.  
One of the most common use cases for placing a function  
declaration in a block is to conditionally define a function one way or  
another \(like with an if..else statement\) depending on some  
environment state. For example\:  
if \(typeof Array.isArray !=  
function isArray\(a\) \{  
return Array.isArray\(a\);  
"undefined"\) \{  
\}  
\}  
else \{  
function isArray\(a\) \{  
return Object.prototype.toString.call\(a\)  
==  
"\[object Array\]";  
\}  
\}  
139 It’s tempting to structure code this way for performance reasons,  
since the typeof Array.isArray check is only performed once, as  
opposed to defining just one isArray\(..\) and putting the if  
statement inside it—the check would then run unnecessarily on  
every call.  
WARNING\:  
In addition to the risks of FiB deviations, another problem with  
conditional-definition of functions is it’s harder to debug such a  
program. If you end up with a bug in the isArray\(..\) function, you  
first have to figure out which isArray\(..\) implementation is  
actually running! Sometimes, the bug is that the wrong one was  
applied because the conditional check was incorrect! If you define  
multiple versions of a function, that program is always harder to  
reason about and maintain.  
In addition to the previous snippets, several other FiB corner cases  
are lurking; such behaviors in various browsers and non-browser JS  
environments \(JS engines that aren’t browser based\) will likely vary.  
For example\:  
if \(true\) \{  
function ask\(\) \{  
console.log\("Am I called?"\);  
\}  
\}  
if \(true\) \{  
function ask\(\) \{  
console.log\("Or what about me?"\);  
\}  
140 \}  
for \(let i = 0; i \< 5; i++\) \{  
function ask\(\) \{  
console.log\("Or is it one of these?"\);  
\}  
\}  
ask\(\);  
function ask\(\) \{  
console.log\("Wait, maybe, it's this one?"\);  
\}  
Recall that function hoisting as described in “When Can I Use a  
Variable?” \(in Chapter 5\) might suggest that the final ask\(\) in this  
snippet, with “Wait, maybe…” as its message, would hoist above the  
call to ask\(\). Since it’s the last function declaration of that name, it  
should “win,” right? Unfortunately, no.  
It’s not my intention to document all these weird corner cases, nor to  
try to explain why each of them behaves a certain way. That  
information is, in my opinion, arcane legacy trivia.  
My real concern with FiB is, what advice can I give to ensure your  
code behaves predictably in all circumstances?  
As far as I’m concerned, the only practical answer to avoiding the  
vagaries of FiB is to simply avoid FiB entirely. In other words, never  
place a function declaration directly inside any block. Always place  
function declarations anywhere in the top-level scope of a function  
\(or in the global scope\).  
141 So for the earlier if..else example, my suggestion is to avoid  
conditionally defining functions if at all possible. Yes, it may be  
slightly less performant, but this is the better overall approach\:  
function isArray\(a\) \{  
if \(typeof Array.isArray !=  
return Array.isArray\(a\);  
"undefined"\) \{  
\}  
else \{  
return Object.prototype.toString.call\(a\)  
==  
"\[object Array\]";  
\}  
\}  
If that performance hit becomes a critical path issue for your  
application, I suggest you consider this approach\:  
var isArray = function isArray\(a\) \{  
return Array.isArray\(a\);  
\};  
// override the definition, if you must  
if \(typeof Array.isArray ==  
"undefined"\) \{  
isArray = function isArray\(a\) \{  
return Object.prototype.toString.call\(a\)  
==  
"\[object Array\]";  
\};  
\}  
It’s important to notice that here I’m placing a function expression,  
not a declaration, inside the if statement. That’s perfectly fine and  
valid, for function expressions to appear inside blocks. Our  
142 discussion about FiB is about avoiding function declarations in  
blocks.  
Even if you test your program and it works correctly, the small benefit  
you may derive from using FiB style in your code is far outweighed  
by the potential risks in the future for confusion by other developers,  
or variances in how your code runs in other JS environments.  
FiB is not worth it, and should be avoided.  
# Blocked Over  
The point of lexical scoping rules in a programming language is so  
we can appropriately organize our program’s variables, both for  
operational as well as semantic code communication purposes.  
And one of the most important organizational techniques is to ensure  
that no variable is over-exposed to unnecessary scopes \(POLE\).  
Hopefully you now appreciate block scoping much more deeply than  
before.  
Hopefully by now you feel like you’re standing on much more solid  
ground with understanding lexical scope. From that base, the next  
chapter jumps into the weighty topic of closure.

143 Chapter 7\: Using Closures  
Up to this point, we’ve focused on the ins and outs of lexical scope,  
and how that affects the organization and usage of variables in our  
programs.  
Our attention again shifts broader in abstraction, to the historically  
somewhat daunting topic of closure. Don’t worry! You don’t need an  
advanced computer science degree to make sense of it. Our broad  
goal in this book is not merely to understand scope, but to more  
effectively use it in the structure of our programs; closure is central to  
that effort.  
Recall the main conclusion of Chapter 6\: the least exposure principle  
\(POLE\) encourages us to use block \(and function\) scoping to limit  
the scope exposure of variables. This helps keep code  
understandable and maintainable, and helps avoid many scoping  
pitfalls \(i.e., name collision, etc.\).  
Closure builds on this approach\: for variables we need to use over  
time, instead of placing them in larger outer scopes, we can  
encapsulate \(more narrowly scope\) them but still preserve access  
from inside functions, for broader use. Functions remember these  
referenced scoped variables via closure.  
We already saw an example of this kind of closure in the previous  
chapter \(factorial\(..\) in Chapter 6\), and you’ve almost certainly  
already used it in your own programs. If you’ve ever written a  
callback that accesses variables outside its own scope… guess  
what!? That’s closure.  
144 Closure is one of the most important language characteristics ever  
invented in programming—it underlies major programming  
paradigms, including Functional Programming \(FP\), modules, and  
even a bit of class-oriented design. Getting comfortable with closure  
is required for mastering JS and effectively leveraging many  
important design patterns throughout your code.  
Addressing all aspects of closure requires a daunting mountain of  
discussion and code throughout this chapter. Make sure to take your  
time and ensure you’re comfortable with each bit before moving onto  
the next.  
# See the Closure  
Closure is originally a mathematical concept, from lambda calculus.  
But I’m not going to list out math formulas or use a bunch of notation  
and jargon to define it.  
Instead, I’m going to focus on a practical perspective. We’ll start by  
defining closure in terms of what we can observe in different  
behavior of our programs, as opposed to if closure was not present  
in JS. However, later in this chapter, we’re going to flip closure  
around to look at it from an alternative perspective.  
Closure is a behavior of functions and only functions. If you aren’t  
dealing with a function, closure does not apply. An object cannot  
have closure, nor does a class have closure \(though its  
functions/methods might\). Only functions have closure.  
For closure to be observed, a function must be invoked, and  
specifically it must be invoked in a different branch of the scope  
145 chain from where it was originally defined. A function executing in the  
same scope it was defined would not exhibit any observably different  
behavior with or without closure being possible; by the observational  
perspective and definition, that is not closure.  
Let’s look at some code, annotated with its relevant scope bubble  
colors \(see Chapter 2\)\:  
// outer/global scope\: RED\(1\)  
function lookupStudent\(studentID\) \{  
// function scope\: BLUE\(2\)  
var students = \[  
\{ id\: 14, name\: "Kyle" \},  
\{ id\: 73, name\: "Suzy" \},  
\{ id\: 112, name\: "Frank" \},  
\{ id\: 6, name\: "Sarah" \}  
\];  
return function greetStudent\(greeting\)\{  
// function scope\: GREEN\(3\)  
var student = students.find\(  
student =\> student.id == studentID  
\);  
return  
\`\$\{ greeting \}, \$\{ student.name \}!\`  
;  
\};  
\}  
var chosenStudents = \[  
lookupStudent\(6\),  
146 lookupStudent\(112\)  
\];  
// accessing the function's name\:  
chosenStudents\[0\].name;  
// greetStudent  
chosenStudents\[0\]\("Hello"\);  
// Hello, Sarah!  
chosenStudents\[1\]\("Howdy"\);  
// Howdy, Frank!  
The first thing to notice about this code is that the  
lookupStudent\(..\) outer function creates and returns an inner  
function called greetStudent\(..\). lookupStudent\(..\) is called  
twice, producing two separate instances of its inner  
greetStudent\(..\) function, both of which are saved into the  
chosenStudents array.  
We verify that’s the case by checking the .name property of the  
returned function saved in chosenStudents\[0\], and it’s indeed an  
instance of the inner greetStudent\(..\).  
After each call to lookupStudent\(..\) finishes, it would seem like all  
its inner variables would be discarded and GC’d \(garbage collected\).  
The inner function is the only thing that seems to be returned and  
preserved. But here’s where the behavior differs in ways we can start  
to observe.  
While greetStudent\(..\) does receive a single argument as the  
parameter named greeting, it also makes reference to both  
147 students and studentID, identifiers which come from the enclosing  
scope of lookupStudent\(..\). Each of those references from the  
inner function to the variable in an outer scope is called a closure. In  
academic terms, each instance of greetStudent\(..\) closes over  
the outer variables students and studentID.  
So what do those closures do here, in a concrete, observable  
sense?  
Closure allows greetStudent\(..\) to continue to access those outer  
variables even after the outer scope is finished \(when each call to  
lookupStudent\(..\) completes\). Instead of the instances of  
students and studentID being GC’d, they stay around in memory.  
At a later time when either instance of the greetStudent\(..\)  
function is invoked, those variables are still there, holding their  
current values.  
If JS functions did not have closure, the completion of each  
lookupStudent\(..\) call would immediately tear down its scope and  
GC the students and studentID variables. When we later called  
one of the greetStudent\(..\) functions, what would then happen?  
If greetStudent\(..\) tried to access what it thought was a BLUE\(2\)  
marble, but that marble did not actually exist \(anymore\), the  
reasonable assumption is we should get a ReferenceError, right?  
But we don’t get an error. The fact that the execution of  
chosenStudents\[0\]\("Hello"\) works and returns us the message  
“Hello, Sarah!”, means it was still able to access the students and  
studentID variables. This is a direct observation of closure!  
Pointed Closure  
148 Actually, we glossed over a little detail in the previous discussion  
which I’m guessing many readers missed!  
Because of how terse the syntax for =\> arrow functions is, it’s easy  
to forget that they still create a scope \(as asserted in “Arrow  
Functions” in Chapter 3\). The student =\> student.id ==  
studentID arrow function is creating another scope bubble inside  
the greetStudent\(..\) function scope.  
Building on the metaphor of colored buckets and bubbles from  
Chapter 2, if we were creating a colored diagram for this code,  
there’s a fourth scope at this innermost nesting level, so we’d need a  
fourth color; perhaps we’d pick ORANGE\(4\) for that scope\:  
var student = students.find\(  
student =\>  
// function scope\: ORANGE\(4\)  
student.id == studentID  
\);  
The BLUE\(2\) studentID reference is actually inside the  
ORANGE\(4\) scope rather than the GREEN\(3\) scope of  
greetStudent\(..\); also, the student parameter of the arrow  
function is ORANGE\(4\), shadowing the GREEN\(3\) student.  
The consequence here is that this arrow function passed as a  
callback to the array’s find\(..\) method has to hold the closure over  
studentID, rather than greetStudent\(..\) holding that closure.  
That’s not too big of a deal, as everything still works as expected. It’s  
just important not to skip over the fact that even tiny arrow functions  
can get in on the closure party.  
149 Adding Up Closures  
Let’s examine one of the canonical examples often cited for closure\:  
function adder\(num1\) \{  
return function addTo\(num2\)\{  
return num1 + num2;  
\};  
\}  
var add10To = adder\(10\);  
var add42To = adder\(42\);  
add10To\(15\); // 25  
add42To\(9\); // 51  
Each instance of the inner addTo\(..\) function is closing over its own  
num1 variable \(with values 10 and 42, respectively\), so those num1’s  
don’t go away just because adder\(..\) finishes. When we later  
invoke one of those inner addTo\(..\) instances, such as the  
add10To\(15\) call, its closed-over num1 variable still exists and still  
holds the original 10 value. The operation is thus able to perform 10  
+ 15 and return the answer 25.  
An important detail might have been too easy to gloss over in that  
previous paragraph, so let’s reinforce it\: closure is associated with an  
instance of a function, rather than its single lexical definition. In the  
preceding snippet, there’s just one inner addTo\(..\) function defined  
inside adder\(..\), so it might seem like that would imply a single  
closure.  
150 But actually, every time the outer adder\(..\) function runs, a new  
inner addTo\(..\) function instance is created, and for each new  
instance, a new closure. So each inner function instance \(labeled  
add10To\(..\) and add42To\(..\) in our program\) has its own closure  
over its own instance of the scope environment from that execution  
of adder\(..\).  
Even though closure is based on lexical scope, which is handled at  
compile time, closure is observed as a runtime characteristic of  
function instances.  
Live Link, Not a Snapshot  
In both examples from the previous sections, we read the value  
from a variable that was held in a closure. That makes it feel like  
closure might be a snapshot of a value at some given moment.  
Indeed, that’s a common misconception.  
Closure is actually a live link, preserving access to the full variable  
itself. We’re not limited to merely reading a value; the closed-over  
variable can be updated \(re-assigned\) as well! By closing over a  
variable in a function, we can keep using that variable \(read and  
write\) as long as that function reference exists in the program, and  
from anywhere we want to invoke that function. This is why closure  
is such a powerful technique used widely across so many areas of  
programming!  
Figure 4 depicts the function instances and scope links\:  
151 Fig. 4\: Visualizing Closures  
As shown in Figure 4, each call to adder\(..\) creates a new  
BLUE\(2\) scope containing a num1 variable, as well as a new  
instance of addTo\(..\) function as a GREEN\(3\) scope. Notice that  
the function instances \(addTo10\(..\) and addTo42\(..\)\) are present  
in and invoked from the RED\(1\) scope.  
Now let’s examine an example where the closed-over variable is  
updated\:  
function makeCounter\(\) \{  
var count = 0;  
return function getCurrent\(\) \{  
count = count + 1;  
return count;  
\};  
\}  
var hits = makeCounter\(\);  
152 // later  
hits\(\); // 1  
// later  
hits\(\); // 2  
hits\(\); // 3  
The count variable is closed over by the inner getCurrent\(\)  
function, which keeps it around instead of it being subjected to GC.  
The hits\(\) function calls access and update this variable, returning  
an incrementing count each time.  
Though the enclosing scope of a closure is typically from a function,  
that’s not actually required; there only needs to be an inner function  
present inside an outer scope\:  
var hits;  
\{ // an outer scope \(but not a function\)  
let count = 0;  
hits = function getCurrent\(\)\{  
count = count + 1;  
return count;  
\};  
\}  
hits\(\); // 1  
hits\(\); // 2  
hits\(\); // 3  
153 NOTE\:  
I deliberately defined getCurrent\(\) as a function expression  
instead of a function declaration. This isn’t about closure, but with  
the dangerous quirks of FiB \(Chapter 6\).  
Because it’s so common to mistake closure as value-oriented  
instead of variable-oriented, developers sometimes get tripped up  
trying to use closure to snapshot-preserve a value from some  
moment in time. Consider\:  
var studentName =  
"Frank";  
var greeting = function hello\(\) \{  
// we are closing over  
\`  
studentName  
\`  
,  
// not "Frank"  
console.log\(  
\`Hello, \$\{ studentName \}!\`  
\);  
\}  
// later  
studentName =  
"Suzy";  
// later  
greeting\(\);  
// Hello, Suzy!  
By defining greeting\(\) \(aka, hello\(\)\) when studentName holds  
the value "Frank" \(before the re-assignment to "Suzy"\), the  
mistaken assumption is often that the closure will capture "Frank".  
154 But greeting\(\) is closed over the variable studentName, not its  
value. Whenever greeting\(\) is invoked, the current value of the  
variable \("Suzy", in this case\) is reflected.  
The classic illustration of this mistake is defining functions inside a  
loop\:  
var keeps = \[\];  
for \(var i = 0; i \< 3; i++\) \{  
keeps\[i\] = function keepI\(\)\{  
// closure over  
\`i\`  
return i;  
\};  
\}  
keeps\[0\]\(\); // 3 -- WHY!?  
keeps\[1\]\(\); // 3  
keeps\[2\]\(\); // 3  
NOTE\:  
This kind of closure illustration typically uses a setTimeout\(..\) or  
some other callback like an event handler, inside the loop. I’ve  
simplified the example by storing function references in an array, so  
that we don’t need to consider asynchronous timing in our analysis.  
The closure principle is the same, regardless.  
You might have expected the keeps\[0\]\(\) invocation to return 0,  
since that function was created during the first iteration of the loop  
when i was 0. But again, that assumption stems from thinking of  
closure as value-oriented rather than variable-oriented.  
155 Something about the structure of a for-loop can trick us into thinking  
that each iteration gets its own new i variable; in fact, this program  
only has one i since it was declared with var.  
Each saved function returns 3, because by the end of the loop, the  
single i variable in the program has been assigned 3. Each of the  
three functions in the keeps array do have individual closures, but  
they’re all closed over that same shared i variable.  
Of course, a single variable can only ever hold one value at any  
given moment. So if you want to preserve multiple values, you need  
a different variable for each.  
How could we do that in the loop snippet? Let’s create a new  
variable for each iteration\:  
var keeps = \[\];  
for \(var i = 0; i \< 3; i++\) \{  
// new  
\`j\`  
created each iteration, which gets  
// a copy of the value of \`i\`  
at this moment  
let j = i;  
// the  
\`i\` here isn't being closed over, so  
// it's fine to immediately use its current  
// value in each loop iteration  
keeps\[i\] = function keepEachJ\(\)\{  
// close over  
\`j\`  
, not \`i\`!  
return j;  
\};  
\}  
keeps\[0\]\(\); // 0  
156 keeps\[1\]\(\); // 1  
keeps\[2\]\(\); // 2  
Each function is now closed over a separate \(new\) variable from  
each iteration, even though all of them are named j. And each j  
gets a copy of the value of i at that point in the loop iteration; that j  
never gets re-assigned. So all three functions now return their  
expected values\: 0, 1, and 2!  
Again remember, even if we were using asynchrony in this program,  
such as passing each inner keepEachJ\(\) function into  
setTimeout\(..\) or some event handler subscription, the same kind  
of closure behavior would still be observed.  
Recall the “Loops” section in Chapter 5, which illustrates how a let  
declaration in a for loop actually creates not just one variable for the  
loop, but actually creates a new variable for each iteration of the  
loop. That trick/quirk is exactly what we need for our loop closures\:  
var keeps = \[\];  
for \(let i = 0; i \< 3; i++\) \{  
// the  
\`let i\`  
gives us a new  
// each iteration, automatically!  
keeps\[i\] = function keepEachI\(\)\{  
return i;  
\`i\` for  
\};  
\}  
keeps\[0\]\(\); // 0  
keeps\[1\]\(\); // 1  
keeps\[2\]\(\); // 2  
157 Since we’re using let, three i’s are created, one for each loop, so  
each of the three closures just work as expected.  
Common Closures\: Ajax and Events  
Closure is most commonly encountered with callbacks\:  
function lookupStudentRecord\(studentID\) \{  
ajax\(  
\`https\://some.api/student/\$\{ studentID \}\`  
,  
function onRecord\(record\) \{  
console.log\(  
\`\$\{ record.name \} \(\$\{ studentID \}\)\`  
\);  
\}  
\);  
\}  
lookupStudentRecord\(114\);  
// Frank \(114\)  
The onRecord\(..\) callback is going to be invoked at some point in  
the future, after the response from the Ajax call comes back. This  
invocation will happen from the internals of the ajax\(..\) utility,  
wherever that comes from. Furthermore, when that happens, the  
lookupStudentRecord\(..\) call will long since have completed.  
Why then is studentID still around and accessible to the callback?  
Closure.  
Event handlers are another common usage of closure\:  
158 function listenForClicks\(btn,label\) \{  
btn.addEventListener\("click"  
,function onClick\(\)\{  
console.log\(  
\`The \$\{ label \} button was clicked!\`  
\);  
\}\);  
\}  
var submitBtn = document.getElementById\("submit-btn"\);  
listenForClicks\(submitBtn,  
"Checkout"\);  
The label parameter is closed over by the onClick\(..\) event  
handler callback. When the button is clicked, label still exists to be  
used. This is closure.  
What If I Can’t See It?  
You’ve probably heard this common adage\:  
If a tree falls in the forest but nobody is around to hear it, does it  
make a sound?  
It’s a silly bit of philosophical gymnastics. Of course from a scientific  
perspective, sound waves are created. But the real point\: does it  
matter if the sound happens?  
Remember, the emphasis in our definition of closure is observability.  
If a closure exists \(in a technical, implementation, or academic  
sense\) but it cannot be observed in our programs, does it matter?  
No.  
159 To reinforce this point, let’s look at some examples that are not  
observably based on closure.  
For example, invoking a function that makes use of lexical scope  
lookup\:  
function say\(myName\) \{  
var greeting =  
output\(\);  
"Hello";  
function output\(\) \{  
console.log\(  
\`\$\{ greeting \}, \$\{ myName \}!\`  
\);  
\}  
\}  
say\("Kyle"\);  
// Hello, Kyle!  
The inner function output\(\) accesses the variables greeting and  
myName from its enclosing scope. But the invocation of output\(\)  
happens in that same scope, where of course greeting and myName  
are still available; that’s just lexical scope, not closure.  
Any lexically scoped language whose functions didn’t support  
closure would still behave this same way.  
In fact, global scope variables essentially cannot be \(observably\)  
closed over, because they’re always accessible from everywhere. No  
function can ever be invoked in any part of the scope chain that is  
not a descendant of the global scope.  
160 Consider\:  
var students = \[  
\{ id\: 14, name\: "Kyle" \},  
\{ id\: 73, name\: "Suzy" \},  
\{ id\: 112, name\: "Frank" \},  
\{ id\: 6, name\: "Sarah" \}  
\];  
function getFirstStudent\(\) \{  
return function firstStudent\(\)\{  
return students\[0\].name;  
\};  
\}  
var student = getFirstStudent\(\);  
student\(\);  
// Kyle  
The inner firstStudent\(\) function does reference students, which  
is a variable outside its own scope. But since students happens to  
be from the global scope, no matter where that function is invoked in  
the program, its ability to access students is nothing more special  
than normal lexical scope.  
All function invocations can access global variables, regardless of  
whether closure is supported by the language or not. Global  
variables don’t need to be closed over.  
Variables that are merely present but never accessed don’t result in  
closure\:  
161 function lookupStudent\(studentID\) \{  
return function nobody\(\)\{  
var msg =  
"Nobody's here yet.  
console.log\(msg\);  
";  
\};  
\}  
var student = lookupStudent\(112\);  
student\(\);  
// Nobody's here yet.  
The inner function nobody\(\) doesn’t close over any outer variables  
—it only uses its own variable msg. Even though studentID is  
present in the enclosing scope, studentID is not referred to by  
nobody\(\). The JS engine doesn’t need to keep studentID around  
after lookupStudent\(..\) has finished running, so GC wants to  
clean up that memory!  
Whether JS functions support closure or not, this program would  
behave the same. Therefore, no observed closure here.  
If there’s no function invocation, closure can’t be observed\:  
function greetStudent\(studentName\) \{  
return function greeting\(\)\{  
console.log\(  
\`Hello, \$\{ studentName \}!\`  
\);  
\};  
\}  
162 greetStudent\("Kyle"\);  
// nothing else happens  
This one’s tricky, because the outer function definitely does get  
invoked. But the inner function is the one that could have had  
closure, and yet it’s never invoked; the returned function here is just  
thrown away. So even if technically the JS engine created closure for  
a brief moment, it was not observed in any meaningful way in this  
program.  
A tree may have fallen… but we didn’t hear it, so we don’t care.  
Observable Definition  
We’re now ready to define closure\:  
Closure is observed when a function uses variable\(s\) from outer  
scope\(s\) even while running in a scope where those variable\(s\)  
wouldn’t be accessible.  
The key parts of this definition are\:  
Must be a function involved  
Must reference at least one variable from an outer scope  
Must be invoked in a different branch of the scope chain from  
the variable\(s\)  
This observation-oriented definition means we shouldn’t dismiss  
closure as some indirect, academic trivia. Instead, we should look  
163 and plan for the direct, concrete effects closure has on our program  
behavior.  
# The Closure Lifecycle and Garbage  
# Collection \(GC\)  
Since closure is inherently tied to a function instance, its closure over  
a variable lasts as long as there is still a reference to that function.  
If ten functions all close over the same variable, and over time nine  
of these function references are discarded, the lone remaining  
function reference still preserves that variable. Once that final  
function reference is discarded, the last closure over that variable is  
gone, and the variable itself is GC’d.  
This has an important impact on building efficient and performant  
programs. Closure can unexpectedly prevent the GC of a variable  
that you’re otherwise done with, which leads to run-away memory  
usage over time. That’s why it’s important to discard function  
references \(and thus their closures\) when they’re not needed  
anymore.  
Consider\:  
function manageBtnClickEvents\(btn\) \{  
var clickHandlers = \[\];  
return function listener\(cb\)\{  
if \(cb\) \{  
let clickHandler =  
function onClick\(evt\)\{  
164 console.log\("clicked!"\);  
cb\(evt\);  
\};  
clickHandlers.push\(clickHandler\);  
btn.addEventListener\(  
"click"  
,  
clickHandler  
\);  
\}  
else \{  
// passing no callback unsubscribes  
// all click handlers  
for \(let handler of clickHandlers\) \{  
btn.removeEventListener\(  
"click"  
,  
handler  
\);  
\}  
clickHandlers = \[\];  
\}  
\};  
\}  
// var mySubmitBtn =  
..  
var onSubmit = manageBtnClickEvents\(mySubmitBtn\);  
onSubmit\(function checkout\(evt\)\{  
// handle checkout  
\}\);  
onSubmit\(function trackAction\(evt\)\{  
// log action to analytics  
165 \}\);  
// later, unsubscribe all handlers\:  
onSubmit\(\);  
In this program, the inner onClick\(..\) function holds a closure over  
the passed in cb \(the provided event callback\). That means the  
checkout\(\) and trackAction\(\) function expression references are  
held via closure \(and cannot be GC’d\) for as long as these event  
handlers are subscribed.  
When we call onSubmit\(\) with no input on the last line, all event  
handlers are unsubscribed, and the clickHandlers array is  
emptied. Once all click handler function references are discarded,  
the closures of cb references to checkout\(\) and trackAction\(\)  
are discarded.  
When considering the overall health and efficiency of the program,  
unsubscribing an event handler when it’s no longer needed can be  
even more important than the initial subscription!  
Per Variable or Per Scope?  
Another question we need to tackle\: should we think of closure as  
applied only to the referenced outer variable\(s\), or does closure  
preserve the entire scope chain with all its variables?  
In other words, in the previous event subscription snippet, is the  
inner onClick\(..\) function closed over only cb, or is it also closed  
over clickHandler, clickHandlers, and btn?  
166 Conceptually, closure is per variable rather than per scope. Ajax  
callbacks, event handlers, and all other forms of function closures  
are typically assumed to close over only what they explicitly  
reference.  
But the reality is more complicated than that.  
Another program to consider\:  
function manageStudentGrades\(studentRecords\) \{  
var grades = studentRecords.map\(getGrade\);  
return addGrade;  
// \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
function getGrade\(record\)\{  
return record.grade;  
\}  
function sortAndTrimGradesList\(\) \{  
// sort by grades, descending  
grades.sort\(function desc\(g1,g2\)\{  
return g2 - g1;  
\}\);  
// only keep the top 10 grades  
grades = grades.slice\(0,10\);  
\}  
function addGrade\(newGrade\) \{  
grades.push\(newGrade\);  
sortAndTrimGradesList\(\);  
167 return grades;  
\}  
\}  
var addNextGrade = manageStudentGrades\(\[  
\{ id\: 14, name\: "Kyle"  
, grade\: 86 \},  
\{ id\: 73, name\: "Suzy"  
, grade\: 87 \},  
\{ id\: 112, name\: "Frank"  
, grade\: 75 \},  
// ..many more records..  
\{ id\: 6, name\: "Sarah"  
, grade\: 91 \}  
\]\);  
// later  
addNextGrade\(81\);  
addNextGrade\(68\);  
// \[ .., .., ... \]  
The outer function manageStudentGrades\(..\) takes a list of student  
records, and returns an addGrade\(..\) function reference, which we  
externally label addNextGrade\(..\). Each time we call  
addNextGrade\(..\) with a new grade, we get back a current list of  
the top 10 grades, sorted numerically descending \(see  
sortAndTrimGradesList\(\)\).  
From the end of the original manageStudentGrades\(..\) call, and  
between the multiple addNextGrade\(..\) calls, the grades variable  
is preserved inside addGrade\(..\) via closure; that’s how the running  
list of top grades is maintained. Remember, it’s a closure over the  
variable grades itself, not the array it holds.  
168 That’s not the only closure involved, however. Can you spot other  
variables being closed over?  
Did you spot that addGrade\(..\) references  
sortAndTrimGradesList? That means it’s also closed over that  
identifier, which happens to hold a reference to the  
sortAndTrimGradesList\(\) function. That second inner function has  
to stay around so that addGrade\(..\) can keep calling it, which also  
means any variables it closes over stick around—though, in this  
case, nothing extra is closed over there.  
What else is closed over?  
Consider the getGrade variable \(and its function\); is it closed over?  
It’s referenced in the outer scope of manageStudentGrades\(..\) in  
the .map\(getGrade\) call. But it’s not referenced in addGrade\(..\) or  
sortAndTrimGradesList\(\).  
What about the \(potentially\) large list of student records we pass in  
as studentRecords? Is that variable closed over? If it is, the array of  
student records is never getting GC’d, which leads to this program  
holding onto a larger amount of memory than we might assume. But  
if we look closely again, none of the inner functions reference  
studentRecords.  
According to the per variable definition of closure, since getGrade  
and studentRecords are not referenced by the inner functions,  
they’re not closed over. They should be freely available for GC right  
after the manageStudentGrades\(..\) call completes.  
Indeed, try debugging this code in a recent JS engine, like v8 in  
Chrome, placing a breakpoint inside the addGrade\(..\) function. You  
169 may notice that the inspector does not list the studentRecords  
variable. That’s proof, debugging-wise anyway, that the engine does  
not maintain studentRecords via closure. Phew!  
But how reliable is this observation as proof? Consider this \(rather  
contrived!\) program\:  
function storeStudentInfo\(id,name,grade\) \{  
return function getInfo\(whichValue\)\{  
// warning\:  
// using  
\`  
eval\(..\)\` is a bad idea!  
var val = eval\(whichValue\);  
return val;  
\};  
\}  
var info = storeStudentInfo\(73,  
"Suzy"  
,87\);  
info\("name"\);  
// Suzy  
info\("grade"\);  
// 87  
Notice that the inner function getInfo\(..\) is not explicitly closed  
over any of id, name, or grade variables. And yet, calls to info\(..\)  
seem to still be able to access the variables, albeit through use of  
the eval\(..\) lexical scope cheat \(see Chapter 1\).  
So all the variables were definitely preserved via closure, despite not  
being explicitly referenced by the inner function. So does that  
disprove the per variable assertion in favor of per scope? Depends.  
170 Many modern JS engines do apply an optimization that removes any  
variables from a closure scope that aren’t explicitly referenced.  
However, as we see with eval\(..\), there are situations where such  
an optimization cannot be applied, and the closure scope continues  
to contain all its original variables. In other words, closure must be  
per scope, implementation wise, and then an optional optimization  
trims down the scope to only what was closed over \(a similar  
outcome as per variable closure\).  
Even as recent as a few years ago, many JS engines did not apply  
this optimization; it’s possible your websites may still run in such  
browsers, especially on older or lower-end devices. That means it’s  
possible that long-lived closures such as event handlers may be  
holding onto memory much longer than we would have assumed.  
And the fact that it’s an optional optimization in the first place, rather  
than a requirement of the specification, means that we shouldn’t just  
casually over-assume its applicability.  
In cases where a variable holds a large value \(like an object or array\)  
and that variable is present in a closure scope, if you don’t need that  
value anymore and don’t want that memory held, it’s safer \(memory  
usage\) to manually discard the value rather than relying on closure  
optimization/GC.  
Let’s apply a fix to the earlier manageStudentGrades\(..\) example  
to ensure the potentially large array held in studentRecords is not  
caught up in a closure scope unnecessarily\:  
function manageStudentGrades\(studentRecords\) \{  
var grades = studentRecords.map\(getGrade\);  
171 // unset \`  
studentRecords  
\` to prevent unwanted  
// memory retention in the closure  
studentRecords = null;  
return addGrade;  
// ..  
\}  
We’re not removing studentRecords from the closure scope; that  
we cannot control. We’re ensuring that even if studentRecords  
remains in the closure scope, that variable is no longer referencing  
the potentially large array of data; the array can be GC’d.  
Again, in many cases JS might automatically optimize the program  
to the same effect. But it’s still a good habit to be careful and  
explicitly make sure we don’t keep any significant amount of device  
memory tied up any longer than necessary.  
As a matter of fact, we also technically don’t need the function  
getGrade\(\) anymore after the .map\(getGrade\) call completes. If  
profiling our application showed this was a critical area of excess  
memory use, we could possibly eek out a tiny bit more memory by  
freeing up that reference so its value isn’t tied up either. That’s likely  
unnecessary in this toy example, but this is a general technique to  
keep in mind if you’re optimizing the memory footprint of your  
application.  
The takeaway\: it’s important to know where closures appear in our  
programs, and what variables are included. We should manage  
these closures carefully so we’re only holding onto what’s minimally  
needed and not wasting memory.  
172 An Alternative Perspective  
Reviewing our working definition for closure, the assertion is that  
functions are “first-class values” that can be passed around the  
program, just like any other value. Closure is the link-association that  
connects that function to the scope/variables outside of itself, no  
matter where that function goes.  
Let’s recall a code example from earlier in this chapter, again with  
relevant scope bubble colors annotated\:  
// outer/global scope\: RED\(1\)  
function adder\(num1\) \{  
// function scope\: BLUE\(2\)  
return function addTo\(num2\)\{  
// function scope\: GREEN\(3\)  
return num1 + num2;  
\};  
\}  
var add10To = adder\(10\);  
var add42To = adder\(42\);  
add10To\(15\); // 25  
add42To\(9\); // 51  
Our current perspective suggests that wherever a function is passed  
and invoked, closure preserves a hidden link back to the original  
173 scope to facilitate the access to the closed-over variables. Figure 4,  
repeated here for convenience, illustrates this notion\:  
Fig. 4 \(repeat\)\: Visualizing Closures  
But there’s another way of thinking about closure, and more  
precisely the nature of functions being passed around, that may help  
deepen the mental models.  
This alternative model de-emphasizes “functions as first-class  
values,” and instead embraces how functions \(like all non-primitive  
values\) are held by reference in JS, and assigned/passed by  
reference-copy—see Appendix A of the Get Started book for more  
information.  
Instead of thinking about the inner function instance of addTo\(..\)  
moving to the outer RED\(1\) scope via the return and assignment,  
we can envision that function instances actually just stay in place in  
their own scope environment, of course with their scope-chain intact.  
174 What gets sent to the RED\(1\) scope is just a reference to the in-  
place function instance, rather than the function instance itself.  
Figure 5 depicts the inner function instances remaining in place,  
pointed to by the RED\(1\) addTo10 and addTo42 references,  
respectively\:  
Fig. 5\: Visualizing Closures \(Alternative\)  
As shown in Figure 5, each call to adder\(..\) still creates a new  
BLUE\(2\) scope containing a num1 variable, as well as an instance of  
the GREEN\(3\) addTo\(..\) scope. But what’s different from Figure 4  
is, now these GREEN\(3\) instances remain in place, naturally nested  
inside of their BLUE\(2\) scope instances. The addTo10 and addTo42  
references are moved to the RED\(1\) outer scope, not the function  
instances themselves.  
175 When addTo10\(15\) is called, the addTo\(..\) function instance \(still  
in place in its original BLUE\(2\) scope environment\) is invoked. Since  
the function instance itself never moved, of course it still has natural  
access to its scope chain. Same with the addTo42\(9\) call—nothing  
special here beyond lexical scope.  
So what then is closure, if not the magic that lets a function maintain  
a link to its original scope chain even as that function moves around  
in other scopes? In this alternative model, functions stay in place and  
keep accessing their original scope chain just like they always could.  
Closure instead describes the magic of keeping alive a function  
instance, along with its whole scope environment and chain, for as  
long as there’s at least one reference to that function instance  
floating around in any other part of the program.  
That definition of closure is less observational and a bit less familiar-  
sounding compared to the traditional academic perspective. But it’s  
nonetheless still useful, because the benefit is that we simplify  
explanation of closure to a straightforward combination of references  
and in-place function instances.  
The previous model \(Figure 4\) is not wrong at describing closure in  
JS. It’s just more conceptually inspired, an academic perspective on  
closure. By contrast, the alternative model \(Figure 5\) could be  
described as a bit more implementation focused, how JS actually  
works.  
Both perspectives/models are useful in understanding closure, but  
the reader may find one a little easier to hold than the other.  
Whichever you choose, the observable outcomes in our program are  
the same.  
176 NOTE\:  
This alternative model for closure does affect whether we classify  
synchronous callbacks as examples of closure or not. More on this  
nuance in Appendix A.  
# Why Closure?  
Now that we have a well-rounded sense of what closure is and how  
it works, let’s explore some ways it can improve the code structure  
and organization of an example program.  
Imagine you have a button on a page that when clicked, should  
retrieve and send some data via an Ajax request. Without using  
closure\:  
var APIendpoints = \{  
studentIDs\:  
"https\://some.api/register-students"  
,  
// ..  
\};  
var data = \{  
// ..  
studentIDs\: \[ 14, 73, 112, 6 \],  
\};  
function makeRequest\(evt\) \{  
var btn = evt.target;  
var recordKind = btn.dataset.kind;  
ajax\(  
APIendpoints\[recordKind\],  
data\[recordKind\]  
177 \);  
\}  
// \<button data-kind=  
"studentIDs"\>  
// Register Students  
// \</button\>  
btn.addEventListener\("click"  
,makeRequest\);  
The makeRequest\(..\) utility only receives an evt object from a click  
event. From there, it has to retrieve the data-kind attribute from the  
target button element, and use that value to lookup both a URL for  
the API endpoint as well as what data should be included in the Ajax  
request.  
This works OK, but it’s unfortunate \(inefficient, more confusing\) that  
the event handler has to read a DOM attribute each time it’s fired.  
Why couldn’t an event handler remember this value? Let’s try using  
closure to improve the code\:  
var APIendpoints = \{  
studentIDs\:  
"https\://some.api/register-students"  
,  
// ..  
\};  
var data = \{  
// ..  
studentIDs\: \[ 14, 73, 112, 6 \],  
\};  
function setupButtonHandler\(btn\) \{  
var recordKind = btn.dataset.kind;  
178 btn.addEventListener\(  
"click"  
,  
function makeRequest\(evt\)\{  
ajax\(  
APIendpoints\[recordKind\],  
data\[recordKind\]  
\);  
\}  
\);  
\}  
// \<button data-kind=  
"studentIDs"\>  
// Register Students  
// \</button\>  
setupButtonHandler\(btn\);  
With the setupButtonHandler\(..\) approach, the data-kind  
attribute is retrieved once and assigned to the recordKind variable  
at initial setup. recordKind is then closed over by the inner  
makeRequest\(..\) click handler, and its value is used on each event  
firing to look up the URL and data that should be sent.  
NOTE\:  
evt is still passed to makeRequest\(..\), though in this case we’re  
not using it anymore. It’s still listed, for consistency with the previous  
snippet.  
By placing recordKind inside setupButtonHandler\(..\), we limit  
the scope exposure of that variable to a more appropriate subset of  
the program; storing it globally would have been worse for code  
179 organization and readability. Closure lets the inner makeRequest\(\)  
function instance remember this variable and access whenever it’s  
needed.  
Building on this pattern, we could have looked up both the URL and  
data once, at setup\:  
function setupButtonHandler\(btn\) \{  
var recordKind = btn.dataset.kind;  
var requestURL = APIendpoints\[recordKind\];  
var requestData = data\[recordKind\];  
btn.addEventListener\(  
"click"  
,  
function makeRequest\(evt\)\{  
ajax\(requestURL,requestData\);  
\}  
\);  
\}  
Now makeRequest\(..\) is closed over requestURL and  
requestData, which is a little bit cleaner to understand, and also  
slightly more performant.  
Two similar techniques from the Functional Programming \(FP\)  
paradigm that rely on closure are partial application and currying.  
Briefly, with these techniques, we alter the shape of functions that  
require multiple inputs so some inputs are provided up front, and  
other inputs are provided later; the initial inputs are remembered via  
closure. Once all inputs have been provided, the underlying action is  
performed.  
180 By creating a function instance that encapsulates some information  
inside \(via closure\), the function-with-stored-information can later be  
used directly without needing to re-provide that input. This makes  
that part of the code cleaner, and also offers the opportunity to label  
partially applied functions with better semantic names.  
Adapting partial application, we can further improve the preceding  
code\:  
function defineHandler\(requestURL,requestData\) \{  
return function makeRequest\(evt\)\{  
ajax\(requestURL,requestData\);  
\};  
\}  
function setupButtonHandler\(btn\) \{  
var recordKind = btn.dataset.kind;  
var handler = defineHandler\(  
APIendpoints\[recordKind\],  
data\[recordKind\]  
\);  
btn.addEventListener\("click"  
,handler\);  
\}  
The requestURL and requestData inputs are provided ahead of  
time, resulting in the makeRequest\(..\) partially applied function,  
which we locally label handler. When the event eventually fires, the  
final input \(evt, even though it’s ignored\) is passed to handler\(\),  
completing its inputs and triggering the underlying Ajax request.  
Behavior-wise, this program is pretty similar to the previous one, with  
the same type of closure. But by isolating the creation of  
181 makeRequest\(..\) in a separate utility \(defineHandler\(..\)\), we  
make that definition more reusable across the program. We also  
explicitly limit the closure scope to only the two variables needed.  
# Closer to Closure  
As we close down a dense chapter, take some deep breaths let it all  
sink in. Seriously, that’s a lot of information for anyone to consume!  
We explored two models for mentally tackling closure\:  
Observational\: closure is a function instance remembering its  
outer variables even as that function is passed to and invoked  
in other scopes.  
Implementational\: closure is a function instance and its scope  
environment preserved in-place while any references to it are  
passed around and invoked from other scopes.  
Summarizing the benefits to our programs\:  
Closure can improve efficiency by allowing a function instance  
to remember previously determined information instead of  
having to compute it each time.  
Closure can improve code readability, bounding scope-exposure  
by encapsulating variable\(s\) inside function instances, while still  
making sure the information in those variables is accessible for  
future use. The resultant narrower, more specialized function  
instances are cleaner to interact with, since the preserved  
information doesn’t need to be passed in every invocation.  
182 Before you move on, take some time to restate this summary in your  
own words, explaining what closure is and why it’s helpful in your  
programs. The main book text concludes with a final chapter that  
builds on top of closure with the module pattern.  
183 Chapter 8\: The Module Pattern  
In this chapter, we wrap up the main text of the book by exploring  
one of the most important code organization patterns in all of  
programming\: the module. As we’ll see, modules are inherently built  
from what we’ve already covered\: the payoff for your efforts in  
learning lexical scope and closure.  
We’ve examined every angle of lexical scope, from the breadth of  
the global scope down through nested block scopes, into the  
intricacies of the variable lifecycle. Then we leveraged lexical scope  
to understand the full power of closure.  
Take a moment to reflect on how far you’ve come in this journey so  
far; you’ve taken big steps in getting to know JS more deeply!  
The central theme of this book has been that understanding and  
mastering scope and closure is key in properly structuring and  
organizing our code, especially the decisions on where to store  
information in variables.  
Our goal in this final chapter is to appreciate how modules embody  
the importance of these topics, elevating them from abstract  
concepts to concrete, practical improvements in building programs.  
# Encapsulation and Least Exposure \(POLE\)  
Encapsulation is often cited as a principle of object-oriented \(OO\)  
programming, but it’s more fundamental and broadly applicable than  
that. The goal of encapsulation is the bundling or co-location of  
184 information \(data\) and behavior \(functions\) that together serve a  
common purpose.  
Independent of any syntax or code mechanisms, the spirit of  
encapsulation can be realized in something as simple as using  
separate files to hold bits of the overall program with common  
purpose. If we bundle everything that powers a list of search results  
into a single file called “search-list.js”, we’re encapsulating that part  
of the program.  
The recent trend in modern front-end programming to organize  
applications around Component architecture pushes encapsulation  
even further. For many, it feels natural to consolidate everything that  
constitutes the search results list—even beyond code, including  
presentational markup and styling—into a single unit of program  
logic, something tangible we can interact with. And then we label that  
collection the “SearchList” component.  
Another key goal is the control of visibility of certain aspects of the  
encapsulated data and functionality. Recall from Chapter 6 the least  
exposure principle \(POLE\), which seeks to defensively guard against  
various dangers of scope over-exposure; these affect both variables  
and functions. In JS, we most often implement visibility control  
through the mechanics of lexical scope.  
The idea is to group alike program bits together, and selectively limit  
programmatic access to the parts we consider private details. What’s  
not considered private is then marked as public, accessible to the  
whole program.  
The natural effect of this effort is better code organization. It’s easier  
to build and maintain software when we know where things are, with  
185 clear and obvious boundaries and connection points. It’s also easier  
to maintain quality if we avoid the pitfalls of over-exposed data and  
functionality.  
These are some of the main benefits of organizing JS programs into  
modules.  
# What Is a Module?  
A module is a collection of related data and functions \(often referred  
to as methods in this context\), characterized by a division between  
hidden private details and public accessible details, usually called  
the “public API.”  
A module is also stateful\: it maintains some information over time,  
along with functionality to access and update that information.  
NOTE\:  
A broader concern of the module pattern is fully embracing system-  
level modularization through loose-coupling and other program  
architecture techniques. That’s a complex topic well beyond the  
bounds of our discussion, but is worth further study beyond this  
book.  
To get a better sense of what a module is, let’s compare some  
module characteristics to useful code patterns that aren’t quite  
modules.  
Namespaces \(Stateless Grouping\)  
186 If you group a set of related functions together, without data, then  
you don’t really have the expected encapsulation a module implies.  
The better term for this grouping of stateless functions is a  
namespace\:  
// namespace, not module  
var Utils = \{  
cancelEvt\(evt\) \{  
evt.preventDefault\(\);  
evt.stopPropagation\(\);  
evt.stopImmediatePropagation\(\);  
\},  
wait\(ms\) \{  
return new Promise\(function c\(res\)\{  
setTimeout\(res,ms\);  
\}\);  
\},  
isValidEmail\(email\) \{  
return /\[\^@\]+@\[\^@.\]+\\.\[\^@.\]+/.test\(email\);  
\}  
\};  
Utils here is a useful collection of utilities, yet they’re all state-  
independent functions. Gathering functionality together is generally  
good practice, but that doesn’t make this a module. Rather, we’ve  
defined a Utils namespace and organized the functions under it.  
Data Structures \(Stateful Grouping\)  
Even if you bundle data and stateful functions together, if you’re not  
limiting the visibility of any of it, then you’re stopping short of the  
187 POLE aspect of encapsulation; it’s not particularly helpful to label  
that a module.  
Consider\:  
// data structure, not module  
var Student = \{  
records\: \[  
\{ id\: 14, name\: "Kyle"  
\{ id\: 73, name\: "Suzy"  
\{ id\: 112, name\: "Frank"  
\{ id\: 6, name\: "Sarah"  
, grade\: 86 \},  
, grade\: 87 \},  
, grade\: 75 \},  
, grade\: 91 \}  
\],  
getName\(studentID\) \{  
var student = this.records.find\(  
student =\> student.id == studentID  
\);  
return student.name;  
\}  
\};  
Student.getName\(73\);  
// Suzy  
Since records is publicly accessible data, not hidden behind a  
public API, Student here isn’t really a module.  
Student does have the data-and-functionality aspect of  
encapsulation, but not the visibility-control aspect. It’s best to label  
this an instance of a data structure.  
Modules \(Stateful Access Control\)  
188 To embody the full spirit of the module pattern, we not only need  
grouping and state, but also access control through visibility \(private  
vs. public\).  
Let’s turn Student from the previous section into a module. We’ll  
start with a form I call the “classic module,” which was originally  
referred to as the “revealing module” when it first emerged in the  
early 2000s. Consider\:  
var Student = \(function defineStudent\(\)\{  
var records = \[  
\{ id\: 14, name\: "Kyle"  
\{ id\: 73, name\: "Suzy"  
\{ id\: 112, name\: "Frank"  
\{ id\: 6, name\: "Sarah"  
, grade\: 86 \},  
, grade\: 87 \},  
, grade\: 75 \},  
, grade\: 91 \}  
\];  
var publicAPI = \{  
getName  
\};  
return publicAPI;  
// \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
function getName\(studentID\) \{  
var student = records.find\(  
student =\> student.id == studentID  
\);  
return student.name;  
\}  
\}\)\(\);  
189 Student.getName\(73\); // Suzy  
Student is now an instance of a module. It features a public API with  
a single method\: getName\(..\). This method is able to access the  
private hidden records data.  
WARNING\:  
I should point out that the explicit student data being hard-coded  
into this module definition is just for our illustration purposes. A  
typical module in your program will receive this data from an outside  
source, typically loaded from databases, JSON data files, Ajax calls,  
etc. The data is then injected into the module instance typically  
through method\(s\) on the module’s public API.  
How does the classic module format work?  
Notice that the instance of the module is created by the  
defineStudent\(\) IIFE being executed. This IIFE returns an object  
\(named publicAPI\) that has a property on it referencing the inner  
getName\(..\) function.  
Naming the object publicAPI is stylistic preference on my part. The  
object can be named whatever you like \(JS doesn’t care\), or you can  
just return an object directly without assigning it to any internal  
named variable. More on this choice in Appendix A.  
From the outside, Student.getName\(..\) invokes this exposed inner  
function, which maintains access to the inner records variable via  
closure.  
190 You don’t have to return an object with a function as one of its  
properties. You could just return a function directly, in place of the  
object. That still satisfies all the core bits of a classic module.  
By virtue of how lexical scope works, defining variables and  
functions inside your outer module definition function makes  
everything by default private. Only properties added to the public API  
object returned from the function will be exported for external public  
use.  
The use of an IIFE implies that our program only ever needs a single  
central instance of the module, commonly referred to as a  
“singleton.” Indeed, this specific example is simple enough that  
there’s no obvious reason we’d need anything more than just one  
instance of the Student module.  
Module Factory \(Multiple Instances\)  
But if we did want to define a module that supported multiple  
instances in our program, we can slightly tweak the code\:  
// factory function, not singleton IIFE  
function defineStudent\(\) \{  
var records = \[  
\{ id\: 14, name\: "Kyle"  
\{ id\: 73, name\: "Suzy"  
\{ id\: 112, name\: "Frank"  
\{ id\: 6, name\: "Sarah"  
, grade\: 86 \},  
, grade\: 87 \},  
, grade\: 75 \},  
, grade\: 91 \}  
\];  
var publicAPI = \{  
getName  
191 \};  
return publicAPI;  
// \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
function getName\(studentID\) \{  
var student = records.find\(  
student =\> student.id == studentID  
\);  
return student.name;  
\}  
\}  
var fullTime = defineStudent\(\);  
fullTime.getName\(73\); // Suzy  
Rather than specifying defineStudent\(\) as an IIFE, we just define  
it as a normal standalone function, which is commonly referred to in  
this context as a “module factory” function.  
We then call the module factory, producing an instance of the  
module that we label fullTime. This module instance implies a new  
instance of the inner scope, and thus a new closure that  
getName\(..\) holds over records. fullTime.getName\(..\) now  
invokes the method on that specific instance.  
Classic Module Definition  
So to clarify what makes something a classic module\:  
192 There must be an outer scope, typically from a module factory  
function running at least once.  
The module’s inner scope must have at least one piece of  
hidden information that represents state for the module.  
The module must return on its public API a reference to at least  
one function that has closure over the hidden module state \(so  
that this state is actually preserved\).  
You’ll likely run across other variations on this classic module  
approach, which we’ll look at in more detail in Appendix A.  
# Node CommonJS Modules  
In Chapter 4, we introduced the CommonJS module format used by  
Node. Unlike the classic module format described earlier, where you  
could bundle the module factory or IIFE alongside any other code  
including other modules, CommonJS modules are file-based; one  
module per file.  
Let’s tweak our module example to adhere to that format\:  
module.exports.getName = getName;  
// \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
var records = \[  
\{ id\: 14, name\: "Kyle"  
\{ id\: 73, name\: "Suzy"  
\{ id\: 112, name\: "Frank"  
\{ id\: 6, name\: "Sarah"  
, grade\: 86 \},  
, grade\: 87 \},  
, grade\: 75 \},  
, grade\: 91 \}  
193 \];  
function getName\(studentID\) \{  
var student = records.find\(  
student =\> student.id == studentID  
\);  
return student.name;  
\}  
The records and getName identifiers are in the top-level scope of  
this module, but that’s not the global scope \(as explained in Chapter  
4\). As such, everything here is by default private to the module.  
To expose something on the public API of a CommonJS module, you  
add a property to the empty object provided as module.exports. In  
some older legacy code, you may run across references to just a  
bare exports, but for code clarity you should always fully qualify that  
reference with the module. prefix.  
For style purposes, I like to put my “exports” at the top and my  
module implementation at the bottom. But these exports can be  
placed anywhere. I strongly recommend collecting them all together,  
either at the top or bottom of your file.  
Some developers have the habit of replacing the default exports  
object, like this\:  
// defining a new object for the API  
module.exports = \{  
// ..exports..  
\};  
194 There are some quirks with this approach, including unexpected  
behavior if multiple such modules circularly depend on each other.  
As such, I recommend against replacing the object. If you want to  
assign multiple exports at once, using object literal style definition,  
you can do this instead\:  
Object.assign\(module.exports,\{  
// .. exports ..  
\}\);  
What’s happening here is defining the \{ .. \} object literal with your  
module’s public API specified, and then Object.assign\(..\) is  
performing a shallow copy of all those properties onto the existing  
module.exports object, instead of replacing it This is a nice balance  
of convenience and safer module behavior.  
To include another module instance into your module/program, use  
Node’s require\(..\) method. Assuming this module is located at  
“/path/to/student.js”, this is how we can access it\:  
var Student = require\("/path/to/student.js"\);  
Student.getName\(73\);  
// Suzy  
Student now references the public API of our example module.  
CommonJS modules behave as singleton instances, similar to the  
IIFE module definition style presented before. No matter how many  
times you require\(..\) the same module, you just get additional  
references to the single shared module instance.  
195 require\(..\) is an all-or-nothing mechanism; it includes a reference  
of the entire exposed public API of the module. To effectively access  
only part of the API, the typical approach looks like this\:  
var getName = require\("/path/to/student.js"\).getName;  
// or alternately\:  
var \{ getName \} = require\("/path/to/student.js"\);  
Similar to the classic module format, the publicly exported methods  
of a CommonJS module’s API hold closures over the internal module  
details. That’s how the module singleton state is maintained across  
the lifetime of your program.  
NOTE\:  
In Node require\("student"\) statements, non-absolute paths  
\("student"\) assume a “.js” file extension and search  
“node\_modules”.  
# Modern ES Modules \(ESM\)  
The ESM format shares several similarities with the CommonJS  
format. ESM is file-based, and module instances are singletons, with  
everything private by default. One notable difference is that ESM  
files are assumed to be strict-mode, without needing a "use  
strict" pragma at the top. There’s no way to define an ESM as  
non-strict-mode.  
Instead of module.exports in CommonJS, ESM uses an export  
keyword to expose something on the public API of the module. The  
196 import keyword replaces the require\(..\) statement. Let’s adjust  
“students.js” to use the ESM format\:  
export \{ getName \};  
// \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
var records = \[  
\{ id\: 14, name\: "Kyle"  
\{ id\: 73, name\: "Suzy"  
\{ id\: 112, name\: "Frank"  
\{ id\: 6, name\: "Sarah"  
, grade\: 86 \},  
, grade\: 87 \},  
, grade\: 75 \},  
, grade\: 91 \}  
\];  
function getName\(studentID\) \{  
var student = records.find\(  
student =\> student.id == studentID  
\);  
return student.name;  
\}  
The only change here is the export \{ getName \} statement. As  
before, export statements can appear anywhere throughout the file,  
though export must be at the top-level scope; it cannot be inside  
any other block or function.  
ESM offers a fair bit of variation on how the export statements can  
be specified. For example\:  
export function getName\(studentID\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
197 Even though export appears before the function keyword here,  
this form is still a function declaration that also happens to be  
exported. That is, the getName identifier is function hoisted \(see  
Chapter 5\), so it’s available throughout the whole scope of the  
module.  
Another allowed variation\:  
export default function getName\(studentID\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
This is a so-called “default export,” which has different semantics  
from other exports. In essence, a “default export” is a shorthand for  
consumers of the module when they import, giving them a terser  
syntax when they only need this single default API member.  
Non-default exports are referred to as “named exports.”  
The import keyword—like export, it must be used only at the top  
level of an ESM outside of any blocks or functions—also has a  
number of variations in syntax. The first is referred to as “named  
import”\:  
import \{ getName \} from "/path/to/students.js";  
getName\(73\); // Suzy  
As you can see, this form imports only the specifically named public  
API members from a module \(skipping anything not named  
explicitly\), and it adds those identifiers to the top-level scope of the  
198 current module. This type of import is a familiar style to those used to  
package imports in languages like Java.  
Multiple API members can be listed inside the \{ .. \} set, separated  
with commas. A named import can also be renamed with the as  
keyword\:  
import \{ getName as getStudentName \}  
from "/path/to/students.js";  
getStudentName\(73\);  
// Suzy  
If getName is a “default export” of the module, we can import it like  
this\:  
import getName from "/path/to/students.js";  
getName\(73\); // Suzy  
The only difference here is dropping the \{ \} around the import  
binding. If you want to mix a default import with other named imports\:  
import \{ default as getName, /\*  
from "/path/to/students.js";  
.. others ..  
\*/ \}  
getName\(73\); // Suzy  
By contrast, the other major variation on import is called  
“namespace import”\:  
199 import \* as Student from "/path/to/students.js";  
Student.getName\(73\); // Suzy  
As is likely obvious, the \* imports everything exported to the API,  
default and named, and stores it all under the single namespace  
identifier as specified. This approach most closely matches the form  
of classic modules for most of JS’s history.  
NOTE\:  
As of the time of this writing, modern browsers have supported ESM  
for a few years now, but Node’s stable’ish support for ESM is fairly  
recent, and has been evolving for quite a while. The evolution is  
likely to continue for another year or more; the introduction of ESM  
to JS back in ES6 created a number of challenging compatibility  
concerns for Node’s interop with CommonJS modules. Consult  
Node’s ESM documentation for all the latest details\:  
https\://nodejs.org/api/esm.html  
# Exit Scope  
Whether you use the classic module format \(browser or Node\),  
CommonJS format \(in Node\), or ESM format \(browser or Node\),  
modules are one of the most effective ways to structure and  
organize your program’s functionality and data.  
The module pattern is the conclusion of our journey in this book of  
learning how we can use the rules of lexical scope to place variables  
and functions in proper locations. POLE is the defensive private by  
default posture we always take, making sure we avoid over-  
200 exposure and interact only with the minimal public API surface area  
necessary.  
And underneath modules, the magic of how all our module state is  
maintained is closures leveraging the lexical scope system.  
That’s it for the main text. Congratulations on quite a journey so far!  
As I’ve said numerous times throughout, it’s a really good idea to  
pause, reflect, and practice what we’ve just discussed.  
When you’re comfortable and ready, check out the appendices,  
which dig deeper into some of the corners of these topics, and also  
challenge you with some practice exercises to solidify what you’ve  
learned.  
201 Appendix A\: Exploring Further  
We will now explore a number of nuances and edges around many  
of the topics covered in the main text of this book. This appendix is  
optional, supporting material.  
Some people find diving too deeply into the nuanced corner cases  
and varying opinions creates nothing but noise and distraction—  
supposedly, developers are better served by sticking to the  
commonly-tread paths. My approach has been criticized as being  
impractical and counterproductive. I understand and appreciate that  
perspective, even if I don’t necessarily share it.  
I believe it’s better to be empowered by knowledge of how things  
work than to just gloss over details with assumptions and lack of  
curiosity. Ultimately, you will encounter situations where something  
bubbles up from a piece you hadn’t explored. In other words, you  
won’t get to spend all your time riding on the smooth happy path.  
Wouldn’t you rather be prepared for the inevitable bumps of off-  
roading?  
These discussions will also be more heavily influenced by my  
opinions than the main text was, so keep that in mind as you  
consume and consider what is presented. This appendix is a bit like  
a collection of mini-blog posts that elaborate on various book topics.  
It’s long and deep in the weeds, so take your time and don’t rush  
through everything here.  
# Implied Scopes  
202 Scopes are sometimes created in non-obvious places. In practice,  
these implied scopes don’t often impact your program behavior, but  
it’s still useful to know they’re happening. Keep an eye out for the  
following surprising scopes\:  
Parameter scope  
Function name scope  
Parameter Scope  
The conversation metaphor in Chapter 2 implies that function  
parameters are basically the same as locally declared variables in  
the function scope. But that’s not always true.  
Consider\:  
// outer/global scope\: RED\(1\)  
function getStudentName\(studentID\) \{  
// function scope\: BLUE\(2\)  
// ..  
\}  
Here, studentID is a considered a “simple” parameter, so it does  
behave as a member of the BLUE\(2\) function scope. But if we  
change it to be a non-simple parameter, that’s no longer technically  
the case. Parameter forms considered non-simple include  
parameters with default values, rest parameters \(using ...\), and  
destructured parameters.  
Consider\:  
203 // outer/global scope\: RED\(1\)  
function getStudentName\(/\*BLUE\(2\)\*/ studentID = 0\) \{  
// function scope\: GREEN\(3\)  
// ..  
\}  
Here, the parameter list essentially becomes its own scope, and the  
function’s scope is then nested inside that scope.  
Why? What difference does it make? The non-simple parameter  
forms introduce various corner cases, so the parameter list becomes  
its own scope to more effectively deal with them.  
Consider\:  
function getStudentName\(studentID = maxID, maxID\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
Assuming left-to-right operations, the default = maxID for the  
studentID parameter requires a maxID to already exist \(and to have  
been initialized\). This code produces a TDZ error \(Chapter 5\). The  
reason is that maxID is declared in the parameter scope, but it’s not  
yet been initialized because of the order of parameters. If the  
parameter order is flipped, no TDZ error occurs\:  
function getStudentName\(maxID,studentID = maxID\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
204 The complication gets even more in the weeds if we introduce a  
function expression into the default parameter position, which then  
can create its own closure \(Chapter 7\) over parameters in this  
implied parameter scope\:  
function whatsTheDealHere\(id,defaultID = \(\) =\> id\) \{  
id = 5;  
console.log\( defaultID\(\) \);  
\}  
whatsTheDealHere\(3\);  
// 5  
That snippet probably makes sense, because the defaultID\(\)  
arrow function closes over the id parameter/variable, which we then  
re-assign to 5. But now let’s introduce a shadowing definition of id in  
the function scope\:  
function whatsTheDealHere\(id,defaultID = \(\) =\> id\) \{  
var id = 5;  
console.log\( defaultID\(\) \);  
\}  
whatsTheDealHere\(3\);  
// 3  
Uh oh! The var id = 5 is shadowing the id parameter, but the  
closure of the defaultID\(\) function is over the parameter, not the  
shadowing variable in the function body. This proves there’s a scope  
bubble around the parameter list.  
But it gets even crazier than that!  
205 function whatsTheDealHere\(id,defaultID = \(\) =\> id\) \{  
var id;  
console.log\(\`local variable 'id'\: \$\{ id \}\`\);  
console.log\(  
\`  
parameter 'id' \(closure\)\: \$\{ defaultID\(\) \}\`  
\);  
console.log\("reassigning 'id' to 5"\);  
id = 5;  
console.log\(\`local variable 'id'\: \$\{ id \}\`\);  
console.log\(  
\`  
parameter 'id' \(closure\)\: \$\{ defaultID\(\) \}\`  
\);  
\}  
whatsTheDealHere\(3\);  
// local variable 'id'\: 3 // parameter 'id' \(closure\)\: 3  
// reassigning 'id' to 5  
// local variable 'id'\: 5  
// parameter 'id' \(closure\)\: 3  
\<--- Huh!? Weird!  
The strange bit here is the first console message. At that moment,  
the shadowing id local variable has just been var id declared,  
which Chapter 5 asserts is typically auto-initialized to undefined at  
the top of its scope. Why doesn’t it print undefined?  
In this specific corner case \(for legacy compat reasons\), JS doesn’t  
auto-initialize id to undefined, but rather to the value of the id  
parameter \(3\)!  
206 Though the two ids look at that moment like they’re one variable,  
they’re actually still separate \(and in separate scopes\). The id = 5  
assignment makes the divergence observable, where the id  
parameter stays 3 and the local variable becomes 5.  
My advice to avoid getting bitten by these weird nuances\:  
Never shadow parameters with local variables  
Avoid using a default parameter function that closes over any of  
the parameters  
At least now you’re aware and can be careful about the fact that the  
parameter list is its own scope if any of the parameters are non-  
simple.  
Function Name Scope  
In the “Function Name Scope” section in Chapter 3, I asserted that  
the name of a function expression is added to the function’s own  
scope. Recall\:  
var askQuestion = function ofTheTeacher\(\)\{  
// ..  
\};  
It’s true that ofTheTeacher is not added to the enclosing scope  
\(where askQuestion is declared\), but it’s also not just added to the  
scope of the function, the way you’re likely assuming. It’s another  
strange corner case of implied scope.  
207 The name identifier of a function expression is in its own implied  
scope, nested between the outer enclosing scope and the main inner  
function scope.  
If ofTheTeacher was in the function’s scope, we’d expect an error  
here\:  
var askQuestion = function ofTheTeacher\(\)\{  
// why is this not a duplicate declaration error?  
let ofTheTeacher =  
"Confused, yet?";  
\};  
The let declaration form does not allow re-declaration \(see Chapter  
5\). But this is perfectly legal shadowing, not re-declaration, because  
the two ofTheTeacher identifiers are in separate scopes.  
You’ll rarely run into any case where the scope of a function’s name  
identifier matters. But again, it’s good to know how these  
mechanisms actually work. To avoid being bitten, never shadow  
function name identifiers.  
# Anonymous vs. Named Functions  
As discussed in Chapter 3, functions can be expressed either in  
named or anonymous form. It’s vastly more common to use the  
anonymous form, but is that a good idea?  
As you contemplate naming your functions, consider\:  
Name inference is incomplete  
Lexical names allow self-reference  
Names are useful descriptions  
208 Arrow functions have no lexical names  
IIFEs also need names  
Explicit or Inferred Names?  
Every function in your program has a purpose. If it doesn’t have a  
purpose, take it out, because you’re just wasting space. If it does  
have a purpose, there is a name for that purpose.  
So far many readers likely agree with me. But does that mean we  
should always put that name into the code? Here’s where I’ll raise  
more than a few eyebrows. I say, unequivocally, yes!  
First of all, “anonymous” showing up in stack traces is just not all that  
helpful to debugging\:  
btn.addEventListener\("click"  
,function\(\)\{  
setTimeout\(function\(\)\{  
\["a"  
,42\].map\(function\(v\)\{  
console.log\(v.toUpperCase\(\)\);  
\}\);  
\},100\);  
\}\);  
// Uncaught TypeError\: v.toUpperCase is not a function  
// at myProgram.js\:4  
// at Array.map \(\<anonymous\>\)  
// at myProgram.js\:3  
Ugh. Compare to what is reported if I give the functions names\:  
btn.addEventListener\("click"  
setTimeout\(function waitAMoment\(\)\{  
,function onClick\(\)\{  
209 \["a"  
,42\].map\(function allUpper\(v\)\{  
console.log\(v.toUpperCase\(\)\);  
\}\);  
\},100\);  
\}\);  
// Uncaught TypeError\: v.toUpperCase is not a function  
// at allUpper \(myProgram.js\:4\)  
// at Array.map \(\<anonymous\>\)  
// at waitAMoment \(myProgram.js\:3\)  
See how waitAMoment and allUpper names appear and give the  
stack trace more useful information/context for debugging? The  
program is more debuggable if we use reasonable names for all our  
functions.  
NOTE\:  
The unfortunate “\<anonymous\>” that still shows up refers to the fact  
that the implementation of Array.map\(..\) isn’t present in our  
program, but is built into the JS engine. It’s not from any confusion  
our program introduces with readability shortcuts.  
By the way, let’s make sure we’re on the same page about what a  
named function is\:  
function thisIsNamed\(\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
ajax\("some.url"  
// ..  
,function thisIsAlsoNamed\(\)\{  
\}\);  
210 var notNamed = function\(\)\{  
// ..  
\};  
makeRequest\(\{  
data\: 42,  
cb /\* also not a name \*/\: function\(\)\{  
// ..  
\}  
\}\);  
var stillNotNamed = function butThisIs\(\)\{  
// ..  
\};  
“But wait!”, you say. Some of those are named, right!?  
var notNamed = function\(\)\{  
// ..  
\};  
var config = \{  
cb\: function\(\)\{  
// ..  
\}  
\};  
notNamed.name;  
// notNamed  
config.cb.name;  
// cb  
211 These are referred to as inferred names. Inferred names are fine, but  
they don’t really address the full concern I’m discussing.  
Missing Names?  
Yes, these inferred names might show up in stack traces, which is  
definitely better than “anonymous” showing up. But…  
function ajax\(url,cb\) \{  
console.log\(cb.name\);  
\}  
ajax\("some.url"  
// ..  
,function\(\)\{  
\}\);  
// ""  
Oops. Anonymous function expressions passed as callbacks are  
incapable of receiving an inferred name, so cb.name holds just the  
empty string ""  
. The vast majority of all function expressions,  
especially anonymous ones, are used as callback arguments; none  
of these get a name. So relying on name inference is incomplete, at  
best.  
And it’s not just callbacks that fall short with inference\:  
var config = \{\};  
config.cb = function\(\)\{  
// ..  
\};  
212 config.cb.name;  
// ""  
var \[ noName \] = \[ function\(\)\{\} \];  
noName.name  
// ""  
Any assignment of a function expression that’s not a simple  
assignment will also fail name inferencing. So, in other words, unless  
you’re careful and intentional about it, essentially almost all  
anonymous function expressions in your program will in fact have  
no name at all.  
Name inference is just… not enough.  
And even if a function expression does get an inferred name, that  
still doesn’t count as being a full named function.  
Who am I?  
Without a lexical name identifier, the function has no internal way to  
refer to itself. Self-reference is important for things like recursion and  
event handling\:  
// broken  
runOperation\(function\(num\)\{  
if \(num \<= 1\) return 1;  
return num \* oopsNoNameToCall\(num - 1\);  
\}\);  
// also broken  
btn.addEventListener\("click"  
,function\(\)\{  
213 console.log\("should only respond to one click!"\);  
btn.removeEventListener\("click"  
,oopsNoNameHere\);  
\}\);  
Leaving off the lexical name from your callback makes it harder to  
reliably self-reference the function. You could declare a variable in an  
enclosing scope that references the function, but this variable is  
controlled by that enclosing scope—it could be re-assigned, etc.—so  
it’s not as reliable as the function having its own internal self-  
reference.  
Names are Descriptors  
Lastly, and I think most importantly of all, leaving off a name from a  
function makes it harder for the reader to tell what the function’s  
purpose is, at a quick glance. They have to read more of the code,  
including the code inside the function, and the surrounding code  
outside the function, to figure it out.  
Consider\:  
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \].filter\(function\(v\)\{  
return v % 2 == 1;  
\}\);  
// \[ 1, 3, 5 \]  
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \].filter\(function keepOnlyOdds\(v\)\{  
return v % 2 == 1;  
\}\);  
// \[ 1, 3, 5 \]  
214 There’s just no reasonable argument to be made that omitting the  
name keepOnlyOdds from the first callback more effectively  
communicates to the reader the purpose of this callback. You saved  
13 characters, but lost important readability information. The name  
keepOnlyOdds very clearly tells the reader, at a quick first glance,  
what’s happening.  
The JS engine doesn’t care about the name. But human readers of  
your code absolutely do.  
Can the reader look at v % 2 == 1 and figure out what it’s doing?  
Sure. But they have to infer the purpose \(and name\) by mentally  
executing the code. Even a brief pause to do so slows down reading  
of the code. A good descriptive name makes this process almost  
effortless and instant.  
Think of it this way\: how many times does the author of this code  
need to figure out the purpose of a function before adding the name  
to the code? About once. Maybe two or three times if they need to  
adjust the name. But how many times will readers of this code have  
to figure out the name/purpose? Every single time this line is ever  
read. Hundreds of times? Thousands? More?  
No matter the length or complexity of the function, my assertion is,  
the author should figure out a good descriptive name and add it to  
the code. Even the one-liner functions in map\(..\) and then\(..\)  
statements should be named\:  
lookupTheRecords\(someData\)  
.then\(function extractSalesRecords\(resp\)\{  
return resp.allSales;  
215 \}\)  
.then\(storeRecords\);  
The name extractSalesRecords tells the reader the purpose of this  
then\(..\) handler better than just inferring that purpose from  
mentally executing return resp.allSales.  
The only excuse for not including a name on a function is either  
laziness \(don’t want to type a few extra characters\) or uncreativity  
\(can’t come up with a good name\). If you can’t figure out a good  
name, you likely don’t understand the function and its purpose yet.  
The function is perhaps poorly designed, or it does too many things,  
and should be re-worked. Once you have a well-designed, single-  
purpose function, its proper name should become evident.  
Here’s a trick I use\: while first writing a function, if I don’t fully  
understand its purpose and can’t think of a good name to use, I just  
use TODO as the name. That way, later when reviewing my code, I’m  
likely to find those name placeholders, and I’m more inclined \(and  
more prepared!\) to go back and figure out a better name, rather than  
just leave it as TODO.  
All functions need names. Every single one. No exceptions. Any  
name you omit is making the program harder to read, harder to  
debug, harder to extend and maintain later.  
Arrow Functions  
Arrow functions are always anonymous, even if \(rarely\) they’re used  
in a way that gives them an inferred name. I just spent several pages  
explaining why anonymous functions are a bad idea, so you can  
probably guess what I think about arrow functions.  
216 Don’t use them as a general replacement for regular functions.  
They’re more concise, yes, but that brevity comes at the cost of  
omitting key visual delimiters that help our brains quickly parse out  
what we’re reading. And, to the point of this discussion, they’re  
anonymous, which makes them worse for readability from that angle  
as well.  
Arrow functions have a purpose, but that purpose is not to save  
keystrokes. Arrow functions have lexical this behavior, which is  
somewhat beyond the bounds of our discussion in this book.  
Briefly\: arrow functions don’t define a this identifier keyword at all. If  
you use a this inside an arrow function, it behaves exactly as any  
other variable reference, which is that the scope chain is consulted  
to find a function scope \(non-arrow function\) where it is defined, and  
to use that one.  
In other words, arrow functions treat this like any other lexical  
variable.  
If you’re used to hacks like var self = this, or if you prefer to call  
.bind\(this\) on inner function expressions, just to force them to  
inherit a this from an outer function like it was a lexical variable,  
then =\> arrow functions are absolutely the better option. They’re  
designed specifically to fix that problem.  
So, in the rare cases you need lexical this, use an arrow function. It’s  
the best tool for that job. But just be aware that in doing so, you’re  
accepting the downsides of an anonymous function. You should  
expend additional effort to mitigate the readability cost, such as more  
descriptive variable names and code comments.  
217 IIFE Variations  
All functions should have names. I said that a few times, right!? That  
includes IIFEs.  
\(function\(\)\{  
// don't do this!  
\}\)\(\);  
\(function doThisInstead\(\)\{  
// ..  
\}\)\(\);  
How do we come up with a name for an IIFE? Identify what the IIFE  
is there for. Why do you need a scope in that spot? Are you hiding a  
cache variable for student records?  
var getStudents = \(function StoreStudentRecords\(\)\{  
var studentRecords = \[\];  
return function getStudents\(\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
\}\)\(\);  
I named the IIFE StoreStudentRecords because that’s what it’s  
doing\: storing student records. Every IIFE should have a name. No  
exceptions.  
IIFEs are typically defined by placing \( .. \) around the function  
expression, as shown in those previous snippets. But that’s not the  
only way to define an IIFE. Technically, the only reason we’re using  
218 that first surrounding set of \( .. \) is just so the function keyword  
isn’t in a position to qualify as a function declaration to the JS  
parser. But there are other syntactic ways to avoid being parsed as a  
declaration\:  
!function thisIsAnIIFE\(\)\{  
// ..  
\}\(\);  
+function soIsThisOne\(\)\{  
// ..  
\}\(\);  
\~function andThisOneToo\(\)\{  
// ..  
\}\(\);  
The !, +,  
\~, and several other unary operators \(operators with one  
operand\) can all be placed in front of function to turn it into an  
expression. Then the final \(\) call is valid, which makes it an IIFE.  
I actually kind of like using the void unary operator when defining a  
standalone IIFE\:  
void function yepItsAnIIFE\(\) \{  
// ..  
\}\(\);  
The benefit of void is, it clearly communicates at the beginning of  
the function that this IIFE won’t be returning any value.  
219 However you define your IIFEs, show them some love by giving  
them names.  
# Hoisting\: Functions and Variables  
Chapter 5 articulated both function hoisting and variable hoisting.  
Since hoisting is often cited as mistake in the design of JS, I wanted  
to briefly explore why both these forms of hoisting can be beneficial  
and should still be considered.  
Give hoisting a deeper level of consideration by considering the  
merits of\:  
Executable code first, function declarations last  
Semantic placement of variable declarations  
Function Hoisting  
To review, this program works because of function hoisting\:  
getStudents\(\);  
// ..  
function getStudents\(\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
The function declaration is hoisted during compilation, which  
means that getStudents is an identifier declared for the entire  
scope. Additionally, the getStudents identifier is auto-initialized with  
the function reference, again at the beginning of the scope.  
220 Why is this useful? The reason I prefer to take advantage of function  
hoisting is that it puts the executable code in any scope at the top,  
and any further declarations \(functions\) below. This means it’s easier  
to find the code that will run in any given area, rather than having to  
scroll and scroll, hoping to find a trailing \} marking the end of a  
scope/function somewhere.  
I take advantage of this inverse positioning in all levels of scope\:  
getStudents\(\);  
// \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
function getStudents\(\) \{  
var whatever = doSomething\(\);  
// other stuff  
return whatever;  
// \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
function doSomething\(\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
\}  
When I first open a file like that, the very first line is executable code  
that kicks off its behavior. That’s very easy to spot! Then, if I ever  
need to go find and inspect getStudents\(\), I like that its first line is  
also executable code. Only if I need to see the details of  
doSomething\(\) do I go and find its definition down below.  
221 In other words, I think function hoisting makes code more readable  
through a flowing, progressive reading order, from top to bottom.  
Variable Hoisting  
What about variable hoisting?  
Even though let and const hoist, you cannot use those variables in  
their TDZ \(see Chapter 5\). So, the following discussion only applies  
to var declarations. Before I continue, I’ll admit\: in almost all cases, I  
completely agree that variable hoisting is a bad idea\:  
pleaseDontDoThis =  
// much later  
var pleaseDontDoThis;  
"bad idea";  
While that kind of inverted ordering was helpful for function hoisting,  
here I think it usually makes code harder to reason about.  
But there’s one exception that I’ve found, somewhat rarely, in my  
own coding. It has to do with where I place my var declarations  
inside a CommonJS module definition.  
Here’s how I typically structure my module definitions in Node\:  
// dependencies  
var aModuleINeed = require\("very-helpful"\);  
var anotherModule = require\("kinda-helpful"\);  
// public API  
var publicAPI = Object.assign\(module.exports,\{  
222 getStudents,  
addStudents,  
// ..  
\}\);  
// \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
// private implementation  
var cache = \{ \};  
var otherData = \[ \];  
function getStudents\(\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
function addStudents\(\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
Notice how the cache and otherData variables are in the “private”  
section of the module layout? That’s because I don’t plan to expose  
them publicly. So I organize the module so they’re located alongside  
the other hidden implementation details of the module.  
But I’ve had a few rare cases where I needed the assignments of  
those values to happen above, before I declare the exported public  
API of the module. For instance\:  
// public API  
var publicAPI = Object.assign\(module.exports,\{  
getStudents,  
addStudents,  
223 refreshData\: refreshData.bind\(null,cache\)  
\}\);  
I need the cache variable to have already been assigned a value,  
because that value is used in the initialization of the public API \(the  
.bind\(..\) partial-application\).  
Should I just move the var cache = \{ .. \} up to the top, above  
this public API initialization? Well, perhaps. But now it’s less obvious  
that var cache is a private implementation detail. Here’s the  
compromise I’ve \(somewhat rarely\) used\:  
cache = \{\}; // used here, but declared below  
// public API  
var publicAPI = Object.assign\(module.exports,\{  
getStudents,  
addStudents,  
refreshData\: refreshData.bind\(null,cache\)  
\}\);  
// \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
// private implementation  
var cache /\* = \{\}\*/;  
See the variable hoisting? I’ve declared the cache down where it  
belongs, logically, but in this rare case I’ve used it earlier up above,  
in the area where its initialization is needed. I even left a hint at the  
value that’s assigned to cache in a code comment.  
224 That’s literally the only case I’ve ever found for leveraging variable  
hoisting to assign a variable earlier in a scope than its declaration.  
But I think it’s a reasonable exception to employ with caution.  
The Case for var  
Speaking of variable hoisting, let’s have some real talk for a bit about  
var, a favorite villain devs love to blame for many of the woes of JS  
development. In Chapter 5, we explored let/const and promised  
we’d revisit where var falls in the whole mix.  
As I lay out the case, don’t miss\:  
var was never broken  
let is your friend  
const has limited utility  
The best of both worlds\: var and let  
Don’t Throw Out var  
var is fine, and works just fine. It’s been around for 25 years, and it’ll  
be around and useful and functional for another 25 years or more.  
Claims that var is broken, deprecated, outdated, dangerous, or ill-  
designed are bogus bandwagoning.  
Does that mean var is the right declarator for every single  
declaration in your program? Certainly not. But it still has its place in  
your programs. Refusing to use it because someone on the team  
chose an aggressive linter opinion that chokes on var is cutting off  
your nose to spite your face.  
225 OK, now that I’ve got you really riled up, let me try to explain my  
position.  
For the record, I’m a fan of let, for block-scoped declarations. I  
really dislike TDZ and I think that was a mistake. But let itself is  
great. I use it often. In fact, I probably use it as much or more than I  
use var.  
const-antly Confused  
const on the other hand, I don’t use as often. I’m not going to dig  
into all the reasons why, but it comes down to const not carrying its  
own weight. That is, while there’s a tiny bit of benefit of const in  
some cases, that benefit is outweighed by the long history of  
troubles around const confusion in a variety of languages, long  
before it ever showed up in JS.  
const pretends to create values that can’t be mutated—a  
misconception that’s extremely common in developer communities  
across many languages—whereas what it really does is prevent re-  
assignment.  
const studentIDs = \[ 14, 73, 112 \];  
// later  
studentIDs.push\(6\); // whoa, wait... what!?  
Using a const with a mutable value \(like an array or object\) is asking  
for a future developer \(or reader of your code\) to fall into the trap you  
set, which was that they either didn’t know, or sorta forgot, that value  
immutability isn’t at all the same thing as assignment immutability.  
226 I just don’t think we should set those traps. The only time I ever use  
const is when I’m assigning an already-immutable value \(like 42 or  
"Hello, friends!"\), and when it’s clearly a “constant” in the sense  
of being a named placeholder for a literal value, for semantic  
purposes. That’s what const is best used for. That’s pretty rare in my  
code, though.  
If variable re-assignment were a big deal, then const would be more  
useful. But variable re-assignment just isn’t that big of a deal in terms  
of causing bugs. There’s a long list of things that lead to bugs in  
programs, but “accidental re-assignment” is way, way down that list.  
Combine that with the fact that const \(and let\) are supposed to be  
used in blocks, and blocks are supposed to be short, and you have a  
really small area of your code where a const declaration is even  
applicable. A const on line 1 of your ten-line block only tells you  
something about the next nine lines. And the thing it tells you is  
already obvious by glancing down at those nine lines\: the variable is  
never on the left-hand side of an =; it’s not re-assigned.  
That’s it, that’s all const really does. Other than that, it’s not very  
useful. Stacked up against the significant confusion of value  
vs. assignment immutability, const loses a lot of its luster.  
A let \(or var!\) that’s never re-assigned is already behaviorally a  
“constant”, even though it doesn’t have the compiler guarantee.  
That’s good enough in most cases.  
var and let  
In my mind, const is pretty rarely useful, so this is only two-horse  
race between let and var. But it’s not really a race either, because  
227 there doesn’t have to be just one winner. They can both win…  
different races.  
The fact is, you should be using both var and let in your programs.  
They are not interchangeable\: you shouldn’t use var where a let is  
called for, but you also shouldn’t use let where a var is most  
appropriate.  
So where should we still use var? Under what circumstances is it a  
better choice than let?  
For one, I always use var in the top-level scope of any function,  
regardless of whether that’s at the beginning, middle, or end of the  
function. I also use var in the global scope, though I try to minimize  
usage of the global scope.  
Why use var for function scoping? Because that’s exactly what var  
does. There literally is no better tool for the job of function scoping a  
declaration than a declarator that has, for 25 years, done exactly  
that.  
You could use let in this top-level scope, but it’s not the best tool for  
that job. I also find that if you use let everywhere, then it’s less  
obvious which declarations are designed to be localized and which  
ones are intended to be used throughout the function.  
By contrast, I rarely use a var inside a block. That’s what let is for.  
Use the best tool for the job. If you see a let, it tells you that you’re  
dealing with a localized declaration. If you see var, it tells you that  
you’re dealing with a function-wide declaration. Simple as that.  
228 function getStudents\(data\) \{  
var studentRecords = \[\];  
for \(let record of data.records\) \{  
let id =  
\`  
student-\$\{ record.id \}\`  
studentRecords.push\(\{  
id,  
record.name  
;  
\}\);  
\}  
return studentRecords;  
\}  
The studentRecords variable is intended for use across the whole  
function. var is the best declarator to tell the reader that. By contrast,  
record and id are intended for use only in the narrower scope of the  
loop iteration, so let is the best tool for that job.  
In addition to this best tool semantic argument, var has a few other  
characteristics that, in certain limited circumstances, make it more  
powerful.  
One example is when a loop is exclusively using a variable, but its  
conditional clause cannot see block-scoped declarations inside the  
iteration\:  
function commitAction\(\) \{  
do \{  
let result = commit\(\);  
var done = result && result.code == 1;  
229 \} while \(!done\);  
\}  
Here, result is clearly only used inside the block, so we use let.  
But done is a bit different. It’s only useful for the loop, but the while  
clause cannot see let declarations that appear inside the loop. So  
we compromise and use var, so that done is hoisted to the outer  
scope where it can be seen.  
The alternative—declaring done outside the loop—separates it from  
where it’s first used, and either necessitates picking a default value  
to assign, or worse, leaving it unassigned and thus looking  
ambiguous to the reader. I think var inside the loop is preferable  
here.  
Another helpful characteristic of var is seen with declarations inside  
unintended blocks. Unintended blocks are blocks that are created  
because the syntax requires a block, but where the intent of the  
developer is not really to create a localized scope. The best  
illustration of unintended scope is the try..catch statement\:  
function getStudents\(\) \{  
try \{  
// not really a block scope  
var records = fromCache\("students"\);  
\}  
catch \(err\) \{  
// oops, fall back to a default  
var records = \[\];  
\}  
// ..  
\}  
230 There are other ways to structure this code, yes. But I think this is  
the best way, given various trade-offs.  
I don’t want to declare records \(with var or let\) outside of the try  
block, and then assign to it in one or both blocks. I prefer initial  
declarations to always be as close as possible \(ideally, same line\) to  
the first usage of the variable. In this simple example, that would only  
be a couple of lines distance, but in real code it can grow to many  
more lines. The bigger the gap, the harder it is to figure out what  
variable from what scope you’re assigning to. var used at the actual  
assignment makes it less ambiguous.  
Also notice I used var in both the try and catch blocks. That’s  
because I want to signal to the reader that no matter which path is  
taken, records always gets declared. Technically, that works  
because var is hoisted once to the function scope. But it’s still a nice  
semantic signal to remind the reader what either var ensures. If var  
were only used in one of the blocks, and you were only reading the  
other block, you wouldn’t as easily discover where records was  
coming from.  
This is, in my opinion, a little superpower of var. Not only can it  
escape the unintentional try..catch blocks, but it’s allowed to  
appear multiple times in a function’s scope. You can’t do that with  
let. It’s not bad, it’s actually a little helpful feature. Think of var more  
like a declarative annotation that’s reminding you, each usage,  
where the variable comes from. “Ah ha, right, it belongs to the whole  
function.”  
This repeated-annotation superpower is useful in other cases\:  
231 function getStudents\(\) \{  
var data = \[\];  
// do something with data  
// .. 50 more lines of code ..  
// purely an annotation to remind us  
var data;  
// use data again  
// ..  
\}  
The second var data is not re-declaring data, it’s just annotating for  
the readers’ benefit that data is a function-wide declaration. That  
way, the reader doesn’t need to scroll up 50+ lines of code to find the  
initial declaration.  
I’m perfectly fine with re-using variables for multiple purposes  
throughout a function scope. I’m also perfectly fine with having two  
usages of a variable be separated by quite a few lines of code. In  
both cases, the ability to safely “re-declare” \(annotate\) with var helps  
make sure I can tell where my data is coming from, no matter where  
I am in the function.  
Again, sadly, let cannot do this.  
There are other nuances and scenarios when var turns out to offer  
some assistance, but I’m not going to belabor the point any further.  
The takeaway is that var can be useful in our programs alongside  
let \(and the occasional const\). Are you willing to creatively use the  
tools the JS language provides to tell a richer story to your readers?  
232 Don’t just throw away a useful tool like var because someone  
shamed you into thinking it wasn’t cool anymore. Don’t avoid var  
because you got confused once years ago. Learn these tools and  
use them each for what they’re best at.  
# What’s the Deal with TDZ?  
The TDZ \(temporal dead zone\) was explained in Chapter 5. We  
illustrated how it occurs, but we skimmed over any explanation of  
why it was necessary to introduce in the first place. Let’s look briefly  
at the motivations of TDZ.  
Some breadcrumbs in the TDZ origin story\:  
consts should never change  
It’s all about time  
Should let behave more like const or var?  
Where It All Started  
TDZ comes from const, actually.  
During early ES6 development work, TC39 had to decide whether  
const \(and let\) were going to hoist to the top of their blocks. They  
decided these declarations would hoist, similar to how var does.  
Had that not been the case, I think some of the fear was confusion  
with mid-scope shadowing, such as\:  
let greeting =  
"Hi!";  
\{  
// what should print here?  
233 console.log\(greeting\);  
// .. a bunch of lines of code ..  
// now shadowing the  
\`  
greeting  
\`  
let greeting =  
"Hello, friends!";  
variable  
// ..  
\}  
What should we do with that console.log\(..\) statement? Would it  
make any sense to JS devs for it to print “Hi!”? Seems like that could  
be a gotcha, to have shadowing kick in only for the second half of  
the block, but not the first half. That’s not very intuitive, JS-like  
behavior. So let and const have to hoist to the top of the block,  
visible throughout.  
But if let and const hoist to the top of the block \(like var hoists to  
the top of a function\), why don’t let and const auto-initialize \(to  
undefined\) the way var does? Here was the main concern\:  
\{  
// what should print here?  
console.log\(studentName\);  
// later  
const studentName =  
"Frank";  
// ..  
\}  
234 Let’s imagine that studentName not only hoisted to the top of this  
block, but was also auto-initialized to undefined. For the first half of  
the block, studentName could be observed to have the undefined  
value, such as with our console.log\(..\) statement. Once the  
const studentName = .. statement is reached, now studentName  
is assigned "Frank". From that point forward, studentName can’t  
ever be re-assigned.  
But, is it strange or surprising that a constant observably has two  
different values, first undefined, then "Frank"? That does seem to  
go against what we think a constant means; it should only ever be  
observable with one value.  
So… now we have a problem. We can’t auto-initialize studentName  
to undefined \(or any other value for that matter\). But the variable  
has to exist throughout the whole scope. What do we do with the  
period of time from when it first exists \(beginning of scope\) and when  
it’s assigned its value?  
We call this period of time the “dead zone,” as in the “temporal dead  
zone” \(TDZ\). To prevent confusion, it was determined that any sort of  
access of a variable while in its TDZ is illegal and must result in the  
TDZ error.  
OK, that line of reasoning does make some sense, I must admit.  
Who let the TDZ Out?  
But that’s just const. What about let?  
Well, TC39 made the decision\: since we need a TDZ for const, we  
might as well have a TDZ for let as well. In fact, if we make let have  
235 a TDZ, then we discourage all that ugly variable hoisting people do.  
So there was a consistency perspective and, perhaps, a bit of social  
engineering to shift developers’ behavior.  
My counter-argument would be\: if you’re favoring consistency, be  
consistent with var instead of const; let is definitely more like var  
than const. That’s especially true since they had already chosen  
consistency with var for the whole hoisting-to-the-top-of-the-scope  
thing. Let const be its own unique deal with a TDZ, and let the  
answer to TDZ purely be\: just avoid the TDZ by always declaring  
your constants at the top of the scope. I think this would have been  
more reasonable.  
But alas, that’s not how it landed. let has a TDZ because const  
needs a TDZ, because let and const mimic var in their hoisting to  
the top of the \(block\) scope. There ya go. Too circular? Read it again  
a few times.  
# Are Synchronous Callbacks Still  
# Closures?  
Chapter 7 presented two different models for tackling closure\:  
Closure is a function instance remembering its outer variables  
even as that function is passed around and invoked in other  
scopes.  
Closure is a function instance and its scope environment being  
preserved in-place while any references to it are passed around  
and invoked from other scopes.  
236 These models are not wildly divergent, but they do approach from a  
different perspective. And that different perspective changes what we  
identify as a closure.  
Don’t get lost following this rabbit trail through closures and  
callbacks\:  
Calling back to what \(or where\)?  
Maybe “synchronous callback” isn’t the best label  
IIF functions don’t move around, why would they need closure?  
Deferring over time is key to closure  
What is a Callback?  
Before we revisit closure, let me spend a brief moment addressing  
the word “callback.” It’s a generally accepted norm that saying  
“callback” is synonymous with both asynchronous callbacks and  
synchronous callbacks. I don’t think I agree that this is a good idea,  
so I want to explain why and propose we move away from that to  
another term.  
Let’s first consider an asynchronous callback, a function reference  
that will be invoked at some future later point. What does “callback”  
mean, in this case?  
It means that the current code has finished or paused, suspended  
itself, and that when the function in question is invoked later,  
execution is entering back into the suspended program, resuming it.  
Specifically, the point of re-entry is the code that was wrapped in the  
function reference\:  
237 setTimeout\(function waitForASecond\(\)\{  
// this is where JS should call back into  
// the program when the timer has elapsed  
\},1000\);  
// this is where the current program finishes  
// or suspends  
In this context, “calling back” makes a lot of sense. The JS engine is  
resuming our suspended program by calling back in at a specific  
location. OK, so a callback is asynchronous.  
Synchronous Callback?  
But what about synchronous callbacks? Consider\:  
function getLabels\(studentIDs\) \{  
return studentIDs.map\(  
function formatIDLabel\(id\)\{  
return  
\`Student ID\: \$\{  
String\(id\).padStart\(6\)  
\}\`  
;  
\}  
\);  
\}  
getLabels\(\[ 14, 73, 112, 6 \]\);  
// \[  
// "Student ID\: 000014"  
,  
// "Student ID\: 000073"  
,  
// "Student ID\: 000112"  
,  
238 // "Student ID\: 000006"  
// \]  
Should we refer to formatIDLabel\(..\) as a callback? Is the  
map\(..\) utility really calling back into our program by invoking the  
function we provided?  
There’s nothing to call back into per se, because the program hasn’t  
paused or exited. We’re passing a function \(reference\) from one part  
of the program to another part of the program, and then it’s  
immediately invoked.  
There’s other established terms that might match what we’re doing—  
passing in a function \(reference\) so that another part of the program  
can invoke it on our behalf. You might think of this as Dependency  
Injection \(DI\) or Inversion of Control \(IoC\).  
DI can be summarized as passing in necessary part\(s\) of  
functionality to another part of the program so that it can invoke them  
to complete its work. That’s a decent description for the map\(..\) call  
above, isn’t it? The map\(..\) utility knows to iterate over the list’s  
values, but it doesn’t know what to do with those values. That’s why  
we pass it the formatIDLabel\(..\) function. We pass in the  
dependency.  
IoC is a pretty similar, related concept. Inversion of control means  
that instead of the current area of your program controlling what’s  
happening, you hand control off to another part of the program. We  
wrapped the logic for computing a label string in the function  
formatIDLabel\(..\), then handed invocation control to the map\(..\)  
utility.  
239 Notably, Martin Fowler cites IoC as the difference between a  
framework and a library\: with a library, you call its functions; with a  
framework, it calls your functions. 1  
In the context of our discussion, either DI or IoC could work as an  
alternative label for a synchronous callback.  
But I have a different suggestion. Let’s refer to \(the functions  
formerly known as\) synchronous callbacks, as inter-invoked  
functions \(IIFs\). Yes, exactly, I’m playing off IIFEs. These kinds of  
functions are inter-invoked, meaning\: another entity invokes them, as  
opposed to IIFEs, which invoke themselves immediately.  
What’s the relationship between an asynchronous callback and an  
IIF? An asynchronous callback is an IIF that’s invoked  
asynchronously instead of synchronously.  
Synchronous Closure?  
Now that we’ve re-labeled synchronous callbacks as IIFs, we can  
return to our main question\: are IIFs an example of closure?  
Obviously, the IIF would have to reference variable\(s\) from an outer  
scope for it to have any chance of being a closure. The  
formatIDLabel\(..\) IIF from earlier does not reference any  
variables outside its own scope, so it’s definitely not a closure.  
What about an IIF that does have external references, is that  
closure?  
function printLabels\(labels\) \{  
var list = document.getElementByID\("labelsList"\);  
240 labels.forEach\(  
function renderLabel\(label\)\{  
var li = document.createELement\("li"\);  
li.innerText = label;  
list.appendChild\(li\);  
\}  
\);  
\}  
The inner renderLabel\(..\) IIF references list from the enclosing  
scope, so it’s an IIF that could have closure. But here’s where the  
definition/model we choose for closure matters\:  
If renderLabel\(..\) is a function that gets passed  
somewhere else, and that function is then invoked, then yes,  
renderLabel\(..\) is exercising a closure, because closure is  
what preserved its access to its original scope chain.  
But if, as in the alternative conceptual model from Chapter 7,  
renderLabel\(..\) stays in place, and only a reference to it is  
passed to forEach\(..\), is there any need for closure to  
preserve the scope chain of renderLabel\(..\), while it  
executes synchronously right inside its own scope?  
No. That’s just normal lexical scope.  
To understand why, consider this alternative form of  
printLabels\(..\)\:  
function printLabels\(labels\) \{  
var list = document.getElementByID\("labelsList"\);  
241 for \(let label of labels\) \{  
// just a normal function call in its own  
// scope, right? That's not really closure!  
renderLabel\(label\);  
\}  
// \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
function renderLabel\(label\) \{  
var li = document.createELement\("li"\);  
li.innerText = label;  
list.appendChild\(li\);  
\}  
\}  
These two versions of printLabels\(..\) are essentially the same.  
The latter one is definitely not an example of closure, at least not in  
any useful or observable sense. It’s just lexical scope. The former  
version, with forEach\(..\) calling our function reference, is  
essentially the same thing. It’s also not closure, but rather just a plain  
ol’ lexical scope function call.  
Defer to Closure  
By the way, Chapter 7 briefly mentioned partial application and  
currying \(which do rely on closure!\). This is a interesting scenario  
where manual currying can be used\:  
function printLabels\(labels\) \{  
var list = document.getElementByID\("labelsList"\);  
var renderLabel = renderTo\(list\);  
242 // definitely closure this time!  
labels.forEach\( renderLabel \);  
// \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
function renderTo\(list\) \{  
return function createLabel\(label\)\{  
var li = document.createELement\("li"\);  
li.innerText = label;  
list.appendChild\(li\);  
\};  
\}  
\}  
The inner function createLabel\(..\), which we assign to  
renderLabel, is closed over list, so closure is definitely being  
utilized.  
Closure allows us to remember list for later, while we defer  
execution of the actual label-creation logic from the renderTo\(..\)  
call to the subsequent forEach\(..\) invocations of the  
createLabel\(..\) IIF. That may only be a brief moment here, but  
any amount of time could pass, as closure bridges from call to call.  
# Classic Module Variations  
Chapter 8 explained the classic module pattern, which can look like  
this\:  
var StudentList = \(function defineModule\(Student\)\{  
var elems = \[\];  
243 var publicAPI = \{  
renderList\(\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
\};  
return publicAPI;  
\}\)\(Student\);  
Notice that we’re passing Student \(another module instance\) in as a  
dependency. But there’s lots of useful variations on this module form  
you may encounter. Some hints for recognizing these variations\:  
Does the module know about its own API?  
Even if we use a fancy module loader, it’s just a classic module  
Some modules need to work universally  
Where’s My API?  
First, most classic modules don’t define and use a publicAPI the  
way I have shown in this code. Instead, they typically look like\:  
var StudentList = \(function defineModule\(Student\)\{  
var elems = \[\];  
return \{  
renderList\(\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
\};  
244 \}\)\(Student\);  
The only difference here is directly returning the object that serves  
as the public API for the module, as opposed to first saving it to an  
inner publicAPI variable. This is by far how most classic modules  
are defined.  
But I strongly prefer, and always use myself, the former publicAPI  
form. Two reasons\:  
publicAPI is a semantic descriptor that aids readability by  
making it more obvious what the purpose of the object is.  
Storing an inner publicAPI variable that references the same  
external public API object returned, can be useful if you need to  
access or modify the API during the lifetime of the module.  
For example, you may want to call one of the publicly exposed  
functions, from inside the module. Or, you may want to add or  
remove methods depending on certain conditions, or update the  
value of an exposed property.  
Whatever the case may be, it just seems rather silly to me that  
we wouldn’t maintain a reference to access our own API. Right?  
Asynchronous Module Defintion \(AMD\)  
Another variation on the classic module form is AMD-style modules  
\(popular several years back\), such as those supported by the  
RequireJS utility\:  
245 define\(\[ "  
./Student" \],function StudentList\(Student\)\{  
var elems = \[\];  
return \{  
renderList\(\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
\};  
\}\);  
If you look closely at StudentList\(..\), it’s a classic module factory  
function. Inside the machinery of define\(..\) \(provided by  
RequireJS\), the StudentList\(..\) function is executed, passing to it  
any other module instances declared as dependencies. The return  
value is an object representing the public API for the module.  
This is based on exactly the same principles \(including how the  
closure works!\) as we explored with classic modules.  
Universal Modules \(UMD\)  
The final variation we’ll look at is UMD, which is less a specific, exact  
format and more a collection of very similar formats. It was designed  
to create better interop \(without any build-tool conversion\) for  
modules that may be loaded in browsers, by AMD-style loaders, or in  
Node. I personally still publish many of my utility libraries using a  
form of UMD.  
Here’s the typical structure of a UMD\:  
\(function UMD\(name,context,definition\)\{  
// loaded by an AMD-style loader?  
246 if \(  
typeof define ===  
define.amd  
"function" &&  
\) \{  
define\(definition\);  
\}  
// in Node?  
else if \(  
typeof module !==  
module.exports  
"undefined" &&  
\) \{  
module.exports = definition\(name,context\);  
\}  
else \{  
// assume standalone browser script  
context\[name\] = definition\(name,context\);  
\}  
\}\)\("StudentList"  
,this,function DEF\(name,context\)\{  
var elems = \[\];  
return \{  
renderList\(\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
\};  
\}\);  
Though it may look a bit unusual, UMD is really just an IIFE.  
What’s different is that the main function expression part \(at the  
top\) of the IIFE contains a series of if..else if statements to  
247 detect which of the three supported environments the module is  
being loaded in.  
The final \(\) that normally invokes an IIFE is being passed three  
arguments\: "StudentsList", this, and another function  
expression. If you match those arguments to their parameters, you’ll  
see they are\: name, context, and definition, respectively.  
"StudentList" \(name\) is the name label for the module, primarily in  
case it’s defined as a global variable. this \(context\) is generally the  
window \(aka, global object; see Chapter 4\) for defining the module  
by its name.  
definition\(..\) is invoked to actually retrieve the definition of the  
module, and you’ll notice that, sure enough, that’s just a classic  
module form!  
There’s no question that as of the time of this writing, ESM \(ES  
Modules\) are becoming popular and widespread rapidly. But with  
millions and millions of modules written over the last 20 years, all  
using some pre-ESM variation of classic modules, they’re still very  
important to be able to read and understand when you come across  
them.

248 Appendix B\: Practice  
This appendix aims to give you some challenging and interesting  
exercises to test and solidify your understanding of the main topics  
from this book. It’s a good idea to try out the exercises yourself—in  
an actual code editor!—instead of skipping straight to the solutions at  
the end. No cheating!  
These exercises don’t have a specific right answer that you have to  
get exactly. Your approach may differ some \(or a lot!\) from the  
solutions presented, and that’s OK.  
There’s no judging you on how you write your code. My hope is that  
you come away from this book feeling confident that you can tackle  
these sorts of coding tasks built on a strong foundation of  
knowledge. That’s the only objective, here. If you’re happy with your  
code, I am, too!  
# Buckets of Marbles  
Remember Figure 2 from back in Chapter 2?  
249 Fig. 2 \(Ch. 2\)\: Colored Scope Bubbles  
This exercise asks you to write a program—any program!—that  
contains nested functions and block scopes, which satisfies these  
constraints\:  
If you color all the scopes \(including the global scope!\) different  
colors, you need at least six colors. Make sure to add a code  
comment labeling each scope with its color.  
BONUS\: identify any implied scopes your code may have.  
Each scope has at least one identifier.  
Contains at least two function scopes and at least two block  
scopes.  
250 At least one variable from an outer scope must be shadowed by  
a nested scope variable \(see Chapter 3\).  
At least one variable reference must resolve to a variable  
declaration at least two levels higher in the scope chain.  
TIP\:  
You can just write junk foo/bar/baz-type code for this exercise, but I  
suggest you try to come up with some sort of non-trivial real’ish  
code that at least does something kind of reasonable.  
Try the exercise for yourself, then check out the suggested solution  
at the end of this appendix.  
# Closure \(PART 1\)  
Let’s first practice closure with some common computer-math  
operations\: determining if a value is prime \(has no divisors other  
than 1 and itself\), and generating a list of prime factors \(divisors\) for  
a given number.  
For example\:  
isPrime\(11\); // true  
isPrime\(12\); // false  
factorize\(11\); // \[ 11 \]  
factorize\(12\); // \[ 3, 2, 2 \] --\> 3\*2\*2=12  
Here’s an implementation of isPrime\(..\), adapted from the Math.js  
library\: 1  
251 function isPrime\(v\) \{  
if \(v \<= 3\) \{  
return v \> 1;  
\}  
if \(v % 2 == 0 || v % 3 == 0\) \{  
return false;  
\}  
var vSqrt = Math.sqrt\(v\);  
for \(let i = 5; i \<= vSqrt; i += 6\) \{  
if \(v % i == 0 || v % \(i + 2\) == 0\) \{  
return false;  
\}  
\}  
return true;  
\}  
And here’s a somewhat basic implementation of factorize\(..\) \(not  
to be confused with factorial\(..\) from Chapter 6\)\:  
function factorize\(v\) \{  
if \(!isPrime\(v\)\) \{  
let i = Math.floor\(Math.sqrt\(v\)\);  
while \(v % i != 0\) \{  
i--;  
\}  
return \[  
...factorize\(i\),  
...factorize\(v / i\)  
\];  
\}  
return \[v\];  
\}  
252 NOTE\:  
I call this basic because it’s not optimized for performance. It’s  
binary-recursive \(which isn’t tail-call optimizable\), and it creates a lot  
of intermediate array copies. It also doesn’t order the discovered  
factors in any way. There are many, many other algorithms for this  
task, but I wanted to use something short and roughly  
understandable for our exercise.  
If you were to call isPrime\(4327\) multiple times in a program, you  
can see that it would go through all its dozens of  
comparison/computation steps every time. If you consider  
factorize\(..\), it’s calling isPrime\(..\) many times as it computes  
the list of factors. And there’s a good chance most of those calls are  
repeats. That’s a lot of wasted work!  
The first part of this exercise is to use closure to implement a cache  
to remember the results of isPrime\(..\), so that the primality \(true  
or false\) of a given number is only ever computed once. Hint\: we  
already showed this sort of caching in Chapter 6 with  
factorial\(..\).  
If you look at factorize\(..\), it’s implemented with recursion,  
meaning it calls itself repeatedly. That again means we may likely  
see a lot of wasted calls to compute prime factors for the same  
number. So the second part of the exercise is to use the same  
closure cache technique for factorize\(..\).  
Use separate closures for caching of isPrime\(..\) and  
factorize\(..\), rather than putting them inside a single scope.  
253 Try the exercise for yourself, then check out the suggested solution  
at the end of this appendix.  
A Word About Memory  
I want to share a little quick note about this closure cache technique  
and the impacts it has on your application’s performance.  
We can see that in saving the repeated calls, we improve  
computation speed \(in some cases, by a dramatic amount\). But this  
usage of closure is making an explicit trade-off that you should be  
very aware of.  
The trade-off is memory. We’re essentially growing our cache \(in  
memory\) unboundedly. If the functions in question were called many  
millions of times with mostly unique inputs, we’d be chewing up a lot  
of memory. This can definitely be worth the expense, but only if we  
think it’s likely we see repetition of common inputs so that we’re  
taking advantage of the cache.  
If most every call will have a unique input, and the cache is  
essentially never used to any benefit, this is an inappropriate  
technique to employ.  
It also might be a good idea to have a more sophisticated caching  
approach, such as an LRU \(least recently used\) cache, that limits its  
size; as it runs up to the limit, an LRU evicts the values that are…  
well, least recently used!  
The downside here is that LRU is quite non-trivial in its own right.  
You’ll want to use a highly optimized implementation of LRU, and be  
keenly aware of all the trade-offs at play.  
254 Closure \(PART 2\)  
In this exercise, we’re going to again practive closure by defining a  
toggle\(..\) utility that gives us a value toggler.  
You will pass one or more values \(as arguments\) into toggle\(..\),  
and get back a function. That returned function will alternate/rotate  
between all the passed-in values in order, one at a time, as it’s called  
repeatedly.  
function toggle\(/\*  
// ..  
..  
\*/\) \{  
\}  
var hello = toggle\("hello"\);  
var onOff = toggle\("on"  
,  
"off"\);  
var speed = toggle\("slow"  
,  
"medium"  
,  
"fast"\);  
hello\(\); // "hello"  
hello\(\); // "hello"  
onOff\(\); // "on"  
onOff\(\); // "off"  
onOff\(\); // "on"  
speed\(\); // "slow"  
speed\(\); // "medium"  
speed\(\); // "fast"  
speed\(\); // "slow"  
The corner case of passing in no values to toggle\(..\) is not very  
important; such a toggler instance could just always return  
255 undefined.  
Try the exercise for yourself, then check out the suggested solution  
at the end of this appendix.  
# Closure \(PART 3\)  
In this third and final exercise on closure, we’re going to implement a  
basic calculator. The calculator\(\) function will produce an  
instance of a calculator that maintains its own state, in the form of a  
function \(calc\(..\), below\)\:  
function calculator\(\) \{  
// ..  
\}  
var calc = calculator\(\);  
Each time calc\(..\) is called, you’ll pass in a single character that  
represents a keypress of a calculator button. To keep things more  
straightforward, we’ll restrict our calculator to supporting entering  
only digits \(0-9\), arithmetic operations \(+, -, \*, /\), and “=” to compute  
the operation. Operations are processed strictly in the order entered;  
there’s no “\( \)” grouping or operator precedence.  
We don’t support entering decimals, but the divide operation can  
result in them. We don’t support entering negative numbers, but the  
“-” operation can result in them. So, you should be able to produce  
any negative or decimal number by first entering an operation to  
compute it. You can then keep computing with that value.  
256 The return of calc\(..\) calls should mimic what would be shown on  
a real calculator, like reflecting what was just pressed, or computing  
the total when pressing “=”.  
For example\:  
calc\("4"\); // 4  
calc\("+"\); // +  
calc\("7"\); // 7  
calc\("3"\); // 3  
calc\("  
-  
"\); // -  
calc\("2"\); // 2  
calc\("  
=  
"\); // 75  
calc\("\*"\); // \*  
calc\("4"\); // 4  
calc\("  
=  
"\); // 300  
calc\("5"\); // 5  
calc\("  
-  
"\); // -  
calc\("5"\); // 5  
calc\("  
=  
"\); // 0  
Since this usage is a bit clumsy, here’s a useCalc\(..\) helper, that  
runs the calculator with characters one at a time from a string, and  
computes the display each time\:  
function useCalc\(calc,keys\) \{  
return \[...keys\].reduce\(  
function showDisplay\(display,key\)\{  
var ret = String\( calc\(key\) \);  
return \(  
display +  
\(  
257 \(ret !=  
"" && key ==  
"  
=  
"  
=  
""  
"\) ?  
" \:  
\) +  
ret  
\);  
\},  
""  
\);  
\}  
useCalc\(calc,  
useCalc\(calc,  
useCalc\(calc,  
useCalc\(calc,  
useCalc\(calc,  
useCalc\(calc,  
useCalc\(calc,  
"4+3=  
"\); // 4+3=7  
"+9=  
"\); // +9=16  
"\*8=  
"\); // \*5=128  
"7\*2\*3=  
"\); // 7\*2\*3=42  
"1/0=  
"\); // 1/0=ERR  
"+3=  
"\); // +3=ERR  
"51=  
"\); // 51  
The most sensible usage of this useCalc\(..\) helper is to always  
have “=” be the last character entered.  
Some of the formatting of the totals displayed by the calculator  
require special handling. I’m providing this formatTotal\(..\)  
function, which your calculator should use whenever it’s going to  
return a current computed total \(after an "=" is entered\)\:  
function formatTotal\(display\) \{  
if \(Number.isFinite\(display\)\) \{  
// constrain display to max 11 chars  
let maxDigits = 11;  
// reserve space for "e+" notation?  
258 if \(Math.abs\(display\) \> 99999999999\) \{  
maxDigits -= 6;  
\}  
// reserve space for "  
if \(display \< 0\) \{  
maxDigits--;  
-  
"?  
\}  
// whole number?  
if \(Number.isInteger\(display\)\) \{  
display = display  
.toPrecision\(maxDigits\)  
.replace\(/\\.0+\$/,  
""\);  
\}  
// decimal  
else \{  
// reserve space for "  
"  
.  
maxDigits--;  
// reserve space for leading "0"?  
if \(  
Math.abs\(display\) \>= 0 &&  
Math.abs\(display\) \< 1  
\) \{  
maxDigits--;  
\}  
display = display  
.toPrecision\(maxDigits\)  
.replace\(/0+\$/,  
""\);  
\}  
\}  
else \{  
display =  
"ERR";  
\}  
259 return display;  
\}  
Don’t worry too much about how formatTotal\(..\) works. Most of  
its logic is a bunch of handling to limit the calculator display to 11  
characters max, even if negatives, repeating decimals, or even “e+”  
exponential notation is required.  
Again, don’t get too mired in the mud around calculator-specific  
behavior. Focus on the memory of closure.  
Try the exercise for yourself, then check out the suggested solution  
at the end of this appendix.  
# Modules  
This exercise is to convert the calculator from Closure \(PART 3\) into  
a module.  
We’re not adding any additional functionality to the calculator, only  
changing its interface. Instead of calling a single function calc\(..\),  
we’ll be calling specific methods on the public API for each  
“keypress” of our calculator. The outputs stay the same.  
This module should be expressed as a classic module factory  
function called calculator\(\), instead of a singleton IIFE, so that  
multiple calculators can be created if desired.  
The public API should include the following methods\:  
number\(..\) \(input\: the character/number “pressed”\)  
plus\(\)  
260 minus\(\)  
mult\(\)  
div\(\)  
eq\(\)  
Usage would look like\:  
var calc = calculator\(\);  
calc.number\("4"\); // 4  
calc.plus\(\); // +  
calc.number\("7"\); // 7  
calc.number\("3"\); // 3  
calc.minus\(\); // -  
calc.number\("2"\); // 2  
calc.eq\(\); // 75  
formatTotal\(..\) remains the same from that previous exercise.  
But the useCalc\(..\) helper needs to be adjusted to work with the  
module API\:  
function useCalc\(calc,keys\) \{  
var keyMappings = \{  
"+"\: "plus"  
,  
"  
-  
"\: "minus"  
"  
=  
"\: "eq"  
,  
"\*"\: "mult"  
,  
"/"\: "div"  
,  
\};  
return \[...keys\].reduce\(  
function showDisplay\(display,key\)\{  
261 var fn = keyMappings\[key\] || "number";  
var ret = String\( calc\[fn\]\(key\) \);  
return \(  
display +  
\(  
\(ret !=  
"  
=  
""  
"" && key ==  
"  
=  
"\) ?  
" \:  
\) +  
ret  
\);  
\},  
""  
\);  
\}  
useCalc\(calc,  
useCalc\(calc,  
useCalc\(calc,  
useCalc\(calc,  
useCalc\(calc,  
useCalc\(calc,  
useCalc\(calc,  
"4+3=  
"\); // 4+3=7  
"+9=  
"\); // +9=16  
"\*8=  
"\); // \*5=128  
"7\*2\*3=  
"\); // 7\*2\*3=42  
"1/0=  
"\); // 1/0=ERR  
"+3=  
"\); // +3=ERR  
"51=  
"\); // 51  
Try the exercise for yourself, then check out the suggested solution  
at the end of this appendix.  
As you work on this exercise, also spend some time considering the  
pros/cons of representing the calculator as a module as opposed to  
the closure-function approach from the previous exercise.  
BONUS\: write out a few sentences explaining your thoughts.  
262 BONUS \#2\: try converting your module to other module formats,  
including\: UMD, CommonJS, and ESM \(ES Modules\).  
# Suggested Solutions  
Hopefully you’ve tried out the exercises before you’re reading this  
far. No cheating!  
Remember, each suggested solution is just one of a bunch of  
different ways to approach the problems. They’re not “the right  
answer,” but they do illustrate a reasonable way to approach each  
exercise.  
The most important benefit you can get from reading these  
suggested solutions is to compare them to your code and analyze  
why we each made similar or different choices. Don’t get into too  
much bikeshedding; try to stay focused on the main topic rather than  
the small details.  
Suggested\: Buckets of Marbles  
The Buckets of Marbles Exercise can be solved like this\:  
// RED\(1\)  
const howMany = 100;  
// Sieve of Eratosthenes  
function findPrimes\(howMany\) \{  
// BLUE\(2\)  
var sieve = Array\(howMany\).fill\(true\);  
var max = Math.sqrt\(howMany\);  
263 for \(let i = 2; i \< max; i++\) \{  
// GREEN\(3\)  
if \(sieve\[i\]\) \{  
// ORANGE\(4\)  
let j = Math.pow\(i,2\);  
for \(let k = j; k \< howMany; k += i\) \{  
// PURPLE\(5\)  
sieve\[k\] = false;  
\}  
\}  
\}  
return sieve  
.map\(function getPrime\(flag,prime\)\{  
// PINK\(6\)  
if \(flag\) return prime;  
return flag;  
\}\)  
.filter\(function onlyPrimes\(v\)\{  
// YELLOW\(7\)

\}\)  
.slice\(1\);  
\}

264 Suggested\: Closure \(PART 1\)  
The Closure Exercise \(PART 1\) for isPrime\(..\) and  
factorize\(..\), can be solved like this\:  
var isPrime = \(function isPrime\(v\)\{  
var primes = \{\};  
return function isPrime\(v\) \{  
if \(v in primes\) \{  
return primes\[v\];  
\}  
if \(v \<= 3\) \{  
return \(primes\[v\] = v \> 1\);  
\}  
if \(v % 2 == 0 || v % 3 == 0\) \{  
return \(primes\[v\] = false\);  
\}  
let vSqrt = Math.sqrt\(v\);  
for \(let i = 5; i \<= vSqrt; i += 6\) \{  
if \(v % i == 0 || v % \(i + 2\) == 0\) \{  
return \(primes\[v\] = false\);  
\}  
\}  
return \(primes\[v\] = true\);  
\};  
\}\)\(\);  
var factorize = \(function factorize\(v\)\{  
var factors = \{\};  
return function findFactors\(v\) \{  
if \(v in factors\) \{  
265 return factors\[v\];  
\}  
if \(!isPrime\(v\)\) \{  
let i = Math.floor\(Math.sqrt\(v\)\);  
while \(v % i != 0\) \{  
i--;  
\}  
return \(factors\[v\] = \[  
...findFactors\(i\),  
...findFactors\(v / i\)  
\]\);  
\}  
return \(factors\[v\] = \[v\]\);  
\};  
\}\)\(\);  
The general steps I used for each utility\:  
1\. Wrap an IIFE to define the scope for the cache variable to  
reside.  
2\. In the underlying call, first check the cache, and if a result is  
already known, return.  
3\. At each place where a return was happening originally, assign  
to the cache and just return the results of that assignment  
operation—this is a space savings trick mostly just for brevity in  
the book.  
I also renamed the inner function from factorize\(..\) to  
findFactors\(..\). That’s not technically necessary, but it helps it  
make clearer which function the recursive calls invoke.  
266 Suggested\: Closure \(PART 2\)  
The Closure Exercise \(PART 2\) toggle\(..\) can be solved like this\:  
function toggle\(...vals\) \{  
var unset = \{\};  
var cur = unset;  
return function next\(\)\{  
// save previous value back at  
// the end of the list  
if \(cur != unset\) \{  
vals.push\(cur\);  
\}  
cur = vals.shift\(\);  
return cur;  
\};  
\}  
var hello = toggle\("hello"\);  
var onOff = toggle\("on"  
,  
"off"\);  
var speed = toggle\("slow"  
,  
"medium"  
,  
"fast"\);  
hello\(\); // "hello"  
hello\(\); // "hello"  
onOff\(\); // "on"  
onOff\(\); // "off"

Remember\: this exercise is about closure. Don’t focus too much on  
the actual mechanics of a calculator, but rather on whether you are  
properly remembering the calculator state across function calls.
