- --- ROUTLEDGE RESEARCH IN DESIGN STUDIES -- Wayfinding, Consumption, and  
# Air Terminal Design  
This book investigates how international air terminals organize passenger movement  
and generate spending. It offers a new understanding of how their architecture and  
artworks operate visually to guide people through the space and affect their behaviour.  
Menno Hubregtse’s research draws upon numerous airport visits and interviews  
with architects and planners, as well as documents and articles that address these  
terminals’ development, construction, and renovations. The book establishes the  
main concerns of architects with respect to wayfinding strategies and analyzes how  
air terminal architecture, artworks, and interior design contribute to the airport’s  
operations.  
The book will be of interest to art historians, architectural historians, practising  
architects, urban planners, airport specialists, and geographers.  
Menno Hubregtse is an instructor at the University of Victoria where he teaches art  
and architectural history.Routledge Research in Design Studies

The contemporary international air terminal is a quintessential space of circulation  
defined by security, spectacle, and spending. This building’s main function is to move  
passengers and their baggage from ground transportation to the check-in, through  
security, and onto their plane. While terminals are planned to order passengers’ move-  
ments into directional flows, they are also designed to maximize profits from shops  
and restaurants. As airports around the world began to be privatized during the 1980s,  
they started to rely on retail profits to pay for operating costs and were redesigned as  
shopping spaces \(Edwards 2005\). Many of today’s international airports recoup more  
money from retail spending and parking than the landing fees paid by airlines. On the  
one hand, planners try to design routes through the terminal that can be easily navi-  
gated, while on the other hand, they try to direct travellers to walk past retail outlets  
and services. The air terminal moves people using a stop-and-go process—passengers  
are forwarded along pathways such as corridors and escalators and are contained in  
spaces such as departure lounges and observation decks \(Adey 2007; Fuller 2009\).  
Within these architectural interiors, planners typically install visual media such as  
advertisements and artworks. Although the types of imagery represented vary, many  
of the artworks convey themes of place, flight, and other kinds of movement.  
This book illustrates how the terminal’s interior design is integral to its operation.  
While the design of the terminal’s footprint and elevation are important in terms of  
how aircraft can access its gates and how the building links to ground transportation  
networks, the terminal’s interior is the area that processes the airport’s main user, the  
air passenger.1 I concentrate on how architects and planners design the air terminal  
interior both to facilitate passenger movement and to encourage spending. Corridors,  
escalators, and moving walkways are all obvious examples of the types of things that  
are used to direct travellers along particular routes. However, there are many other  
more subtle examples of interior design that organize passenger movement and are as  
important as signage in directing passenger streams. I examine how ceilings, flooring  
patterns, and lighting are designed to entice travellers to move towards their departing  
gates. Architects designing new terminal buildings adjust the footprint such that there  
are unobstructed sightlines of the windows facing the apron; a view of the aircraft  
parked at the air bridges helps orient passengers since it clearly indicates where the  
gates are located. Interior designs also direct travellers to walk towards commercial  
spaces. In some airports, they are funnelled into a walkthrough duty-free store upon  
exiting the pre-boarding security area. These retail spaces often send travellers along a  
serpentine route to increase their exposure to the various goods for sale.  
While this book addresses a number of interior design strategies that manage pas-  
senger movement and entice spending in the terminal, it also examines how planners 2 Introduction  
deploy artworks to fulfil these functions. I argue that air terminal artworks, which  
have received little attention in the scholarship on airports, have the capacity to con-  
tribute to the terminal’s operation and should not be considered as simply decorative  
additions to the interior.2 I examine how some air terminals have installed artworks  
as landmarks to help with wayfinding and to draw passengers towards retail stores  
and restaurants. I also discuss how air terminal planners assume that certain types of  
artworks will encourage spending.  
Drawing upon actor-network theory \(Latour 2000, 2005; Latour and Yaneva  
2008; Yaneva 2013, 2017\), I consider how architecture and artworks are active  
agents that produce the terminal’s social space. I address how these things’ material  
aspects are able to influence passenger behaviour, and I discuss how airport planners  
and architects expect that their designs will perform in this capacity. For instance,  
Westfield uses artificial lighting to direct travellers towards the departure gates at  
Los Angeles’ Terminal 6 \(Herman 2016; Westfield Airports 2016\). The long, thin  
strips of LED lighting in the terminal’s ceiling emphasize the building’s main route  
\(Figure I.1\).  
At Heathrow Terminal 5, Richard Rogers Partnership has incorporated skylights  
that accentuate the required directional flow \(Figure I.2\). They run laterally across the  
building’s vast ceiling from the landside, which abuts the access road, to the airside,  
which faces the aircraft on the apron.3 For passengers in the landside departures area,  
these bands of light draw one’s eye towards the pre-boarding security area.

In some air terminals, architects deploy artworks to support passenger navigation.  
At Vancouver’s YVR, planners installed Bill Reid’s Spirit of Haida Gwaii\: The Jade  
Canoe to operate as a way-post for orientation \(see Plate 1\). This sculpture is one of  
many artworks that the airport has installed for this purpose; a number of these pieces  
appear as icons on YVR’s terminal maps.  
I discuss how these types of wayfinding designs constitute a functional aesthetic.  
Moreover, I consider how they have an aesthetic quality that stems from their capac-  
ity to organize passenger movement. Heathrow Terminal 5’s skylights and Reid’s The  
Jade Canoe operate on a visual register, and in order for them to be effective, they  
need to clearly accentuate the directional flow or be conspicuous enough to operate as  
a landmark. My analysis of their functional aesthetic, however, does not aim to pro-  
vide an aesthetic judgement; rather, it offers a theoretical insight into how wayfinding  
designs can be useful for enabling passenger circulation.  
While air terminals are designed to organize passengers’ movements along a general  
directional flow, travellers transiting through the terminal do not all move in identi-  
cal streams. Travellers are able and even encouraged to deviate from the main routes,  
whether to shop or use the washroom. Airport planners use simulation software to  
estimate how quickly and how many passengers can be processed, and they use this 4 Introduction  
information to adjust terminal designs, operations, and scheduling \(Adey 2004\).4  
Although these programs account for variations in behaviour and attempt to recreate  
actual conditions, passenger movements in these simulations are defined by complex  
algorithms and are quantified as vectors, albeit different for each type of virtual travel-  
ler. But neither passenger simulation software nor the mathematical formulae used to  
optimize terminal designs figure in this study beyond how passenger behaviour is con-  
ceptualized using these design practices. In most cases, they do move through the ter-  
minal more or less along the intended routes and within the expected timeframes \(i.e.  
the time allotted between check-in and departure\), and that phenomenon is central  
to my analysis. However, I do consider one instance of unexpected passenger behav-  
iour where the air terminal’s design malfunctioned. On October 13, 2007, Robert  
Dziekański, a Polish national who did not speak English, became lost en route in the  
arrivals area at Vancouver’s International Terminal. After he emerged from customs  
nearly nine hours after landing, Dziekański became agitated and started throwing fur-  
niture. Four police officers, called by the airport to deal with the disturbance, subdued  
Dziekański with a conducted energy weapon which resulted in his death. This incident  
raises serious questions about design strategy and illustrates some of the implications  
of airport aesthetics. I concentrate on how the airport improved its terminal’s design  
and operations in response to this tragic event.  
Aside from my consideration of this affair, my analysis is based on a general notion  
of the air passenger\: an individual who is flying commercially, accesses the terminal by  
ground transportation, then checks in, drops off luggage, passes through airport secu-  
rity, locates their gate, and waits for their boarding call. Whatever their purpose, from  
work to tourism or family visits, all passengers need to follow this general process  
irrespective of class, income, ethnicity, and gender. Consequently, my investigation  
of air terminal design concentrates on the areas that are accessible to all passengers,  
excluding, for example, lounges limited to business and first-class travellers.  
Aside from walkthrough duty-free stores, I do not concentrate on the design of indi-  
vidual shops and restaurants in these terminals’ spaces.5 I address walkthrough shops  
since all passengers are directed through this space. Moreover, my attention to the  
commercial aspects of air terminal architecture is focused on how airport architects  
design corridors and concourses such that passengers are drawn to move towards or  
through areas that offer shopping and food services.  
I also discuss why architects and planners situate artworks near these commercial  
areas to encourage spending, and I consider how these pieces operate materially as  
well as symbolically to fulfil this purpose. Architects and planners often choose eye-  
catching artworks to entice passengers to move towards shops and restaurants. How-  
ever, they also select artworks that convey themes which they believe will stimulate  
consumption. In many cases, these artworks refer to the region where the airport is  
located. These objects are suspected to lend to the terminal’s ‘sense of place,’ and  
airport authorities presume that this manufactured ambiance places passengers in the  
mood to spend. Other prevalent themes among air terminal artworks are movement  
and flight. These works often convey a type of movement that contrasts with the  
ordered mobility that passengers typically experience while transiting through the ter-  
minal. I consider how these pieces, like those conveying themes of place, affect pas-  
sengers’ behaviour and whether they serve a commercial purpose.  
Sometimes these pieces are major expenditures. When the Vancouver International  
Airport Authority purchased Reid’s The Jade Canoe for three million Canadian Introduction 5  
dollars in 1993 \(Globe and Mail 1993; Lamb 1994; O’Hara 2003\), it set the record  
for the highest amount paid for a Canadian artwork \(see Plate 1\). The airport’s  
authority argued that these costs would be recouped since this place-themed artwork  
would stimulate the passenger’s desire to spend \(Bell 1996\). Reid’s sculpture is one  
of many Northwest Coast Indigenous artworks installed at Vancouver’s YVR that  
are intended to elicit a ‘sense of place.’6 London Heathrow paid 2.5 million pounds  
to build Richard Wilson’s seventy-eight-metre-long Slipstream \(O. Wainwright 2014;  
J. Wainwright 2014\); it was Europe’s longest sculpture when it was installed in Termi-  
nal 2’s forecourt in 2014 \(Figure I.3\).  
Wilson’s rendering of an aircraft’s supposed trajectory exemplifies how flight- and  
movement-themed artworks often connote unrestricted types of movement. Slipstream  
depicts the path of a small stunt plane engaging in rapid twists and turns, and it evokes  
a freedom of movement that contrasts with the ordered mobility that defines com-  
mercial flight. Passengers spend their flights buckled in an allotted seat and aboard  
a large airliner that usually follows a less anarchic route. I argue that works such as  
Slipstream, which convey unconstrained forms of movement, stimulate sensations of  
kinaesthesia as well as an aesthetic experience—one that resembles the Ancient Greek  
notion of aesthetics, aisth*ē*tikos, which means “perceptive by feeling” \(Susan Buck-  
Morss cited in Kester 1997, 43\).  
Slipstream’s depiction of unrestricted movement also contrasts with the passenger’s  
experience of control and containment in the airport. This is most amplified in the  
pre-boarding security zone. Zigzagging rows of retractable cordon barriers confine  
travellers in a queue leading to stations where personnel scan their bodies with metal  
detectors and their baggage with X-rays. In some instances, planners install artworks  
near these security zones to calm passengers before and after this intrusive process.  
Artworks placed at other locations are also intended to buoy one’s disposition. Slip-  
stream, for example, is intended to instil a sense of excitement for those about to  
depart on their flights \(J. Wainwright 2014\). I draw upon theories of affect \(Massumi  
2002; Thrift 2004; Anderson 2006; McCormack 2008; Pile 2010\) to consider how  
air terminal artworks can stir passengers’ moods, and I examine why diverting their  
attention away from their experience of being controlled matters with regard to the  
airport’s operation.  
Slipstream also illustrates how air terminal artworks typically emerge out of a col-  
laborative process between artists, architects, planners, and public art consultants.  
Heathrow’s design team worked with Futurecity, a “placemaking” firm, to establish  
the sculpture’s parameters and to run the commissioning process.7 The brief asked  
artists to engage with themes of “travel, movement, communication and global links  
on history and heritage” \(J. Wainwright 2014, 11\). The proposed piece had to extend  
through Terminal 2’s ‘Covered Court,’ a sprawling space situated between the termi-  
nal building and the parking garage. Wilson’s winning submission met these criteria.  
It, however, required a host of design professionals to realize the work. For instance,  
the architectural engineering firm, Price & Myers Geometrics, used film animation  
software and computer-numerical-control \(CNC\) machines to manufacture the sculp-  
ture’s 30,000 unique components \(Parker and Lucas 2014\).  
This book examines how architects influence the placement and production of air  
terminal artworks.8 They often decide where works are installed in the building, which  
themes are exhibited, and even how they should be constructed. At Toronto Pearson’s  
Terminal 1, Moshe Safdie helped determine the ideal sites for the commissioned works 6 Introduction  
Figure I.3 Richard Wilson, Slipstream, London Heathrow Airport, United Kingdom, 2014.  
Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2014\).  
and, in some cases, suggested how the artist could improve their piece’s relationship  
with his design \(Hiller 2004\). While Katharina Grosse was spray painting Untitled in  
2004, he asked her to expand her work such that it touched the ceiling; Safdie wanted  
the work to appear as though the strokes would extend to the sky above \(see Plate 2\). Introduction 7  
Noel Best, an architect with Stantec, works with artists to develop pieces that are  
suitable for the terminal \(pers. comm., December 17, 2018\).9 These works need to be  
durable, appropriately scaled, and—most importantly—visually compelling. During  
the commissioning process, Stantec distributes guidelines that show images of the  
planned interior as well as types of artworks that might fit with the space. It outlines  
“challenges and opportunities” for each site and how the work should be integrated  
into the architectural design. The guidelines also define the proposed themes, which  
often refer to the culture and environment of the airport’s greater region.  
In short, artists creating pieces for airports must usually follow a detailed set of  
recommendations. Their works are vetted in advance and assessed whether they can  
meet the airport’s requirements. In addition, artists are discouraged from depicting  
any overtly political themes since airport authorities do not want to upset passengers  
transiting through the terminal.10 This, however, does not mean that all air terminal  
artworks are devoid of content pertaining to political issues. At a number of airports,  
place-themed installations highlight only one or some of the region’s cultural groups.  
At Vancouver’s YVR, airport authorities have chosen to display primarily Northwest  
Coast First Nations artworks. At Delhi Indira Gandhi’s Terminal 3, planners have  
installed a number of pieces that refer to a Hindu identity. Ayush Kasliwal’s wall  
installation, which consists of twelve enormous hands depicting mudras, welcomes  
passengers arriving at the terminal \(see Plate 3\). My analysis of these designs considers  
why airport authorities feel that a particular identity appeals to travellers and why this  
is usually driven by commercial imperatives. I also discuss why some of these place-  
themed installations matter in terms of their placement in the terminal. Schiphol’s  
Holland Boulevard contains a number of stereotypical Dutch designs such as instal-  
lations modelled after Delft Blue pottery; this corridor in the post-security airside is  
intended to appeal to transferring passengers who are spending a layover in Amster-  
dam’s airport and not entering the country. Some airports install place-themed designs  
near the airport’s border zone. These are especially notable with regard to cultural  
identity and state governance. Kasliwal’s gigantic mudras, for example, are situated  
above the screening area’s immigration officers; these hand gestures assert a Hindu  
identity in a space that vets travellers entering a country where Hindu nationalism has  
affected domestic politics and intercultural relations.  
Air terminal artworks that refer to themes of place and movement such as Kasli-  
wal’s wall installation and Wilson’s Slipstream tend to celebrate their subject matter  
and are generally not intended to provoke a critical response. There are some site-  
specific works that are exceptions to this norm. Dennis Adams’s Coda, Jenny Holzer’s  
Untitled, Niek Kemps’s Closed View, and Marc Ruygrok’s So go on at Schiphol and  
Mark Bradford’s Bell Tower at Los Angeles International Airport reflect upon the  
traveller’s experience of moving through the terminal—a building that is designed to  
organize passengers into regulated flows. These five works, which I examine in detail  
in Chapter 4, ask the viewer to contemplate some of the central themes explored in  
this book; they address how air terminals use material design and symbolic imagery to  
affect passengers’ behaviour, and they offer a critical interpretation of how air termi-  
nal artworks are deployed to serve this purpose.  
Research Methodology  
This investigation is based upon my observations from visits to forty-two international  
airports between 2011 and 2019. These include the world’s fifteen busiest airports  
in terms of international passenger traffic\: Dubai, London Heathrow, Hong Kong, 8 Introduction  
Amsterdam Schiphol, Seoul Incheon, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Singapore Changi,  
Frankfurt, Bangkok Suvarnabhumi, Istanbul Atatürk, Taipei Taoyuan, Kuala Lum-  
pur, London Gatwick, Madrid-Barajas, and Barcelona-El Prat.11 The twenty-seven  
other international airports include\: Shanghai Pudong, Delhi Indira Gandhi, Mum-  
bai Chhatrapati Shivaji, London Stansted, Paris Orly, EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-  
Freiburg, Prague, Vienna, Venice, Dubrovnik, Athens, New York John F. Kennedy,  
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas/Fort Worth, Las Vegas McCarran,  
Los Angeles, San Francisco, SeaTac, Victoria, Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto Pearson,  
Ottawa, Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Quebec City, and Halifax. I have flown in  
and out of these airports’ terminals as a passenger. In most cases, I spent approxi-  
mately two eight-hour days in each airport examining their landside and airside areas.  
This allowed me to discover the types of artworks and interior designs installed at  
each airport. My analysis of their construction and development draws upon press  
releases, the architects’ and airports’ websites, and newspaper and journal articles.  
While my investigation draws upon my research into each of these airports, I focus  
on some sites more than others—particularly, Amsterdam’s Schiphol, London’s Heath-  
row, Vancouver’s YVR, and Hong Kong International Airport \(HKIA\). These airports  
are indicative of a number of larger trends pertaining to air terminal design. Heathrow  
and HKIA typify the global airport; some of their terminals are designed by world-  
renowned ‘starchitects,’ and they are among the world’s busiest in terms of inter-  
national passengers. For instance, Richard Rogers Partnership designed Heathrow’s  
Terminal 5, which opened in 2008, and Foster + Partners designed HKIA’s Terminal  
1, which opened in 1998. Schiphol, also a major international hub for travellers,  
exemplifies how airports are designed as urban spaces and shopping destinations for  
passengers and local visitors; Schiphol Group \(2019\) has branded its design as an  
“AirportCity” \(see also Cresswell 2006\). Although YVR has less traffic, the Vancou-  
ver International Airport Authority planned its International Terminal in order to  
compete with other North American Pacific Rim transfer hubs such as Seattle, San  
Francisco, and Los Angeles \(Vancouver International Airport Authority 1995; Binney  
1999\). In addition, YVR’s International Terminal is a significant example of a ‘glocal’  
design. Its Indigenous Northwest Coast artworks assert a place-based identity in a  
transfer hub intended to operate on a global scale.  
I have flown in and out of Schiphol, Heathrow, YVR, and HKIA several times as  
a passenger in order to examine all of the accessible landside and airside spaces. My  
research into their designs is based upon planning documents, media releases, corpo-  
rate websites, and newspaper and journal articles that documented the planning and  
development of these terminals during their construction and any subsequent renova-  
tions. I also interviewed architects, planners, and wayfinding experts involved with  
these buildings’ designs. My analysis does not include passenger interviews. It does,  
however, rely on some general observations of how passengers engage with the space.  
Chapter Overview  
Chapter 1 concentrates on how architects design air terminal interiors with mate-  
rial cues that support intuitive passenger wayfinding. It outlines key principles of air  
terminal design before examining three airports—Schiphol, Heathrow, and HKIA—  
in detail. They exemplify three different types of planning approaches with respect  
to air terminal development. Schiphol’s terminal has been renovated and expanded Introduction 9  
repeatedly to account for increasing passenger traffic since it began operating in 1967.  
Heathrow has constructed new buildings to meet demands for increased space. I con-  
centrate on Terminal 5, which opened in 2008. Rather than expanding an existing ter-  
minal or constructing a second stand-alone structure, Hong Kong’s airport authority  
built a new airport on a separate site to replace the city’s former airport, Kai Tak. This  
overview of these airports’ histories and current designs illustrates how wayfinding  
solutions differ among air terminals. This chapter also examines how interior designs  
direct passengers towards retail and restaurant spaces. It provides a brief overview of  
why air terminals need to operate as shopping centres before examining walkthrough  
duty-free stores. This summary of wayfinding designs and commerce in air terminals  
lays the groundwork for the subsequent analyses.  
Chapter 2 focuses on how architecture and interior design can actively influence  
passengers’ practices in the terminal. It discusses how architects consider their design’s  
materiality and its potential to mediate passengers’ behaviour and movement. Fur-  
thermore, I argue that air terminal design consists of a functional aesthetic in relation  
to how it regulates passenger movement, and I discuss how wayfinding designs need  
to look fit for their purpose in order to be effective. This chapter also considers how  
architects assess their air terminal designs’ actual performance. A design’s intended  
function does not necessarily correlate with its operation in ‘real world’ conditions.  
I discuss this issue in light of theories of proper function and scripts which concentrate  
on how function emerges out of a design’s relation with its users. I illustrate how some  
architects examine the terminal’s actual operation and use this evaluation of its func-  
tion to refine their designs.  
Chapters 3, 4, and 5 concentrate primarily on air terminal artworks. Chapter 3  
considers these installations in terms of the theoretical framework employed in the  
previous chapter. Moreover, it focuses on how artworks are material things that medi-  
ate passengers’ movements and how they serve wayfinding and commercial purposes.  
I examine how some planners install eye-catching artworks that are intended to oper-  
ate as guides for navigation. I also discuss why they are often placed near retail spaces  
and how planners generally believe that artworks can create an atmosphere that  
encourages spending. My analysis concentrates on artworks integrated into the build-  
ing’s design and located near commercial areas. Usually, artists need to design their  
pieces to mesh with the terminal’s interior. In some cases, architects design the inte-  
rior to accommodate a sculpture acquired during the terminal’s construction phase.  
For instance, Waisman Dewar Grout Carter Inc. designed a theatre-like space around  
Reid’s The Jade Canoe at Vancouver’s International Terminal. In addition, they placed  
a food court, a café, and a gift shop within steps of the sculpture; the airport’s author-  
ity believed that Reid’s work would evoke a ‘sense of place’ and motivate passengers  
to spend. Richard Serra’s Tilted Spheres at Toronto Pearson’s Terminal 1 influenced  
Safdie’s design for the building. It is also located next to a shopping space. However,  
it runs counter to the airport planner’s central aims—its curved steel plates form an  
enclosure that blocks one’s view of the surrounding stores and signage.  
While Chapter 3 concentrates on artworks with regard to their materiality, Chap-  
ters 4 and 5 focus on what these installations depict in terms of subject matter and how  
this influences the traveller’s experience in the air terminal. Chapter 4 considers how  
an artwork’s representational content can affect passengers’ moods. After a cursory  
overview of theories of affect, I establish how artworks located near security zones can  
operate on an affective register to calm anxious passengers entering and exiting these 10 Introduction  
areas. This chapter’s remaining sections focus on movement-themed sculptures. The  
chapter illustrates how these installations usually depict forms of unrestricted move-  
ment or harmonious flows that contrast with the controlled movement experienced  
in the terminal. I discuss how they operate affectively to spur bodily sensations of  
motion, and I argue that this capacity to stimulate kinaesthesia constitutes an aes-  
thetic experience. I also address how these types of works might generate passenger  
spending. This chapter’s final section considers site-specific artworks that call one’s  
attention to technologies that organize passenger movement and that reflect upon the  
experience of being filtered and funnelled into directional flows. I argue that these  
pieces depart from the usual forms of air terminal installations and that they offer a  
critical interpretation of the functions these works are intended to perform.  
Chapter 5 examines artworks as well as interior designs that refer to the airport’s  
region. It considers these installations with regard to their symbolic content, and it  
examines the types of meanings planners wish to convey via these representations of  
place. As noted, planners install place-themed designs with the aim to increase spend-  
ing. This chapter addresses why they often choose to highlight only certain cultural  
groups living within these areas, and it discusses why these types of artworks and inte-  
riors appeal to passengers. It also concentrates on the political connotations of works  
placed near the terminal’s border screening areas. I focus on Kasliwal’s depictions of  
mudras at Delhi Indira Gandhi’s Terminal 3 as well as a series of Musqueam artworks  
that Vancouver’s YVR has commissioned to welcome international travellers. I exam-  
ine how the representation of these identities relates to the politics of the terminal’s  
border zone as well as national identity and Indigenous land rights. In the latter part  
of the chapter, I turn to natural and pseudo-naturalistic installations that aim to evoke  
a sense of place via the region’s flora and fauna.  
Other Analyses of Air Terminal Design  
This investigation expands on the existing literature on air terminal design.12 Brian  
Edwards’s The Modern Airport Terminal \(2005\) is the most comprehensive study of  
contemporary air terminal architecture. He considers all aspects of terminal construc-  
tion, including how the building fits in with the rest of the airport infrastructure,  
technical requirements such as lighting, soundproofing, and safety, and how termi-  
nals are designed to facilitate passenger movement. He supports his findings with  
numerous case studies from recently built terminals across the world. Steve Thomas-  
Emberson \(2007\) also discusses the design and layout of recent air terminal interi-  
ors, but he focuses on commercial operations and shop designs. He also examines  
how stores featuring luxury brands have increased in air terminals since the early  
2000s. Thomas-Emberson briefly addresses air terminal artworks; he discusses how  
Cesar Pelli established the parameters for the artworks commissioned for Washing-  
ton National Airport such that they could be incorporated into the building’s design.  
Marcus Binney \(1999\) provides an overview of terminal designs, though his analysis  
is not as extensive as Edwards’s \(2005\) or Thomas-Emberson’s \(2007\) books. Binney,  
who focuses on terminals built during the 1990s or under construction at the time  
of writing, examines numerous sites and offers brief overviews of the general layout  
of each terminal and details regarding their construction. Christopher Blow’s \(1991\)  
investigation of air terminal design offers a detailed discussion of the building’s overall  
structure, from connection to ground transportation to aircraft docking requirements,  
but only briefly addresses aspects of interior design such as signage and lighting. Introduction 11  
Contemporary air terminal architecture also receives some attention in historical  
overviews of airport and air terminal layout and design. Alistair Gordon’s \(2008\) and  
Hugh Pearman’s \(2004\) investigations of airport architecture since the early twentieth  
century both include a discussion of how these structures have changed in response  
to changes in aircraft design, the shift towards mass air travel, and safety and security  
requirements. Like Gordon and Pearman, Gillian Fuller and Ross Harley \(2004\) also  
examine air terminal design since the advent of flight, but they focus on the various  
systems that order mobilities in airport spaces and across space more generally—in the  
sense that the world’s airports form one global network. John Zukowsky and Koos  
Bosma \(1996\) and Alexander von Vegesack and Jochen Eisenbrand \(2004\) address the  
history of air terminal architecture in their edited volumes on aviation design. These two  
volumes both contain essays by Bosma \(1996, 2004\) on air terminal architecture since  
the Second World War, and they both examine broader issues such as aircraft construc-  
tion and their internal arrangement, airline branding, and flight attendants’ uniforms.  
Air terminal design has also received some attention in studies of airports as social  
spaces. Mark Gottdiener \(2001\), whose aim is to investigate air spaces in the same  
fashion as other theorists of everyday urban life, briefly looks at terminal design and  
signage. David Pascoe \(2001\) considers the airport as a large infrastructural space  
both on the ground and up to a few thousand metres in the air. His attention to this  
broad space, which considers how it is unique to modernity and how it affects the  
lives of those passing through them, examines air terminal architecture during the past  
century and how airports have been represented in literature, film, and art. Pascoe  
addresses a few air terminal artworks, but he does not examine why planners install  
these works and how they contribute to the air terminal’s function.13 In a similar vein  
to Pascoe’s book, Christopher Schaberg’s The Textual Life of Airports \(2012\) exam-  
ines literary representations of air terminals. His analysis of these texts incorporates  
a discussion of how the air terminal is a space defined by textuality. Schaberg draws  
in some examples of airport artworks; the most notable are those pertaining to avian  
imagery, which he discusses in his chapter, “Bird Citing” \(2012, 117–39\). He com-  
pares artworks modelled after birds and flight to how actual birds pose a threat to  
commercial air travel as “bird strikes.” He also considers how passengers, like birds,  
are offered an aerial view of the earth—a view that is now widely available when one is  
not in flight via computer applications such as Google Earth. In Airportness, Schaberg  
\(2017\) discusses everyday experiences in the terminal and aboard commercial aircraft.  
His analysis is largely based on observations from US airports and contextualized in  
relation to literature, film, and contemporary American politics. His investigation,  
which considers how a common notion of the airport permeates our collective con-  
sciousness, does not address differences between air terminals and implies that their  
designs are relatively the same. Schaberg’s The End of Airports \(2016\) includes anec-  
dotes of his experience as an airport employee. Like his aforementioned books, this  
text includes his observations of air travel and how it is represented in literature and  
film. With regard to air terminal design, he addresses jet bridges and seating, particu-  
larly Charles and Ray Eames’s modular Tandem Sling furniture.  
Airports have been a particularly salient topic for geographers, sociologists, and  
other theorists studying mobility.14 However, only few analyze air terminal design in  
their investigations. In Tim Cresswell’s \(2006\) analysis of mobility, he examines how  
movement is facilitated at various levels at Schiphol. He considers how the airport reg-  
ulates broader movements such as a passenger’s ability to cross international borders  
and how it aims to manage travellers’ movements within the terminal space. He briefly 12 Introduction  
discusses how Jan Benthem has added structural and design elements that operate on  
a visual register to order passenger flows; I address these designs as well as other way-  
finding strategies at Schiphol in the following chapter. Peter Adey \(2008\) considers  
the terminal’s spatial ordering in terms of theories of affect. He examines how plan-  
ners design locations such as security zones to trigger specific emotional responses. In  
Chapter 4, I draw upon his analysis to consider how air terminal artworks can affect  
passenger behaviour. In a separate article, Adey \(2007\) addresses how passengers are  
active observers regulated by the spectacle produced in airports. He notes that these  
strategies to contain air travellers in particular locations illustrate that airports should  
be considered as spaces of both mobility and immobility. Similarly, Fuller \(2009, 2012\)  
argues that the airport is defined by a process of interrupted movements where passen-  
gers are both stored and forwarded.15 She observes that as much as the social spaces  
of airports and air travel are marked by a stop-and-go process, the general aesthetic of  
airports and aircraft “works to inculcate a sense of smoothness and transparency in  
movement” \(2009, 72\). While my analysis of air terminal design also investigates how  
air terminals organize passenger streams into stop-and-go movements, it departs from  
Fuller’s study by examining the visual media in air terminals that convey relatively free  
movements. Furthermore, I consider how these representations of unrestricted move-  
ment can evoke kinaesthesia—the sensation of movement.  
None of the aforementioned analyses of air terminal design in relation to mobili-  
ties are book-length studies. Max Hirsh’s \(2016\) book on airport urbanism in Asia  
addresses this topic, but it does not concentrate on passenger flows in the terminal.  
He largely focuses on ground and sea transportation infrastructure that accesses Asian  
airports and their effect on urban form.16 One chapter is devoted to Asian terminals  
that service low-cost airlines; it illustrates how they have led to the growth of a new  
class of air passengers in the region. In the following chapters, I examine these termi-  
nals’ artworks, place-themed interiors, and intuitive wayfinding designs.  
My analysis expands on the literature of air terminal architecture since it investigates  
and critically assesses wayfinding strategies and artworks at the world’s busiest interna-  
tional terminals. Unlike the existing monographs on air terminal design, I build upon  
actor-network theory to consider how various design solutions operate on a material  
level to mediate passenger behaviour, and I draw upon theories of affect to consider how  
artworks and interior designs can buoy passengers’ moods. Furthermore, I offer a new  
insight into air terminal design with respect to aesthetics. My assessment of its archi-  
tecture and artworks in terms of a functional aesthetic offers an understanding of how  
these things can effectively contribute to the airport’s operations. This, however, is only  
one of a myriad of aesthetic types at play in the terminal. Movement-themed artworks,  
for instance, elicit an entirely different affective and aesthetic experience. Finally, my  
attention to air terminal artworks consists of a significant contribution to the literature  
since it is a rarely studied topic. My analysis not only offers a broad account of the types  
of works found around the world, but it critically assesses their functional purpose and  
the political connotations of their subject matter.  
Notes  
1\. A number of factors determine the terminal’s footprint and elevations \(Horonjeff et al. 2010;  
Hart 1985\). Chief are the airport’s runway layout, road and rail access, the types of aircraft  
to be serviced, and the number of gates required—all dependent on the anticipated volume  
of air traffic. Besides these requirements, terminals need to be engineered to maximize the  
efficiency of passenger flows—from ground transportation access to the aircraft. Introduction 13  
My investigation of the terminal’s interior spaces is not centered on the calculation of  
specific functional attributes. It instead concentrates on the types of materials and archi-  
tectural strategies used to order flows. See Horonjeff et al. \(2010\) for an overview of the  
strategies and formulae used to estimate these dimensions of corridors, lounges, and gates.  
2\. This book expands upon my earlier investigations into air terminal design \(Hubregtse  
2016, 2017\).  
Aside from my publications on airport artworks, there are only a few scholarly analyses  
on this topic. Bernard Flaman \(2009\) examines pieces installed in Canadian airports during  
the 1950s and 1960s. Jo Ankor \(2013\) briefly addresses an artwork installed at Adelaide’s  
airport before considering the experience of seeing an airport’s place-themed imagery in  
light of recent theories of tourism and travel. Christopher Schaberg \(2012\) addresses air-  
port artworks in his analysis of airports and textuality. I discuss his book in further detail  
in Chapters 2 and 4.  
3\. The term ‘landside’ refers to the terminal’s publicly accessible area; ‘airside’ refers to the  
post-security zone.  
4\. See Mike Lazzaroni’s \(2012\) and A. Beck’s \(2011\) reports on how simulation software has  
been used at Vancouver’s YVR and London Heathrow. Horonjeff et al.’s \(2010\) investiga-  
tion of air terminal design examines simulation models and overviews some of the formu-  
lae used to estimate passengers’ wait times and queuing lengths.

ing the project at Heathrow \(J. Wainwright 2014\). Grimshaw Architects designed the ter-

9\. 10. Stantec has designed a number of airports in North and South America.  
Greg Curnoe’s Homage to the R 34, installed at Montreal’s Dorval airport in 1968, is a nota-  
ble exception. Transport Canada, who commissioned the mural, removed it almost immedi-  
ately after its installation since it critiqued the United States’ role in the Vietnam War \(Sloan  
2010; Rodger 2016; King 2017\). The mural depicted a figure resembling President Lyn-  
don Johnson being struck by an airship’s propeller. Johnson drastically increased American  
involvement in the war. The work included text referring to Muhammed Ali, an American  
boxer who protested the Vietnam War. These two panels in particular led to its removal since  
the work greeted US travellers arriving in Canada. Curnoe did not limit his political critique  
to US foreign policy. He included excerpts from the Freedom Anarchists’ Weekly and text  
referring to Paul Joseph Chartier, an Albertan who died trying to bomb the Canadian Par-  
liament in 1966. The work also mentioned Louis Riel, a Métis revolutionary who led two  
rebellions against the Canadian government during the late nineteenth century. In addition,  
the mural addressed how aeronautic technology used for mass air travel often derives from  
military applications. Curnoe chose to depict the R 34, a German airship developed during  
the First World War. While it was meant to serve a military purpose, the airship was used pri-  
marily for civilian air travel following the war. One of the brightly coloured panels includes  
text of an eyewitness account of a German air raid on a London school in 1917.

fic in 2018 \(Airports Council International 2019\).  
12\. My account of this literature concentrates on book-length studies and excludes those that  
are primarily pictorial overviews \(e.g., Arai 1996; van Uffelen 2012; Eiselin, Frommberg,  
and Gutzmer 2016\).  
13\. These pieces include\: Castor Solano’s Vagamundo, 1996, at Madrid-Barajas Terminal  
1; Julian Opie, Imagine That You’re Moving, 1997, at Heathrow’s Flight Connections 14 Introduction  
Centre; and Michael Hayden’s The Sky’s the Limit, 1989, at Chicago O’Hare’s United Ter-  
minal. Pascoe also briefly refers to the works Pelli commissioned for Washington National  
Airport.  
14\. John Urry \(2007\) theorizes this paradigm in the social sciences in terms of mobility-  
systems—the infrastructures that enable people, objects, and information to move from  
place to place—and the effects of these systems on social life. These types of effects have  
been investigated in rail station literature \(Richards and MacKenzie 1986\). Urry, however,  
considers a broad scope of mobility-systems including roadways, pedestrian paths, and  
railways as well as the virtual spaces of the Internet. He argues that aeromobility is the  
main determinant of globalization. Without this mobility-system and the numerous inter-  
national social relations and links it has forged, the current global order would not have  
developed to the degree that it has.  
Ole B. Jensen’s \(2013, 2014\) contributions on ‘mobilities design’ offer a theoretical  
framework for investigating how people engage with the material aspects of various mobil-  
ity-systems \(see also Jensen and Lanng 2017\). These books do not include analyses of air  
terminal design. Jensen’s research methodology involves an assessment of planners’ design  
intentions as well as detailed observations of people’s practices within urban spaces. These  
include quantitative assessments of people’s movements. My investigation concentrates on  
airport architects’ and planners’ design strategies for managing passenger flows and offers  
only general observations of how design affects passenger behaviour.  
15\. Fuller \(2002\) argues that the directional signage in airports does more than simply order  
the space for passengers on a cognitive level. She argues that signs produce the space and  
become part of the airport’s materiality through the passengers’ embodiment of the sig-  
nage’s navigational directions.

# Passenger Circulation  
This chapter examines contemporary international air terminals that include ‘intuitive’  
designs to facilitate wayfinding. While I address these buildings’ structural supports, eleva-  
tions, and footprints, I concentrate on how architects design their interiors with mate-  
rial cues intended to aid with passenger orientation. For instance, they often design the  
concourse with high ceilings such that travellers can see where they are in the building.  
Sometimes planners design these ceilings with skylights or other materials that give the  
sense of the required directional flow. Carpets, colour schemes, and artificial lighting are  
also used for wayfinding purposes. I begin my analysis by outlining some of the central  
aspects of air terminal design before examining three airports in greater detail. Schiphol,  
Heathrow, and Hong Kong International Airport \(HKIA\) are three of the busiest airports  
in the world with respect to international air travel. Their terminals illustrate three differ-  
ent models of development to account for increasing passenger traffic. Schiphol’s terminal  
has been renovated and expanded repeatedly since it first opened in 1967. Rather than  
creating one large terminal building, Heathrow’s planners have built an agglomeration of  
free-standing structures since the airport started its operations in 1946. I focus on Richard  
Rogers Partnership’s Terminal 5, an architectural design subjected to numerous revisions  
before it finally opened in 2008. It illustrates how architects have to adjust their designs  
to account for existing airport buildings and infrastructure. At HKIA, on the other hand,  
architects designed the terminal on an entirely new site. The airport opened in 1998 on  
reclaimed land in the water west of the city’s downtown and replaced Kai Tak, the city’s  
former airport in Kowloon, Hong Kong. I briefly discuss each of these airports’ histories  
before examining their current terminal designs. Although I address the ground transpor-  
tation networks that connect these airports with surrounding cities and regions, I omit a  
description of the rail transportation buildings and parking garages. Instead, I account for  
how the terminals are linked to these transfer points such that the passenger can move  
from the automobile or train to the check-in counter as efficiently as possible. My aim for  
this overview of Schiphol, Heathrow, and HKIA is to provide the reader with an under-  
standing of air terminal design and wayfinding, how this differs from site to site, and some  
of the reasons behind the design choices.  
While architects aim to create terminals that facilitate smooth circulation, they also  
try to design these structures as consumer spaces that generate passenger spending. The  
latter half of this chapter considers how architects incorporate retail and food services  
into their plans and how this sometimes hampers their ability to provide transparent  
designs with regard to wayfinding and navigation. Typically, the main routes travelled  
by departing and arriving passengers are lined with shops and restaurants in order to  
maximize financial return.1 Some interior designs require travellers to walk past retail  
areas, while others, particularly walkthrough duty-free stores, force passengers to Facilitating Passenger Circulation 19  
transit through a commercial space before reaching their gate. Moments of immobility,  
or dwell-time, are seen as a potential commercial boon for airport authorities. In most  
airports, the majority of retail stores and restaurants are located on the post-security  
airside; people are encouraged to loiter in or around shops and restaurants and spend  
their money as they spend their time waiting. Terminals often include a few shops and  
restaurants on the landside for people awaiting arriving friends and family members. In  
my analysis, I focus on walkthrough duty-free stores since these designs exemplify how  
planners use materials to organize passengers’ movement and encourage them to spend.  
In short, this chapter concentrates on air terminal interiors with regard to circula-  
tion, and it aims to provide the reader with an overview of various types of air termi-  
nal layouts. This summary of the material aspects of these complex structures sets the  
stage, so to speak, for the more detailed critical analyses of air terminal architecture,  
artworks, and design in this book.  
Air Terminals as Spaces of Circulation  
airport terminals are the cathedrals of our age—a huge public space where people  
gather, wait, eat, sometimes sleep, and usually shop. These are truly twenty-first-  
century buildings—fluid space for fluid functions using high technology architec-  
ture for spatial containment and cultural expression.  
\(Edwards 2005, x\)  
The twenty-first-century air terminal, Brian Edwards argues, is akin to a cathedral  
architecturally in relation to its structure and manipulation of light. This comparison  
between a transportation building and an ecclesiastical structure is not entirely unu-  
sual. G.K. Chesterton made a comparable pronouncement with respect to railway sta-  
tions \(Richards and MacKenzie 1986\). While air terminals and cathedrals share some  
material similarities, these buildings differ markedly in terms of symbolic and spiritual  
value. Air terminals and railway stations, on the other hand, are very alike in struc-  
ture and in purpose. Edwards notes that in both of these buildings the paths people  
follow in their interiors “are processional and linear” \(2005, x\). They are planned as  
transit hubs that move passengers through the space as efficiently as possible as well  
as marketplaces where travellers are encouraged to dwell and spend their money at air  
terminal retailers. Not only do airport architects need to design a space that functions  
as a passenger-processing machine and a consumption centre, they need to account  
for technological requirements that support aviation and security. While function is  
a major determinant of the design, architects also need to consider the passenger’s  
experience within these structures. Architectural historian Koos Bosma \(1996, 2004\)  
argues that the ideal airport is not simply a transfer point that moves people efficiently  
through the space but is also a place where travellers are kept calm while they wait  
and move through the terminal.  
In his essay “In Search of the Perfect Airport,” Bosma concedes that planners and  
architects have been unable to achieve “typological or architectural purity” in their  
designs since their plans need to account for a vast number of functions integral to an  
airport’s smooth operation \(2004, 64\).2 The strategies used in airports to circulate peo-  
ple, cargo, and aircraft constantly change due to new logistical and security demands,  
technological developments, and shifts in socio-political conditions. This constant  
push for upgrades to improve the speed, efficiency, and security of how passengers  
and freight are processed necessitates renovations, reconstruction, and expansions. 20 Facilitating Passenger Circulation  
Foster + Partners’ design for London’s Stansted anticipated future expansions \(Pow-  
ell 1992\). It is a large single terminal using a modular construction that allows new  
modules to be added without dramatically disrupting the appearance of the whole  
\(Figure 1.1\).  
Figure 1.1 Foster + Partners, London Stansted Airport, United Kingdom, 1991.  
Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2018\). Facilitating Passenger Circulation 21  
Its open-spaced design contrasted with the majority of airports in use when it  
was built in 1991. Many airports, notably Heathrow, had undergone numerous  
reconstructions and renovations and were experienced as a maze of confusing cor-  
ridors \(Gottdiener 2001\). Airports built during the 1950s and 1960s needed to be  
restructured to handle increased passenger loads due to the mass popularization of  
air travel, cheaper airfares, and the introduction of the jumbo jet in 1970 \(Gordon  
2008; Pearman 2004\). Air terminal interiors were also redesigned in response to the  
dramatic increase in hijackings and terrorist attacks during the late 1960s and early  
1970s. New airports constructed during the 1970s, such as Paul Andreu’s Charles  
de Gaulle in Paris, accounted for these increased risks and were designed as heavy  
and solid structures that funnelled passengers through tightly regulated and artifi-  
cially lit corridors.  
3 Stansted is one of many air terminals built after 1990 that are  
designed as large unified structures with lightweight roofs and floor-to-ceiling glass  
walls that allow the passenger to see the terminal from end to end. From the outside,  
these glassy buildings often appear “to float in the air or to be poised to take wing”  
\(Gottdiener 2001, 70\). These spectacular air terminals have been constructed for  
new airports such as Foster + Partners’ Terminal 1 at Chek Lap Kok in Hong Kong  
or for existing airports such as Richard Rogers Partnership’s Terminal 5 at Heath-  
row \(Figure I.2, 1.2\).  
Whether it is one large open space or a solidly built structure with a maze of corri-  
dors, passengers predominantly experience the air terminal by walking and navigating  
Figure 1.2 Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2014\).

themselves through the building’s interior. Signage and other visual cues help lead  
them through the space. At Schiphol, Paul Mijksenaar has carefully designed a signage  
system consisting of nested categories that directs people to their destination \(Cress-  
well 2006; Mijksenaar 2012\). Mijksenaar colour-coded and sized Schiphol’s signage  
according to three categories\: signs directing flows, which indicate where travellers  
need to go in the process; signs referring to fixed locations such as toilets, lounges, and  
chapels; and signs identifying specific shops and restaurants. His design has become an  
“international aesthetic of air mobility” since numerous other airports have adopted  
Schiphol’s signage system \(Cresswell 2006, 246\).  
Planners are trying to design airports where passengers rely less on signage and nav-  
igate the terminal primarily on an intuitive level \(Gordon 2008\). This is intended to  
reduce the stress experienced by travellers and mitigate the increasing number of ‘air  
rage’ incidents. Architects incorporate specific visual cues into their terminal designs  
that are intended to help push passengers into specific directions \(Edwards 2005\). For  
example, columns used to support a roof are often aligned parallel to major routes  
as are other structural elements like beams. Daylight is manipulated and is sometimes  
projected onto passageways to help guide travellers. The size of a space is determined  
by its relative importance as a route; major transit points and thoroughfares like  
departures halls are often built as large concourses while minor routes like emergency  
exits and pathways to private areas are designed as smaller corridors.  
While wayfinding is a significant aspect of air terminal design, the main deter-  
minant of the building’s overall form is the airport’s runways. These vast expanses  
of tarmac occupy most of the airport’s landmass, and they are relatively fixed once  
they have been developed. Airport planning firms such as NACO \(Netherlands Air-  
port Consultants\) determine the ground plan based on the area between the runways  
and how aircraft can best access the terminal’s gates \(Hein Baijer, Piet Ringersma,  
and Toon Stallaart, pers. comm., April 10, 2018\). NACO designed Beijing Capital  
International Airport’s Terminal 3 with a Y-shaped footprint since this configuration  
works well for long, narrow segments of land between two parallel runways. Hong  
Kong International Airport’s Terminal 1 has a comparable shape since it is also placed  
between two parallel runways. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol’s terminal is situated in  
an area enclosed by three runways and a highway.4 It consists of seven piers, each with  
a different footprint, radiating out from the main terminal structure. Unlike HKIA  
Terminal 1 and Beijing Terminal 3, Schiphol’s terminal does not have a symmetrical  
footprint—largely because it has been substantially reconstructed and expanded since  
it opened in 1967. Beijing Terminal 3 and HKIA Terminal 1, on the other hand, have  
undergone few renovations since they were opened in 2008 and 1996 respectively.5  
HKIA has added separate satellite terminals.6  
Once NACO has determined the ideal shape of a terminal’s footprint with  
respect to the runways, apron, and required gates, they modify the design such  
that it is easier for passengers to navigate \(Hein Baijer, Piet Ringersma, and Toon  
Stallaart, pers. comm., April 10, 2018\). NACO tries to limit the number of ‘deci-  
sion points’ that travellers encounter during their transit through the terminal.  
Often, they adjust the footprint such that a terminal’s piers only converge at one  
point. Furthermore, the firm tries to keep sightlines in the direction one needs  
to travel unobscured, especially if it allows for a view of the exterior apron and  
aircraft through a window. In their design for Mexico City’s new international  
airport, NACO decided to deploy an X-shaped footprint where four piers intersect Facilitating Passenger Circulation 23  
at one central point instead of an H-shaped footprint with two parallel piers con-  
nected by a central perpendicular corridor.7 The check-in area is located between  
two of the piers. NACO has decided to direct passengers to a balcony immediately  
after the check-in such that they can look down upon the terminal’s key decision  
point—the intersection where the four piers meet. HKIA has a similar configura-  
tion. Once passengers have passed through security, they enter an area that over-  
looks an important intersection. Figure 1.3 shows the view from the escalator that  
leads down to a decision point where travellers need to choose the route to their  
gate. I discuss this terminal’s layout in further detail in the following section. Stan-  
tec \(formerly Architectura\) employed an analogous design principle in its plans  
for the Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport \(Noel Best, pers. comm.,  
December 17, 2018\).  
8 The firm designed the building such that the apron and  
aircraft are visible from the check-in area on the departures floor. In this respect,  
Ottawa’s airport is an exception. In most terminals, passengers are not able to see  
the apron until after they have cleared pre-boarding security.  
Like NACO’s plans for the new terminal in Mexico City, Stantec designed a new  
terminal for Ottawa’s airport. Its existing terminal remained operational until the new  
terminal opened in October 2003 \(Campion-Smith 2003\). Clearly, when architects  
develop a new terminal from scratch, they can incorporate unobstructed sightlines  
and limited decision points early in the design process. These wayfinding solutions

are certainly more difficult to implement when renovating an existing terminal. Next,  
I discuss the different types of wayfinding strategies Jan Benthem has incorporated  
into his renovations of Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport.  
Schiphol, Heathrow, and HKIA\: Accretion, Agglomeration,  
and Relocation  
When planners need to expand an airport’s terminal due to increasing passenger traf-  
fic, they can apply three different approaches\: accretion, in which the existing terminal  
building is expanded; agglomeration, where a new distinct terminal is built adjacent  
to the existing terminal structure; or relocation, when an entirely new airport and air  
terminal are constructed on a larger area of land. This section describes how architects  
have applied these three respective planning types at Schiphol, Heathrow, and HKIA.  
I will briefly discuss these airports’ origins before addressing how they have grown  
over time and how their terminals are designed to enable passenger movement. This  
description of their layouts illustrates the complexity of the terminal’s interior space  
and why wayfinding design matters.  
Schiphol’s terminal has been expanded numerous times since it opened in 1967 and  
is an example of accretion. Benthem’s master plan from 1997, which depicts Schiphol  
in 2015, illustrates how the terminal consists of a number of piers radiating from a  
central structure \(see Plate 4\). The airport has gradually added more piers to accom-  
modate increasing passenger traffic. Benthem’s master plan outlined his strategy for  
further growth—some piers needed to be expanded, and new ones, such as the H-pier,  
had to be built. I describe the terminal’s layout in further detail below.  
Schiphol, located eleven kilometres southwest from Amsterdam’s city centre, was  
first used for military purposes during the First World War \(Dierikx and Bouwens  
1997\).9 In 1920, the Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij voor Nederland en Koloniën  
\(KLM\), the Netherlands’ national airline founded a year earlier, was awarded a con-  
tract to fly scheduled flights carrying mail from the airport to London. During the  
next few years, Schiphol’s operations shifted towards civilian use, becoming KLM’s  
main airport. The airport’s first passenger terminal, a one-storey building made of red  
brick, was completed in time for the city’s hosting of the 1928 Olympic Games. The  
terminal was substantially redeveloped during 1936 and 1937. The check-in hall was  
expanded and a second storey was built to house a restaurant and other amenities for  
visitors, many of whom came to the airport to see what went on outside on the apron  
and to watch the aircraft come and go.10 During the Second World War, the German  
Luftwaffe appropriated the airport. In 1943, Allied forces bombed Schiphol, causing  
the Luftwaffe to cease operations. After the war ended, the Dutch government began  
to rebuild the ruined airport \(Versleijen 1999\). Soon afterwards, it built a new longer  
runway plus additional terminal facilities with the introduction of jet aircraft in the  
late 1950s.  
In 1961, the Dutch Government approved the development of an entirely new ter-  
minal \(Kloos and de Maar 1999; Berkers and Burgers 2013a\). This building is still  
being used today, although it has expanded extensively since its opening in 1967.11  
The terminal was designed by Marius Duintjer, the project’s chief architect; Frans de  
Weger, an engineer; and NACO, which was responsible for planning the landside and  
airside operations and organizing the development’s finances, contracts, and staff. In  
1962, Kho Liang Ie Associates was hired to design the terminal’s interior. The new Facilitating Passenger Circulation 25  
terminal’s layout was based on Chicago’s O’Hare Airport. Duintjer placed the arrivals  
area on the ground floor and the departures area on the first level above.12 Depart-  
ing passengers were afforded with views of the aprons and aircraft. Despite numer-  
ous renovations, this configuration has been retained. Kho Liang Ie devised a colour  
scheme for the 1967 terminal that has remained relatively unchanged. In his design he  
only used muted colours throughout the terminal so that the signs, which were green  
and yellow, could clearly stand out from the surrounding architecture \(see Plate 5\).  
He argued that the passengers’ clothing and luggage would animate the terminal with  
additional colours. In the subsequent renovations and expansions, the tiling, walls,  
and ceilings have been predominantly neutral colours such as white, grey, and black,  
and the signage currently uses yellow with black text, blue with white text, green with  
white text, or dark grey with yellow or white text.  
Passengers access their aircraft via piers that expand out from the main terminal  
area \(Plate 4\). All airport gates are located on the piers, which are designated by let-  
ters. When it first opened, the terminal had three piers\: C, D, and E \(Kloos and de  
Maar 1999\). The C-pier was expanded in 1970. A new F-pier was completed in 1975.  
During the same year, the terminal was expanded. In 1983, Schiphol decided that the  
original E-pier needed to be larger so that it could accommodate wide-body jet air-  
craft. The new E-pier opened in 1987. In 1989, construction began on an extension to  
the D-pier which opened the following year. The G-pier was built in 1992.  
In 1985 some of the states within the European Union signed the Schengen Agree-  
ment, intended to eliminate border controls between the signatory states \(Cresswell  
2006; Berkers and Burgers 2013a\). Ten years later, the Schengen Area was established,  
and European airports had to be renovated to separate Schengen flights from non-  
Schengen flights. Most airports in the Schengen Area rearranged their terminals so  
that passengers flying to and from other Schengen states would be paired with travel-  
lers flying domestically. Schiphol, on the other hand, had no existing space that was  
allocated to domestic flights since the airport’s traffic was mostly international, so the  
air terminal had to be rearranged to account for the two different passenger streams.  
The C-pier along with a new B-pier, which opened in 1994, are for travellers flying to  
and from Schengen countries and who do not have to pass through passport control  
\(Kloos and de Maar 1999; Bosma 2013\). The E-, F-, and G-piers are for passengers  
flying to and from non-Schengen countries and who do need to be screened by border  
officials. The D-pier became the border zone between the Schengen and non-Schengen  
spaces, and it services flights to both areas.13  
At the time of writing, the B-, C-, D-, E-, F-, and G-pier all appear fairly similar.  
Each pier is a relatively long corridor with gates on each side \(see Plate 5\). Floor-to-  
ceiling windows offer views out to the aprons on both sides of the piers. They all have  
light grey floor tiling and use neutral colours for the ceilings and walls. The gates  
are indicated by signs with a yellow background and black lettering with the same  
typeface. One exceptional difference is that the wall tiling around the entrance to the  
restrooms and in their interiors are different colours for each pier. The piers extend  
from Schiphol’s lounges, areas that are in the post-security zone that contain numer-  
ous shops, restaurants, cafés, and other amenities \(Figure 1.4\). In the non-Schengen  
area, there is a corridor connecting its two lounges called Holland Boulevard, which  
I discuss in more detail in Chapter 5.  
In November 2005, Schiphol opened a new pier that is dedicated to low-cost carri-  
ers such as EasyJet \(NRC Handelsblad 2005; Brandsma 2005\). It was built with seven Figure 1.4 Benthem Crouwel Architects NACO, Terminal-West, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol,  
Netherlands, 1993.

gates and no aerobridges to access the planes. The gates, which are on the ground  
level, are approached by escalators from the corridor above and have waiting areas  
with only a few seats. Passengers enter and exit the plane by a movable staircase and  
need to walk across the tarmac to and from the gate. This loading procedure mark-  
edly reduces the aircraft’s turnover time between landing and take-off—a key strategy  
employed by discount carriers to reduce their operation costs. The pier’s gates can  
either be designated as H for non-Schengen flights or M for Schengen flights, and these  
passenger streams are separated by a vertical glass wall on the upper corridor. Unlike  
the other piers, the H/M-pier does not have any shops or restaurants. Nevertheless,  
passengers do have access to shops and cafés between security and the pier itself.14  
Unlike the other piers at Schiphol, the H/M-pier has only one wall with floor-to-ceiling  
windows looking out to the aprons, and its flooring is much darker than the light grey  
tiles used throughout the rest of the terminal.  
The most substantial shift in how Schiphol managed its terminal design and devel-  
opment occurred during the 1980s. The company wanted to have an architect that  
could organize the airport’s design as one cohesive whole rather than a cluster of  
developments in differing styles \(Kloos and de Maar 1999\). The architectural firm,  
Benthem Crouwel Architects, which had designed projects for the airport including a  
bicycle shed in 1982 and a bus shelter in 1986, was approached for the job.15 In 1988,  
Benthem Crouwel Architects began a partnership with NACO.  
The partnership’s first major expansion, Terminal-West, was completed in 1993  
\(Kloos and de Maar 1999\). Like Duintjer’s 1967 terminal, its arrivals area is on the  
ground level and the departures area is on the level above. Terminal-West is built out  
of three fifty-metre modules and can be extended up to 350 metres. The new expan-  
sion and the existing terminal, which are intended to be perceived as one unified build-  
ing, are connected by an eighty-metre-long corridor. Terminal-West’s ceiling, which  
has skylights and a more lightweight appearance than the 1967 terminal’s ceiling, is  
supported by V-shaped columns. The building is encased in glass on both the landside  
and airside. On the landside, the departures level is separated from the exterior wall  
and natural light falls onto the arrivals level below. The lower level does not abut an  
exterior wall since it adjoins Schiphol Plaza, which was completed in 1995 \(discussed  
below\). Schiphol Plaza is adjacent to both Terminal-West’s and the 1967 terminal’s  
arrivals levels. In the latter building, the floor of the departures level on the landside is  
built against the exterior wall; therefore, no natural light shines into the lower arrivals  
area.16  
In 1990, Nel Verschuuren from Kho Liang Ie Associates was appointed to work  
with Benthem on Schiphol’s interior design \(Kloos and de Maar 1999; Berkers and  
Burgers 2013b\). Verschuuren had worked with Kho on the original 1967 terminal and  
its expansion in 1975. Like Kho’s design for the original 1967 terminal, Verschuuren  
used neutral colours for Terminal-West’s tiling, ceiling, and walls. She also tried to  
retain Duintjer and Kho’s design principle that views to the aircraft outside should be  
as unrestricted as possible. Verschuuren considered how eye-catching objects might be  
used as landmarks for wayfinding. On the airside of the terminal, Benthem and Ver-  
schuuren designed a bar housed within a golden dome that was also intended as a land-  
mark for navigation. Similarly, Verschuuren used artworks as locating devices. This  
included Mark Brusse’s I meet you, a pair of oversize Dutch clogs carved out of red  
stone and placed on top of a tall black plinth \(Figure 1.5\). It was placed in Arrival 3’s Figure 1.5 Mark Brusse, I meet you, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Netherlands, 1993.

landside area. Meeters and greeters can sit at the base of the work while they await  
arriving passengers.  
In 1995, the airport opened Schiphol Plaza, a triangular building that abuts both  
terminals and contains the Netherlands’ national rail company’s station \(Benthem  
Crouwel Architects and Schipper 2010\).17 Schiphol Plaza’s ground level has a large  
central area where passengers and visitors enter from the railway concourse below, the  
passageways that lead to parking garages, or the entrances that face the Jan Dallaert-  
plein, an outdoor square adjacent to a road accessed by buses and taxis \(Figure 1.6\).  
The ticketing desks for Nederlandse Spoorwegen are in this central area along with a  
few cafés and bars. A ring around the central area forms a shopping mall that abuts  
the arrivals areas of both terminals. Skylights allow natural light to shine into the  
shopping mall corridor.  
The ceiling covering the central area in Schiphol Plaza is twelve metres high \(Kloos  
and de Maar 1999\). Benthem Crouwel Architects deliberately chose to build a high  
ceiling because they wanted to maximize the visibility of the directional signage since  
it is a complex space in terms of wayfinding—a number of different passenger streams  
converge in the central area. The firm use tinted glass for the building’s façade to allow  
for views to the landside exterior and to create a darker interior, which would make  
electronic signs easier to read. The designers assumed that people are compelled to

move towards lighter spaces and that passengers would be drawn to walk to the more  
brightly lit terminals from the dim Schiphol Plaza. They also used another technique  
to guide people without relying on signage; the railway concourse below was not  
entirely soundproofed so that passengers and visitors on the ground level could hear  
the trains.  
Dennis Adams’s Coda was installed at the time of the plaza’s opening. This cubic  
structure painted with red and white checkers is one of Schiphol’s official meeting  
points \(see Plate 6\). Coda’s coloured pattern is used in aviation to demarcate obsta-  
cles and hazards. On each side there is a ledge that visitors can sit on and an opening  
to the cube’s interior. This conspicuous structure contrasts with the muted colours  
of the surrounding space and is included on the airport’s maps as a landmark for  
wayfinding. Coda is one of many artworks installed at the airport which are intended  
to operate as navigational aids. I address a number of these works in the subsequent  
chapters.  
Heathrow is an example of growth by agglomeration. The airport has gradually  
added new distinct terminal structures in response to increasing passenger traffic. This  
massive complex, which is one of the world’s busiest airports, is located twenty-five  
kilometres west of London’s core. Heathrow Airport, when officially opened as a  
civilian airport in 1946, replaced Croydon as the nation’s principal airport soon after  
it was built \(Dierikx and Bouwens 1997; Gallop 2005\).18 It was originally a private  
aerodrome developed during the early 1930s. The Air Ministry obtained the land in  
1944 and claimed that it would be converted into a Royal Air Force airport. However,  
the Air Ministry’s actual plans were to convert this site into London’s main civilian  
airport once the Second World War ended. Heathrow Airport, which was renamed  
London Airport, began its operations with tented passenger terminals. Inside one of  
the tents was a W.H. Smith & Sons shop, which sold newspapers, magazines, and  
cigarettes \(this shop has proven to be rather successful at Heathrow—WHSmith shops  
are situated before and after security at each of the terminals\). By the end of the year,  
the airport had erected passenger terminals built out of the same type of construction  
materials used in prefabricated homes built after the war. In 1955, London Airport  
opened a more permanent steel-framed passenger terminal encased with glass, red  
brick, and stone. Frederick Gibberd, a British architect, designed the new terminal  
as well as a new control tower and an office building with a public observation deck  
on its roof. These buildings, which were located in a central area inside a triangle of  
runways, were accessed by a newly built 628-metre-long tunnel that passed under one  
of the runways. Many of the airlines flying out of London Airport moved into the  
new terminal, which contained numerous restaurants, lounges, and shops. The main  
part of the terminal was named the Europa Building, and it serviced flights to destina-  
tions across Europe. A western section of the building, named the Britannic Building,  
serviced domestic flights. The airlines that maintained their operations in the older  
terminal moved out of the building in 1961, when London Airport opened its Oceanic  
Building also designed by Gibberd.  
In 1966, the British Airport Authority \(BAA\) assumed the operations of London  
Airport \(Gallop 2005\). The British government handed the airport, which had received  
massive amounts of investment and had continually failed to generate profits, to this  
independent body along with Stansted, Gatwick, and Prestwick Airport in Glasgow.  
Shortly after it acquired London Airport, the BAA renamed it Heathrow Airport,  
and its three-letter code was changed from LAP to LHR. In 1969, Heathrow Airport Facilitating Passenger Circulation 31  
opened its third Gibberd-designed passenger terminal, Terminal 1, and the Europa  
Building and Oceanic Building were renamed Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, respectively.  
With the advent of the jumbo jet and the subsequent spike in air travel during the  
1970s, more and more passengers departed, landed, and transferred at Heathrow, and  
its three terminals became more and more crowded. In the late 1970s, BAA started  
developing its plans for a fourth terminal. This new structure had to be situated away  
from the other three terminals because the central area between the runways had  
reached its capacity. BAA decided that Terminal 4 would be built across the runway to  
the south of the central area, and it commissioned the architectural firm Scott, Brown-  
rigg & Turner to design the building. Before BAA could bring this massive project to  
fruition, it had to await the approval of a public inquiry. It was approved, and the new  
terminal officially opened in 1986.19  
Although the public inquiry slowed the development of Terminal 4, it was nowhere  
near as long as the public inquiry into the development of Terminal 5, which was the  
longest in UK history \(Doherty 2008\). Even before Terminal 4 was completed, BAA  
was looking to build a fifth terminal at the western edge of the land between the two  
runways. The construction of this new terminal required a major redevelopment of  
the existing site. A sewage treatment plant had to be moved, two rivers had to be  
diverted, a new roadway had to be built, and the rail and London Underground lines  
accessing Heathrow had to be extended. As expected, the proposal for this massive  
development was subject to a public inquiry. BAA spent two years preparing its case,  
and the inquiry began in 1995. The main stakeholders in the inquiry were BAA, Brit-  
ish Airways, a number of local community councils, and the Highways Agency. The  
inquiry, which ran for 525 days and closed in 1999, mainly addressed the reasoning  
behind Heathrow’s proposed expansion, the impact of a new motorway leading to the  
terminal, the airport’s noise levels, and environmental and air quality concerns.  
In 2001, the British government announced the outcome of the inquiry—BAA was  
officially approved to build the new terminal. More than a decade had passed since  
the first architectural plans were drawn for Terminal 5.20 Richard Rogers Partnership  
had won the competition for Terminal 5 in 1989, and the firm’s original plans were  
substantially altered by the time the terminal opened in 2008.21 Following the public  
inquiry, the partnership had to make some concessions such as reducing the site’s  
footprint \(Pearman 2008a\). A number of the design choices that the firm had wanted  
to employ at Terminal 5 were incorporated into Madrid-Barajas Airport Terminal 4,  
which the firm designed in conjunction with Estudio Lamela and opened in 2006  
\(Powell 2003\). The terminal at Madrid-Barajas was designed with a wave-like roof  
with multiple undulations which resemble the original plans for Terminal 5’s roof \(see  
Plate 7\). But the roof that was ultimately built over the main concourse at Terminal 5  
has one simple curve \(Figure I.2\). The parking garage, which has six levels, is a sepa-  
rate structure thirty-five metres to the west of the main terminal \(Macnair 2007; Pear-  
man 2008a\). Cars, taxis, and buses approach the airport via a large curved ramp that  
leads to the top level of the parking garage where there is a passenger pick-up and  
drop-off zone. Passengers can enter the terminal via bridges connecting the top floor  
of the car park to the departures level or through covered passageways under these  
bridges on the ground level, which is the arrivals level in the terminal. The decision to  
build the car park and the land transportation access point as a separate structure was  
partly driven by security concerns—the thirty-five-metre separation could mitigate the  
potential damage caused by a car bomb. The terminal’s main structure is essentially 32 Facilitating Passenger Circulation  
the building’s envelope, which is the curved roof supported by a series of structural  
trees on the inside of the building and the four glass curtain walls encasing the space  
\(Figure 1.7\). The interior construction is independent from the exterior shell, which  
allows for changes to the interior spatial arrangement without having to do any reno-  
vations to the support structure.  
Terminal 5’s section and elevation are unconventional with regard to air terminal  
design \(Pearman 2008a\). Because of the building’s limited footprint, Richard Rog-  
ers Partnership needed to organize the space on more vertical levels than most other  
terminals which tend to expand horizontally.22 The interior space is divided into four  
storeys above ground and three below. On the pre-security side, there are two levels  
above ground that are accessible to passengers\: the departures area on the top level  
\(Figure I.2\) and the arrivals area on the ground level \(see Plate 8\). On the post-security  
side, the departures area is split into two levels \(Figure 1.7\). The top level is on the  
same level as the departures area on the pre-security side and accommodates shopping  
and restaurants. The gates are situated one level below, which also has shops, restau-  
rants, and cafés, as well as seating areas. Passengers arriving at the terminal move  
through two levels on the post-security side\: the baggage claim is on the ground level  
and the UK border control is one floor above. On the pre-security side, passengers  
need to descend to an underground level to access the Heathrow Express, a non-stop  
Figure 1.7 Richard Rogers Partnership, Terminal 5, London Heathrow Airport, United King-  
dom, 2008.  
Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2013\). Facilitating Passenger Circulation 33  
high-speed train to central London, and the London Underground, the city’s public  
transit railway system. On the post-security side, there is also an underground level  
that accesses a rail line—the shuttle that connects to Terminals 5B and 5C. These are  
two satellite buildings east of the main terminal building. Terminal 5B was completed  
at the same time as the main structure, and Terminal 5C opened in 2011 \(Heathrow  
Airport Information 2011\).  
The pre-security departures level spans the length of the building and encom-  
passes a vast space \(Figure I.2\). Even though this space is relatively open compared  
to the more complex layouts at accreted terminals such as Schiphol, Richard Rogers  
Partnership has incorporated some wayfinding strategies into the architecture. This  
includes a different colour scheme for the various access points to the terminal. There  
are four bridges that connect this level to the car park, and at the entrance to each  
one there is an elevator and a set of escalators that lead down to the arrivals area  
below. Each one of these bridge-elevator-escalator modules is designated by a differ-  
ent colour; the structures supporting the elevators and the I-beams supporting the  
bridges are painted in red, orange, green, and purple \(see Plate 8\). The escalators and  
elevators that access the Heathrow Express and London Underground are situated  
in a large blue support structure nestled between the car park and the terminal and  
situated between the green and purple bridges. These are the only the support struc-  
tures on the pre-security side of the building that are painted with distinct colours.  
The columns and beams supporting the roof, curtain glass walls, and other structures  
are painted white or grey. The colour-coded ‘mobility-modules’ are landmarks in this  
expansive space and undoubtedly aid with the passengers’ and visitors’ navigation  
of the terminal. The green and orange modules are used to designate meeting points.  
Each one has a long vertical banner in the same colour that hangs in the arrivals area  
and indicates that it is a meeting point\: green is the north meeting point, and orange  
is the south meeting point.  
During the design process, BAA hired Vancouver-based Architectura, which is now  
Stantec, to conduct analyses of anticipated passenger flows in the terminal and iden-  
tify any wayfinding issues with Richard Rogers Partnership’s terminal planning \(Noel  
Best, pers. comm., December 17, 2018\).23 The firm’s team, led by Noel Best, com-  
pleted its assessments and designs by 2004, four years before the terminal officially  
opened. One of Best’s recommended changes included a reorientation of the escalators  
in the terminal’s satellite building \(Figure 1.8\). Rather than placing the upward and  
downward escalators side by side, Stantec rearranged them such that they were placed  
opposite to one another in the space. The adjusted design separates the passenger  
streams and, according to Best, prevents bottlenecks caused by travellers having to  
decide, on the moving escalator, which direction to take on arrival at the next level.  
Instead, passengers approaching the escalators will have already decided where they  
are heading. In addition to providing recommendations for more intuitive and effec-  
tive passenger flows, Stantec also recommended the location and text for the termi-  
nal’s signage.  
Some intuitive cues were already present in Richard Rogers Partnership’s design for  
Terminal 5 \(Figure I.2\). The ceiling’s materials form distinct lines running parallel to  
the direction that passengers need to travel to get to their plane, and it has rows of  
skylights running in this direction that allow light to be cast on the floor. This flooring,  
made of resin-stone conglomerate tiles, is highly reflective, and it clearly reproduces  
the band of light cast from the skylights above.24 34 Facilitating Passenger Circulation

Even though the departures area on the pre-security side at Terminal 5 is vast, it  
is easy to orient oneself within the concourse because of the relatively unobstructed  
views of the ceiling and walls \(Figure I.2\). Three of the glass curtain walls are visible  
from most points in the check-in area. The wall of glass facing the airside is blocked  
by a barrier that contains the security checkpoints. The curved ceiling, which has  
skylights running widthwise, is mostly visible with the exception of what is blocked  
by the barrier. On the post-security airside, the views of the ceiling and glass walls are  
often obstructed because of the two-level installation of retail shops and restaurants.  
In the spaces where there is an upward view, the ceiling’s curvature and striated sky-  
lights offer a sense of which direction one is facing \(Figure 1.9\).  
Passengers do get an expansive view of the space at two points on the top level,  
where there are balconies that offer views of the level below, of the ceiling above,  
and through the wall of glass to the aircraft outside on the apron \(Figure 1.7\). Look-  
ing down from these balconies, passengers can see the seating areas, shops, and res-  
taurants below. These types of views are not available in the arrivals area on the  
terminal’s airside, which are on the two levels below. But unlike the departures area,  
travellers rarely need to orient themselves with respect to the terminal’s layout as their  
options in terms of movement are far more limited. Signage and corridors direct them Figure 1.9 Richard Rogers Partnership, Terminal 5, London Heathrow Airport, United King-  
dom, 2008.

to the baggage claim and border control. Passengers transferring to other flights are  
directed to corridors leading back into the departures area or to shuttles heading to  
Heathrow’s other terminals. Unlike departing travellers, who are free to move through  
a vast space with numerous consumer choices while they spend time waiting, arriving  
and transferring passengers in the airside arrivals area are expected to follow routes in  
one direction and only stop at the screening points, the baggage claim, and the toilets  
if necessary.  
Departing passengers appear to be encouraged to explore the terminal since they  
are not notified of their gate prior to passing through security. Electronic screens on  
the post-security airside display the gate information. For flights within the UK and  
Europe, gates are posted forty-five to sixty minutes before the departure time. For  
all other destinations, gates are posted seventy-five minutes in advance. For flights  
departing from Terminal 5B and 5C, the gates are posted two hours beforehand to  
give passengers enough time to catch the shuttle to these satellite concourses. From my  
observations at Terminal 5, there are only few travellers that take a seat and wait near  
the gates, which is likely due to the announcement of the gate information only shortly  
before passengers need to board their plane. Most passengers wait in the central seat-  
ing areas, walk through the terminal, shop in the numerous stores, or eat and drink at  
the restaurants and cafés.  
HKIA is an example of an airport that was relocated to a new site. Its architects and  
planners did not need to adjust the air terminal design according to existing build-  
ings and airport infrastructure. HKIA in its entirety—the runways, the terminals, the  
access roads, the train station, etc.—were built on a new site that was reclaimed from  
the water west of Hong Kong \(Figure 1.10\). HKIA, also known as Chek Lap Kok, was  
built to replace the city’s former airport, Kai Tak, in Kowloon, Hong Kong, which  
had been in operation since 1925 \(Government of the Hong Kong Special Administra-  
tive Region n.d.\). Kai Tak, which was located near a dense urban area, was reaching  
capacity and could not be expanded to deal with the expected rises in passenger traf-  
fic. The new airport was built upon two islands and a large portion of reclaimed land  
surrounding them. Lam Chau Island and Chek Lap Kok Island, which had a mountain  
one hundred metres high, were reconfigured to have a flat plane with an elevation of  
ca. 6.5 metres extending 6 kilometres in length and 3.5 kilometres in width \(Pearson  
1998\).25 At the time of the airport’s opening in 1998, HKIA’s Terminal 1 was the  
world’s largest air terminal \(Pearson 1998\). It encompassed ca. 550,000 square metres  
of floor area and was designed to process thirty-five million passengers per year. The  
airport’s planners had already accounted for potential expansions; these would come  
in the form of satellite terminals.26  
HKIA was perceived as the last major undertaking by the British in Hong Kong  
before the former British colony was handed over to China in 1997 \(Glanville 1998;  
MacQueen 1998\). The consortium that won the commission in March 1992—Foster +  
Partners, BAA, and Mott Connell—was largely British, and the design for the most  
impressive structure on the site, Terminal 1, derives from an air terminal on British  
soil. Foster + Partners based their plans on what they had learned while designing  
London’s Stansted Airport, which opened in 1991.27 Pearman \(2008b\) argues that  
when Stansted opened it truly was a “revolutionary” new design, comparable to Eero  
Saarinen’s Dulles Airport in Washington D.C. which opened in 1962. At Stansted,  
Foster + Partners redefined airport design by moving the baggage handling systems  
to the basement and opening up the terminal space under one large roof \(Figure 1.1\). Figure 1.10 Foster + Partners, Terminal 1, Hong Kong International Airport, Hong Kong,  
1998\. Aerial view.  
Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2014\). 38 Facilitating Passenger Circulation  
Like Stansted, HKIA’s Terminal 1 is built with modules that are repeated in space.  
Foster + Partners’ plans for a standardized module at Terminal 1 allowed for an eco-  
nomical and flexible design.28 It differs from the design at Stansted, where each square  
module curves in two directions and has a central skylight. At Terminal 1 the module  
is designed with one longitudinal curve, and the succession of these modules give the  
sense of a directional flow across the length of the airport \(Figure 1.11\). At Stansted,  
on the other hand, the square modules read more like a grid that expands across two  
axes in space. The longitudinal module at HKIA Terminal 1 exemplifies the functional  
aesthetic concerning circulation which I examine in Chapter 2. It operates as a cue to  
entice passengers to move along this axis, which is the general direction they need to  
follow as they walk from the check-in to the gate.  
Foster + Partners used these modules to create a symmetrical design with the north  
side of the terminal mirroring its south side \(Figure 1.10\). The building was designed  
not only with an attention to how it would look on the inside but also from the out-  
side with a view from above \(Davey 1998\). The building’s plan, which arriving and  
departing passengers can see from the window of their jet, “recalls the footprint of a  
primitive aeroplane” \(Edwards 2005, 187\). On the terminal’s east side, a series of nine  
barrel vaults cover the landside departures area, which is a large rectangular space.  
Immediately adjacent to this space on the west is a triangular space also covered by  
Figure 1.11 Foster + Partners, Terminal 1, Hong Kong International Airport, Hong Kong,  
1998.  
Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2014\). Facilitating Passenger Circulation 39  
nine barrel vaults, which contains the airside shopping spaces and food court. At the  
base of this triangle, there are two rectangular wings each composed of five barrel  
vaults that extend north and south, which contain a few of the terminal’s gates. The  
central barrel vault connected to the central rectangular and triangular spaces projects  
towards the west before forking off into two angled wings each composed of eight  
barrel vaults. This Y-shaped concourse contains most of the terminal’s gates. The long  
central vault, when seen inside the building, exemplifies the sense of the lengthwise  
flow through the terminal \(Figure 1.11\).29  
Hong Kong’s Terminal 1 is arranged such that the arrivals level is below the depar-  
tures level. Passengers arriving at the gates are funnelled through this lower level to  
the Hong Kong border screening area or over to connecting flights. Travellers arriv-  
ing at gates on the terminal’s west side are directed to take a shuttle train that runs  
below the arrivals level along the long central concourse. Passengers departing from  
the gates at the building’s west end can take this shuttle train in the other direction to  
avoid walking the length of the central concourse. This train also accesses the Mid-  
field Concourse, a satellite terminal which opened in 2016. In Terminal 1, departing  
passengers must pass down a series of escalators located shortly after the pre-security  
baggage check on the building’s east side to access the train. Arriving and departing  
travellers do not encounter one another on the shuttle train, as they are directed along  
separate routes and enter and exit the shuttle at different points. Upon exiting the  
train, arriving passengers are ferried up escalators and deposited near the Hong Kong  
border screening zone.  
Arriving passengers remain on this same level as they collect their luggage from the  
baggage claim and pass through the gateway to the landside area. From here they can  
walk through the space where meeters and greeters await and head directly to the  
high-speed train to Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Tsing Yi without needing to change  
levels \(Figure 1.2\).30 This rail station, which was also designed by Foster + Partners,  
accords with the design logic of the air terminal. Trains arriving at HKIA from the  
city stop on a level of the rail station that is connected by a series of bridges to the  
terminal’s check-in area.  
These bridges are one of two sets of bridges that cross an expansive space in Ter-  
minal 1’s landside area \(Figure 1.2\). In this respect, the building parallels Heathrow  
Terminal 5 whose space is likewise defined by bridges leading to the various transport  
systems accessing the airport. Though unlike Heathrow Terminal 5, the bridges are  
angled ramps going both up and down to different levels of access points on the exte-  
rior of the building.31  
The angled ramps that cross through Terminal 1’s concourse on the landside area  
are placed in a symmetrical fashion, as are the escalators in this space. From Terminal  
1’s landside arrivals area there is a central escalator and lift module that leads to the  
departures area above. There are also two sets of escalators leading from the arrivals  
level to the departures level on the north and south sides of the terminal. The angled  
ramps are divided into two sets of four and are situated between the central escala-  
tors and the escalators near the exterior sides. These two sets of ramps are in a mirror  
image of each other. Starting with the building’s centre and moving to the terminal’s  
exterior, they are arranged as follows\: train to check-in, roadway to check-in, train  
to check-in, and roadway to check-in. Under the outermost ramps on both sides of  
the terminal, there are escalators that lead down to the arrivals level from the corri-  
dor connecting to the arriving trains. It appears that these were built for the meeters 40 Facilitating Passenger Circulation  
and greeters that come to the airport via the high-speed rail line as these escalators  
are in line with the two points where arriving passengers exit from the airside to the  
landside. In terms of wayfinding, this symmetrical layout of these ramps differs from  
the coloured mobility-modules at Heathrow Terminal 5. Although there is no dif-  
ferentiation between each ramp along the width of the terminal, these structures run  
lengthwise across the terminal’s space and emphasize the same directional flow as the  
ceiling’s longitudinal modules.  
The departures level is also a symmetrical design. There are two security check-  
points, one on the north side and the other on the south. In between these checkpoints  
is a two-level restaurant and shopping area. Restaurants on the second level offer  
views across the concourse’s large expansive space. At the top of the escalators on the  
second level, airport visitors can look through a glass barrier to the food court on the  
terminal’s airside. In addition, they can look down to the movement of passengers  
on the arrivals level before they have passed through the border screening zone and  
picked up their luggage from the baggage claim area. This vantage point also allows  
for a view along the terminal’s long central vault.  
Upon exiting security on either the north or the south side of the terminal, pas-  
sengers enter a shopping space. Between these two shopping spaces is a food court,  
which has seating that offers views down the concourse as well as down to some of  
the shops on the level below \(see Plate 9\). This upper level of the airside departures  
area is situated above an extensive shopping mall on the departures area’s lower floor.  
Passengers must take an escalator down to this lower level as all of the terminal’s  
gates are accessed from the floor below \(Figure 1.3\). While moving down the escala-  
tor, passengers get a clear view of a significant decision point on the lower level. It is a  
three-way intersection between routes leading to gates along the long singular central  
vault and the gates in the north and south wings on the terminal’s east side. This inter-  
section also has escalators that descend to the underground rail line connecting to the  
two wings at the terminal’s western side and another set of escalators that descend to  
the waiting areas for gates 501–530. These waiting areas are situated on the same  
level as the tarmac. Unlike the gates above where travellers board their planes via air  
bridges, passengers are driven from these gates directly to their aircraft by bus or shut-  
tled to the North Satellite Concourse building that houses gates 501–510.  
This tarmac level is one of the few areas in the terminal where the interior archi-  
tecture does not have a symmetrical arrangement. The interior architecture of the  
passenger-accessible areas on the floors above are designed such that the north and  
south sides of the terminal more or less mirror each other along the building’s east-west  
axis. This includes the more permanent architecture in the space such as escalators,  
people movers, bridges, and security check points. As to be expected, the distribution  
of shops, restaurants, and advertisements is not symmetrical along this axis. As noted,  
the barrel vaults are also arranged symmetrically along the building’s east-west axis  
\(Figure 1.10\). This interior space’s symmetry contrasts with air terminals that have  
grown via accretion such as Schiphol. One of the factors that allowed Foster + Part-  
ners to design a terminal with a symmetrical footprint and a symmetrically ordered  
system of passenger routes was the nature of the site. By starting with a vacant site and  
erecting an entire airport from scratch, the planners could integrate the designs for the  
terminal, the high-speed rail station, and the roadways.32  
In June 2007, a second terminal opened at HKIA \(Kang-chung 2007; Skid-  
more, Owings & Merrill LLP n.d.\). Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP designed the Facilitating Passenger Circulation 41  
30,000-square-metre building that contains Terminal 2 and SkyPlaza, a shopping mall  
that is part of the terminal’s structure. The new terminal’s purpose was to reduce some  
of the congestion at Terminal 1. Terminal 2, which was expected to process up to fif-  
teen percent of the passengers departing from HKIA, increased the number of check-in  
counters at the airport but not the number of gates. Passengers checking in at Terminal  
2 pass through security in the building and then need to board an underground train  
that travels to the gates at Terminal 1.  
Terminal 2’s design is somewhat different than Terminal 1. Its ceiling does not  
suggest the same type of directional flow as the ceiling at Terminal 1 as it has a series  
of undulating ripples running in multiple directions, similar to the types of waves  
formed on a lake’s surface by a light breeze. As with Terminal 1, it can be accessed  
by the high-speed rail line from Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Tsing Yi. Passengers  
travelling to Terminal 2 exit the train at the same stop as Terminal 1, but instead of  
exiting by the doors facing west, they must exit the doors facing east. Terminal 2  
also has a series of bridges that run from the building’s entrance to the departures  
area \(Figure 5.8\). There are two bridges connecting from the train station that slope  
downwards to the check-in counters, and there are four bridges that slope upwards  
from the roadway to the check-in counters. They are arranged symmetrically in  
the space\: on the terminal’s south side there is a bridge leading to the train situated  
between two bridges leading to the road, and this is repeated on the terminal’s north  
side. Beside each set of bridges, on the side facing the exterior wall, there are esca-  
lators leading to the floor below. This floor, however, is not an arrivals level—all  
passengers arriving at HKIA exit the airport via Terminal 1. This space is reserved  
for coach transport to mainland China. There are ticket counters, waiting areas,  
and bays leading to the buses. On the west-facing side of this floor, there are three  
tunnels that run under the high-speed rail line and connect with the landside area  
of Terminal 1.  
On the floor above, passengers and visitors can visit SkyPlaza. This shopping mall is  
situated to the east of the check-in counters. It has an upper floor which offers views  
to the shops below and westwards to the check-in area and the bridges accessing the  
rail station and road. Passengers checking in at Terminal 2 need to transit through  
SkyPlaza’s lower level as the escalators leading down to the pre-boarding security area  
are behind the mall’s east side.  
The Air Terminal and Commerce\: A Spectacular  
Consumption Centre  
Schiphol’s, Heathrow’s, and HKIA’s terminal buildings include a variety of shops and  
restaurants in their landside and airside areas, and some of these commercial spaces  
resemble contemporary shopping mall interiors \(Figure 1.4, 1.7, 1.9; see Plate 9\).  
Air terminals began to incorporate more stores and services after the introduction of  
wide-bodied jets in the early 1970s \(Gottdiener 2001\). When airports were reconfig-  
ured as larger spaces to account for increased passenger loads, planners realized that  
longer walking distances to and from the aircraft could be used to expose travellers  
to more retail frontage and advertising. The push to maximize consumer spending in  
the terminal increased in the 1980s when airports began to be privatized \(Rau 1996\).  
Dubai International’s Terminal 3, Seoul Incheon’s Terminal 1, Charles De Gaulle’s  
Terminal 2F, HKIA Terminal 1, and Heathrow Terminal 5 are all examples of how air 42 Facilitating Passenger Circulation  
terminal design is now focused on creating large open spaces with an array of stores  
and restaurants on the airside.  
Some airports include shopping malls on their landside, and they are meant to serve  
passengers, visitors, and staff. HKIA’s SkyPlaza, for instance, is intended to attract  
passengers departing from both Terminal 1 and 2, local residents, and people travel-  
ling from SkyPier, a ferry pier connected to HKIA \(Ma 2006\). Within its first two  
years of operation, the mall did not attract the number of consumers that Hong  
Kong’s airport authority had hoped. In 2009, Ng Yuk-hang from the South China  
Morning Post reported that eleven out of the one hundred shops at SkyPlaza had  
closed and a number of the businesses were struggling. At Terminal 1, on the other  
hand, all of the available commercial spaces were occupied by shops and restaurants.  
Yuk-hang relayed that one of the shop’s employees thought that Terminal 2 attracted  
only few consumers because most travellers transiting through HKIA did not know  
that the terminal existed and that most passengers tend to shop once they have passed  
through pre-boarding security. During my visits to HKIA in August and Septem-  
ber 2014, I noticed that there were far fewer people in Terminal 2’s shops than those at  
Terminal 1.  
At Schiphol, planners have also added a shopping mall in Schiphol Plaza that is  
intended to serve non-flying consumers visiting the “AirportCity” \(Pearman 2004\).33  
Unlike HKIA’s SkyPlaza, most passengers and visitors pass through this mall since  
it is located between the airport’s primary entrance points and the terminal’s depar-  
tures and arrivals areas. Moreover, Schiphol Plaza’s shops ring around the space that  
includes the travellators leading up from the railway platforms below, the walkway  
that leads to the parking garage, and the building’s ground level entrance which  
serves those who arrive by bus transportation. Departing passengers dropped off  
by automobile, however, do not transit through Schiphol Plaza since they enter the  
building one level above, and they pass through a doorway that leads directly to the  
check-in area.  
On the airside, Schiphol has concentrated its shopping areas in the lounges at the  
base of each pier. Mark Pimlott \(2008\) contends that Schiphol is the ideal realiza-  
tion of a “continuous interior,” a building type consisting of an expansive interior  
space filled with an innumerable amount of consumer goods and advertisements.  
The continuous interior originated in the nineteenth century within the Parisian  
arcades and the 1851 Crystal Palace in London. In his unfinished The Arcades  
Project, Walter Benjamin \(2002\) considers the experience of the nineteenth century  
flâneur meandering through the former’s spectacular glass-covered spaces of con-  
sumption. During the twentieth century, the continuous interior has been expressed  
within other consumer paradises such as shopping malls, casinos, and theme parks.  
Even though these interiors give the “impression of freedom,” they are tightly regu-  
lated spaces engineered to stimulate spending through advertising and spectacle  
\(Pimlott 2008, 76\).  
Drawing from Jonathan Crary’s \(1999\) analyses of the management of attention  
and techniques of observation during the nineteenth century, Peter Adey \(2007\) con-  
siders how spectacular elements are deployed in the terminal to facilitate passenger  
movement.34 He discusses how airport designers try to capture people’s attention  
using information screens, windows, and balconies in order to encourage them to  
dwell in specific airport spaces. Observation points looking out to the landscape and  
air aprons or over the terminal’s interior space are often surrounded by restaurants Facilitating Passenger Circulation 43  
and shops. Information screens are placed close to departure gates to try to engage the  
passengers’ attention and to keep them from wandering off and missing their board-  
ing call. Adey notes that these screens are also strategically placed in spaces next to  
shops and services. Heathrow’s, Gatwick’s, and Stansted’s current operation employs  
this strategy; the flights’ gate numbers are not listed until shortly before the departure  
time, and this information is displayed on screens in corridors and waiting areas adja-  
cent to the terminal’s shopping spaces \(Figures 1.7 and 1.12\). In Chapter 3, I consider  
how eye-catching air terminal artworks are intended to capture the passenger’s atten-  
tion and draw them towards consumer spaces.  
Denis Cosgrove \(1999\) compares the airport’s scopic and kinetic regulation of  
passengers to strategies used in Georgian parks. He argues that the planner’s careful  
engineering of viewpoints in airport spaces resembles techniques used by eighteenth-  
century English landscape designers to direct people’s trajectories such that their sight  
lines were oriented to perceive various manufactured perspectival effects. Cosgrove’s  
essay, “Airport/Landscape,” was published in 1999. Approximately ten years later,  
a number of duty-free shops at international air terminals began to be redesigned  
as ‘walkthrough’ shops with serpentine routes that recall eighteenth-century English  
gardens. Yet, instead of being surprised by a folly after a bend in the footpath, pas-  
sengers encounter a display case with the latest fashions, aromatic perfumes, high-tech  
electronics, or aged spirits.

Walkthrough Duty-Free Stores  
Once passengers pass through security at Heathrow Terminal 5, Schiphol, and HKIA,  
they must walk through an area with restaurants and shops before they can reach their  
gate. In these airports, these areas are designed with passageways and corridors that  
are distinct from the shops and restaurants \(Figures 1.4 and 1.9\). They are demarcated  
with storefront signage and face the passageways. They also have a distinctively differ-  
ent design than the passageways which are part of the larger spaces in the concourse.  
This contrasts with airports such as Gatwick, Stansted, and Vancouver’s YVR where  
passengers exiting security are led along a corridor and funnelled into a walkthrough  
duty-free shop \(Figure 1.13; see Plate 10\).  
World Duty Free Group opened its walkthrough stores at Gatwick Terminal South and  
YVR in 2012 and at Stansted in 2014 \(Amor 2012; Morton 2012; Barras-Hill 2014\).35  
Unlike the corridors and passageways throughout the rest of the terminal, which are gen-  
erally rectilinear, the passageway running through these stores is a curvilinear path lined  
with chocolates, perfumes, alcohol, and jewellery. Furthermore, passengers encounter  
sales attendants offering samples of liquor and spritzes of scents. These worlddutyfree  
shops are an artificially lit low-ceilinged space that contrasts with the adjoining terminal  
spaces, which have high ceilings plus skylights. The passageway in each shop has a slightly  
different design than the rest of the store to demarcate it as the main route to be followed.  
The floor tiling designating the direction is black while the surrounding tiling is white.  
The ceiling designs at these worlddutyfree shops correspondingly accentuate the route  
through the store. At YVR, the ceiling above the passageway has white panels that form  
an undulating wave that runs from the shop’s entrance to the exit. At London Gatwick’s  
South Terminal, the ceiling above the black walkway is flat and painted white. Some of the  
panels above the shopping spaces are white and have a wave-like S-shape. At Stansted, the  
ceiling above the route consists of flat thin black strips. It contrasts with the curvilinear-  
shaped white ceiling that delineates the surrounding retail area.  
In each of these stores, the passenger is sent in a somewhat curvilinear path from  
one end of the shop to the other. At Gatwick Terminal South travellers are sent in a  
long arc where the entrance and exit points are relatively close with respect to the  
terminal’s built space. In each of these worlddutyfree shops passengers are directed  
along a longer route than if the pathway followed a single straight trajectory from the  
entrance to the exit.  
A similar strategy was employed at the Dufry duty-free store at EuroAirport Basel-  
Mulhouse-Freiburg when it opened in 2006.36 Unlike the worlddutyfree shops at  
Stansted, Gatwick, and YVR where passengers are sent through the store in a one-  
directional flow, travellers at EuroAirport’s duty-free store encounter a three-way inter-  
section at its centre; it is the node where three of the terminal’s post-security wings,  
each containing gates, meet. This planning strategy runs counter to NACO’s designs  
for wayfinding discussed earlier. This crucial decision point at EuroAirport does not  
include any views of the wings where passengers ultimately need to go. Instead, they  
are surrounded by advertisements and display stands with spirits, perfumes, candy,  
chocolates, watches, and sunglasses. Travellers must rely on signage to find the way  
to their gate. At Stansted’s, Gatwick’s, and YVR’s worlddutyfree shops, passengers  
do not encounter any decision points—they must simply follow the curvilinear path.  
Kuala Lumpur’s Terminal 2, completed in 2014, funnels passengers departing  
from the P- and Q-gates through the Eraman duty-free store \(Figure 1.14\). Unlike Figure 1.13 worlddutyfree shop, International Terminal, Vancouver International Airport,

the shops described previously, the passageway is not delineated with a floor design.  
It has a long sinuous light fixture suspended from the ceiling that guides passen-  
gers towards the gates. A series of round signs listing product types hang from this  
fixture. This sign’s shape includes a directional arrow that points to the product’s

location in the store. Below each sign’s text is a colourful image of figures with  
shopping bags, an aircraft, and Kuala Lumpur’s iconic Petronas Towers. Charles  
De Gaulle’s first walkthrough duty-free store, which opened in 2012, also includes  
signs that refer to the airport’s location \(Airport World 2012\).37 Its signage depicts  
landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, and its ceiling is meant to recall the Parisian  
galleries.  
Walkthrough shop designs are not popular with all airport architects and planners.  
At Schiphol, Benthem has maintained a design ethos that an air terminal should facili-  
tate passenger flows with as little disruption as possible \(de Wijn 2013\). This ideal of  
creating a “zero-friction society” also informed Kho’s interior design for Schiphol’s  
terminal, where the main focus was to create clearly defined passageways, and com-  
mercial operations, which were a secondary concern, were to be located on the periph-  
ery of the routes. In 2006, Schiphol’s management wanted to create routes that forced  
passengers to walk through shops, but Benthem disagreed with this planning initiative  
and decided to resign over the issue. Benthem argues that this strategy runs counter  
to what is acceptable in designing urban spaces\: “in Amsterdam, people walk to the  
Dam past the shops in the Kalverstraat, not through the shops” \(cited in de Wijn  
2013, 131\). These plans, however, were abandoned, and Benthem stayed on board as  
the airport’s architect.  
The installation of a walkthrough shop at Stansted is noteworthy. As discussed  
previously, Norman Foster’s design for this terminal was revolutionary when  
it opened in 1991 since it offered passengers views of the terminal in all direc-  
tions \(Figure 1.1\). This innovative terminal design inspired other open concourses  
that similarly offer passengers an outlook of the interior, which, as noted, aids  
in terms of wayfinding. At Stansted these views are now obscured in the world-  
dutyfree shop, which opened in 2014, as well as in the ‘retail street’ that travellers  
encounter upon exiting the walkthrough duty-free store. In this area, passengers  
are directed along a route with distinctive shopfronts on each side \(Figure 1.12\).  
Unlike the passageway running through the duty-free store, this route is not cov-  
ered by a separate ceiling and the terminal’s modular roof is visible. This retail  
street also directs passengers along a circuitous route—one that follows a long arc  
and ends in a waiting area lined with more shops. This space has limited seating  
and large screens displaying flight information. Passengers are intended to stay  
in this space, the retail street, or the duty-free shop since the gate number is not  
displayed until fifty minutes prior to the flight.38 The actual distance between the  
worlddutyfree store’s exit and the waiting area is much shorter than the length of  
the curvilinear retail street that travellers are required to follow. Clearly, Stansted’s  
planners have chosen to force passengers to walk longer distances with the aim to  
generate profits from retail sales.  
Conclusion  
Today’s international air terminals share the same functions but are defined by dif-  
ferent architectural and interior designs. Their development is affected by multiple  
variables such as existing infrastructure at the airport sites, the anticipated number of  
passengers to be processed, technological requirements, economic and political condi-  
tions, and aesthetic choices made by the architects and interior designers. However,  
their designs are also defined by a few key planning principles. For instance, architects  
and planners aim to design their air terminals such that they are easy to navigate. In 48 Facilitating Passenger Circulation  
some cases, architects try to clarify the dominant routes by incorporating views of the  
apron on the exterior or including material cues such as skylights that emphasize the  
required directional flow. These design strategies illustrate how architects aim to cre-  
ate designs that allow for a smooth circulation of passenger traffic. However, airport  
authorities also aim to interrupt these flows for commercial gain. Moreover, generat-  
ing profits from retail and food sales is a central concern, and planners aim to direct  
passengers to walk past or through retail areas. Walkthrough duty-free stores are  
particularly effective for this purpose since they force travellers to pass through a retail  
space on their way to the gate, and, in some cases, they are directed to move along a  
serpentine route in order to expose them to more consumer goods.  
The overview in this chapter illustrates the key tenets of air terminal design, and it  
underpins the analyses in this book. Moreover, in the subsequent chapters I address  
these types of designs in further detail, and I offer theoretical assessments of how they  
serve wayfinding purposes, how they might entice passengers to spend, and how they  
work in conjunction with artworks to affect the traveller’s experience in the terminal.  
Notes  
1\. Brian Edwards notes that the British Airport Authority  
earns over £700 million per year from retail-type activities at its UK airports, which  
exceeds by £100 million the amount of money that the company spends each year on  
building operations of various kinds. Viewed in this way retail revenues pay for termi-  
nals without the additional income from landing fees.  
\(2005, 148\)  
During 2000 and 2001, Sydney International generated thirty-one percent of its revenue  
from retail shops and services, an amount that exceeded the profits garnered from its avia-  
tion operations such as landing fees\(Lloyd 2003\).  
2\. The planning of contemporary air terminals also illustrates how architectural designs need  
to account for a number of factors including budget, political pressures, community con-  
cerns, and technological requirements. See Arindam Dutta’s \(2012\) discussion of how the  
planning process involves a number of professional practitioners in order to manage these  
various details.  
3\. Martha Rosler’s \(1998\) photographs of air terminals include a number of these types of cor-  
ridors. See also Anthony Vidler’s \(2000\) consideration of Rosler’s photographs as expres-  
sions of the passenger’s experience of waiting and anxieties associated with air travel.  
4\. Schiphol has six runways in total. In addition to the three runways adjacent to the terminal  
building, there is one to the east and two to the west which are accessed by taxiways that  
cross over a highway.  
5\. Beijing’s Terminal 3 was designed with three sections\: C, D, and E. All three were opera-  
tional when the airport opened in time for the 2008 Olympic Games. Section D was closed  
shortly after the Games. In April 2013, it was reopened to account for increased passenger  
traffic \(China Daily 2013\).  
6\. HKIA’s North Satellite Concourse began operating in 2010, and the Midfield Concourse  
was fully operational in 2016 \(Hong Kong Government News 2011, 2016\).  
7\. Mexico City’s new airport is expected to open in 2020. Foster + Partners and FR-EE, the  
airport’s chief architects, commissioned NACO to design the terminal’s footprint as well  
as the control tower, parking garage, and public transportation access points \(Netherlands  
Airport Consultants n.d.\).  
8\. For a brief overview of Stantec’s design for Ottawa’s airport, see Trevor Boddy \(2017\).  
Stantec acquired Architectura, a Vancouver-based architecture and interior design firm, in  
January 2003 \(Stantec n.d.\).  
9\. In 1916, two fields in the Haarlemmermeer polder near Amsterdam were purchased by  
the Dutch Minister of War, N. Bosboom, and developed into suitable landing strips for a  
military aerodrome. Facilitating Passenger Circulation 49  
10\. In 1936, 322,931 people visited Schiphol, and the airport garnered 68,595 Dutch Guilders  
from entry fees, which accounted for 27.9 percent of the airport’s annual income \(Dierikx  
and Bouwens 1997\). In the early days of air travel, most airports constructed stands or bal-  
conies with views of the airfield. These outdoor spaces are now rare due to security concerns.  
Schiphol, however, does allow visitors to access the terminal’s roof to view aircraft on the  
tarmac. See Adey \(2008\) for an analysis of the balcony at Liverpool Airport and its viewers’  
practices.  
11\. When the new terminal opened, the former terminal site began to be used for cargo \(Bosma  
2013\).  
12\. Most airports are designed with this configuration, but there are some exceptions. Charles De  
Gaulle’s Terminal 1 has its arrivals area two levels above the departures area, and the airport’s  
Terminals 2A, 2C, and 2D combine the arrivals and departures areas on the same level. How-  
ever, the airport’s Terminals 2E and 2F comprise of a departures level above the arrivals level.  
13\. Schiphol needs to have a pier that can service aircraft flying between Schengen and non-  
Schengen zones. For instance, an airplane arriving from Toronto and carrying on to Paris  
needs to have deplaning passengers pass through a non-Schengen zone and embarking pas-  
sengers pass through a Schengen zone. When the Schengen Area came into effect in 1995,  
a glass wall separated the two passenger streams in this pier. The following year the D-pier  
was expanded into two levels in order to separate the two zones.  
14\. Passengers flying to non-Schengen locations access the pier from the same post-security  
area that adjoins the D-, E-, F-, and G-piers. This area has two lounges and the Holland  
Boulevard. Passengers flying to Schengen locations pass through a security zone and a  
lounge that only leads to the M-gates.  
15\. See Benthem Crouwel Architects and Kirsten Schipper \(2010\) for an overview of the design  
of the bike shed and bus shelter.  
16\. On its maps and signage, Schiphol does not refer to these terminals as two separate struc-  
tures. Rather, these terminals are presented as one building, and it is ordered into three  
departure areas on the landside, four lounges on the airside, and four arrivals areas. Depar-  
tures 1 and 2, Lounges 1 and 2, and Arrivals 1 and 2 are in the 1967 terminal, and Depar-  
tures 3, Lounges 3 and 4, and Arrivals 3 and 4 are in Terminal-West.  
17\. The building replaced the railway station built in 1976 that stood on the opposite side of  
the access road.  
18\. Heathrow was not the city’s first civilian airport but the city’s third. It was preceded by  
Croydon and Gatwick. Croydon Airport, a military airfield situated nineteen kilometres  
southwest of the City of London, was repurposed as the city’s civilian airport and opened  
in 1920. The city’s second airport, Gatwick, is located forty-six kilometres south of the city  
centre and first opened in 1936. Its terminal, nicknamed the ‘beehive,’ was a unique circu-  
lar structure with six covered fingers leading to the aircraft. Operations ceased at Gatwick  
the following year because of flooding, and it was not reopened until 1958.  
19\. In the same year, the British government signed the Airports Act, which sought to privatize  
BAA \(Thomas-Emberson 2007\). In July the following year, BAA was listed on the London  
Stock Exchange and valued at 1255 million pounds sterling.  
20\. In November 2000, Norman Foster criticized this planning process at a meeting of the  
Associate Parliamentary Group on Architecture and Planning at the House of Commons,  
and he compared the quick completion of the new airport in Hong Kong with the long  
drawn out process for Terminal 5 \(Taylor 2000\). Foster + Partners had won the com-  
mission for HKIA three years after Richard Rogers Partnership won the commission for  
Terminal 5, and while HKIA was completed two years prior to this meeting, the plans for  
Terminal 5 were still waiting to be approved.  
21\. See Paul Finch \(1996\) and Edwards \(1997\) for descriptions and images of an earlier itera-  
tion of Terminal 5’s design.  
22\. Its footprint measures 400 metres by 176 metres. The curved ceiling’s high point is forty  
metres above ground and runs longitudinally across the rectangular building.  
23\. Stantec compiled a report, “BAA Wayfinding,” which overviews the firm’s designs for  
Heathrow Terminal 5. A copy is kept at the firm’s Vancouver office.  
24\. See Pamela Buxton’s \(2008\) description of how the resin-stone conglomerate tiles were  
made and how they were installed at Terminal 5. 50 Facilitating Passenger Circulation  
25\. HKIA was not the first airport to be built on reclaimed land in the sea. Kansai International  
Airport in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, designed by Renzo Piano and completed in 1994, was  
built on artificial island in Osaka Bay \(Buchanan 1994\). At Kansai and HKIA, designers  
were forced to build on reclaimed land because of the surrounding mountainous terrain  
and the existing flat spaces were already allocated for other developments \(Davey 1995\).  
HKIA was part of a larger Airport Core Program, costing twenty billion USD, which  
included a six-lane highway that would connect the airport to Hong Kong, two suspension  
bridges, and a high-speed train that stops in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Tsing Yi.  
26\. With the addition of the North Satellite Concourse and the Midfield Concourse, HKIA  
has been able to handle more than double the number of passengers per year. In 2017, the  
airport processed 72.9 million passengers \(Hong Kong International Airport n.d.\).  
27\. The lessons learned at Stansted helped expedite the design process for HKIA’s Terminal 1,  
which was completed in a mere six years.  
28\. In conjunction with the engineering firm Ove Arup and Partners, Foster + Partners designed  
a thirty-six-metre-wide module for HKIA Terminal 1 \(Robbins 1998\). Each module has a  
ceiling constructed out of lightweight steel with a row of triangular skylights that runs the  
length of the longitudinal curve. Below the skylights is a gantry, which deflects and diffuses  
the light across the curved ceiling. The gantry is also equipped with artificial lighting and  
has a walkway for maintenance crews. This module is repeated across the entirety of the  
building’s space, creating a series of thirty-six-metre-wide barrel vaults.  
29\. Although these vaults were made from standardized parts, their height varies throughout  
the terminal. The central vault is the highest in the building, and the vaults extending to the  
north and south gradually diminish in height. This is most pronounced in the angled wings  
at the terminal’s west end where the vaults rise as low as four metres, much lower than the  
central vault that hovers twenty-two metres above the check-in counters \(Robbins 1998\).  
The concrete columns that support the vaults vary in height, and each has a steel node  
bolted to the top that allowed for the vaults to be installed at varying angles. The vaults  
also vary in height along their east-west axis. Passengers can see this variation in height  
when looking down the length of the long central vault from the food court on the airport’s  
landside.  
30\. See Max Hirsh’s \(2016\) analysis of the Airport Express line and how low-income travellers  
access the airport using cheaper transportation alternatives.  
31\. The uppermost level on the exterior of HKIA’s Terminal 1 is a roadway where automobiles,  
taxis, and buses can drop off passengers. The ramps connecting from this level run down-  
wards towards the check-in areas on the terminal’s departures level. Below this roadway,  
there is a corridor that runs the length of Terminal 1’s eastern exterior. From this corridor,  
there are four ramps running upwards towards Terminal 1’s check-in area. On the other  
side of this corridor, there are three bridges on the exterior of the terminal that connect to  
the top level of the high-speed rail station.  
32\. As discussed previously, the design for Heathrow Terminal 5 had to accord with existing  
infrastructure on the site. Like HKIA’s Terminal 1, Heathrow Terminal 5 has a symmetrical  
footprint, its outer shell has a symmetrical shape, and its structural nodes are distributed  
evenly throughout the space. But, unlike HKIA’s Terminal 1 with its symmetrical arrange-  
ment of bridges leading to the roadway and train station, the coloured bridges and mobil-  
ity-modules at Heathrow Terminal 5 have an uneven distribution in the space. Between  
each of the coloured mobility-modules, there are two of Rogers’s structural nodes—with  
the exception of the space between the blue mobility-module and the purple module, where  
there is only one node. The blue module, which is the access point for the Heathrow  
Express and London Underground, is a markedly different design from the other coloured  
mobility-modules leading to the parking garage. The red, orange, and green modules are on  
its south side, and the purple module is on its north side. Because the unique blue module  
is not situated at the building’s centre, Heathrow Terminal 5 does not reach the same level  
of symmetrical logic as Hong Kong’s Terminal 1.  
33\. See also David Jarach’s \(2001\) discussion of how airports are trying to maximize their  
revenue via non-aviation business ventures such as commercial, tourist, and conference  
services. Facilitating Passenger Circulation 51  
34\. Crary \(1999\) bases his argument on Guy Debord’s \(1994\) consideration of the spectacle  
in terms of how mass media influences the social conditions that separate and individuate  
subjects in twentieth-century capitalist societies. He notes that although Debord’s soci-  
ety of the spectacle appears markedly different from Michel Foucault’s \(1977\) society of  
discipline and surveillance, the two theories share some similarities. They both suppose  
that a subtle operation of power orders people into docile subjects. The spectacle, Crary  
notes, is less concerned with what is being shown and more with how visual media such as  
television manages the spectator’s attention and positions them as an isolated, separated,  
and controlled individual. Adey \(2007\) extrapolates on Crary’s consideration of how the  
spectacle is used to organize bodies in the terminal’s space.  
35\. When the World Duty Free Group opened its walkthrough shop at Stansted in 2014, it was  
the firm’s largest store in the UK \(Barras-Hill 2014\).  
36\. 37. This store was renovated in 2016 \(Ireland 2016\).  
It is situated between Terminals 2A and 2C.  
38\. The terminal’s gates are in three separate satellite structures. One is accessible via a cor-  
ridor, and the others are linked via a train.

# Agency and a Functional Aesthetic  
The previous chapter illustrated how air terminals organize passenger flows. They  
are directed to move from the building’s entrance to the gate, and they are exposed to  
numerous shops and restaurants along the way. In many terminals architects include  
material cues such as skylights and ceiling vaults that are intended to aid with navi-  
gation. This chapter considers how air terminal architecture and interior design are  
active agents that produce airport spaces. My line of inquiry is in the same vein as  
Bruno Latour’s and Albena Yaneva’s contributions to actor-network theory, a mode of  
investigation that attributes agency to things \(Latour 2000, 2005, 2009; Latour and  
Yaneva 2008; Yaneva 2005, 2009, 2013, 2016, 2017\). I explain key tenets in their  
writing before addressing how the air terminal’s material aspects influence travellers’  
practices. My investigation concentrates on how architects consider airport architec-  
ture in terms of its materiality and its capacity to mediate passengers’ actions in the  
terminal.  
I also argue that air terminal architecture and design constitute a functional aesthetic  
with regard to how their materiality organizes passenger flows. This aesthetic type is  
based upon one’s understanding of how these things support passenger navigation,  
wayfinding, and orientation. I expand upon Glenn Parsons and Allen Carlson’s \(2008\)  
theory of functional aesthetics; they posit that an object can be judged on whether it  
looks appropriate for its function, and they offer a critical assessment of how one can  
determine this type of appeal.1 My analysis does not present an aesthetic judgement;  
rather, it aims to provide a theoretical framework to comprehend an aesthetic aspect  
of effective designs. Moreover, I discuss how wayfinding designs need to look fit for  
their purpose since they usually function on a visual register. This builds upon my  
analysis in the last chapter where I illustrated how architects incorporate cues into the  
terminal’s interior that visually emphasize the routes that passengers need to follow.  
In addition, I consider how air terminal architects assess whether their designs func-  
tion as intended. Sometimes a design’s intended purpose differs from its use in practice.  
I examine how this issue is addressed by theories of proper function and Madeleine  
Akrich’s \(1992\) notion of scripts. These assessments of function assume that a thing’s  
operation in real life does not necessarily mirror the intended function as envisioned  
by the artefact’s designer. Instead, it emerges out of the thing’s relation with its users  
and context. I consider how these conceptions of function pertain to the air terminal  
design process, and I discuss how some airport architects study the building’s func-  
tions in ‘real-time’ in order to improve their own air terminal designs.  
This chapter illustrates how air terminal architects try to create easy-to-navigate  
interiors and how they believe that the terminal’s materiality can effectively facilitate 56 Agency and a Functional Aesthetic  
passenger flows. I argue that these types of design solutions counter Marc Augé’s  
\(1995\) and Christopher Schaberg’s \(2012\) assertions that the operation of air ter-  
minals is predominately defined by texts. Architects designing today’s international  
air terminals try to create spaces where travellers do not need to rely on signage for  
navigation. Furthermore, signage with text has limitations for wayfinding. I discuss a  
tragic incident at Vancouver’s YVR where a Polish national who did not speak Eng-  
lish died after misunderstanding the process for passing through the airport’s border  
screening zone. Robert Dziekański became agitated after spending hours confused  
in this secured area and was accidentally killed by the Royal Canadian Mounted  
Police \(RCMP\). I examine why Dziekański became lost and what changes the airport’s  
authority made to its terminal design to prevent a similar incident from happening  
again. Some of these improvements to YVR’s screening zone illustrate the functional  
aesthetic of intuitive wayfinding designs.  
Air Terminal Design and Agency  
In Chapter 1, I illustrated how architectural firms such as Foster + Partners and Rich-  
ard Rogers Partnership deploy things like skylights and ceiling vaults to encourage  
passengers to walk in particular directions. This type of design thinking resembles  
Latour’s \(2000, 2005\) attribution of agency to things.2 For Latour, a human, a non-  
human thing, or a group of things and humans are equally important with regard to  
social interactions. His critical writing is part of a larger project, actor-network theory,  
which contrasts with traditional sociology as it accepts entities that operate with-  
out intention or consciousness as actors within networks of social relations.3 Latour  
critiques the general tenet in sociology, introduced by Émile Durkheim, that human  
actions and relations are driven by social forces and “that objects do nothing, at least  
nothing comparable or even connectable to human social action, and that if they can  
sometimes ‘express’ power relations, ‘symbolize’ social hierarchies, ‘reinforce’ social  
inequalities, ‘transport’ social power, ‘objectify’ inequality, and ‘reify’ gender rela-  
tions, they cannot be at the origin of social activity” \(2005, 72\). Non-human things,  
he argues, play an active role in social environments, which consist of numerous  
unpredictable interactions between humans and things\:  
The main reason why objects had no chance to play any role before was not only  
due to the definition of the social used by sociologists, but also to the very defini-  
tion of actors and agencies most often chosen. If action is limited a priori to what  
‘intentional’, ‘meaningful’ humans do, it is hard to see how a hammer, a basket, a  
door closer, a cat, a rug, a mug, a list, or a tag could act. They might exist in the  
domain of ‘material’ ‘causal’ relations, but not in the ‘reflexive’ ‘symbolic’ domain  
of social relations. By contrast, if we stick to our decision to start from the con-  
troversies about actors and agencies, then any thing that does modify a state of  
affairs by making a difference is an actor.  
\(Latour 2005, 71; italics in original\)  
Even though Latour attributes agency to things, he does not suggest that objects  
determine social relations. Rather, things have the capacity to operate as mediators in  
a network of human and non-human actors. In “The Berlin Key or How to Do Words  
with Things,” Latour \(2000\) describes how a unique key with teeth on both ends Agency and a Functional Aesthetic 57  
facilitates social relations among apartment dwellers in Berlin. This key and its cor-  
responding lock require the occupant to secure their door at night but leave the door  
unlocked during the day. The building’s concierge uses a separate key to unlatch the  
lock during the daytime, and the lock is designed such that the occupant’s key cannot  
turn in the keyhole when the lock is unbolted. Latour writes\:  
If I take my key with two bits that authorises me to re-enter my house and obliges  
me to bolt the door at night and forbids me to bolt it during the day, am I not deal-  
ing with social relations, with morality, with laws? Of course, but made of steel.  
\(2000, 19\)  
The key, in this example, does not symbolize the required behaviour; as a material  
entity it acts to limit the occupant’s actions. Latour notes, however, that the key does  
not determine the social interactions in the Berlin apartment building since the key’s  
intended function can be overridden. If the occupant uses a file to make their key thin-  
ner, then it operates in a similar fashion as the concierge’s master key; the occupant  
gains control of the lock and can latch and unlatch the door during the day.  
In “Give Me a Gun and I Will Make All Buildings Move,” Latour and Albena  
Yaneva \(2008\) explain how actor-network theory can be used in analyses of architec-  
ture. The essay’s title refers to Étienne-Jules Marey’s photographic gun which captures  
a series of exposures in quick succession. Marey used this device to analyze how a  
gull flies. Latour and Yaneva note there is no imaging technology that accurately  
represents the multifarious movements of people within buildings. They propose that  
actor-network theory offers a method “to picture a building as a moving modulator  
regulating different intensities of engagement, redirecting users’ attention, mixing and  
putting people together, concentrating flows of actors and distributing them so as to  
compose a productive force in time-space” \(2008, 87; italics in original\).4 They argue  
that investigations of architecture should take a comprehensive view of how design  
mediates the action of the user. Indeed, this type of analysis differs from examina-  
tions of how a building conveys symbolic connotations or displays harmonious ratios  
among its parts.  
Latour and Yaneva, however, are not the first theorists to suggest that analyses of  
architecture should account for how users engage with the building. The philosopher  
that is perhaps most well-known in terms of a conception of space with respect to  
practices is Michel de Certeau. Space for de Certeau \(1984\) is defined by the practices  
enacted within it. He writes, “In short, space is a practiced place. Thus the street geo-  
metrically defined by urban planning is transformed into a space by walkers” \(1984,  
117; italics in original\).5 Architectural theorist Neil Leach \(2002\) examines how con-  
ceptions of practices might contribute to a more nuanced study of architecture and  
cultural identity. He draws from de Certeau’s conception of practices, Judith Butler’s  
notion of performativity, and Christian Metz’s writing on film theory to theorize how  
both architectural form and practices enacted in the space define a building’s meaning.6  
Like Leach, cultural geographers such as Loretta Lees have framed their investiga-  
tions into architecture around the practices performed within buildings. For instance,  
in her investigation of Moshe Safdie’s Vancouver Public Library, Lees \(2001\) exam-  
ines and compares the civic debates regarding the building’s planning processes with  
ethnographic accounts of people using the library’s spaces during an eighteen-month  
period following its opening in 1995. Although she notes that social, economic, and 58 Agency and a Functional Aesthetic  
political conditions need to be addressed in an architectural analysis, she argues that  
buildings are not merely defined by the productive forces or the symbolic references  
connoted by a structure’s design but also by spatial practices enacted within it. Her  
intention was to offer an analysis that shifted away from the predominant readings  
of the building, which discussed the library’s façade and whether it was appropriate  
for Vancouver.7 In Lees’s article, she recounts some of the practices she witnessed\: for  
example, people perusing books and reading, the elderly using it as a meeting place,  
homeless people using the bathrooms to wash up, and children playing on escalators.8  
Yaneva \(2013, 2017\) also uses an ethnographic method in her studies of architec-  
ture in terms of actor-network theory. However, she concentrates on how a building’s  
materiality mediates the users’ actions. In her \(2017\) investigation of FCBStudios’  
Benzie building at the Manchester School of Arts, she observes her and others’ engage-  
ment with the building’s physical components. The atrium’s open plan, for instance,  
facilitates interactions between the school’s faculty and students. Her account also  
closely examines how the building’s staircases, elevators, doors, and locks mediate the  
user’s movement through the interior. She argues that this type of analysis does not  
merely lend “an understanding of architectural objects as static surfaces where mean-  
ing can be projected” \(2013, 122\). Instead, it offers “a more dynamic understanding  
of the processes that make buildings possible not by asking what a building means,  
but what it does and how it works” \(2013, 122; italics in original\).  
My analysis in this chapter considers air terminal architecture and design in a simi-  
lar manner; it examines how these material things mediate the passengers’ practices  
within the airport. I do not assess the terminal’s architecture as an expression of the  
social relations within the airport and the air transportation industry. Instead, I con-  
sider how it actively produces airport spaces. I investigate how the physical materiality  
of airport architecture enables passenger movement within the terminal, and I concen-  
trate on how architects deploy material cues to aid with passenger navigation. Moreo-  
ver, I examine how architects design air terminal interiors such that their materiality  
actively mediates passenger behaviour. I also discuss how some architects observe  
travellers’ practices in order to improve their terminal designs.  
Without a doubt, airport architects accept that the building’s material design has the  
capacity to facilitate passenger flows. Their designs include things like corridor walls  
and escalators that physically require a traveller to move in a particular direction.  
However, they also include materials that operate on a sensory register, visual and  
even auditory, to draw passengers to move through the terminal. At Schiphol Plaza  
\(Figure 1.6; see Plate 6\), Jan Benthem introduced rows of columns and beams to visu-  
ally emphasize predominant pathways and has designed a grid for the flooring that  
aligns with the major routes that travellers are intended to follow in the space \(Cress-  
well 2006\). He designed Schiphol Plaza with dark-tinted windows as a strategy to  
entice people to walk to the more brightly lit terminals since passengers were expected  
to be drawn towards light \(Kloos and de Maar 1999\). At Beijing’s Terminal 3, Foster +  
Partners designed the ceiling with thin slats that correspond with the main directional  
flow \(Lin-Liu 2008\). They hang below the ceiling and are spaced apart such that they  
do not obscure the light shining through the skylights. Foster + Partners’ Mouzhan  
Majidi notes that\: “the roof becomes a tool to guide the passengers to the gate, wel-  
coming, directing, and orientating them” \(cited in Lin-Liu 2008, 113, 119\). Similarly,  
Heathrow Terminal 5’s ceiling has long and narrow skylights that emphasize the route  
one needs to follow to pass through security and access the gates \(Figure I.2\). Safdie’s Agency and a Functional Aesthetic 59  
Terminal 1 at Toronto Pearson also includes skylights \(Figure 2.1\) that are intended to  
indicate the main passenger routes \(Kuitenbrouwer 2006; Mississauga News 2006\).  
When asked about his design for a pier that opened in 2006, Safdie noted\: “Airports  
are intimidating places and most people associate airports with stress. . . . We’ve tried  
to design this so that it is self-oriented. . . . We’ve used daylight as a major placefinding  
mechanism” \(Mississauga News 2006, 1\). At Paris Charles de Gaulle’s Terminal 2F,  
Paul Andreu placed translucent ceilings over its two piers in order to draw the travel-  
ler’s eyes upwards and to stimulate a sense of flight \(Jodidio and Andreu 2004\). The  
piers’ ceiling design also serves a purpose for wayfinding. When looking towards the  
gates, the ceiling’s framework curves inwards and connects to a long ridgepole, which  
entices one to move forwards \(Figure 2.2\). In its renovation of Los Angeles’s Terminal 6  
building, Westfield incorporated ribbons of LED lights in the ceiling \(Figure I.1\) to  
direct passengers along the main route \(Herman 2016; Westfield Airports 2016\). In  
some areas of the terminal, these winding ribbons are replicated in the terrazzo floor-  
ing as darker bands.  
These material design strategies are used to help passengers navigate themselves  
through the terminal. Unlike airport signage, which requires the traveller’s full atten-  
tion to what is written and signified through pictograms, these architectural features  
are more or less Heideggerian ready-to-hand entities that are generally taken for

granted and are active agents operating in the background of one’s attention.9 These  
material designs are not only helpful for wayfinding but are also conducive to spend-  
ing. An easy-to-navigate interior design lends to a place where passengers are less  
stressed and more willing to shop. In addition, these designs require less directional Agency and a Functional Aesthetic 61  
signage, and this allows the traveller’s attention to drift towards the numerous shop-  
fronts and restaurants within the terminal.  
The Architectural Organization of Movement as a  
Functional Aesthetic  
The aforementioned examples illustrate how air terminal architects believe that  
their designs play an active role in organizing passenger movement. Their aim as  
designers is to create a material environment that is effective for wayfinding. I argue  
that these design strategies constitute a functional aesthetic. This type of appeal  
is defined by what these material designs do. For instance, I argue that Heathrow  
Terminal 5’s skylights are aesthetically appealing since they encourage travellers to  
move along the required directional flow \(Figure I.2\). My aim is to illustrate that  
an architectural design’s capacity to actively mediate passenger flows constitutes an  
aesthetic quality. My analysis, however, is not an estimation of these designs’ aes-  
thetic value; rather, it is an investigation of an aesthetic type determined by the air  
terminal’s function as a transit hub that organizes passenger movement. I am also  
establishing a theoretical framework for understanding how an air terminal design  
can be effective.  
I build upon Parsons and Carlson’s \(2008\) critical assessment of how an artefact’s  
aesthetics can be determined by the knowledge of its utility.10 According to their theory  
the cheetah’s stunning spotted coat, which helps camouflage the animal, is not con-  
sidered appealing simply because of its superficial appearance. But, the knowledge  
that the cheetah’s small head allows for an aerodynamic advantage and how its head  
“looks fit” in terms of this known function determines an aspect of this animal’s func-  
tional aesthetics. Their notion contrasts with Stephen Davies’s \(2007\) conception of  
functional aesthetics, which considers how a thing’s aesthetic properties contribute to  
and enhance the thing’s function. Even though Parsons and Carlson refer to architec-  
ture, they offer only a limited consideration of how their theory applies to buildings.  
Nevertheless, they do explain that their investigation follows a lineage of examina-  
tions into aesthetics and function with respect to architecture such as Louis Sullivan’s  
\(1896\) “The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered.” While Parsons and Carl-  
son’s analysis of architecture is not applicable to my study of air terminal design, their  
attention to the functional aesthetic of larger arrangements like ecosystems is helpful  
in terms of assessing the aesthetics of the air terminal as a mobility-system. They argue  
that their conception of functional aesthetics can apply to a complex network of enti-  
ties such as an estuary, where each entity contributes to its overall function as a water  
filter. Similarly, I consider the aesthetics of material designs such as skylights with  
regard to their contribution to wayfinding and the organization of passenger flows  
within the air terminal.  
Unlike Parsons and Carlson, I concentrate on architecture as a system of parts that  
support a purpose. I contend that I offer a more thorough investigation of how their  
notion of functional aesthetics can be applied to architecture. Furthermore, I argue  
that my analysis of wayfinding design illustrates an example of why ‘looking fit for its  
purpose’ matters in relation to a design’s function. Moreover, these types of designs  
often operate on a visual register, and they need to look fit for their purpose in order  
to work effectively. Before I address wayfinding designs, I will illustrate how Parsons  
and Carlson’s notion of functional aesthetics can apply to architecture.  
The structural nodes supporting Heathrow Terminal 5’s ceiling are a striking example  
of how architecture can be considered aesthetically with respect to its utility \(Figure 2.3\). 62 Agency and a Functional Aesthetic  
For Parsons and Carlson, an object’s functional aesthetic is based on whether it  
looks fit in terms of one’s knowledge of its function. In this case, I know that the  
structural node’s function is to support the terminal’s high ceiling, and I can argue  
that it looks fit for this purpose. What I would like to emphasize here is that for  
Figure 2.3 Richard Rogers Partnership, Terminal 5, London Heathrow Airport, United King-  
dom, 2008.  
Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2013\). Agency and a Functional Aesthetic 63  
Parsons and Carlson the aesthetic of utility is determined by function itself. So,  
if I use their aesthetic theory to consider this structural node, I cannot make the  
following statement\: this node considered with regard to its form alone is an aes-  
thetically appealing object, and it also happens to support the ceiling. Its aesthetic  
depends on my knowledge of its function, which is to support the ceiling. In this  
case, I can state that the structural node, which consists of a hinge that connects  
three pairs of beams attached to the floor and ceiling, looks fit in terms of its role in  
supporting the ceiling.  
Each one of these structural nodes is painted entirely in white with the exception  
of two rings painted grey that are fixed to both sides of the pin running horizontally  
through the node. This slight colour differentiation draws one’s attention to how this  
pin is a pivot point for a hinge connecting three pairs of beams and how it is a key  
element in supporting the roof. Yet, whether these rings are painted grey or white is  
inconsequential in terms of my assessment of their functional aesthetic. This applica-  
tion of paint may draw my attention to the pin and the structural node’s function, but  
it does not contribute to the node’s function and therefore does not impact my assess-  
ment of whether this node looks fit with regard to its function.  
Although my analysis of the structural node at Heathrow Terminal 5 illustrates the  
logic of Parsons and Carlson’s notion of functional aesthetics, they do not include  
a similar type of analysis in their explanation of how their theory applies to archi-  
tecture. Instead, their attention to function focuses on how a building is used by its  
inhabitants. They rightfully note that in many cases a building’s appearance is not nec-  
essarily an indication of how it is used. They argue that earlier analyses that focused  
on “structural honesty” offer only a confused account of how a building’s appearance  
might be considered aesthetically in terms of its function. Parsons and Carlson also  
contend that buildings that point to their function via their overall expression—such  
as Eero Saarinen’s TWA terminal—are not examples of a functional aesthetic since this  
aspect of their form has little to do with their actual function.11  
My analysis of the structural node at Heathrow Terminal 5 illustrates how a con-  
ception of functional aesthetics can be applied to a broader consideration of architec-  
tural function—namely, how individual structural components support the building.  
This attention to the functional aesthetic of the air terminal’s individual components  
with respect to the building’s function resembles Bruno Taut’s \(1929\) explanation of  
efficient design and aesthetics. Taut contends that every architectural detail included  
in a design must serve the overall plan and that their aesthetic derives from their  
ability to fulfil this function. This aesthetic and design principle, which mirrors the  
operation of a collective and cooperative society, is championed by Taut as a means to  
improve social behaviour.12 Although Taut’s assertion that this aspect of architectural  
design directly affects social relations is tenuous, his attention to the overall integra-  
tion of a building’s components offers a concrete example of functional aesthetics and  
architecture.  
My analysis of air terminal wayfinding design also considers the function of a build-  
ing’s individual components—specifically, how they support the building’s primary  
use, which is to move, process, and regulate passengers. Corridors and escalators are  
obvious examples of interior design that function to direct them through the space.  
As I have described previously, architects often deploy more subtle strategies such as  
visual cues to guide passengers. These are examples of design that need to look fit  
for their purpose since they function on a visual level. The thin ceiling slats at Bei-  
jing Terminal 3 look fit for their wayfinding function since they run parallel to the  
direction that travellers need to follow to get to their gate \(Lin-Liu 2008\). Similarly, 64 Agency and a Functional Aesthetic  
the skylights at Heathrow Terminal 5 visually emphasize the direction towards pre-  
boarding security and the gates \(Figure I.2\).  
The design of HKIA Terminal 1, as noted in the previous chapter, has a near perfect  
symmetrical arrangement of the interior architecture that facilitates the movements of  
passengers, such as the escalators, the security checkpoints, and the bridges connecting  
from the train and the road to the check-in areas. Although this symmetrical design  
can be considered aesthetically comparable to the Classical design ethos as seen in  
Greek temples, it is not a strong example of the type of aesthetic that I have described  
earlier. I consider the architecture’s aesthetic in relation to how it helps manage pas-  
sengers’ movements. Although an awareness of this symmetrical arrangement might  
help with one’s navigation of the terminal space, it is a quality that likely only few of  
the passengers notice. For one to be aware of this symmetrical design, one needs to  
look at the architectural drawings or walk through the space with a careful attention  
as to how these things are deployed in the building. One aspect of HKIA Terminal 1’s  
design that is a strong example of the type of functional aesthetic that I am proposing  
is the linear ceiling vaults that are aligned with the overall direction which passengers  
need to follow to get from the entrance to their gate \(Figure 1.11\). Like the ceiling  
slats at Beijing Terminal 3 and the skylights at Heathrow Terminal 5, the long linear  
vaults draw the traveller’s eye in the direction they need to move. As these vaults are  
all aligned along the same east-west axis, they also help with giving a sense as to which  
direction one is facing in the space. Indeed, the vaults look fit for their purpose as a  
material design that encourages passengers to follow the terminal’s directional flow.  
Heathrow Terminal 5’s colour scheme is a corresponding example of a functional  
aesthetic that operates visually to serve a wayfinding purpose \(see Plate 8\). The red,  
orange, green, purple, and blue ‘mobility-modules’ at Heathrow Terminal 5 help ori-  
ent travellers and visitors within the building’s vast landside space \(Royal Academy  
of Arts 2013\). Although Richard Rogers Partnership designed Terminal 5 with some  
colour, it is a rather limited application compared to Terminal 4 at Madrid-Barajas  
where the firm used a generous amount of colour to aid with passenger navigation \(see  
Plate 11\). The columns and curved beams supporting the wave-like roof are painted in  
a rainbow of colours that gradually shift in hue as one moves along the length of the  
concourse. On the airside facing the apron, there is an unobstructed view of the con-  
course, and one can see the gradation in colour. The terminal’s gates are demarcated  
by H, J, and K, and they correspond with the supports’ hues.13 The signage for the  
H-gates is coloured red, the J-gates yellow, and the K-gates blue. The gate numbers are  
not duplicated across the three different colours. The gates are distributed as follows\:  
H1 to H37, J40 to J59, and K62 to K98.  
The structural supports change from yellow to green to blue as one walks north-  
ward from the J-gates to the K-gates. The struts and beams change from yellow to  
orange to red as one walks southward from the J-gates to the H-gates. The signs for  
the gates do not gradually change colour. For instance, the same yellow hue is used  
for gates J40 through J59. The experience of seeing the terminal’s supports slowly  
change colour while walking through the concourse surely consists of an aesthetic  
and kinaesthetic experience. However, my assessment of this wayfinding strategy as  
a functional aesthetic focuses on a cognitive understanding of how this architectural  
design operates visually to facilitate passenger circulation.  
The structural supports in Madrid-Barajas Terminal 4’s landside area are painted  
in a uniform yellow hue \(see Plate 7\). It encompasses less space lengthwise than the Agency and a Functional Aesthetic 65  
airside concourse. This landside area is adjacent to the J-gates, which are also indi-  
cated by the colour yellow. In this respect, the use of colour for orientation differs  
from Heathrow Terminal 5, which has differently coloured columns and beams on  
the landside. As noted in the previous chapter, the two meeting points at Heathrow  
Terminal 5 are identified by the colours of the adjacent escalator and elevator support  
structures \(see Plate 8\). Madrid-Barajas Terminal 4 only has one meeting point, and  
its signage employs the same yellow colour as the struts and beams supporting the  
ceiling.  
Defining a Design’s Actual Function  
The aforementioned examples illustrate how architects assume that the material aspects  
of their design will facilitate passenger traffic. But, how do we know whether an archi-  
tectural design for wayfinding performs as intended? This is indeed a difficult question  
to answer. Some architects like Kho Liang Ie observe how travellers engage with an air  
terminal’s interior, and they use this information to improve their own designs. Plan-  
ners also rely on passenger feedback to assess whether their changes to improve way-  
finding are actually effective. Every two months, Schiphol conducts surveys consisting  
of questions that address a number of aspects regarding the respondent’s experience  
of the airport \(Hans Bouchier, pers. comm., April 11, 2018\). Schiphol’s planners reuse  
the same questionnaire as this allows them to ascertain whether a recent change to the  
design was effective.  
These types of assessments of a design’s actual operation pertain to my analysis  
of air terminal aesthetics in relation to its function. As noted, I draw upon Parsons  
and Carlson’s \(2008\) conception of functional aesthetics which is predicated on an  
understanding of the object in question’s actual function. They posit that a thing’s  
functional aesthetic derives from its proper function, which is determined by the thing  
itself and not by a functional role that its designer intended it to have.14 Parsons and  
Carlson argue that most things have a multitude of functions; some are proper func-  
tions, which “belong” to the things themselves, and others are accidental functions  
that occur by chance. The “selected effects” theory of function distinguishes a thing’s  
proper function from its accidental functions. This theory, which follows from biolo-  
gists’ investigations into the reproduction of selected traits in organisms, supposes  
that a thing’s proper function is one that has allowed it to survive in nature or within  
the marketplace. For instance, a lung’s proper function is to circulate air, not to make  
breathing sounds. A wire coat hanger’s proper function—the main reason why it has  
survived in the marketplace—is its ability to hang clothes, not its other accidental  
functions such as opening locked car doors.  
What about the inorganic things in nature that function to sustain ecosystems?  
Unlike living beings, these things do not reproduce and do not have selected traits that  
have contributed to their survival. Inorganic things that sustain an ecosystem—such as  
a rock that happens to flood a plain—have causal role functions \(Parsons and Carlson  
2008\). This type of function happens to support a larger system by accident and only  
exists as a function because of this chance contribution. Even though a thing’s causal  
role function is a weaker notion of function than a thing’s ‘selected’ proper functions,  
Parsons and Carlson contend that their theory still applies to these types of inorganic  
things. In their assessment of manufactured artefacts, buildings, and artworks, they 66 Agency and a Functional Aesthetic  
argue that their functional aesthetic is determined by proper functions rather than  
causal role functions.  
With respect to air terminals, most architectural features that facilitate and organ-  
ize passenger movement have a proper function with respect to the airport’s role as a  
transit hub. In many cases, travellers have no choice in selecting these designs, and it  
is therefore easy to determine these things’ proper functions. For instance, corridors,  
aerobridges, hallways, and stairwells funnel passengers in particular directions; their  
proper function is to organize travellers into directional flows. However, sometimes  
passengers are offered a choice with regard to how they move through these spaces.  
They can elect to use escalators and people movers to expedite their movement \(see  
Plates 5 and 8\).  
Things such as stairwells and escalators tend to function as intended. However,  
not all material designs that planners deploy to direct passenger movement operate  
as envisioned. Airport artworks, which I examine in detail in the following chap-  
ters, are often installed as meeting points and landmarks in the terminal to aid with  
passenger wayfinding. But not all artworks are effective in serving this purpose.  
Shinkichi Tajiri’s Knot \(Figure 2.4\), a large white knot wrapped around a pillar  
in Schiphol’s arrivals level, was designated as a meeting point shortly after it was  
installed in 1974 \(van Hooff 1998\). Even though Knot was the airport’s official  
meeting point, many travellers and visitors chose Kees Franse’s Apple as a place to  
meet instead \(see Plate 12\). It is a sculpture made out of wood slices in the form of  
its title and was installed in 1975. Although it was not intended to function as a  
meeting point, it gradually did acquire this role. Despite the fact that Apple gained  
this role by accident, it is not a causal role function like that of a rock that happens  
to irrigate a flood plain. Passengers chose to use Apple as their designated meeting  
point, and therefore it has gained this as a new proper function. This type of proper  
function is akin to that of the pipe cleaner, which is a thing that has acquired a new  
and more popular proper function that is not the same as the original intended  
function \(Parsons and Carlson 2008\). Pipe cleaners, which are designed to clean  
pipes and are still used to clean pipes, are more often sold as a material to be  
used in children’s craftworks. Like pipe cleaners, Apple’s original intended function  
was not neutralized by its newly acquired proper function. When Apple was first  
installed, it, like other artworks in the terminal, was intended to make people smile,  
and it undoubtedly retained this capacity to elicit this feeling after it started to be  
used as a meeting point \(Berkers and Burgers 2013\). Not only did this artwork’s  
proper function change over time, but its exterior appearance also changed due  
to its effectiveness in capturing the viewers’ attention and actively engaging with  
them. The sculpture has been slowly transformed by countless people marking their  
names on the wooden apple using coloured chalk and inks.  
It is worth noting that this notion of proper function parallels a conception of ontol-  
ogy similar to Latour’s \(2000, 2005, 2009\) philosophical considerations of material  
things as active agents. Moreover, a manufactured artefact’s or building’s proper func-  
tion emerges out of a relation between it and a network of human actors. Like Parsons  
and Carlson, Latour posits that a manufactured object or a building does not neces-  
sarily operate as its designer intended. In his explanations of actor-network theory,  
he draws upon Akrich’s \(1992\) notion of scripts to theorize how a thing’s intended  
function does not always equate with its actual use. Akrich suggests that designed  
artefacts are imbued with a script that defines how the product is expected to perform  
in the real world. Designers establish this script based upon how they expect the user  
to engage with the artefact\: Agency and a Functional Aesthetic 67  
Figure 2.4 Shinkichi Tajiri, Knot, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Netherlands, 1974.

For some time sociologists of technology have argued that when technologists define  
the characteristics of their objects, they necessarily make hypotheses about the entities  
that make up the world into which the object is to be inserted. Designers thus define  
actors with specific tastes, competences, motives, aspirations, political prejudices, and 68 Agency and a Functional Aesthetic  
the rest, and they assume that morality, technology, science, and economy will evolve  
in particular ways. A large part of the work of innovators is that of ‘inscribing’ this  
vision of \(or prediction about\) the world in the technical content of the new object.  
I will call the end product of this work a ‘script’ or a ‘scenario.’  
\(Akrich 1992, 207–8; italics in original\)  
This script, however, is open to interpretation with regard to the artefact’s users\: “it  
may be that no actors will come forward to play the roles envisaged by the designer.  
Or users may define quite different roles of their own” \(Akrich 1992, 208\). Returning  
to Latour’s \(2000\) analysis of the Berlin key, the object is inscribed with a script to  
prescribe the apartment dwellers’ social relations based on how it operates the lock;  
however, one can override this script by altering the key’s shape.  
Akrich’s \(1992\) conception of an artefact’s script resembles Parsons and Carlson’s  
\(2008\) notion of proper functions since both theories accept that the material artefact  
itself actively mediates its use among its users. However, these theorists differ in terms  
of how they evaluate an artefact’s actual use. Akrich’s conception of the script concen-  
trates on the designer’s intended aim for the artefact’s use, and she offers a framework  
to assess the degree to which the script affects the artefact’s actual use in a number of  
different social contexts. Parsons and Carlson’s conception of proper function, on the  
other hand, seeks to determine one specific actual use—the function that has led to the  
artefact’s repeated selection by the majority of its users.  
Although Parsons and Carlson look to an object’s proper function to assess its func-  
tional aesthetics, I argue that an assessment of air terminal artworks, architecture, and  
design should not discount the airport authorities’, artists’, architects’, and design-  
ers’ intentions—or scripts—for these aesthetic things. Although I do not contend that  
an artefact’s intended function determines its actual function, a consideration of the  
thing’s script may provide some indication of the purpose the item under consideration  
serves. In some cases, the air terminal architects’ and planners’ script for a particular  
building element may draw from existing information about a related element’s actual  
function in other air terminals. At Schiphol, for instance, Marius Duintjer mimicked  
Chicago O’Hare’s overall plan in his design for the new terminal, which opened in  
1967 \(Bosma 2013\). This layout, where the upper departures level is accessed by an  
elevated road and the arrivals area is one storey below, effectively separates the incom-  
ing and outgoing passenger flows. This design has proven to be popular among airport  
architects—most contemporary air terminals organize their departures and arrivals  
areas in a similar fashion. GMR Group, who won the commission to design Delhi  
Indira Gandhi International Airport’s Terminal 3 in 2006, visited a number of the  
world’s busiest airports while they were developing the building \(Vaish 2010; Delhi  
Indira Gandhi International Airport n.d.\). Shortly before Terminal 3 opened in 2010,  
GMR Group’s CEO of Airport Development, Prabhakara Rao, noted that “we had the  
chance of learning from others’ strengths and weaknesses” \(cited in Vaish 2010\). The  
firm visited Heathrow, Frankfurt, Madrid-Barajas, Dubai, Bangkok Suvarnabhumi,  
Singapore Changi, Kuala Lumpur, Tokyo Narita, Hong Kong, and Seoul Incheon dur-  
ing the design process. The latter two were particularly helpful with regard to how  
their designs allowed for a smooth and efficient processing of passenger flows.  
Beth Preston \(2000\) accounts for how an existing product’s actual use influences  
similar subsequent designs in her analysis of proper function. She notes that an artefact  
acquires its proper function through its “lineage” \(2000, 31\).15 Moreover, an artefact’s Agency and a Functional Aesthetic 69  
proper function, a property that ensured its survival, has been replicated in anteced-  
ent artefacts categorically similar to the artefact in question. Kho’s design process for  
Schiphol illustrates an example of lineage with regard to air terminal design. When  
the firm was commissioned to design the terminal’s interior in 1962, they looked to  
other major international airports in Europe and North America for design solutions  
\(Bosma 2013; Berkers and Burgers 2013\). Kho travelled to the airports to see how  
their interior architecture functioned. He watched how passengers interacted with  
the material elements in the terminal, and he used this information to influence his  
design for Schiphol. In some cases, Kho replicated interior design at other airports,  
and in other cases he developed innovative solutions based on what he observed at  
these terminals. At Orly Airport in Paris, he noticed that many travellers were almost  
slipping and falling on the marble flooring as they were rushing through the terminal,  
so he chose a type of tiling that offered more texture and grip. Kho also tried to maxi-  
mize the passengers’ traction by incorporating studded rubber flooring in some of the  
high traffic areas. This design strategy was influential as many other airport planners  
looked to Schiphol’s interior design and began to use this type of flooring as well.  
While this chapter has focused on strategies to direct passenger circulation, these types  
of measures are another type of functional aesthetic as they improve the efficiency and  
safety of passengers’ movements.  
Kho’s design process is also notable with regard to actor-network theory. It resem-  
bles the type of research methodology that Latour and Yaneva \(2008\) propose for  
studying architecture. As noted, Yaneva \(2013, 2017\) conducts ethnographic analyses  
of how people engage with a building’s material aspects. Kho also closely examined  
how architecture mediates passengers’ actions, and he relied on this research to create  
an effective design for Schiphol’s interior.  
Prescribing Movement and Anticipating Consumption in the  
Walkthrough Duty-Free Store  
The aforementioned examples include things like skylights and floor patterns which  
try to coax passengers to move in particular directions. Usually, architects design these  
things in order to provide travellers with clear cues as to how to move efficiently  
towards areas such as pre-boarding security or their gates. The last chapter exam-  
ined walkthrough duty-free store designs that send passengers along serpentine routes  
such that they are exposed to a greater number of goods for sale. According to the  
aviation consulting firm InterVISTAS, this strategy appears to work. In a 2014 report  
on air terminal revenue, Kenneth Currie and Luciano Nunes state\: “Duty-free Shops  
configured in a serpentine walk-through shop achieve sales as much as 60% higher  
than other configurations because 100% of customers are exposed” \(2014, 4\). With  
this in mind, we can establish that increasing passenger spending is an actual func-  
tion for these routes running through duty-free shops in the terminal and that these  
designs constitute a functional aesthetic with respect to passenger circulation and  
consumption.  
The functional aesthetic outlined in this chapter is based on a cognitive understand-  
ing of the design’s function. In this case, it is determined by knowing that this curvi-  
linear route leads to higher sales. This aesthetic, however, is much different from the  
experiential aesthetic of moving through these walkthrough designs. When entering  
these stores for the first time, there is an element of surprise when rounding a corner 70 Agency and a Functional Aesthetic  
and seeing an array of consumer goods. While this may be pleasurable for passengers  
with ample time before their departure, it undoubtedly causes anxiety for those who  
need to rush to their gate.16  
Indeed, this curvilinear route can elicit a sense of terror in some passengers. This  
response mirrors the type of sensation that late-eighteenth-century tourists sought  
when they walked along serpentine paths in picturesque English gardens such as  
Thomas Johnes’s grounds at Hafod; these gardens were meant to trigger a sense of  
terror, albeit one that was ultimately not an actual negative feeling \(Andrews 1989\).  
Moreover, tourists visited these manufactured spaces for a sublime experience.17 These  
types of picturesque gardens contrast with planned landscapes such as Versailles which  
include vistas across rectilinear pathways and allow for a rational understanding of  
the space. This is notable with regard to Norman Foster’s innovative design for Lon-  
don’s Stansted; its ceiling consists of a Cartesian grid of modules that allows for views  
in all directions, and it serves a wayfinding purpose since passengers can use the ceil-  
ing to orient themselves within the interior \(Figure 1.1\). But, the walkthrough duty-  
free shop and serpentine shopping street, which were installed thirteen years after the  
terminal opened in 1991, block these vistas and obfuscate one’s understanding of the  
terminal’s layout \(Figure 1.12; see Plate 10\).  
Texts and Their Limitations for Wayfinding  
The material designs discussed in this chapter actively enable passenger movement,  
and they do so by operating on a non-textual level. This runs counter to Augé’s \(1995\)  
and Schaberg’s \(2012\) analyses of air terminals as spaces that are predominately  
defined by texts. For Augé, the airport is a quintessential “non-place,” and he argues  
that\: “The link between individuals and their surroundings in the space of non-place  
is established through the mediation of words, or even texts” \(1995, 94\).18 In The Tex-  
tual Life of Airports, Schaberg \(2012\) follows Augé’s line of inquiry and offers a more  
detailed analysis of the airport’s operations and textuality. Schaberg writes\:  
I argue that airports depend on textuality to a great degree, as much for their  
straightforward operations \(such as the daily performances and narratives that play  
out all the way from the check-in stand to the departure gate\), as for their everyday  
mysteries and inoperative moments \(for instance, how a thousand unique stories can  
be contained in and canceled out by phrases like ‘weather delay’ and ‘lost baggage’\).  
\(2012, 2\)19  
I challenge Augé’s and Schaberg’s arguments that texts define the airport’s environ-  
ment. In today’s contemporary international airports, air terminal architects try to  
minimize the use of signage, and they focus on how the building’s material design can  
be shaped such that it is an easy-to-navigate space. Although I am arguing that the  
terminal’s materiality plays a larger role in the airport’s operations than what Augé  
and Schaberg suggest in their respective analyses, I am not suggesting that texts do  
not have an integral function at the air terminal. Even though texts are not the only  
medium used for wayfinding, the careful deployment of signage often helps passengers  
find their way.  
However, signage can be confusing for some travellers, particularly if they are una-  
ble to read the language depicted. In these cases, passengers will usually find their Agency and a Functional Aesthetic 71  
way by either following other travellers or seeking assistance from airport personnel.  
However, passengers occasionally do get lost, and this can lead to tragic outcomes.  
In October 2007, Robert Dziekański, a Polish national, died as a result of misunder-  
standing the process involved to pass through the border zone at Vancouver’s Interna-  
tional Terminal. After spending over six hours in this space, he became agitated and  
his confused mental state ultimately led to his death. Dziekański’s miscomprehension  
of the process likely stemmed from his inability to speak or read English, the main lan-  
guage spoken in Vancouver. I examine the steps taken by the Vancouver International  
Airport Authority \(VIAA\) in response to this event, and I discuss how the authority  
recognized that signage and texts are less effective for wayfinding than clear view-  
points of desired destinations in the terminal.  
Before I address the implications of the Dziekański incident, I will give an account  
of his, his mother’s, and the airport and security staff’s actions on October 13 and 14,  
2007\. This overview helps illustrate the rationale behind the changes at Vancouver’s  
YVR in response to this tragedy. On October 13, 2007, Dziekański flew from Poland  
to Vancouver \(CBC News 2007a, 2007b, 2007c, 2007d, 2008, 2009\). This was his  
first trip out of Poland as well as his first time flying. Dziekański, who only spoke  
Polish, had to pass through airports in Frankfurt and Vancouver and was anxious  
about the process. His mother, Sofia Cisowski, instructed him to meet her at the bag-  
gage carousels. Yet, meeters and greeters are not permitted to access this space in the  
International Terminal’s airside arrivals area. After Dziekański landed, he waited in  
the secured baggage claim area for over six hours before having his visa processed by  
the Canada Border Services Agency \(CBSA\) and exiting this secured zone. Meanwhile,  
his mother, who was waiting in the landside area, made numerous attempts to find out  
whether he had arrived and if they could page him. Even though she explained that he  
was likely by the carousels, she was reassured by airport staff that he would be attended  
to.20 After numerous attempts to find her son, Cisowski was advised to return to her  
home in Kamloops, situated 350 kilometres east of Vancouver. At approximately the  
same time, Dziekański was processed at the exit of the CBSA baggage claim area.  
From there, he was directed to a separate office where CBSA agents approved his visa  
application and allowed him to leave this secured zone. However, about thirty minutes  
later, an officer noticed that Dziekański was sitting in a chair within this space, and he  
was escorted to the final CBSA checkpoint. When Dziekański exited to the landside  
area of the arrivals hall, he became agitated and tried to return back to this secured  
space. Police were called to deal with Dziekański who at one point started throwing  
furniture. Four RCMP officers arrived on the scene shortly afterwards, and they fired  
a Taser at Dziekański several times to subdue him. Dziekański died moments later.21  
The VIAA tried to improve the terminal’s interior design following Dziekański’s  
death. The carpet design and the lighting were changed in an attempt to clarify the  
route from the CBSA zone to the landside arrivals area \(Braidwood 2010\). These  
renovations follow the logic of the functional aesthetic I have outlined in this chapter.  
But they only have a limited effect in terms of wayfinding since there is no direct view  
of the meeters and greeters on the landside. Like most international airports, the bag-  
gage claim and subsequent border screening area at YVR are situated in a contained  
secured space without any windows.  
The VIAA’s more substantial upgrades to this space included increased personnel  
and access to translation services. A new information kiosk was installed next to  
where Dziekański died. This twenty-four-hour information desk is situated beside the 72 Agency and a Functional Aesthetic  
exit leading from the airside of the arrivals area to the landside of the arrivals hall. It  
can be accessed by passengers before they exit the secured zone and by meeters and  
greeters on the landside. This desk is equipped with a landline connecting to transla-  
tors for 170 different languages. A similar twenty-four-hour information desk was  
installed near the carousels in the baggage claim area where Dziekański had spent  
approximately six hours.22 The changes included new signage that uses pictograms  
to direct passengers to the landside area of the arrivals hall. Furthermore, the VIAA  
deployed information cards throughout the airport that explained in twenty differ-  
ent languages that translation services were available and that travellers would only  
need to point to the language that needed translation. The airport authority increased  
the number of personnel in the baggage claim area and equipped them with mobile  
phones that access the language line and emergency services. What is notable is that  
the VIAA did not simply translate existing text, but they also deployed human agents  
throughout the space; in their aim to improve the navigability of the terminal, the  
VIAA increased the number of staff to help with passenger wayfinding. While there  
was some attention to an improvement in architectural design, planners recognized  
that design cues to order circulation do not have the desired effect on all passengers.  
In short, the functional aesthetic addressed in this chapter was recognized as only a  
partial solution and human agents were hired to provide support.  
These services no doubt help with passengers who are unable to read YVR’s sig-  
nage, which is in Canada’s two official languages, English and French, as well as Chi-  
nese text. YVR is not exceptional in terms of its use of English on its signage since it  
is the lingua franca of air travel. Airports in cities such as Bangkok, Shanghai, Lima,  
and Athens have signage that is in both the country’s official language and English.  
In most cases, the official language appears on top with English below. Schiphol is  
an exception. The airport, which used to follow this formulation, redesigned its sig-  
nage in 2000 such that English would be the sole language used unless it was deemed  
necessary to include Dutch text \(Mijksenaar 2012\). The rationale behind the change  
was that words such as “gate,” “toilet,” “departures,” and “arrivals” were almost  
universally identifiable by international air travellers since English is used in virtually  
every airport across the world. Only in select cases would Dutch text be permitted.  
For example, on signs pointing to First Aid, the Dutch text, “Eerste hulp,” would be  
printed under the English text in a smaller and lighter font.  
Conclusion  
Airport architects designing today’s international terminals incorporate material cues  
that are intended to help travellers navigate and orient themselves within the build-  
ing’s interior. Their design ethos, which mirrors key tenets of actor-network theory,  
assumes that the terminal’s materiality can operate as an active agent to mediate pas-  
senger behaviour. Some of the terminal’s components such as escalators and travel-  
lators prescribe only a limited set of actions for the airport’s user. Other wayfinding  
strategies, such as skylights and flooring patterns that emphasize directional flows,  
are more subtle material cues and often operate on a visual register. These designs  
constitute an aesthetic type determined by their function, and their appeal correlates  
with their usefulness as a design for wayfinding. Moreover, if a ceiling design is going  
to effectively facilitate passenger navigation, then it must look appropriate for this  
purpose. Agency and a Functional Aesthetic 73  
Even though an architect assumes that their design is fit to serve its wayfinding  
function, it may not operate as intended. Indeed, a design cannot determine a spe-  
cific behaviour, and it will likely incite a multitude of responses among its users. The  
renovations at Vancouver’s YVR following Dziekański’s death illustrate how planners  
recognize that material designs may not always operate as envisioned and that human  
agents are sometimes necessary to lead the way.  
In the following chapter, I concentrate on how artworks are expected to serve way-  
finding purposes. I examine how architects deploy artworks for orientation and how  
they often install them near consumer spaces to draw passengers towards shops and  
restaurants.  
Notes  
1\. Parsons and Carlson refer to their theory as “Functional Beauty.” However, their use of the  
word “beauty” requires some clarification. Although they concede that “beauty” is a con-  
tentious term, they note that they decided to refer to their theory as functional beauty since  
no other expression—aside from the lengthy phrase, “aesthetic appreciation involving  
knowledge that concerns function”—could succinctly and properly convey their concept  
\(2008, xii\). Parsons and Carlson explain that they use the term “beauty” in the broader  
sense of its meaning, which is “aesthetic appeal in general,” and that they are not referring  
to “the specific sort of aesthetic appearance it typically suggests” \(2008, xiii\).  
2\. See also Karen A. Cerulo’s \(2009\) discussion of actor-network theory and Erin J. Camp-  
bell’s \(2014\) analysis of how Latour’s and other theorists’ ideas concerning the agency of  
things apply to studies of the decorative arts.  
3\. See also Andrew Pickering’s \(1995\) analysis of scientific knowledge and practice in terms  
of a “performative idiom” as opposed to a “representational idiom”; he argues that both  
humans and non-humans are active agents in the production of knowledge but only  
humans have the capacity to act with intention.  
4\. Latour and Yaneva also propose that actor-network theory can offer a more detailed  
description of the architectural design process\:  
We should finally be able to picture a building as a navigation through a controversial  
datascape\: as an animated series of projects, successful and failing, as a changing and  
criss-crossing trajectory of unstable definitions and expertise, of recalcitrant materials  
and building technologies, of flip-flopping users’ concerns and communities’ appraisals.

ties such as John Urry’s \(2007\) writing on mobility-systems and Tim Cresswell’s notion of  
mobility as “socially produced motion” \(2006, 3\).

\(1984, 91–110\) and reflects on how people drive through the urban automobile network.  
Although things such as roads, bridges, highways, stop signs, and stop lights are visible and  
people are generally conscious of this built environment, there are a host of other aspects  
of infrastructure and automobiles that influence people’s movements on a non-cognitive  
register. For instance, software is changing how people drive with improvements such as  
anti-lock brakes, traction control, and navigation systems. Thrift \(2004b, 2007\) has also  
theorized how non-cognitive bodily practices are influenced by things such as software,  
urban infrastructures, and ergonomics, which operate as a “technological unconscious.”  
See also Martin Dodge and Rob Kitchin’s \(2004\) analysis of software and practices in  
the air terminal. They examine how passengers’ and airport employees’ practices are influ-  
enced by their interactions with a myriad of computer programs either visible on a screen  
or operating silently in the background. 74 Agency and a Functional Aesthetic  
6\. While Leach \(2002\) suggests that studies of architecture should account for “narratives  
of use,” he does not include a case study where a building’s inhabitants are observed or  
interviewed to ascertain how their practices might point to the building’s identity. His  
notion of architectural identity is based on a theoretical supposition as to how individuals  
might identify with a building. For an analysis of how practices performed within a build-  
ing contrast with its design’s symbolic meaning, see Rhodri Windsor Liscombe’s \(2014\)  
investigation of how the uses of various British and North American buildings designed in  
a classical style belie the ideologies associated with this architectural aesthetic.  
7\. Scholars and critics mostly addressed whether the Postmodern building’s Colosseum-like  
appearance was an inauthentic structure that did not recall the site’s history and whether  
the design was culturally insensitive to Vancouver’s growing Asian population \(Lees 2001;  
Windsor Liscombe 2000\).  
8\. Lees contends that her method of investigating architecture “recognizes that \[a building’s\]  
meaning is not something fixed but is ongoing and continually produced through prac-  
tice, for human action itself is forever unfinished” \(2001, 75\). Lees’s study has inspired a  
number of other cultural geographers \(Kraftl 2006; Rose, Degen, and Basdas 2010; Jacobs  
and Merriman 2011\) to consider buildings in the context of their inhabitants’ practices.  
Like Lees, they employ ethnographic methods—they observe and take accounts of prac-  
tices while they are being performed, which in some cases includes interviews with the  
inhabitants. This contrasts with methods used by architectural historians. Their investiga-  
tions typically do not involve observations of humans in action but focus on the build-  
ing’s material structure, planning documents, and other printed materials such as journals  
and newspapers. However, see Mark Llewellyn’s \(2004\) investigation of Kensal House, a  
modernist housing flat in London, for a study of past lived experiences inspired by Lees’s  
“critical geography of architecture.” Llewellyn examines the experience of living in Kensal  
House during the 1930s; he draws from surveys conducted shortly after the building was  
constructed and his own interviews with former residents.  
9\. In Being and Time, Martin Heidegger \(1962\) grapples with how, as human beings, we exist  
and considers this in terms of how we encounter other entities as either “present-at-hand”  
or “ready-to-hand” entities. A present-at-hand entity is approached via one’s consciousness  
and is considered in relation to its apparent properties. Many of the things we encounter  
in our own worlds, he argues, are ready-to-hand entities—such as his famous example,  
the hammer when used for hammering—which exist as unnoticed entities in everyday life  
until they malfunction. When the carpenter uses the hammer for hammering, he does not  
think of the tool according to its apparent properties; only when the hammer breaks the  
carpenter contemplates the not ready-to-hand broken tool as present-at-hand.  
10\. Parsons and Carlson \(2008\) argue that this type of aesthetic, which derives from the  
knowledge of a thing’s function, contrasts with a major tenet in Immanuel Kant’s tracts on  
the judgement of taste and beauty, disinterestedness. In judging pure beauty, Kant argues,  
the beholder must approach the object without attending to any concepts pertaining to the  
object and without any consideration of how the object might fulfil any needs or desires.  
Drawing from theories that consider an object’s aesthetics in terms of its social, cultural,  
and historical context, Parsons and Carlson reject Kantian disinterestedness and argue  
that concepts pertaining to things can determine the thing’s aesthetic properties. Although  
Kant’s notion of dependent beauty allows for an aesthetic judgment that accounts for the  
thing’s function and use, Parsons and Carlson note that this type of beauty considers how  
an object’s aesthetic properties might be appropriate for its function and is unlike their  
notion of functional beauty, which derives a thing’s aesthetics from its function.  
11\. Saarinen’s curvilinear design for the TWA terminal was intended to evoke the dynamism of  
flight \(Merkel 2005; Hubregtse 2017\).  
12\. Taut writes\: “The architect who achieves this task becomes a creator of an ethical and  
social character; the people who use the building for any purpose, will, through the struc-  
ture of the house, be brought to a better behaviour in their mutual dealings and relation-  
ship with each other” \(1929, 9\).  
13\. These gates are used for flights departing to airports within the Schengen zone. Flights to  
non-Schengen locations depart from the M- and S-gates in Terminal 4’s satellite building.  
It also has support structures that gradually change colour. Agency and a Functional Aesthetic 75  
14\. See Howard Risatti \(2007\) and Nick Zangwill \(2001\) for examples of philosophical con-  
siderations of the functional aesthetics of man-made objects in terms of the designer’s or  
artist’s intentions.  
15\. Like Parsons and Carlson \(2008\), Preston \(2000\) draws her notion of proper function from  
Ruth Garrett Millikan \(1984, 1989\) and discusses it in the context of Robert Cumming’s  
\(1975\) causal role function, which she refers to as a “system function.” She posits that both  
Cummings and Millikan provide equally strong philosophical considerations of function,  
and she argues that these notions complement each other and that theories of function  
should account for both proper functions and system functions.  
16\. While my assessment of walkthrough duty-free stores focuses on a functional aesthetic  
with regard to organizing passenger movement, I do not discount that there are other aes-  
thetic factors belonging to this space. For instance, shopping itself can be an aesthetic and  
pleasurable experience \(Holbrook and Hirschman 1982\).  
17\. Edmund Burke \(1757\) examines this aesthetic type in Philosophical Enquiry into the Ori-  
gin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful. Joan Coutu \(2017\) considers the relation-  
ship between time, the sensuous, and Burke’s sublime in her analysis of the architectural  
design and sculptures in the Marquis of Rockingham’s Wentworth Woodhouse and British  
politics in the late eighteenth century.  
18\. According to Augé \(1995\), signage is a distinguishing characteristic of “non-places.” These  
include other transit spaces such as railway stations and highways and large-scale commer-  
cial operations such as supermarkets.  
19\. Schaberg’s \(2012\) analysis also examines the airport in terms of a broader scope of texts;  
particularly, how the airport is experienced by many passengers as a space for reading and  
how the airport is described in literary representations.  
20\. His mother also spoke with CBSA officials at their office near the exit from the airside to  
the landside arrivals area. She was told that he had not been processed, even though by this  
time he had already passed through the passport inspection zone.  
21\. Paul Pritchard, a passenger in the landside area of the arrivals hall, started filming  
Dziekański with a digital camera when he started behaving erratically and kept recording  
until a few minutes after Dziekański became motionless. This video, which was released  
to the press, was seen by millions and caused a public outcry. It would later be scrutinized  
at an inquiry led by Justice Thomas Braidwood \(Bailey 2008, 2010\). During the inquiry,  
which ran between 2008 and 2010, Dziekański’s and the RCMP officers’ practices depicted  
in the video were carefully examined frame-by-frame to ascertain whether the use of a  
Taser was warranted. In his final report on the Dziekański affair, Justice Braidwood praised  
Vancouver’s airport authority for adding services aimed at helping international travellers  
who do not speak English \(Braidwood 2010\).  
22\. The VIAA’s installation of extra information desks and distribution of phones with direct  
access to the language line among personnel is undoubtedly a successful strategy for over-  
coming language barriers faced by some passengers. Within a few months of implementing  
this change, the VIAA’s President, Larry Berg \(2008\), reported that the language line was  
being used four to six times per day and that the languages that most often needed to be  
translated were Spanish and Mandarin. He also noted that the newly installed twenty-  
four-hour information desk in the CBSA baggage claim area received approximately 250  
inquiries per day, which were primarily questions regarding directions.

# and Commerce  
In Chapter 2, I examined how architects incorporate material cues into their air termi-  
nal designs for wayfinding purposes. In this chapter, I focus on how architects deploy  
artworks as easily recognizable landmarks for orientation. Like ceiling designs and  
flooring patterns, these installations are active agents that mediate passengers’ actions  
in the terminal. I discuss how air terminal architects and planners deliberately choose  
artworks that will stand out as conspicuous material objects. Moreover, these sculptures  
are typically designed with colours, shapes, and finishes that contrast with the sur-  
rounding interior. Some airports such as Amsterdam’s Schiphol, Vancouver’s YVR, and  
Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi include these distinctive artworks on their terminals’ maps.  
I argue that these types of artworks, like the architectural designs discussed in the last  
chapter, constitute a functional aesthetic with regard to their wayfinding purpose.  
I also discuss how some airport planners install artworks to draw passengers  
towards retail spaces and why they believe that these works will spur the travellers’  
desire to spend. I examine works at Schiphol, YVR, San Francisco International, Los  
Angeles’s Tom Bradley International Terminal, and Toronto Pearson, and I explain  
how they are intended to help generate revenue. I pay particular attention to artworks  
integrated into the building’s architecture during the terminal’s planning and construc-  
tion phases. Often, these pieces are installed near commercial spaces. Furthermore,  
artists are typically required to adjust these integrated artworks to suit the terminal’s  
interior design. Nevertheless, architects occasionally design a terminal to accord with  
a commissioned work and its placement in the interior. For instance, Bill Reid’s Spirit  
of Haida Gwaii\: The Jade Canoe at Vancouver’s International Terminal and Richard  
Serra’s Tilted Spheres at Toronto Pearson’s Terminal 1 were acquired during these  
buildings’ construction phases and significantly impacted their architectural designs.  
I examine these works in detail with respect to these terminals’ design processes as well  
as how they contribute to these terminals’ functions. Reid’s The Jade Canoe is perhaps  
an ideal example since it acts as a significant landmark and draws passengers towards  
adjacent commercial spaces. Serra’s work also serves these functions when it is viewed  
from the exterior. Yet, its interior space undermines these aims since it shields the  
traveller’s view from the terminal’s retail stores, restaurants, and wayfinding signage.  
Artworks and Orientation  
In many of today’s international terminals, planners have installed artworks to aid  
with passenger navigation and orientation. At YVR and Schiphol, architects and plan-  
ners expect these pieces to operate as active agents, and they have chosen artworks to  
function as way-posts because of their materiality. While they carefully select artworks 80 Artworks for Wayfinding and Commerce  
based on their representational content, they also consider how an artwork’s material  
aspects will be grasped in the background of a passenger’s attention. Hans Smits, the  
former director of Schiphol’s art committee, noted that their aim was to install artworks  
that were visible in the corner of the traveller’s eye \(Marck 1995\). This committee  
chose installations such as Dennis Adams’s Coda which passengers would differenti-  
ate from the miles of transparent glass walls and the predominantly white-and-grey-  
coloured floors and ceilings. Coda is notable in regard to wayfinding and colour \(see  
Plate 6\). Its red-and-white checkered pattern contrasts with Schiphol Plaza’s subdued  
tones, and it effectively operates as an eye-catching landmark. Schiphol has designated  
this piece as an official meeting point. Like Heathrow Terminal 5’s skylights and HKIA  
Terminal 1’s longitudinal vaults \(Figure I.2, 1.11\), this artwork looks fit in terms of its  
wayfinding function. Its vibrant colour scheme and monumental size allows it to stand  
out as a noticeable object in a busy space of passenger flows.  
At Vancouver’s airport, Stantec deploys artworks for wayfinding purposes as well, and  
they also choose works with colours that contrast with the surrounding interior design.  
Smith’s Freedom to Move, which the firm installed in the Domestic Terminal in 2009,  
consists of a series of cedar panels adorned with red and black formline representations  
of animals including a raven, an eagle, a grizzly bear, and a killer whale \(see Plate 13\).  
The work stands out among the blue-green carpeting and white ceiling. Stantec placed  
Freedom to Move at a strategic “decision point” \(Noel Best, pers. comm., December 17,  
2018\). It is situated at a three-way intersection in the pier serving the C-gates \(Figure 3.1\).

Airport.

Stantec’s Noel Best notes that the work is not meant to stop passengers in their tracks  
but to “break their pace” and draw their attention to the approaching intersection.  
Smith’s initial conception for Freedom to Move envisioned the cedar pieces fixed  
to the floor without a surrounding structure \(Noel Best, pers. comm., December 17,  
2018\). Stantec suggested that the sculpture should be set in a pool since the wooden  
panels could be easily damaged by baggage trolleys, motorized carts, or careless indi-  
viduals. When it was installed, Freedom to Move was placed on a podium in a pool of  
water enclosed by concrete. Wooden benches are fastened to this low protective wall  
to offer passengers extra seating space. While this concrete wall serves a functional  
purpose with regard to durability and preserving the sculptural work, it does not  
specifically pertain to the functional aesthetic I outlined in the last chapter. Rather,  
this aesthetic concerns the more striking aspects of the work—its cedar panels with  
red and black formline designs allow this piece to operate effectively as a guide for  
wayfinding.  
Schiphol and YVR depict some of their terminals’ artworks on their maps. This  
includes Adams’s Coda and Mark Brusse’s I meet you at Schiphol and Smith’s  
Freedom to Move and Reid’s The Jade Canoe at YVR \(Figure 1.5; see Plates 1, 6,  
and 13\). What is notable is that the artworks on these maps, which are supposed to  
be landmarks, are not identified by their titles or the artists that created them but are  
icons referring to their physical forms and colours—quick identifiers easily grasped by  
passengers who are trying to navigate the space. Coda’s form is parsed down to a cube  
with unbroken edges; the work, however, has a bench for seating and openings that  
lead into the work’s interior space. What’s more, each side is rendered with a 3x3 grid  
of red-and-white checkers rather than the 7x7 grid that actually appears on the sculp-  
ture’s surface. Schiphol includes these simplified renditions of the terminal’s artworks  
on the maps posted throughout the airport, on paper copies available at information  
desks, on its website, and on an app available for mobile phones and tablets. YVR  
uses these icons on the maps placed in the terminal and posted on the airport’s web-  
site. Schiphol’s maps also depict some distinctive architectural features. The map for  
Lounge 3, which is in the post-security area near the F-pier, includes a green-coloured  
icon that refers to the House of Tulips store \(see Plate 14\). It is built out of green glass  
and resembles an Amsterdam canal house \(see Plate 15\). I discuss Studio Tjep’s place-  
themed design for the House of Tulips’ exterior in further detail in Chapter 5.  
Schiphol has commissioned the wayfinding firm, Mijksenaar, to create the maps  
for its interiors. Maps that are fixed to a column or a pier are designed according to  
the passenger’s orientation in the space \(Fenne Roefs, pers. comm., April 11, 2018\).  
The firm only includes an icon of an artwork or a distinctive interior design if it is  
within view of where the map is placed in the terminal. Their intent is to indicate  
artworks strictly for navigation—these maps are not intended to provide a tour of  
the artworks installed in the terminal \(Hans Bouchier, pers. comm., April 11, 2018\).  
Furthermore, an icon is depicted such that it coincides with the passenger’s position  
in the interior. For instance, the map located to the left of the House of Tulips shop  
depicts the icon for the store immediately to the right of where “You” is indicated  
\(see Plate 14\). Mijksenaar’s designers also believe that a view of an aircraft is an  
effective wayfinding tool \(Thoas Hooning van Duyvenbode, pers. comm., April 11,  
2018\).  
1 Their maps include icons of airplanes on the apron, and they situate them  
according to the traveller’s orientation. Aircraft appear at the top of the map if the  
apron is in front of the passenger and at the bottom of the map if the apron is behind  
the passenger. 82 Artworks for Wayfinding and Commerce  
Based on my observations from visits to forty-two international airports across the  
world, only a small number of terminals use artworks on their maps. Schiphol and  
YVR have layouts that are hard to discern as a passenger walking through their inte-  
riors, and artworks can certainly help with navigating oneself through these compli-  
cated spaces. These two airports’ landside and airside areas have expanded a number  
of times since their terminals opened in 1967 and 1968 respectively.2 Yet, it is not  
only terminals that have grown by accretion that necessarily use artworks as guides  
for navigation and represent them as icons on their maps. The terminal at Bangkok’s  
Suvarnabhumi Airport, which opened in 2006 and contains large open spaces like  
HKIA’s Terminal 1 and Heathrow Terminal 5, has a series of sculptures that appear  
on maps posted throughout the building.3 This includes Scene of The Churning of The  
Milk Ocean, an elaborate installation comprised of figures depicting Hindu super-  
natural beings \(see Plate 16\). It is situated on the airside of the terminal, which con-  
sists of a concourse over one kilometre in length \(Figure 3.2\). Two clusters of gates are  
situated on each end. This sculpture is in the centre point of this long passageway, which is  
lined with shops, restaurants, and boutiques. At each end of the concourse, planners have

installed an open-walled structure with a high-pitched roof in a style akin to the highly  
ornamented gables found on traditional Thai temples \(Figure 3.3\). These buildings are  
included on the airport’s maps. These artworks and structures undoubtedly help pas-  
sengers orient themselves in the space. There are three security checkpoints that lead  
Figure 3.3 Gift Shop, Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport, Thailand, 2006.

from the landside to the airside, and these decision points are distributed symmetri-  
cally along the length of the post-security concourse. The Scene of The Churning of  
The Milk Ocean is situated near the central security checkpoint.  
Artworks and Commerce  
Air terminal artworks are installed to support wayfinding as well as commercial pur-  
poses. Some planners place artworks near shops and restaurants to draw travellers  
towards these consumer spaces, and they often expect that these pieces will increase  
the passengers’ desire to spend. However, this planning principle is not universal to  
all airports. At Stansted, for example, there are no artworks in the terminal. In this  
section, I examine the types of works installed at Schiphol, YVR, Toronto Pearson,  
San Francisco International, and Los Angeles’s Tom Bradley International Terminal,  
and I consider how their placement in the building affects passenger spending. Before  
I address these pieces, I consider the reasons why some airport planners elect to not  
commission pieces for their terminal interiors.  
Some planners choose to not install artworks since they occupy spaces that could be  
exploited commercially \(de Wijn 2013\). Schiphol’s architect Jan Benthem notes that  
those in charge of commerce often challenge proposals for artworks since they are  
constantly seeking more advertising and retail space to boost revenue \(Erdogan 2003\).  
Benthem defends the reasoning behind the installation of Dennis Adams’s Coda in the  
central space in Schiphol Plaza \(see Plate 6\). Benthem explains that “every town square  
needs an artwork, a meeting point, a village pump” and that “commerce should yield to  
functionality” \(cited in Erdogan 2003, 14\).4 As noted, this artwork was commissioned  
to operate as an eye-catching landmark in a space of multiple flows, and it appears on  
the terminal’s maps. Clearly for Benthem, the airport’s primary function is the smooth  
circulation of passengers, and its capacity to generate revenue is secondary.  
In some cases air terminal artworks are moved to a different location to make way  
for shops and restaurants or other renovations. Sometimes they are removed and no  
longer displayed in the terminal. Michel Santry suspects that his aerial installation was  
removed from HKIA’s Terminal 1 in 2003 to create more space for advertising \(Korpo-  
raal 2003\). The artwork was suspended from the ceiling in the landside area of Terminal  
1 when it opened in 1998. It comprised of three separate sections, each made with steel  
tubing and colourful lightweight cloths. Airport officials claimed that it was removed  
because it was too difficult to clean. Santry’s suspicions may have been correct, since  
there are a number of advertisements that hang from the ceiling in the landside area  
of the terminal \(Figure 1.2\). HKIA has also removed Tao Ho’s A Synergy of Dynamic  
Energy. Like Santry’s artwork, it was commissioned for Terminal 1 and suspended from  
the ceiling \(Xinhua News Agency 1997\).5 Ho’s artwork, constructed out of coloured  
aluminium tubes and stainless steel wire, consisted of eighteen icosahedra, which was  
meant to symbolize the relationship between the eighteen districts in Hong Kong.  
A developer’s resistance to including artworks in commercial spaces is unsurprising.  
Architect Victor Gruen, a pioneer of shopping centre design, faced criticism from plan-  
ners when he commissioned artworks for malls during the 1950s \(Wall 2005\). Nonethe-  
less, some developers supported his initiative to include creative works in these spaces.  
His design for the Northland Shopping Center included 200,000 USD worth of artworks  
when it opened in 1954 \(Gruen and Smith 1960\). Gruen did not aim to include art “in the  
form of a museum-like display” \(Gruen and Smith 1960, 153\). Rather, he integrated the  
works into the shopping centre’s architecture and landscaping.6 Like Coda at Schiphol, Artworks for Wayfinding and Commerce 85  
these pieces acted as landmarks and meeting points within the mall’s public spaces. Gruen  
did not regard these artworks simply as a means to stimulate spending; they contributed  
to his overall aim to design shopping malls as civic centres that met the community’s social  
and cultural needs. In Shopping Towns USA\: The Planning of Shopping Centres, Gruen  
and Larry Smith reported on the reception of Northland’s artworks\:  
After the opening of the shopping centre, the developer, the executives of his  
organization and the tenants declared themselves delighted with the results. The  
publicity value and promotional opportunity were impressive. Even criticism of  
individual pieces and the resulting controversies were valuable as an expression  
of community life.  
\(1960, 157\)  
While air terminal and shopping mall developers may be delighted with artworks  
in commercial spaces, their capacity to increase spending is hard to measure. Dur-  
ing Smits’s tenure as Schiphol’s Chief Executive Officer, the airport, along with the  
Mondriaan Stichting, commissioned a study into the links between marketing strate-  
gies and air terminal artworks. Dorothée van Hooff \(1998\) published the results in  
Tegenbeelden\: Marketingstrategie en Kunstopdrachten.  
7 She contends that Schiphol’s  
selection of artworks reflects its corporate identity and has bolstered the company’s  
image. She argues that installing artworks in the terminal may lead to more passen-  
gers transferring through the airport; like good shopping options and clean toilets,  
artworks might help attract transferring passengers. Although she admits that it is  
not possible to quantify the returns on installing artworks in terminals, she adds that  
neither is the friendly face of a counter attendant.  
Van Hooff’s \(1998\) Tegenbeelden is a remarkable document when considering  
Gruen and Smith’s \(1960\) comments regarding Northland’s artworks. Not only does  
it address the promotional aspect of artworks, but the study was ordered shortly after  
art critics attacked works installed in Schiphol in 1993. Mark Brusse’s I meet you, for  
instance, was derided for being too touristic \(Figure 1.5\). Smits, who commissioned  
Tegenbeelden, was part of an art committee that was formed to address this criti-  
cism. The committee developed a proposal that sought works which critically reflect  
upon the passenger’s experience of time and space in the terminal. In 1995, Schiphol  
installed four works that address this theme. These include Adams’s Coda, Marc Ruy-  
grok’s So go on, Niek Kemps’s Closed View, and Jenny Holzer’s Untitled. I examine  
these artworks in further detail in Chapter 4.  
Van Hooff \(1998\) does not focus solely on this series. She considers the wide array  
of artworks installed at Schiphol since the terminal opened in 1967.8 A number of the  
pieces added during the 1960s and 1970s were sculptural works in a modernist idiom  
consisting of simple formal arrangements. Carel Visser’s Salami, installed in 1967, is  
a layered stack of thin rectangular metal blocks. It is located outdoors in a rectan-  
gular water pool near the entrance to Schiphol Plaza. That same year André Volt-  
en’s Rustcloud was hung from the terminal’s ceiling. It is made out of small slices of  
metal I-beams welded together.9 In 1974, the airport added Tajiri’s Knot \(Figure 2.4\).  
In 1988, the airport decided that it would allocate 0.2 percent of its construction costs  
for new buildings and renovations to commissioning new artworks \(van Hooff 1998\).  
Five years later, it increased funding to 0.5 percent. These funds paid for artworks  
such as Carel Visser’s Flying Fish, Brusse’s I meet you, Adams’s Coda, Ruygrok’s So  
go on, Kemps’s Closed View, and Holzer’s Untitled. Schiphol has installed a number 86 Artworks for Wayfinding and Commerce  
of other artworks since Tegenbeelden was published in 1998. In the following chap-  
ters, I address Cor Dera’s Flora of the Low Lands and Daan Roosegaarde’s Beyond,  
installed in 2007 and 2016 respectively.  
The airport has opened a satellite gallery of the Rijksmuseum since van Hooff \(1998\)  
published Tegenbeelden. In 2002, the airport began to show some of the Netherlands’  
most famous artworks to passengers transiting through the airport’s non-Schengen  
area \(Koster 2002\). The museum showcases seventeenth-century paintings by Dutch  
Masters such as Rembrandt van Rijn, Jan Steen, and Jacob Isaacksz van Ruisdael.10  
The gallery’s interior is dimly lit, and it offers travellers a moment of tranquillity away  
from the hustle and bustle outside. This changes when passengers exit the gallery and  
enter the museum’s gift shop, which sells things such as models of Amsterdam’s canal  
houses, Delft Blue cups, plates, and tiles, and purses and umbrellas with patterns taken  
from Vincent van Gogh’s paintings \(Figure 3.4\). The purpose of the Rijksmuseum sat-  
ellite gallery is to offer a glimpse of Dutch culture for passengers transferring through  
Schiphol—approximately forty percent of the total passenger traffic \(de Haan 2002\).  
It is undoubtedly an appealing amenity for travellers who need to spend a layover in  
a European hub. However, the museum was not only deployed to draw transferring  
passengers to Schiphol. It is intended to encourage them to travel to Holland and,  
hopefully, visit the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.11  
Like Schiphol, San Francisco International has installed a wide array of artworks in  
its terminals, and it has likewise reserved a percentage of the total construction costs for  
Figure 3.4 Rijksmuseum Museum Shop, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Netherlands, 2017.

art. But the amount set aside is more generous. The airport is beholden to a municipal  
ordinance that requires all public projects to attribute two percent of its development  
costs towards public art \(San Francisco Arts Commission n.d.\). The city’s Arts Commis-  
sion began working with the airport in 1977 when it was developing Terminal 3 \(San  
Francisco International Airport n.d.b\). It has since commissioned works for Terminals  
1 and 2 as well as the airport’s International Terminal, which was completed in 2000.12  
While most are wall-mounted paintings and free-standing sculptures, there are some  
artworks integrated into the buildings’ architecture. The majority of the works installed  
in the International Terminal are on the airside. They consist of two-dimensional pieces  
mounted to a two-storey wall beside each gate. Passengers can view these works from  
the central corridor on the upper level as well as the gate’s waiting area on the lower  
level. Some of these works depict imagery inspired by San Francisco’s community as  
well as more general aviation themes. Juana Alicia and Emmanuel Catarino Montoya’s  
Sanctuary/Sanctuario is a 7.3-metre-long and 6.1-metre-tall fresco mural that depicts  
the city’s diverse population \(see Plate 17\). Rupert Garcia’s Bird Technology is a similar-  
sized work constructed out of hand-painted ceramic tiles \(see Plate 18\). It depicts a sil-  
houette of a bird as well as a grid of coloured squares. The label notes that the bird refers  
to “natural flight” and the “geometric grid . . . symbolizes the technological advances  
that made human flight possible.” On the International Terminal’s landside, there are  
two sculptural works incorporated into the building’s architecture. James Carpenter’s  
Four Sculptural Light Reflectors consists of a translucent material affixed to the ceil-  
ing trusses high above the check-in counters. It is intended to recall the shape of early  
flying machines such as dirigibles and the Wright brothers’ first aircraft. Vito Acconci’s  
Light Beams for the Sky of a Transfer Corridor is incorporated into the design of a pas-  
sageway connecting the International Terminal to Terminals 1, 2, and 3 \(Figure 3.5\).  
Fluorescent lighting encased in plastic laminate criss-crosses the corridor’s walls and  
ceilings. Each light fixture is anchored with a non-functional public telephone.  
Aside from these types of permanent installations, San Francisco International dis-  
plays temporary exhibitions on art, science, history, and culture. SFO Museum is an  
accredited museum with its own team of curators and designers.13 Unlike Schiphol’s  
Rijksmuseum, these exhibitions are located in display cases and dedicated wall spaces  
throughout the landside and airside of all four terminals. San Francisco’s airport does  
not capitalize on these exhibitions in the same fashion as Schiphol. There is no gift  
shop placed at the gallery’s exit since the museum is distributed across the airport. Nor  
does the SFO Museum have its own gift shop. But, there is a San Francisco Museum of  
Modern Art store located in the International Terminal’s pre-security departures area.  
Louis Turpen, San Francisco International’s director from 1981 to 1995, recognized  
how art increases an air terminal’s appeal and how it can be used for commercial  
gain \(Milroy 2003\). He was recognized for overseeing an increase in spending at San  
Francisco’s airport during his tenure, and he was expected to generate an increase in  
revenue at Toronto Pearson when he was hired to direct the Greater Toronto Airports  
Authority \(GTAA\) in 1995 \(Willis 1997\). Turpen’s main achievement as the GTAA’s  
president and CEO was the redevelopment of the airport’s Terminal 1, which opened  
in 2004.14 The firm commissioned Moshe Safdie, Skidmore Owings & Merrill, and  
Adamson Associates to design the building.  
Turpen is largely credited for the GTAA’s decision to install artworks in the terminal  
\(Milroy 2003\). Unlike San Francisco, the airport was not required to set aside funds for  
art. Nonetheless, the GTAA spent approximately nine million CAD on art installations—  
or roughly 0.25 percent of the 3.6 billion CAD construction costs \(Cornell 2004; Rochon 88 Artworks for Wayfinding and Commerce  
Figure 3.5 Vito Acconci, Light Beams for the Sky of a Transfer Corridor, San Francisco Inter-  
national Airport, United States, 2000.  
Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2018\).  
2004\). Furthermore, the GTAA did not need to work with a local arts commission, so it  
was free to choose the types of works and determine their placement within the terminal.  
In 2004, Turpen recalled his experience with the San Francisco Arts Commission\:  
We were spending hundreds of millions of dollars and I’m sitting here twiddling  
my thumbs because somebody that I don’t know, who was hired by somebody  
that I don’t know, is doing something that I’ve never seen, to put someplace I’m  
not sure where.  
\(cited in Blum 2004\)  
For Toronto’s airport, Turpen hired Elsa Cameron, a San Francisco-based art con-  
sultant, to manage the commissioning process. The GTAA chose eight works that  
primarily evoke aviation-related themes, and the artists worked with the building’s  
architects to finalize their designs \(Greater Toronto Airports Authority n.d.\). At the  
time of the terminal’s opening, Safdie noted\: “This is the result of an extraordinary  
collaboration of artists and architects and that is rare. . . . We took risks as architects.  
I mean we gave the artists the best places in the building because we felt we had a  
dialogue with them” \(cited in Hiller 2004, 4\). Two years later, Safdie remarked that  
the terminal’s artworks serve a wayfinding purpose\: “These artworks are landmarks.  
They give specific character to specific places. And they enhance your sense of orienta-  
tion” \(cited in Hume 2006, 4\). Artworks for Wayfinding and Commerce 89  
Some of these works are located adjacent to commercial spaces. Robert Charles  
Coyle’s Flight Song is suspended from the ceiling next to a number of shops and res-  
taurants in the post-security zone that services domestic flights \(Figure 3.6\). It consists  
of nineteen 1.5-metre-long sheets of lexan which are folded into the shape of paper  
airplanes. This squadron of aircraft is flying through the concourse at an altitude  
Figure 3.6 Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2014\).  
Robert Charles Coyle, Flight Song, Toronto Pearson International Airport, Canada, 2003. 90 Artworks for Wayfinding and Commerce  
just above the store and restaurant signage. This suspended artwork also draws one’s  
eye to advertisements posted in the terminal. The squadron’s lead airplanes pass just  
above advertisements hanging below the clerestory windows adjacent to the D39-  
D41 gates. Katharina Grosse’s Untitled is a multi-coloured spray-painted mural  
that spans approximately twenty-three metres across two perpendicular walls \(see  
Plate 2\). One is situated above an entrance to a passageway leading to the D1-D12  
and D22-D28 gates, and the other is above a commercial space which now houses  
the Mill Street Brewery. The latter wall is capped with a skylight above, and Grosse’s  
paint extends onto the roof’s beams below this opening. During the installation, Safdie  
encouraged Grosse to extend her gestural strokes to the ceiling so that they appear to  
travel into the airspace above the terminal \(Hiller 2004\).  
The placement of these two works contrasts with the installations at San Francisco’s  
International Terminal. The most spectacular pieces on its airside are located in the  
waiting areas near the gates and away from the commercial spaces in the corridor  
leading to the gates. As noted, works such as Alicia and Montoya’s Sanctuary/Sanctu-  
ario and Garcia’s Bird Technology are mounted to a wall spanning two storeys, and  
viewers on the upper level can gaze upon these works from a balcony that also offers  
views of the apron and the gate’s waiting area below \(see Plates 17 and 18\). During my  
visit to the terminal in August 2018, there were movable seats placed by some of these  
balconies. The passengers occupying the seats were spending their dwell-time facing  
the artworks or the apron outside and not the commercial spaces located behind them  
along the corridor. The SFO Museum’s exhibitions also distract the passenger’s atten-  
tion away from advertisements and shopfronts. For example, display cases line the  
post-security corridor leading to Terminal 3’s gates \(Figure 3.7\).15 Even though only  
some of the passers-by are captivated by the artworks or historic objects shown, this  
ultimately results in a net loss of time spent near the airside retail spaces, which are  
located after the corridor.  
The redeveloped Terminal 2 at San Francisco’s airport, on the other hand, does  
include an artwork that was deliberately placed next to a shopping area \(see Plate 19\).  
Janet Echelman’s Every Beating Second was suspended over the ‘Recompose’ area  
when the terminal reopened in 2011 \(Henry 2011\). Passengers encounter this work  
directly upon exiting the pre-boarding security screening area. Gensler, the architec-  
tural firm that renovated the terminal, designed the Recompose area with the intent  
to relax passengers before they pass through the airside’s commercial spaces. It is lit  
by skylights and clerestory windows, and the ceiling is approximately twice as high as  
the security screening zone’s ceiling. The San Francisco Arts Commission collaborated  
with Gensler and the airport’s staff to create an “art program plan,” which called for  
an artwork that integrates with the Recompose area’s interior design.16 The commis-  
sioned work, Every Beating Second, consists of three sets of red and purple netting  
that hang below three skylights. These webs of weaved fibres droop between 5.8 and  
6.7 metres from the ceiling, and each net is suspended from two concentric rings\:  
an inner ring in the centre of the round skylight and an outer lobed metal armature  
attached to the ceiling.17 The nets gently pulse since they are stimulated by fans that  
emit a fluctuating air current. Below these translucent volumes are soft cushioned  
benches. Gensler notes that\: “Here, passengers can put on their shoes and gather their  
belongings in comfort, while scanning the shops and restaurants that line the walk  
toward the departure gates” \(Gensler n.d.\). This walk begins with passing by two Artworks for Wayfinding and Commerce 91

shops that abut this high-ceilinged space\: Compass Books and Kiehl’s, a cosmetics  
retailer.  
While Echelman’s vibrantly coloured Every Beating Second certainly draws the  
passer-by’s attention, it is relatively muted compared to Time Tower at Los Angeles’s  
Tom Bradley International Terminal \(Figure 3.8\). This twenty-two-metre-tall work  
encases an elevator shaft with a cubic footprint and projects high-resolution video on  
each of its four sides. Like Echelman’s sculpture, Time Tower is surrounded by shops  
including luxury retailers such as Michael Kors, Coach, Gucci, Hermes, and Burberry.  
The screens display metaphoric interpretations of time, including water streaming  
down a translucent surface, a slow panning view of distant galaxies, and a stack of  
suitcases with a clock that changes shape as it slithers downwards. The latter recalls  
the melted timepieces in Salvador Dalí’s The Persistence of Memory, 1931. Every hour  
the tower projects the actual time in the form of a clock with a case that mimics the  
Art Deco sunburst style. The moment is marked with a two-and-half-minute show  
where the clock’s inner mechanism is exposed and dancers perform a kaleidoscopic  
routine alongside the gearwheels supposedly driving the timepiece.18 Time Tower is a  
landmark on the airside, and it is clearly visible in the central hall situated between the  
north and south concourses that contain the terminal’s gates. The work, however, does Figure 3.8 Sardi Design, MRA International, and Moment Factory, Time Tower, Los Angeles

not merely orient the viewer—its slowly changing subject matter draws the viewer’s  
attention and entices them to dwell in the airside’s most concentrated commercial  
space.  
Time Tower is the largest of seven video works installed in 2013. This 40-mil-  
lion-dollar Integrated Environmental Media System was part of a 1.9-billion-dollar  
reconstruction and expansion which doubled the size of the terminal \(Sumers 2013;  
Templeton 2013; Society for Experiential Graphic Design n.d.\). Sardi Design and  
MRA International designed the video works while Fentress Architects was planning  
and renovating the terminal, and all seven works are integrated into the building’s  
architectural design. Montreal-based Moment Factory was commissioned to create  
over forty hours of video content for the installations. Sakchin Bessette, the firm’s  
creative director, noted that the videos were “designed with the sense of the magic of  
travel in mind” \(cited in Koepke 2013, 3\). Aside from Time Tower, there are two other  
sets of screens deployed in the central hall. The Story Board projects videos inspired by  
Los Angeles as well as other places “both real and imagined” \(Moment Factory 2013,  
n.d.\). The Destination Board displays departures information and graphics based on  
live weather data gathered from the flights’ destinations. There are two other screens  
leading in and out of the airside. The Bon Voyage Wall is situated in a passageway  
leading from the pre-boarding security check to the airside, and the Welcome Wall is  
placed in a corridor accessed by arriving passengers.  
There are also two series of screens, Portals, situated at the entrances to the north  
and south concourses adjacent to the central hall. Each portal consists of ten nar-  
row screens standing 8.5 metres tall. They are designed to display interactive videos  
based on live data. The screens project imagery based on destinations of outbound  
flights, and the video morphs in response to passers-by’s motions; there are sensors  
that capture movement in the surrounding area.19 Melora Koepke describes her expe-  
rience walking past this work in December 2013\: “As I walk by the North Concourse  
portal, each screen column is strung with one quivering string of a jazz manouche  
guitar\: The next outgoing flight is to Paris” \(2013, 3\). My encounter with this work  
in August 2018 was markedly different. At both the north and south portals, the ten  
screens displayed a bright pink advertisement for lipstick \(see Plate 20\). The Portals  
were transformed into a usual form of video advertisement one sees in the terminal;  
namely, a series of screens that are evenly distributed along a corridor or travellator  
and that project a synchronized loop of ads \(see Plate 5\).  
While Portals is a rare example of an artwork repurposed as an advertisement,  
there are a number of air terminal advertisements that are designed using analogous  
conventions employed in contemporary art. Heathrow Terminal 5, for instance, has  
light boxes displaying advertisements for the upscale clothing retailer Burberry that  
are installed in the wall and backlit in a similar fashion as Jeff Wall’s photographic  
transparencies such as The Destroyed Room, 1978, and The Vampires’ Picnic, 1991.  
Like the artworks discussed in this chapter, these spectacular advertisements also cap-  
ture the passenger’s attention.  
Vancouver’s YVR\: Place-Themed Artworks and Stimulating Spending  
Planners at Vancouver’s YVR likewise consider air terminal artworks as a potential  
boon for commercial gain. When the Vancouver International Airport Authority  
\(VIAA\) was developing the International Terminal during the 1990s, they believed 94 Artworks for Wayfinding and Commerce  
that Northwest Coast First Nations artworks would draw passengers towards retail  
spaces \(O’Neill 1998\). Reid’s The Jade Canoe, for example, was deliberately located  
close to the restaurants and food outlets on the departures level \(see Plate 1\). Its  
nearest neighbour is a Starbucks Coffee stand that abuts the eastern side of a theatre-  
like space that surrounds the work, and a larger food court is situated to the north.  
The VIAA not only installed these types of works to attract travellers to particular  
consumer spaces, but they also anticipated that the works themselves would stimu-  
late passenger spending. Frank O’Neill, chairman of the VIAA’s thematics committee,  
claimed\: “What art can do is create an ambiance and a feeling that puts people in a  
good mood. That, by the way, has a great commercial spinoff” \(cited in Bell 1996, 3\).  
The airport authority noted that this expected revenue would help pay for the five mil-  
lion dollars spent on artworks, which was two percent of the International Terminal’s  
250-million-dollar development costs \(Vancouver Sun 1994\). The airport’s planners  
chose a specific type of artwork to create their desired “ambiance.” They installed  
Northwest Coast First Nations artworks since they believed that these pieces would  
give the terminal a “sense of place,” and they argued that this evocation of a place-  
based identity would lead to higher spending in the terminal. In Chapter 5, I discuss  
the rationale behind this expectation in greater detail.  
YVR is a remarkable example in terms of airport artworks since its architects designed  
the International Terminal’s interior based on where these types of sculptural works would  
be placed. The VIAA purchased Reid’s The Jade Canoe three years before the terminal  
opened in 1996 \(Globe and Mail 1993\). Throughout the design process, the VIAA and  
the architects deliberated on where they would place this 6.05-metre-long, 3.48-metre-  
wide, and 3.89-metre-high bronze cast. In a watercolour from 1994, Rudy Kovach  
depicted The Jade Canoe as a central focal point in the terminal’s airside \(Figure 3.9\).20 It  
appears as though it is in the orchestra of a theatre-like space. A semi-circular arrange-  
ment of steps surrounding the monumental work leads upward to a food court area,  
and the sculpture is situated in front of a floor-to-ceiling glass wall that offers views  
of the coastal mountains. The VIAA ultimately decided to place the sculpture in the  
terminal’s landside on the departures level, since this is a publicly accessible area and  
more people can see the work \(Figure 3.10\).  
Yet, this required a design solution that would obscure the south-facing view of the  
glass wall behind it, as it looked out onto the parking and roadway, but still allowed  
light to shine in on the sculpture. They commissioned Lutz Haufschild to create a  
forty-metre-wide and ten-metre-tall glass mural \(O’Neill 1998\). The planners’ discus-  
sion regarding the mural’s imagery included Reid, who preferred a reference to the  
ocean environment that a Haida canoe would be situated in. These canoes, which  
were used traditionally to travel from Haida Gwaii to the British Columbia mainland,  
often encountered stormy seas in Hecate Strait. Haufschild attempted to capture the  
intensity of its crashing waves and modelled the mural after Hokusai’s famous early-  
1830s woodblock print, The Great Wave off Kanagawa.  
Waisman Dewar Grout Carter Inc.’s final design for the interior space surrounding  
Reid’s sculpture resembles Kovach’s illustration from 1994. The area surrounding the  
work is designed as a place where people can sit before passing through security or  
while waiting for friends and family to arrive \(see Plate 1\). Furthermore, The Jade  
Canoe is an eye-catching object in the terminal due to its shimmering reflective sur-  
face, and it appears to operate as an effective landmark. During my visits to the ter-  
minal, I observed that there is almost always someone engaging with the work; many  
of whom are passers-by who stop to photograph or be photographed with the work. Figure 3.9 Rudy Kovach, Sketch of the International Terminal’s Interior and Bill Reid’s The

In the International Terminal’s airside, planners have deployed artworks as well as  
pseudo-naturalistic settings that mimic British Columbia’s wilderness to draw passen-  
gers to consumer spaces \(see Plate 21\). The west post-security chevron, an expansion  
which opened in 2007, includes a stream flowing through a manufactured rocky chan-  
nel in the food court \(SkyTalk 2007a, 2007b\).21 A 114,000-litre saltwater aquarium  
containing marine life indigenous to British Columbia’s coast is located at the end of  
the creek.22 Situated directly above the tank’s glass pane is Orca Chief and the Kelp  
Forest, an installation consisting of Haisla artist Lyle Wilson’s formline representation  
of the Orca Chief and John Nutter’s ‘forest’ of etched glass panels. The food court’s  
tables and chairs flank this ‘supernatural’ scene, and restaurants, cafés, and shops  
circle its periphery.23  
YVR has also placed Northwest Coast First Nations artworks as guides for way-  
finding in its Domestic Terminal, and some of these are situated next to shops and  
restaurants. Marianne Nicolson’s The Rivers Monument, which was installed in the  
airside in 2015, is adjacent to a clothing store and a small shop that sells books,  
travel accessories, snacks, and beverages \(Figure 3.11\). The piece consists of two  
8.57-metre-tall blue glass-etched poles with carved cedar eagles balanced on their  
peaks \(YVR n.d.\). Like Steve Smith’s Freedom to Move, it was placed at a key  
intersection. The Rivers Monument is located immediately beyond the pre-boarding  
security and between the A-gates and B-gates. It too sits upon a podium and is sur-  
rounded by an oval-shaped concrete base with wood bench seating. The podium  
supporting Freedom to Move’s cedar panels has a slightly different shape \(see  
Plate 13\). It is in the shape of a boat’s hull and appears to float in a body of water  
encased by the raised concrete pool. The informational panel accompanying Free-  
dom to Move notes that it refers to how the region’s Northwest Coast First Nations  
people would travel by canoe and that “\[f\]or them, travel was as much about the  
journey as it was about the destination.” The panel explains that the artwork  
“encourages travellers to slow down, contemplate and acknowledge their surround-  
ings in order to experience a change of pace both physically and spiritually.” This  
recommendation for passengers to be aware of “their surroundings” is notable as  
the artwork is situated only a few metres away from an Absolute Spa as well as other  
shops and restaurants.  
Shielding the Passenger From the Spectacle\: Richard Serra’s  
Tilted Spheres  
Richard Serra’s Tilted Spheres at Toronto Pearson’s Terminal 1 is comparable to Time  
Tower as it is placed at the centre of a commercial area containing luxury retailers  
\(Figure 3.12\). The 4.35-metre-tall and 13.86-metre-long sculpture also draws passen-  
gers towards the shops, but its interior offers an escape from the sights and sounds of  
the surrounding commercial space. Like Reid’s The Jade Canoe at YVR, it is a flag-  
ship artwork by a well-known artist and commissioned during the building’s planning  
phase \(Milroy 2003\). The GTAA commissioned Serra’s work for a 84,500-square-  
metre expansion that opened in 2006 and services flights to international locations  
\(Mississauga News 2006\). The pier, which is a long finger extending from the main  
terminal building, is capped with a semi-circular “hammerhead” at its south end.  
Tilted Spheres is at the end of the finger in the centre of the hammerhead. Cranes 98 Artworks for Wayfinding and Commerce  
Figure 3.12 Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2018\).  
Richard Serra, Tilted Spheres, Toronto Pearson International Airport, Canada, 2004.  
lowered the fifty-millimetre-thick metal plates onto the foundation before the ter-  
minal’s walls and ceiling were built \(Adams 2005\). When the hammerhead expan-  
sion was revealed to the public in 2006, Safdie championed Serra’s sculpture “for the  
sense of geometry and motion it creates” \(Mississauga News 2006, 1\). Indeed, Tilted  
Spheres mirrors Safdie’s architectural design for the terminal—the hammerhead’s ceil-  
ing, skylights, and south-facing glass-curtain wall have a related curvilinear design.  
Like The Jade Canoe, Tilted Spheres is integrated with the terminal’s architecture. In  
the former case, architects created an interior design in response to Reid’s sculpture.  
In the latter case, Serra’s work not only corresponds with the terminal’s interior design  
but also with the hammerhead’s footprint and external structure.  
All non-US-bound international flights depart from gates in the pier’s hammerhead—  
they are designated with the letter “E.” The F-gates, which are along the corridor  
leading to the hammerhead, only service US-bound flights. In addition, there are some  
US-bound flights that depart from the E-gates in the hammerhead. The pier is designed  
to separate passengers departing from the E- and F-gates. Those departing from the  
hammerhead are directed along a passageway a storey above the corridor that services  
the F-gates for US-bound flights. This passageway ends with stairs and escalators lead-  
ing down to the hammerhead’s central space. Passengers entering this area encounter  
a decision point with three possible routes\: a central trajectory that passes through or  
around Serra’s Tilted Spheres, a route to the left that passes through a duty-free store, Artworks for Wayfinding and Commerce 99  
or one to the right that passes along a number of shops and through a food court.  
The duty-free store contains a serpentine path equivalent to those found in the walk-  
through shops at Stansted, Gatwick, and YVR. Passengers walking through Tilted  
Spheres also move along a curvilinear path if they choose to enter the narrow spaces  
between the work’s torqued metal plates. But, this serpentine pathway is devoid of the  
spectacular imagery of products, logos, advertisements, and shop displays.  
Serra’s Tilted Spheres replicates the other steel plate artworks for which he is well  
known. Variations of this type appear at numerous galleries across the world includ-  
ing the Seattle Art Museum’s Olympic Sculpture Park and the Guggenheim Museum  
in Bilbao. Though, this work is remarkable since it appears to operate in the same dis-  
ruptive spirit as his infamous Tilted Arc placed in Federal Plaza in New York in 1981.  
A number of the workers who frequented the square disliked the 36.5-metre-long  
curved wall because it obstructed their path and view, and they successfully lobbied  
to have it removed \(Deutsche 1992; Levine 2002\). Serra’s subsequent appeal and the  
work’s ultimate removal in 1989 generated a fervent controversy among artists and  
elicited discussions regarding copyright.  
In this respect, Serra’s Tilted Spheres is an odd choice for an air terminal. Usu-  
ally, planners do not select artworks that hinder one’s view of the terminal’s shops  
or signage. Instead, they install works like The Jade Canoe and Time Tower, which  
invite people to linger in spaces with clear views of the surrounding shops and restau-  
rants. While some passengers may be drawn to the shops that surround Serra’s Tilted  
Spheres, others may find a tranquil space within the work that shields them from the  
sensory experience that one typically encounters in the terminal’s consumer spaces.  
In addition, Tilted Spheres prevents travellers from seeing flight information screens,  
signs indicating gates, or a clear view of the apron. However, the skylights above are  
visible from within the work. As noted in the previous chapter, Safdie included these  
in the ceiling’s design to orient passengers in the terminal.  
Conclusion  
In many of today’s airports, air terminal artworks serve more than simply a decorative  
purpose. Some architects and planners expect these works to operate as landmarks  
for orientation and as material things that draw passengers towards consumer spaces.  
They consider these pieces in terms of their materiality, and they assume that these  
works operate as active agents that impact the travellers’ actions. The expectation that  
artworks can function as guides for wayfinding is most clearly expressed at Amster-  
dam’s Schiphol, Vancouver’s YVR, and Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi. These airports  
include eye-catching pieces as icons on their terminals’ maps. Like the ceiling designs  
discussed in Chapter 2, these pieces are defined by a functional aesthetic with regard  
to their wayfinding purpose; these installations operate on a visual register, and they  
need to look fit for their function as conspicuous markers for navigation.  
My attention to artworks in this chapter also addressed how planners expect them  
to stimulate the passengers’ desire to buy food and goods. Even though we cannot  
confirm whether artworks actually perform this purpose, planners at airports such as  
Schiphol, YVR, Toronto Pearson, San Francisco International, and Los Angeles’s Tom  
Bradley International Terminal have installed artworks to create an appealing atmos-  
phere which they hope will encourage travellers to spend. Reid’s The Jade Canoe and  
Serra’s Tilted Spheres are striking examples of air terminal artworks since YVR’s and 100 Artworks for Wayfinding and Commerce  
Pearson’s architects designed the terminals in response to where these pieces would  
be placed in the interior. At both YVR and Pearson, architects surrounded these  
monumental sculptures with commercial operations. The theatre-like space adjacent  
to Reid’s The Jade Canoe offers people a place to sit, and their attention can move  
between the shimmering piece before them and the colourful shopfronts and restau-  
rant logos in the immediate vicinity. Serra’s Tilted Spheres offers a markedly different  
experience. Its interior is a space where passengers can briefly escape the surrounding  
consumer environment.  
This chapter has concentrated on how air terminal artworks are material objects  
that operate as landmarks for navigation or as things that encourage travellers to  
move towards or gather within consumer spaces. The following chapters examine air  
terminal artworks with regard to their representational and symbolic content and how  
this can affect passengers’ moods.  
Notes  
1\. NACO’s architects, as discussed in Chapter 1, aim to include clear sightlines of the apron  
when they are planning the air terminal’s layout. Like Mijksenaar’s designers, they believe  
that a view of aircraft on the tarmac helps with one’s orientation in the terminal.  
2\. Thompson, Berwick, and Pratt’s design for Vancouver’s terminal has changed remarkably  
since it began operating in 1968 \(McGrath 1992\). After the new International Terminal  
opened in 1996, the building became the airport’s Domestic Terminal.  
3\. Bangkok Suvarnabhumi’s terminal contains ca. 560,000 square metres of floor area,  
slightly less than the combined floor area of HKIA’s Terminal 1 and 2 \(Dixon 2007; Jahn  
et al. 2007\).  
4\. My translation from the original text in Dutch\: “Elk plein heeft een kunstwerk nodig, een  
ontmoetingsplek, een dorpspomp”; and “Dan moet commercie wijken voor functionaliteit.”  
5\. A Synergy of Dynamic Energy was suspended from the ceiling in the western side of the  
terminal where the concourse branches into its angled north and south wings.  
6\. Northland’s design included sculptural works such as Lily Saarinen’s Great Lakes Group,  
Gwen Lux’s Birds of Flight, and Arthur Kraft’s Turtle \(Gruen and Smith 1960\).  
7\. A copy of this publication is held at Benthem Crouwel Architects’ office in Amsterdam.  
8\. For an overview of artworks installed prior to 2000, see Schiphol Group’s \(n.d.\) Kunst  
op Schiphol \(a copy of this publication is held at Benthem Crouwel Architects’ office in  
Amsterdam\). The airport’s website also lists some information regarding its artworks  
\(Schiphol Group 2019a, 2019b\).  
9\. Rustcloud is currently hanging in the lounge in the Schengen area that leads to the B-, C-,  
and D-piers.  
10\. The gallery includes paintings that are permanently on display as well as temporary exhibi-  
tions of paintings from the Rijksmuseum’s collection, which are changed regularly so that  
frequent visitors have the opportunity to see different artworks by seventeenth-century  
Dutch artists \(Koster 2002\).  
11\. For the Schiphol Group, the satellite gallery was part of its mission to create an AirportCity,  
which was conceived as “a dynamic junction where people and worlds meet each other”  
\(de Haan 2002, 10\). My translation from the original text in Dutch\: “een dynamisch  
knooppunt waar mensen en werelden elkaar ontmoeten.”  
12\. The airport’s website includes a map indicating where these works are located, and it  
provides detailed information regarding each work’s dimensions, materials, subject matter,  
and the artist’s intent \(San Francisco International Airport n.d.c\).  
13\. The American Alliance of Museums accredited SFO Museum in 1999. It was the first  
museum in an airport accredited by the organization \(San Francisco International Airport  
n.d.a\). The airport also contains the San Francisco Airport Commission Aviation Library  
and Louis A. Turpen Aviation Museum. It exhibits and maintains a permanent collection  
of media pertaining to commercial aviation. Artworks for Wayfinding and Commerce 101  
14\. 15. Turpen resigned five months after the terminal reopened \(Bloom 2004\).  
From March 10 to November 4, 2018, passengers encountered an exhibition on the history  
of radio. At the end of the corridor, the museum provided a four-page gallery guide that  
unfolds into a poster \(SFO Museum 2018\).  
16\. The plan also called for artworks integrated into the terminal’s glass façade and the land-  
side departures area \(San Francisco Arts Commission 2011\). Norie Sato’s Air Over Under  
is above the terminal’s entrance, and Kendall Buster’s Topograph hangs from the ceiling  
near a Starbucks café and the queue leading to the pre-boarding security zone. The allo-  
cated budget for artworks also paid for Walter Kitundu’s and Charles Sowers’s interactive  
artworks for the children’s play areas.  
17\. Every Beating Second consists of a pattern designed for the terrazzo flooring as well. The  
shaded areas under the work outline the shadows that the three sets of webbing cast during  
the summer solstice \(Janet Echelman n.d.\).  
18\. Schiphol has also installed a video work that functions as a clock. Maarten Baas’s Real  
Time, located in Lounge 2 on the airside, is a three-metre-wide cubic structure with a round  
video screen that depicts a clock with minute and hour hands. Like Time Tower, a human  
resides in the clock and is responsible for relaying the actual time. A diffused image of a  
worker is visible behind the clock’s translucent face. For each passing minute, the worker  
wipes away and repaints the clock’s minute hand. The hour hand is repainted on the hour.  
19\. This work resembles the types of dynamic architectural designs that act as an interface with  
users and transform in response to their actions \(Taylor 2018\).  
20\. Waisman Dewar Grout Carter Inc. hired Rudy Kovach, a partner with the interior design  
firm Hopping Kovach Grinnell, to sketch the terminal’s interior during the planning phase  
\(Clive Grout, email messages to author, April 18, 2017, and May 12, 2017\). Kovach’s  
sketch of The Jade Canoe appears in SkyTalk \(1994\) and Odam \(1994\).  
21\. This expansion included four additional gates. The VIAA retained the same architectural  
firm \(which was renamed Stantec\) that had designed the International Terminal. The nature  
theme also extended to the design of the light fixtures; their shape and scattered arrange-  
ment is intended to allude to the log jams found in many of British Columbia’s rivers \(Berg  
2007\). Larry Berg, the VIAA’s President and Chief Executive Officer, noted that this refer-  
ence is a “tribute to the key role the forestry industry has played in the development of our  
province” \(2007, 3\).  
22\. Staff from the Vancouver Aquarium maintain the tank.  
23\. In its advertisements to attract tourism, British Columbia has branded itself as “Super,  
Natural British Columbia” since 1978 \(Allen 2007\). The imagery in these ads predomi-  
nately feature photographs of the ocean, mountains, forests, and wildlife.

# Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control  
The preceding chapter discussed why Gensler, the San Francisco Arts Commission, and  
airport staff decided to hang Janet Echelman’s Every Beating Second above the space  
immediately following the pre-boarding security area at San Francisco International’s  
Terminal 2 \(see Plate 19\). This space is named the ‘Recompose’ area, and Echelman’s  
work is intended to calm travellers before they carry onwards. This supports a pri-  
mary aim for air terminal designers since they believe that a relaxed and unstressed  
passenger is more likely to spend. This chapter considers how these types of artworks  
have the capacity to affect travellers’ moods. Its analysis differs from those in Chap-  
ters 2 and 3. The former chapters concentrate on how air terminal interior design and  
artworks operate as material things that mediate passengers’ actions; in this chapter,  
I examine how an artwork’s representational and symbolic content has the capacity to  
affect passenger behaviour. My investigation, however, does not account for all of the  
possible affective states an artwork can generate; I concentrate on the meanings and  
feelings that airport planners expect these works to stimulate within the passenger. My  
investigation of these intended affective states illustrates how planners try to create a  
specific ambiance within the terminal and why they believe that this leads to increased  
spending.  
My analysis of these artworks draws upon a number of theoretical texts concerning  
affect, including Peter Adey’s investigations of this topic with respect to air terminal  
design. I begin by outlining what affect is, and I examine artworks placed near security  
zones such as Every Beating Second to establish how art can operate on an affective  
register. I then turn my attention to works that convey themes of movement. In many  
cases, these artworks signify a relatively unrestricted type of motion that contrasts  
with the regulated movement that defines commercial flight. I consider how these art-  
works are able to affect passengers and elicit kinaesthesia, the sensation of movement,  
and whether they are installed for functional purposes.  
Richard Wilson’s Slipstream at Heathrow Terminal 2 depicts the trajectory of a  
small stunt plane, and it clearly stimulates ideas of kinaesthesia and flight \(Figure  
I.3\). I argue that its capacity to induce bodily sensations of movement is a type of  
aesthetic. In company with Susan Buck-Morss, I am looking to the Ancient Greek defi-  
nition of aisth*ē*tikos, which means “perceptive by feeling” \(cited in Kester 1997, 43\).  
This conception, which situates aesthetic experiences on the same register as physi-  
ological sensations, has informed other theories such as Edmund Burke’s writing on  
the sublime \(Ryan 2001\). This type of aesthetic differs from the functional aesthetic  
explored in the last two chapters which concerns a cognitive understanding of the air  
terminal’s operation. It concerns a proximal sense—kinaesthesia, the bodily pleasure Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control 105  
of movement. Artworks that stimulate this aesthetic experience potentially contribute  
to the airport’s function; some planners expect that movement-themed installations  
will buoy the passenger’s mood which, as noted, correlates with an increased desire  
to spend.  
While I primarily discuss static artworks that represent themes of movement, I also  
examine a few kinetic artworks. Their moving components, however, do not turn,  
sway, or swing in an uncontrolled fashion; instead, they are often synchronized to cre-  
ate harmonious flowing patterns. I contend that these works similarly evoke a sense  
of kinaesthesia that contrasts with the actual movement experienced in the terminal.  
Most air terminal artworks divert the traveller’s attention away from how the air-  
port is filtering and processing them into highly ordered flows. Nevertheless, there are  
a few exceptions. This chapter’s last section considers a few artworks that point to  
the technologies and processes used to facilitate passenger movement. It concentrates  
on a series of artworks installed at Schiphol in 1995 that critically reflect upon the  
experiential aspects of moving through the terminal. I argue that these works not only  
deviate from the usual types of works installed in airports but that they also critique  
the functions that air terminal installations are expected to serve. When viewed in  
contrast to the array of airport artworks, Dennis Adams’s Coda, Jenny Holzer’s Unti-  
tled, Niek Kemps’s Closed View, and Marc Ruygrok’s So go on offer a critical inter-  
pretation of why artworks are installed in the terminal and how they are expected to  
contribute to the airport’s operations.  
What Is Affect?  
The last chapter examined how artworks such as Bill Reid’s Spirit of Haida Gwaii\:  
The Jade Canoe and Dennis Adams’s Coda operate as material things that encourage  
people to move towards them or notice them as eye-catching landmarks \(see Plates 1  
and 6\). This chapter and the following chapter concentrate on what these pieces rep-  
resent and how planners believe that these works’ meanings will affect passengers’  
moods. I rely on theories of affect to consider how these works can evoke particular  
feelings.  
Affect is an elusive concept and difficult to define \(Gregg and Seigworth 2010\). In a  
general sense, the term connotes emotions such as shame, fear, joy, happiness, anger,  
sadness, and jealousy. Nigel Thrift defines affect as a “sense of a push in the world,”  
and he theorizes how urban spaces are designed to operate on an affective register  
\(2004, 64\). His notion of affect is informed by Baruch Spinoza’s affectus and Brian  
Massumi’s \(2002\) theoretical investigation into this concept.1 Spinoza’s monist philos-  
ophy was a reaction to René Descartes’s dualistic philosophy that separated the body,  
part of physical and geometrically defined space, from the mind, which was defined  
by conscious thought. Spinoza postulated that human beings and all objects in the  
universe were composed of the same substance. Unlike the Cartesian mind divorced  
from corporeality, the thinking being for Spinoza is embedded within the materiality  
of the body. Spinoza’s monist definition of affect argues that it is an interaction which  
causes the body and the mind to act.  
Gilles Deleuze’s interpretation of Spinoza’s affectus as a connection that flows  
within and between human and non-human bodies informs Thrift’s theory as well as  
other “affectual geographies” \(Anderson 2006; McCormack 2008; Pile 2010\). Draw-  
ing largely from Massumi’s interpretation of Deleuze’s thoughts on Spinoza, Anderson 106 Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control  
notes that affect is a “transpersonal capacity” that allows a body to be affected and to  
affect other bodies \(2006, 735; italics in original\). This capacity is defined by a move-  
ment situated between entities. Feelings are a corporeal experience of this movement;  
they are a response to flows of affect and are expressed as “proprioceptive and visceral  
shifts” in the body \(Anderson 2006, 736\). Emotions are a personal and subjective  
response to feelings and defined by an individual’s social context. Linguistic expres-  
sions and conscious thoughts are part of the emotional register, while feelings are the  
corporeal expressions such as an increase in bodily heat and the skin’s flushing. My  
analysis considers an idea of affect that accounts for multiple experiences in the termi-  
nal’s spaces. For instance, it considers how material designs that incorporate flowing  
water can calm passengers as well as how aviation and movement-themed imagery can  
generate sensations of kinaesthesia.  
‘Affectual geographies,’ like Thrift’s spatial politics of affect, have been criticized  
as universalizing and deterministic theories that do not account for difference and  
diversity \(Tolia-Kelly 2006\). These criticisms partly result from a notion of affect that  
is synonymous with feeling and emotion. Divya P. Tolia-Kelly charges that “affectual  
geographies” define emotion as “intrinsically embedded in universalist thought rather  
than the geopolitical landscape that constitutes our universal political life” \(2006,  
213\). Her criticism is significant because emotion defined as a “trans-personal” push,  
which is experienced equivocally by all individuals, universalizes how every person  
will respond to a particular stimulus.2 Thrift’s \(2004\) article, which she critiques, uses  
affect, emotion, and feeling interchangeably, and it is difficult to determine how and  
on which register they are operating.3 This is not the case in other geographers’ con-  
siderations of the topic. For instance, Anderson \(2006\) clarifies the difference between  
these three terms.4 He reiterates that emotion is subjective, and he adds that affect  
does not directly determine bodily expressions\: “The relationship between the circula-  
tion and distribution of affects and signification is not, therefore, one of conformity or  
correspondence, but one of resonation or interference” \(Anderson 2009, 9\).  
My analysis does not conflate affect with feeling and emotion. It relies on Ander-  
son’s more strict interpretation of affect\: affect is the capacity to affect or be affected;  
feeling is on a separate register defined by bodily fluctuations that are reacting to the  
flows of affect; and emotion is the conscious expression of feelings. I argue that an  
air terminal artwork’s capacity to affect a viewer is a universal quality, but I am not  
arguing that an artwork has the capacity to provoke the same feelings and emotions  
for every traveller. Nor am I arguing that an installation will repeatedly spur the same  
feelings and emotions each time an individual is affected by the work in question. For  
example, Echelman’s Every Beating Second has the capacity to affect all passengers,  
but the feelings and emotions felt while viewing this installation is different for each  
passenger, and these can change for each passenger over time \(see Plate 19\). We can  
ascertain the variation of these responses based on a series of interviews with travellers  
shortly after the piece was unveiled.5 For some, the suspended work gives a sense of  
freedom or being uplifted. For others, it calls to mind San Francisco’s reputation as a  
welcoming and diverse community.  
Even though artworks have the potential to evoke a range of affective responses,  
my analysis in this chapter and the following chapter concentrates largely on the types  
of feelings and meanings that airport planners expect air terminal artworks to evoke  
among the passengers that view them. Indeed, this does not point to the actual effect  
on travellers; but it does address the planners’ and architects’ rationale for installing Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control 107  
these types of works and why they believe that these installations will affect passen-  
gers’ behaviour.  
Affecting Passengers’ Moods With Air Terminal Design  
Adey \(2008\) theorizes how spatial orderings and materials in air terminals might impact  
travellers on a pre-cognitive affective register.6 He investigates how some designs,  
which are based on predicted pre-cognitive responses, are intended to trigger specific  
affects. This does not imply that passengers’ behaviour is determined by airport archi-  
tecture; a terminal’s design affects passengers in variable ways and inspires a multitude  
of contingent responses. He illustrates how planners design commercial spaces with  
the intent of spurring feelings and emotions of joy and excitement. In his study of air-  
port architecture and passenger behaviour conducted during 2003 and 2004, he found  
that airport authorities were trying to increase retail spending to offset profit losses  
due to changes in ownership and a surge in low-cost airlines. Drawing from numer-  
ous studies of consumer behaviour, planners were designing terminal spaces with the  
intent to reduce anxiety and induce feelings associated with higher spending. These  
strategies also included trying to entice passengers to move towards shopping spaces.  
In one airport, which Adey does not name, designers thought that a limestone-tile  
floor’s reflected ambient light would have a positive effect on travellers and encourage  
them to wander past the shops and restaurants. The shopping areas contrast with the  
security spaces. They tend to have lower ceilings, fewer windows, and the paint and  
carpets are usually less colourful. These drab interiors and closed spaces are intended  
to prompt melancholic emotions and to evoke a sense of being controlled—a feeling  
reinforced by the security barriers that limit passengers’ movements.  
As noted, Every Beating Second is intended to improve passengers’ moods once  
they exit the pre-boarding security. The Transportation Security Administration \(TSA\)  
screening zone that precedes the Recompose area with Echelman’s work is similar to  
those described in Adey’s \(2008\) analysis; it has a low ceiling and subdued colour-  
ing. Like Every Beating Second, Daan Roosegaarde’s Beyond at Amsterdam Airport  
Schiphol is adjacent to a pre-boarding screening area \(Figure 4.1\). The one-hundred-  
and-twelve-metre wall panel, installed in Departure Hall 3 in 2016, runs along a corridor  
and two escalators that lead to the screening zone upstairs. Only those with a board-  
ing pass can enter this space. The installation, which Roosegaarde modelled after Dutch  
seventeenth-century landscape paintings, projects a shimmering skyscape with scattered  
clouds that seem to subtly move and change shape \(Studio Roosegaarde n.d.\). The ten-  
centimetre-thick wall contains LED lights and printed lenses that render an illusion where  
the sky has depth, and it appears as though the clouds move as one walks past the work.  
Beyond offers some visual stimulus in what would have otherwise been a bland corridor,  
and its content elicits a sense that one is drifting through the skies above.  
Like Beyond, Ingo Maurer’s Earthbound . . . Unbound at Toronto Pearson’s Termi-  
nal 1 conveys a sense of floating in a peaceful space which contrasts with the surround-  
ing busy environment \(see Plate 22\). This aquarium, containing transparent cubes that  
swirl and glide through blue water, was intended to alleviate passenger anxiety when  
the Greater Toronto Airports Authority installed it in 2004. They placed it next to  
the queue for the E-gates’ pre-boarding security. At the time of the terminal’s open-  
ing, the airport authority’s general manager of design, Sam Dewairy, noted\: “Ingo’s  
idea is to give peace and tranquility to the passengers as they rush about” \(cited in 108 Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control  
Figure 4.1 Daan Roosegaarde, Beyond, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Netherlands, 2016.  
Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2018\).  
Hiller 2004, 4\). Like the seven other works commissioned for the new Moshe Safdie-  
designed terminal, Maurer’s work is intended to convey “the essence of flight in a con-  
ceptual, abstract or realistic manner” \(Greater Toronto Airports Authority n.d., 1\).7  
While the slowly swirling transparent cubes loosely recall aerial imagery such as hot  
air balloons in the sky, one cannot mistake them for anything but objects being gently  
pushed around by the water’s currents.  
Water is generally considered an appealing feature in natural and built environments  
\(R. Kaplan and S. Kaplan 1989\). Placing an installation with water next to a security  
zone is likely an effective strategy to de-stress passengers since it is known to stimulate  
a positive emotional response \(White et al. 2010\). The Musqueam Welcome Area in  
Vancouver’s International Terminal, which travellers encounter on their way to the  
border screening area, includes rushing water that runs down the face of a granite  
wall and along two channels beside a set of stairs and escalators \(Figure 4.2\). Unlike  
the fluid in Maurer’s aquarium, this installation’s moving water is sensed visually as  
well as aurally. Passengers see and hear the rushing water as they walk towards the  
screening area. The following chapter examines this installation’s Northwest Coast  
First Nations artworks and their political significance with regard to their location in  
the terminal.  
At Dubai International’s Terminal 3, planners have installed a similar type of water  
wall adjacent to its security zones \(Figure 4.3\). Arriving passengers encounter the wall Figure 4.2 Susan A. Point, Krista Point, Robyn Sparrow, Debra Sparrow, Gina Grant, and

en route to the border screening area, and departing passengers pass by the work  
upon exiting the pre-boarding security. This extensive water wall and fountain is situ-  
ated behind a set of elevators with an unclad support structure that does not block  
the pacifying sound of the falling water. The space in front of the elevators on the  
lowest level is divided by a glass wall in order to separate the arriving and departing  
passenger flows. Arriving international travellers must descend to the lowest level to  
pass through passport control and customs. Departing travellers enter the space on  
the lowest level after having cleared security. The elevators and an adjacent escalator  
lead to the Terminal’s B- and C-gates. Passengers must take a train from here to access  
the A-gates.  
Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Movement-Themed Artworks  
Adey \(2008\) argues that notions of affect need to consider mobility since feelings and  
emotions both impact and are impacted by bodily movements. He relies on Massu-  
mi’s argument that movement and feeling are inseparable and that moving bodies are  
always feeling, and feeling bodies are always moving. Thrift \(2007\) also notes that  
theorists writing about affect need to consider how bodily movements affect emo-  
tions and feelings. Adey illustrates that this topic is relevant to contemporary design;  
airport architects account for this intertwined nature of affect and mobility, and they  
use it as a strategy to encourage specific responses to the space. Like Adey’s analysis,  
my investigation assumes that passengers’ feelings and behaviours are affected by the  
way they move through these carefully designed interiors. This assumption pertains to  
the functional aesthetic that I explored in the last two chapters, which considered how  
air terminal design organizes passenger traffic. For instance, a glass-walled and high-  
ceilinged open concourse that gives a clear sense of directional flow causes less anxiety  
than a terminal consisting of low-ceilinged artificially lit corridors that feel like a maze.  
In the preceding section, I discussed how planners place artworks near security  
zones to calm travellers’ nerves. In this respect, my analysis of these artworks follows  
a similar tack to Adey’s \(2008\) consideration of how air terminals are designed to  
elicit specific affects. My assessment of movement-themed artworks, however, departs  
from his theoretical considerations of affect and mobility in the terminal since I con-  
sider an inverse relationship between affect and movement. Moreover, my analysis  
of artworks that convey movement examines how they induce kinaesthetic sensa-  
tions. Rather than considering how passengers are affected by the regulation of their  
movement in the terminal, I investigate how an artwork’s representational content can  
stimulate sensations of movement.  
My analysis of this affective response concentrates on artworks such as Jonathan  
Borofsky’s I Dreamed I Could Fly \(Figure 4.4\).8 The work’s five figures were sus-  
pended below a large round skylight in the ceiling at Toronto Pearson’s Terminal  
1 when it opened in 2004. Sadly, it has been removed. Each figure was made of  
aluminium and Lexan, a translucent polymer, and was differently coloured\: green,  
yellow, red, orange, and blue. Their arms and legs were outstretched, and these  
figures gave the impression that they could either fly through the oculus above or  
swoop through the terminal’s vast spaces. Like Echelman’s Every Beating Second,  
Roosegaarde’s Beyond, and Maurer’s Earthbound . . . Unbound, this work was  
situated next to a screening area. Passengers departing from the terminal’s D-gates  
encountered I Dreamed I Could Fly upon exiting the pre-boarding security zone. Figure 4.4 Jonathan Borofsky, I Dreamed I Could Fly, Toronto Pearson International Airport,

After passing through a zigzagging pathway formed by rows of retractable cor-  
don barriers and having security personnel check their travel documents, bodies,  
and luggage, travellers were directed to escalators where they had an unobstructed  
view of Borofsky’s five figures flying freely in the concourse’s expansive space. This  
.  
representation of unrestricted movement clearly contrasts with their experience of  
passing through the screening area. It also differs markedly from the experience of  
flying commercially—passengers typically spend their time aboard an airliner con-  
fined and buckled into their allotted seat.

I argue that these types of movement-themed works operate on an affective register  
to elicit sensations of kinaesthesia. I draw upon the aforementioned definitions of  
affect as well as Sigmund Freud’s conception of the term. With respect to psycho-  
therapy, he describes affect as an electric charge that covers the surface of a memory.  
Freud writes,  
the concept that in mental functions something is to be distinguished—a quota of  
affect or sum of excitation—which possesses all the characteristics of a quantity  
\(though we have no means of measuring it\), which is capable of increase, diminu-  
tion, displacement, and discharge, and which is spread over the memory-traces of  
ideas somewhat as an electric charge is spread over the surface of a body.  
\(cited in Green 1999, 15\)10  
This definition illustrates how a recalled experience of movement can elicit sensations  
associated with the actual movement. For example, a recollection of free-falling when  
jumping from a diving board is loaded with a type of energy that is comparable to what  
is felt during the actual experience of this kinaesthesia. This type of electric charge also  
accompanies imagined experiences of movement such as flight simulation video games  
played from the pilot’s point of view. This affective quality of virtual kinaesthesia is per-  
haps most amplified during dreams of flight—an experience that Borofsky recreates in  
I Dreamed I Could Fly. Indeed, this installation as well as other movement-themed art-  
works draw our attention to our experiences of kinaesthesia, whether real or imagined,  
and bring forth a “sum of excitation” associated with these experiences.  
Aerial-Themed Imagery\: Signifying Flight and Eliciting Kinaesthesia  
I Dreamed I Could Fly conveys a human experience of flight without the aid of wings  
or jet turbines. It is an exception among aerial-themed air terminal artworks since  
most convey non-human things such as winged aircraft and birds. For instance, Ber-  
nard Séguin-Poirier’s Si j’avais des ailes \(If I had Wings\), installed at Montreal’s Pierre  
Elliott Trudeau International in 2008, is a mobile in the shape of an airplane con-  
structed out of painted panels and thin metal tubing \(Figure 4.5\).11 It is suspended in  
the pre-security departures area adjacent to the check-in counters.  
My aforementioned assessment of I Dreamed I Could Fly considered how a direct  
representation of human movement arouses sensations of kinaesthesia. How can a  
depiction of an aircraft such as Si j’avais des ailes \(If I had Wings\) instigate the same  
type of response? I contend that a theoretical framework based on Charles Sand-  
ers Peirce’s semiotics offers a way of understanding how representations of flying  
machines can stir sensations of movement. Unlike Ferdinand de Saussure’s semiol-  
ogy, Peirce’s semiotics transcends the rigid conception of spirit and matter, ideas and 114 Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control

things, and subject and object as separate entities occupying two unbridgeable spheres  
\(Gottdiener 1995; Keane 2005\).12 Even though post-structuralists such as Jacques  
Derrida, Jean Baudrillard, and Roland Barthes have deconstructed many of the under-  
lying assumptions of Saussure’s structuralism, these theorists have all maintained this Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control 115  
dualistic split and retained the sign within the realm of ideas and outside of matter.  
Peirce’s pragmatic theory addresses how the actual object a sign refers to affects the  
sign’s overall meaning. Saussure’s notion of the sign, consisting of a signifier and a sig-  
nified, pertains to the vehicle that transmits the sign \(the signifier\) and the concept it  
prompts in the mind of the receiver \(the signified\). Peirce, on the other hand, analyzes  
a sign in terms of\: the “representamen,” the means by which the sign is conveyed; the  
“interpretant,” the idea that the receiver uses cognitively to understand the sign; and  
the actual material object the sign is referring to. While Saussure was primarily con-  
cerned with how the relations and differences between signs informed the structures of  
systems of signification, Peirce sought to examine the logic of sign systems—namely,  
how language transmits information, and its possibilities for conveying truth claims.  
Peirce’s semiotics classifies signs into a number of categories depending on the  
characteristics of the object, representamen, and intepretant \(Gottdiener 1995; Atkin  
2010\). My analysis considers only one of his triadic classifications of signs\: the sym-  
bol, the icon, and the index. Peirce notes that the first is “a sign which would lose the  
character which renders it a sign if there was no interpretant” \(cited in Gottdiener  
1995, 12\). A symbol’s meaning, such as the written word ‘cat,’ is determined by cul-  
ture and social relations, and this meaning can only be ascertained by individuals with  
access to this cultural and social knowledge. An icon resembles the object it repre-  
sents. The spoken word ‘meow’ is an iconic representation of the sound of a cat, and  
an image of a lit cigarette with a red circle inscribed around it and a red straight line  
drawn through the diameter of the circle and overtop of the lit cigarette is an icon that  
transmits ‘no smoking permitted here.’ An index is a sign that is not determined by a  
convention shared by a particular social group but by the interpreter’s own experience  
of the world, and it points to a causal connection between the representamen and the  
object.13 As an index, a lightning flash is an indication of thunder and an impending  
storm, and smoke is an indication of fire and something burning. For Peirce, these  
three classifications are abstractions, and some signs cannot be strictly differentiated  
along these terms but are iconic, indexical, or symbolic to varying degrees. Further-  
more, the same sign can be interpreted as an index, an icon, or a symbol depending on  
the context and the intentions of the receiver interpreting the sign.  
In Webb Keane’s \(2005\) analysis of how materiality is intrinsic to systems of signifi-  
cation, he addresses how an iconic sign such as the quality ‘red’ cannot be experienced  
simply on its own but through its embodiment in an actual material thing. An inter-  
preter experiences redness along with a number of other contingent qualities which  
are “bundled” with the interpreter’s experience of the colour\: “redness in an apple  
comes along with spherical shape, light weight, sweet flavor, a tendency to rot, and so  
forth” \(Keane 2005, 188\).  
As a sign Séguin-Poirier’s Si j’avais des ailes \(If I had Wings\) is an icon signifying an  
aircraft, which as an actual flying machine is an index that points to the interpreter’s  
experience of flight and movement \(Figure 4.5\). Following Keane’s \(2005\) argument,  
the interpreter’s acknowledgement of its resemblance to a flying machine is bundled  
with a number of other contingent qualities. As an icon of an aircraft, Si j’avais des  
ailes \(If I had Wings\) may elicit the bundled qualities of watching a real airplane in  
flight. This visual experience of a flying thing’s movement conveys the quality ‘move-  
ment,’ which, like the quality ‘redness,’ is bundled with a number of other qualities  
that are contingent and dependent on each individual’s own kinaesthetic experiences.  
This may include embodied experiences of flight itself, other motion machines such  
as automobiles, boats, and bicycles, or bodily movements such as running, dancing, 116 Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control  
and swimming. The sign’s capacity to transmit the quality ‘movement’ to the receiver  
occurs on an affective register; it is essentially a current of affects between two bod-  
ies. In short, an icon of an aircraft has the capacity to affect the viewer, and it gener-  
ates sensations of movement that are unique and particular to the viewer affected by  
this icon.  
Air terminal artworks that refer to airplanes are often similar to Séguin-Poirier’s  
Si j’avais des ailes \(If I had Wings\)—they are constructed out of lightweight materi-  
als and strung from the ceiling. When Kansai International Airport opened in 1994,  
planners suspended Susumu Shingu’s Boundless Sky in the concourse. It consists of  
multiple sculptures constructed out of colourful cloths and lightweight armatures, and  
they recall the shape of flying machines \(Buchanan 1994\). It parallels Michel Santry’s  
aerial installation which hung from HKIA Terminal 1’s ceiling from 1998 until 2003.  
It comprised of three separate installations and was constructed out of stainless steel  
tubing, painted steel tubing, thin colourful cloths, and rigging for yachts \(Xinhua  
News Agency 1997\). Santry maintained that his installation, which resembled winged  
craft and sails, was a place-themed reference as well since it referred to the airplanes at  
HKIA and the boats in Hong Kong’s harbour \(Michel Santry Sculptor n.d.\).14 Robert  
Charles Coyle’s Flight Song, discussed in Chapter 3, is also a flight-themed artwork  
suspended in the concourse and is made of thin plastic \(Figure 3.6\). These installa-  
tions, which all hang from the ceiling and employ lightweight materials, remind the  
viewer that aeronautical technology has allowed us to move through airspace and  
overcome gravitational forces, a barrier that otherwise restricts us from leaving the  
ground. Yi-Chih Lai’s Multiple Dimension, installed at Taipei Taoyuan Terminal 2  
in 2011, is an aviation-themed work suspended over the landside departures area  
\(Figure 4.6\). It, however, consists of voluminous forms and is more massive than the  
lightweight works described previously. The largest of the series, which measures 13.2  
metres long, 11.3 metres wide, and 4.7 metres high, hangs above the airline check-  
in counters. It too refers to advancements in aviation design—it consists of propel-  
lers attached to an assemblage of bulbous forms that recall an aircraft’s aerodynamic  
styling.15  
Some air terminals hang models of actual aircraft from their ceilings. At HKIA  
Terminal 1, a replica 1910 Farman biplane is suspended in the landside area of the  
terminal \(Figure 4.7\).16 Arriving passengers exiting the airside on the south side of  
the terminal can see the biplane as they enter the space where meeters and greet-  
ers are waiting. Departing passengers entering the terminal on the south side can  
view the plane up close as it hangs between two of the sets of angled ramps that  
lead to the check-in area. For some passengers, the biplane may foster a romantic  
notion of the early days of flight when aviation was characterized by innovation,  
adventure, and far less regulation than air travel today. A plaque on the departures  
level explains that the first aircraft to take flight in Hong Kong was a Farman  
biplane that Belgian aviator Charles van den Born flew on March 18, 1911, at Sha  
Tin. It states that this replica, which is a fully functional aircraft, flew at HKIA on  
November 15, 1997, and that\: “The flight and this display are lasting tributes to  
the birth of aviation in Hong Kong and the pioneering spirit that built our avia-  
tion industry.”17 Unlike the aforementioned aerial-themed artworks, the Farman  
biplane is not an icon of an aircraft but an actual flying machine. Therefore, with  
regard to Peirce’s semiotics, it is an index that points to embodied experiences of  
flight. Figure 4.6 Yi-Chih Lai, Multiple Dimension, Taipei Taoyuan International Airport, Taiwan, 2011.

Robert Byers’s Da Vinci Flying Machine is another full-scale model of an aircraft.  
It hung above the baggage claim in the arrivals area of Vancouver’s International Ter-  
minal until it was removed a few years ago \(O’Neill 1999; SkyTalk 1999\). Like the  
Farman biplane, this reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci’s design is a flying machine  
that is an index signifying kinaesthesia. Byers’s installation replicates da Vinci’s plans  
for a set of wings that act as an extension of the human body, where each individual  
pilots their own craft. If this rudimentary flying machine were to function as da Vinci  
had imagined, then this machine would allow the aviator to soar and glide in any  
direction in airspace.  
As installations situated in an international air terminal, replicas of aircraft and art-  
works resembling airplanes may recall the bodily sensations that air travellers experi-  
ence while flying. They experience their flight in the cabin of a jet aircraft and spend  
much of the time securely fastened by a seatbelt to their allotted seat by the window, the  
aisle, or between two other passengers. This relative immobility, however, is accompa-  
nied by feelings of movement—the seat presses against one’s back and the seatbelt pulls  
against one’s waist when the jet accelerates, decelerates, and encounters turbulence.18  
The view from the aircraft window accompanies these kinaesthetic sensations with a  
visual reference of the jet’s movement relative to the ground and the clouds in the sky.19  
For some passengers, particularly the ‘ideal’ passengers in the eyes of the air transporta-  
tion industry, this kinaesthesia—the push felt as the jet takes off and the pull of the jet  
as it drops in an area of turbulence—literally is the pleasure of movement. Though for  
many others, those who experience motion sickness or are anxious about flying, the  
experience of these movements is undoubtedly bundled with negative qualities.  
The Farman biplane replica and some these artworks hardly resemble today’s com-  
mercial aircraft or recall the types of flight paths taken by these passenger jets. For  
instance, van den Born’s first flight in Hong Kong contrasts markedly with the numer-  
ous flights arriving and departing in the highly organized airspace and massive airport  
complex at HKIA.20 Shingu’s Boundless Sky and Santry’s aerial installation, made  
from lightweight tubing and colourful cloths, resemble less so jet aircraft and more so  
the materials used to construct a hang glider. Like the Farman biplane, a hang glider  
usually carries one person, its pilot, and it enables this aviator to fly a relatively unre-  
strained flight path limited only by weather conditions, air currents, and the topogra-  
phy below. Perhaps for some passengers these installations do not elicit the embodied  
experiences of flying commercially but evoke sensations of kinaesthesia associated  
with the modes of flying represented in these works. Modes of flying that involve far  
less restricted movements than the controlled mobilities experienced by passengers  
transiting through the terminal and flying aboard today’s commercial aircraft.  
At Heathrow Terminal 2—reopened in June 2014 after being demolished and  
rebuilt—designers also installed a flight-themed artwork that points to types of move-  
ments freer than those typically experienced while flying commercially. Richard Wil-  
son’s Slipstream is situated in a large covered space between the terminal and the  
parking garage \(Figure I.3\). This seventy-eight-metre-long sculpture of twisted forms  
clad in aluminium is attached to four columns that support the entranceway’s ceiling  
\(O. Wainwright 2014; J. Wainwright 2014\). A set of escalators is next to the artwork.  
They lead from the ground level to the terminal’s arrivals level and departures level.  
Passengers are able to view Slipstream from a number of different angles as they move  
from level to level on the escalators and on the raised walkways that access the park-  
ing garage, the escalators, and the terminal. Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control 119  
While the Farman biplane at HKIA recalls the early days of flight, Slipstream points  
to today’s aircraft due to the sculpture’s riveted aluminium panels.21 Furthermore, Wil-  
son modelled the artwork after a contemporary aircraft’s supposed trajectory; he notes\:  
“Everything leaves an invisible trail and I wanted to make that tangible, expressing the  
velocity and acceleration of flight” \(cited in O. Wainwright 2014, 16\). Yet, Slipstream is  
not a rendition of the smooth flight path of contemporary passenger aircraft such as the  
Airbus A380 or the Boeing 787. Instead, it is a recreation of a wild trajectory taken by  
a Zivko Edge 540 stunt plane—a small agile aircraft capable of aerobatic manoeuvres  
such as tight twisting turns, spins, steep dives, rolls, and loop the loops.  
In Oliver Wainwright’s \(2014\) review of the work in The Guardian, he notes that  
Slipstream is markedly different from Wilson’s Butterfly, an earlier artwork that also  
pertains to aircraft. Butterfly is a Cessna that was crumpled into a small ball and then  
gradually bent back into its initial shape, leaving an aircraft that is battered, bent, and  
beyond repair \(Sotiriadi 2003\). In comparison to Butterfly, “the sculpted twists of  
Slipstream seem almost too well-behaved” \(O. Wainwright 2014, 16\). What’s more,  
Wilson admitted that he wanted to create a work that would not “upset the passen-  
gers” \(cited in O. Wainwright 2014, 16\).  
Even if Wilson had wanted to create a work that resembles Butterfly, it seems unlikely  
that Heathrow’s planners would have installed it in Terminal 2 since Butterfly looks  
like a crashed aircraft pieced back together by airplane accident investigators. While  
Slipstream exemplifies an unrestricted and pleasurable form of kinaesthesia, Butterfly  
is the inverse of this aesthetic. It represents a type of movement that is violently inter-  
rupted, and it undoubtedly operates affectively to prompt emotions of fear and terror  
in passengers—even those with the utmost confidence in aviation technology.  
In a press release for Slipstream, Heathrow’s Development Director, John Holland-  
Kaye, explains that the airport’s management anticipates that passengers transiting  
through the terminal will “enjoy” the artwork \(cited in Heathrow Airport Media Centre  
2014\). The press release includes Wilson’s comments on Slipstream’s capacity to induce  
kinaesthesia\: “Sensations of velocity, acceleration and deceleration follow us at every  
undulation of the form” \(cited in Heathrow Airport Media Centre 2014\). Heathrow  
Airport’s decision to install an artwork that implies a wild airplane ride runs counter to  
the design strategies used by advertisers in the early days of commercial flight. Airlines  
tried to convey an image of a smooth trajectory—flying aboard a passenger aircraft was  
depicted as a comfortable experience, akin to that of travelling in a luxury railcar cabin  
\(Dierikx and Bouwens 1997\). The actual experience of these flights included little com-  
fort. Those who flew aboard the early commercial aircraft, which were typically refur-  
bished warplanes, experienced loud engine noises, noxious fumes, and often airsickness.  
Another artwork that points to a sense of free movement is Carel Visser’s Flying Fish;  
although unlike the works above, it combines both air and nautical themes \(see Plate 23\).  
Schiphol installed the massive sculpture made of uncoloured, red, and black metal panels  
in the Departures 3 area in 1993. It is suspended over a space where passengers queue  
in line for the airlines’ check-in counters. The evocation of movement was part of Vis-  
ser’s intent for the installation as he sought to create an air terminal artwork that was  
“directly associated with an element that ‘glides, hovers or swims’” \(Schiphol Group n.d.,  
n.p.\). In its description of the work, Schiphol Group notes that Flying Fish, “in a poetical  
way, makes a fascinating connection with aviation” \(n.d., n.p.\). Cedric Le Borgne’s Les  
Oiseaux \(The Birds\), installed at Singapore Changi’s Terminal 4 when it opened in 2017,  
is a more realistic depiction of animals with the capacity to fly \(Figure 4.8\). The work 120 Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control  
Figure 4.8 Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2018\).

consists of three birds constructed out of a stainless steel mesh, and they are next to  
the floor-to-ceiling windows that face the access road. Two are suspended from the  
ceiling and appear to be in mid-flight. They hover over a space between two bridges  
that connect the upper departures level to entrances for those arriving by automobile. Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control 121  
The other is perched directly below on the ground level in a garden adjacent to the  
arrivals area and doors that exit to the lower roadway.  
The works described in this section convey types of unrestricted movement. Most  
of these pieces have another quality in common—they do not include passengers.  
Slipstream’s Zivko Edge 540 stunt plane and Da Vinci Flying Machine only allow for  
one crew member, the pilot. Flying Fish and Les Oiseaux \(The Birds\) point to moving  
things, animals, who are the masters of their own movements. Although HKIA’s Far-  
man biplane has the capacity to carry an extra passenger, it is only occupied by one  
dummy, which is at the controls of the aircraft. It is unclear whether Shingu’s Bound-  
less Sky or Santry’s aerial installation point to a flying machine with only the pilot on  
board. However, these sculptures’ materials resemble those of a hang glider, which  
often only has the pilot strapped to the apparatus; though, the pilot may choose to  
bring a passenger in a second harness. These artworks point to a type of movement  
that is freer than those typically experienced by passengers, and they also counter  
the aspect that truly defines what a passenger is. Unlike the pilot, the driver, and the  
steamship captain who are actively controlling their movement-machines, the passen-  
ger is passive in terms of the vessel’s navigation and is being transported at the hands  
of another person or organization. This quality of being transported by another agent  
also applies to the passengers’ experience in the terminal and the functional aesthetic  
outlined in Chapter 2. Even though they have some agency over their movements, pas-  
sengers are directed to move in a directional flow and are led through the building by  
the way of interior design and signage.  
What Purpose Do These Representations of Movement  
Serve in the Terminal?  
The Farman biplane, I Dreamed I Could Fly, Slipstream, and Les Oiseaux are illus-  
trative examples of air terminal installations that evoke sensations of relatively unre-  
stricted movement. The Farman biplane and Slipstream convey a form of aeromobility  
that is far less restrained than the stop-and-go movements experienced by the masses  
of passengers who fly commercially and transit through major airport hubs such as  
HKIA and Heathrow. Like all air terminal artworks, these pieces are installed in an  
interior that operates as a consumer space. As noted in Chapter 3, planners deploy  
place-themed artworks such as the Indigenous installations at Vancouver’s YVR in  
order to entice passenger spending. Do artworks that represent unrestricted move-  
ment serve an equivalent purpose in the terminal?  
Artworks that convey themes of unconstrained movement parallel a related type of  
aesthetic that is used in the automotive industry for commercial profit. Automobile  
advertisements often refer to less restricted modes of mobility than those usually expe-  
rienced by the majority of motorists. These include luxury sedans racing alone along  
twisting highways, pickup trucks crawling up rocky ascents in open mountain ranges,  
sport utility vehicles splashing through puddles along remote jungle roads, or sport  
coupes drifting through racetrack corners.  
These types of advertisements depend on the assumption that an elicitation of kin-  
aesthesia stimulates the consumers’ desire for their advertised vehicles. It is not clear  
whether planners presume that air terminal artworks that generate a sense of free and  
unrestricted kinaesthesia have an analogous functional role with respect to commerce  
at the terminal. Thus far, I have not found any planners that have explicitly stated that  
this is the case. Nevertheless, they do believe that artworks such as Slipstream, which 122 Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control  
trigger a dynamic sense of movement, will add to the passengers’ enjoyment of transiting  
through the terminal, and their attention to the travellers’ enjoyment is often driven by  
commercial imperatives. As noted, airport planners try to put passengers in a good mood  
in the terminal, as positive emotions are associated with an increased desire to spend.  
Actual Movement\: Interactive and Kinetic Artworks  
The aforementioned aviation-themed artworks, which convey relatively free forms  
of movement, are all installations consisting of motionless objects. While most air  
terminal artworks are static constructions, there are some that include moving parts.  
Jeff de Boer’s When Aviation Was Young, which was installed at Calgary International  
Airport in 2002, is an interactive piece that consists of two towers, each supporting  
a carousel that has three airplanes attached to it \(Figure 4.9\). When the viewer winds  
a large toy-like key at the base of one of these towers, its carousel starts to spin, and  
the three aircraft come to life. Although these aircraft spur sensations of kinaesthesia  
when they are standing still \(since they are indexical signs of movement\), the sensa-  
tion of movement is notably amplified when they start to spin through the air in the  
concourse. However, the aircrafts’ movement is relatively controlled since they are  
tethered to a tower, and their travel path is far less jarring than Slipstream’s twisting  
trajectory. This engaging piece is situated next to the waiting areas for gates A15 to  
A20. It is also located near a consumer space—a Starbucks Coffee stand is adjacent  
to the work.  
Singapore’s Changi airport has also commissioned an interactive artwork, but it  
moves at a far slower speed. Christian Moeller’s Daisy, installed in Terminal 3’s land-  
side area in 2007, consists of a large fibreglass propeller attached to a steel column  
\(Figure 4.10\). The work’s round base is on the lower arrivals level near the exit to the  
roadway. Its column rises in a space between two bridges that link the departures area  
with the entrances from the upper access road. Moeller incorporated sensors into its  
design such that the propeller responds to people moving past the work. A robotic arm  
slowly angles the propeller up, down, left, and right. While Daisy is unpredictable with  
regard to its movement, the slow pace at which it changes direction hardly connotes  
the type of unrestricted movement conveyed by static artworks such as Slipstream or  
Les Oiseaux. Dynamic artworks moving in such a fashion would be unpopular with  
passengers; a model aircraft engaging in high-speed twisting turns in the concourse or  
a propeller swinging violently from side to side is undoubtedly frightening for those  
about to embark on a flight.  
Singapore Changi has commissioned a number of other kinetic artworks for its  
terminals. Humans since 1982’s A Million Times at Changi and ART+COM’s Kinetic  
Rain and Petalclouds include multiple objects that are synchronized to form changing  
patterns and morphing forms. These movements are not uncontrolled but are choreo-  
graphed to appear as smooth harmonious flows. Like many of the artworks discussed  
in this chapter, they are meant to affect the passengers’ moods. The airport’s website  
states that these works are “all part of the continuous drive to enhance the experience  
for our passengers and offer them a personalised, stress-free and positively surprising  
experience whenever they are at Changi Airport” \(Changi Airport n.d.a\).  
Planners installed Kinetic Rain in 2012 in Terminal 1 when the building was being  
renovated \(Shetty 2012; Changi Airport n.d.b\). This work consists of two assem-  
blages that each consist of 608 bronze forms shaped like water droplets \(Figure 4.11\). Figure 4.9 Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2019\).

The two 9.8-metre-long and 4-metre-wide ceiling panels have a motor and a thin cable  
attached to each droplet. The motors wind the cables up and down. The droplets are pro-  
grammed to move in unison and appear as falling rain or other three-dimensional forms  
in space. Kinetic Rain’s accompanying panel states that some of these are meant to convey  
birds and airplanes. But they largely appear as multiple variations of undulating waves.  
The work is also supposed to refer to Singapore’s tropical rain showers, and its large  
droplets certainly do call to mind this meaning. Passengers encounter Kinetic Rain in the  
landside departures area. The two assemblages are adjacent to the windows that face the  
access road and are near entrances into the building. They are also next to angled travella-  
tors that move people between the departures level and the arrivals level below.  
The airport also commissioned ART+COM to create a kinetic work for its new  
Terminal 4 which opened on October 31, 2017 \(Lee 2017\). Petalclouds consists of six  
assemblages of sixteen aluminium triangular-shaped rings that hang from the ceiling  
above the baggage claim area \(Figure 4.12\). Purple-hued light emanates from a band  
on the inner surface of each ring. Departing passengers also encounter this work.  
Glass windows on the landside and airside of the upper departures level allow one  
to see Petalclouds and look out over the baggage claim below. The assemblages are  
meant to convey clouds, and their triangular-shaped rings are inspired by orchid pet-  
als. Each of the six sections’ rings move up and down. The work’s informational  
panel explains that they are synchronized to create three types of motions\: circular,  
waves, or morph, where “individual clouds gradually morph to smaller fractions,  
reveal their own character before being consolidated to the bigger structure and being  
divided again.” Music composed by Ólafur Arnalds accompanies Petalclouds’ cho-  
reographed movement, and it is projected from speakers at various points in the ter-  
minal.22 ART+COM states that the “artwork’s harmonic choreography creates a calm  
atmosphere levelling the high activity in the other parts of the terminal” \(n.d.\).  
A Million Times at Changi, installed in Terminal 2’s landside departures area in  
2018, is inspired by a tool that underpins nearly all of the terminal’s functions—the  
clock \(Figure 4.13\).23 Humans since 1982’s 7.5-metre-wide and 3.4-metre-high white  
panel consists of 504 small circular analogue clocks with moving hands.24 The hands  
on each of the work’s clocks change to form different patterns. Their movement is  
continuous, and the ever-changing design is mesmerising. Occasionally, the grid of  
clock hands is configured to display the actual time as a numerical readout, and they  
momentarily stand still. A Million Times at Changi is situated near the airline check-  
in counters. The artwork, which is mounted to a wall facing the entrances from the  
access road, is installed in a similar fashion as the terminal’s electronic screens and  
mechanical split-flap displays that project departures information.  
Kinetic Rain, Petalclouds, and A Million Times at Changi all use software to coor-  
dinate their assemblages’ moving parts. This is notable in terms of their location in  
an airport since computer programs are integral to its operations. They facilitate the  
passengers’ purchase of airline tickets, direct their movements through the airport’s  
spaces, and form the complex algorithms required to propel their jet plane through  
the air. Martin Dodge and Rob Kitchin argue that air spaces are “code/spaces,” where  
“code dominates the production of space” \(2004, 198; italics in original\). They note  
that in the airport this mediation of code and space is used to observe and discipline  
both passengers and staff, and they consider this code/space in relation to Michel  
Foucault’s \(1977\) analysis of Jeremy Bentham’s Panopticon.  
25 Like Bentham’s nine-  
teenth-century penitentiary designs, the airport places everyone in the space under the Figure 4.12 ART+COM, Petalclouds, Singapore Changi Airport, Singapore, 2017.

watchful eye of databases, computer codes, surveillance cameras, and security checks;  
the terminal’s panopticism attempts to discipline these subjects into “docile bodies”  
that move through the space in an organized fashion \(Dodge and Kitchin 2004, 199\).26  
While Kinetic Rain’s, Petalclouds’, and A Million Times at Changi’s moving parts are  
all controlled via computer programs, I suspect that few passengers would think about  
software while viewing these works and even fewer would ponder how it is used to dis-  
cipline passengers and manage their movements. These works’ choreographed routines  
convey smooth flowing motions and are more likely to be perceived as an aesthetic piece  
that resembles a dance. In their artist statement for A Million Times at Changi, Humans  
since 1982 state\: “Metaphorically speaking, we liberated the clock from its sole function  
of measuring and reporting the time by taking the clock hands out of their ‘administrative’  
roles and turning them into dancers” \(Bischoff and Emanuelsson 2018\). Even though danc-  
ing in unison as a group requires order and timing, harmonious movements are generally  
more appealing than the monotonous and predicable ticking of a clock’s second hand.  
Time Tower at Los Angeles’s Tom Bradley International Terminal, discussed in Chap-  
ter 2, also incorporates a choreographed piece into the design of a mechanical clock;  
every hour, its screens depict a kaleidoscopic dance routine performed inside a gear-  
wheel-driven timepiece \(Figure 3.8\). A clock’s mechanical action is arguably similar to  
the airport’s mode of organizing passenger movement. Just as a clock’s cogs churn for-  
ward one at a time, each traveller is processed one after another in the various security  
zones, check-in counters, and boarding gates. Time Tower as well as Changi’s kinetic Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control 129  
artworks depict smooth and harmonious flows that contrast with the stop-and-go pro-  
cess that defines the airport’s regulation of movement, and these pieces draw the pas-  
senger’s attention away from their experience of this type of ordered mobility.  
Troika’s Cloud at Heathrow Terminal 5 is a kinetic sculpture that incorporates a  
tool used during the 1970s and 1980s to direct passenger traffic \(Figure 4.14\). It is

enveloped in flip dots, a system of alternating silver and black flaps used in airport signage.  
This technology is now largely replaced by digital readouts. The design brief asked for an  
artwork that responded to its location in the terminal \(McKeough 2008; MediaArtTube  
2010\). It is suspended between two escalators that move passengers between a busy air-  
side departures area and a quieter first-class lounge.27 Troika looked to an aviation-related  
theme to convey the transition from the bustling transit space to the “serene” lounge. Eva  
Rucki, one of Troika’s founding members, noted that Cloud is “a metaphor for a plane’s  
takeoff, traveling through a layer of clouds to reach calm skies above” \(cited in McKeough  
2008, 271\). The sculpture, which was installed in 2008, is a black flattened capsule-like  
shape that is 4.9 metres long and 2.1 metres wide. The 4,638 flip dots on its exterior are  
programmed to create patterns that change intermittently. Troika wanted Cloud, which  
recreates the sounds and the visual imagery of a now all but phased out technology, to  
prompt romantic notions of travel.28 Although this work is unlike the aforementioned  
aerial-themed artworks, it nonetheless has a kinaesthetic aspect in terms of its nostalgic  
reminder of earlier experiences of travel for some passengers.  
Like Kinetic Rain, Petalclouds, and A Million Times at Changi, Troika’s Cloud  
synchronizes its flip dots’ movements into flowing patterns. These types of kinetic  
works are analogous to the aerial-themed works that trigger sensations of unrestricted  
kinaesthesia—they stimulate an aesthetic of movement that differs from the type of  
movement experienced in the terminal. Moreover, they display a type of motion that is  
harmonious and smooth, and it contrasts with the airport’s filtering of passenger flows  
into ordered, stop-and-go movements.  
Artworks That Refer to Contemporary Technologies Used to  
Organize Movement  
Troika’s Cloud is notable as an aerial-themed artwork since there are few installations  
of this type that refer to tools and processes used to manage passenger flows. This  
section focuses on works that call the traveller’s attention to the technologies used  
to regulate movement in today’s airports. Unlike Cloud, they do not intend to evoke  
nostalgic memories of an earlier age of flight. Instead, they critically reflect on the  
contemporary experience of life in the terminal. These types of air terminal artworks  
differ from the norm since they clearly illustrate how the airport is designed to control  
a host of aeromobilities. After discussing two artworks at two US airports that address  
these themes, I concentrate on a series of artworks installed at Schiphol. These four  
site-specific works call attention to their role in ordering passenger movement. I argue  
that these sculptures deviate from the usual kinds of air terminal artworks and critique  
the functions they are intended to serve.  
Larry Kirkland’s Flight Patterns at San Francisco International’s Terminal 1 refers to  
the infrastructure that directs airplanes in and out of the airport’s airspace \(Figure 4.15\).  
Air traffic control imagery inspired the shape of the 1,500 thin aluminium objects that  
hang from the ceiling \(SFO Museum n.d.\). The X shapes denote aircraft, the triangles  
represent landmarks, and the dotted lines refer to boundaries. The work’s theme is  
remarkable with regard to its placement; it is adjacent to the entrance leading to the  
TSA’s pre-boarding security zone. Flight Patterns recalls an imagery of control in a  
space that immediately precedes one of the air terminal’s most secured zones.  
Mark Bradford’s Bell Tower, which hangs over the TSA’s pre-boarding screening  
area at Los Angeles’s Tom Bradley International Terminal, refers to the airport’s regu-  
lation of movement in a more abstract fashion \(Figure 4.16\). The 9.14-metre-tall and Figure 4.15 Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2018\).

7.93-metre-wide sculpture is constructed out of 712 panels and was installed in 2014  
\(Michno 2013; Hill, Smee, and Butler 2018\). The title refers to early modern bell  
towers which, as Bradford notes, were used for surveillance. But the work’s form is  
modelled after a ‘Jumbo Tron,’ a large-scale assemblage of screens that often hangs  
over a sports stadium’s arena. Bradford chose this shape since it refers to how screens  
and technology control people’s behaviours in contemporary society. At sports games,  
the Jumbo Tron directs the fans’ gaze to what is deemed important. Air terminals, as  
Bradford rightfully notes, employ screens for a similar purpose\: “You look up and it  
says gate number 37, and you just go to gate number 37. We’re so comfortable with  
being controlled” \(cited in Michno 2013\). Yet, this intended meaning is not immedi-  
ately apparent since Bell Tower does not include direct representations of surveillance  
such as security cameras.29 Nonetheless, as an air terminal artwork, Bell Tower is  
a notable exception from the norm since it is meant to provoke a critical reflection  
of how air terminals regulate passenger behaviour and movement. Bradford states\:  
“Whether you like it or not, it’s contemporary art in an airport, and it does exactly  
what I wanted it to do—makes people think” \(cited in Tomkins 2015\).  
Schiphol is decidedly the greatest outlier in this respect. In 1995, it installed a series  
of artworks that are meant to evoke thoughts about the experiential aspects of transit-  
ing through the terminal and flying commercially. Adams’s Coda, Holzer’s Untitled,  
Kemps’s Closed View, and Ruygrok’s So go on shed light on the restricted stop-and-go  
flows that passengers normally undergo in the airport and aboard commercial air-  
craft. An art committee consisting of Saskia Bos, director of the contemporary art gal-  
lery De Appel in Amsterdam, Wim Crouwel, the former director of Museum Boijmans  
Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, and Hans Smits, Schiphol’s president, commissioned the  
works. This committee was formed in response to the criticism levelled at some of the  
artworks installed in the airport in 1993 \(van Hooff 1998; Kloos and de Maar 1999\).  
Art critics panned works such as Mark Brusse’s I meet you and Hugo Kaagman’s  
Nice Trip, a series of Delft Blue tiles that combined traditional Dutch imagery such as  
windmills and tulips with patterns found in Islamic art \(Figure 1.5\). Critics considered  
these works, which portray overtly obvious Dutch themes, to be too one-dimensional,  
and the art committee agreed. Shortly after, they formulated a master plan that defined  
the types of artworks to be commissioned and their location in the terminal. The com-  
mittee sought to move away from pieces that they deemed to be simply decorative or  
touristic. Instead, they favoured artworks that engaged with themes that responded  
to the passengers’ experience of time and space. In addition, they stipulated that their  
location and signified meaning should respond to how they might be perceived by pas-  
sengers moving past or around these works.  
Ruygrok’s So go on, installed in the D-pier, consists of three rectangular stacks com-  
posed of two lit letters that rise to the ceiling \(Schiphol Group n.d.; van Hooff 1998\).  
It is intended to be read by passengers as they walk by the work. The three stacks spell  
out the three words of the work’s title, and they were positioned at different angles so  
travellers must move around the work to grasp its meaning. The phrase ‘so go on’ is  
meant to refer to the passengers’ passage through the D-pier—they need to go to their  
gate or the baggage claim. However, the work’s message, its title, can only be read if  
passengers interrupt their trajectory and move around the ceiling-high blocks.  
The committee also commissioned Adams’s Coda \(see Plate 6\). As noted, planners  
placed this piece in Schiphol Plaza, the entrance to the airport, and labelled it as an  
official meeting point. This cube-like prism, approximately four metres tall, has a Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control 133  
red-and-white-checkered pattern that is used in aviation to indicate structures next to  
the runway.30 Due to its size and vibrant colouring, Coda is a distinctive object in the  
terminal’s interior, a space enclosed by glass windows and neutrally coloured floors,  
walls, and ceilings. This cube not only draws one’s attention to a sign used in avia-  
tion, but it also refers to how Coda functions as an obstacle that interrupts people  
moving in and out of the airport. It is a thing intended to be noticed and to be read  
as an impediment to these flows as it is the designated meeting point where some pas-  
sengers and visitors will choose to stop and wait.31 In this regard, Coda is a conceptual  
artwork that critically reflects upon its role as a distinctive landmark. This artwork  
is remarkable with regard to this book’s analyses. Coda, which looks appropriate for  
its purpose as a conspicuous thing for orientation, exemplifies the functional aesthetic  
outlined in Chapters 2 and 3; and its red-and-white checkered pattern is a symbolic  
connotation that reflects upon how its design effectively allows it to operate as an eye-  
catching landmark for wayfinding.  
Kemps’s Closed View likewise referred to the systems that order aircraft movement.  
It consisted of thirteen monitors laid in the floor of Departures 2 that reproduced  
the types of images seen on radar screens by air traffic control \(Koelemeijer 1995;  
Den Hartog Jager 1996\). Unfortunately this work has been removed. Closed View  
reminded air travellers that the air space their jet was about to enter was a highly  
controlled envelope of air, where jets are required to fly at specific altitudes, follow  
precise flight paths, and are under the constant watch of air traffic control. Like Kirk-  
land’s Flight Patterns, this depiction of a surveillance system recalled the extent of the  
regulation that the airport has over the passenger \(Figure 4.15\). It called the traveller’s  
attention to thoughts of control in an area where they were required to queue into a  
line that led to a check-in counter attendant who would examine their identity docu-  
ments and process their air tickets.  
Holzer’s Untitled is a long thin rectangular illuminated text box that hangs  
vertically from the ceiling \(Figure 4.17\). It is situated next to a stairwell between  
Departures 1 and 2. The work is visible from the pre-security landside as well as  
the airside. On the display, a wide range of sentences, mostly general statements  
that ask for some sort of philosophical reflection, continuously scroll down the  
text box. Unlike Ruygrok’s work which is a static presentation of text intended  
to be read by passengers moving around the work, Holzer’s stream of vertically  
rolling text demands the viewer to stand still to be able to read and comprehend  
the projected sentences. It pulls one’s attention, no matter how little or how unfo-  
cused, from moving through the terminal and entices one to pause and reflect on  
statements such as\: “a solid home base builds a sense of self; a strong sense of  
duty imprisons you; absolute submission can be a form of freedom; abstraction  
is a type of decadence; abuse of power comes as no surprise; action causes more  
trouble than thought.” At the time of its installation, the work pointed to an  
additional aspect of the traveller’s experience in the terminal. Judith Koelemeijer  
\(1995\) noted in de Volkskrant that Holzer’s work uses the same technology that  
commercial operations use to project advertisements. But, instead of reading a  
commercial advertisement as one would expect from such a sign, the passenger is  
presented with a philosophical statement.  
Even if the passenger only briefly pays attention to this work, it has the capacity  
to interrupt an otherwise ‘typical’ transit through this consumer space and mobility-  
system. As noted in Chapter 3, artworks are often deployed to interrupt the passenger’s Figure 4.17 Jenny Holzer, Untitled, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Netherlands, 1995.  
Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2013\). Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control 135  
trajectory through the terminal, and usually the intent is to slow them down such that  
they notice neighbouring shops and restaurants. Unlike de Boer’s When Aviation Was  
Young, which is located next to a café, and Time Tower, which is surrounded by duty-  
free stores and other retail outlets, Holzer’s Untitled invites passengers to spend time  
in a stairwell where there are no shops and restaurants nearby \(Figures 3.8 and 4.9\).  
The work’s placement in a location removed from consumption opportunities ampli-  
fies its critique of the terminal’s use as a shopping centre and a space that contains a  
captive audience for numerous advertisements.  
Schiphol has commissioned a number of artworks since this series was installed  
in 1995. But, these pieces do not offer a critical interpretation of one’s experience in  
the terminal. Tom Claassen’s Two Incredible Sitting Black Snowmen, commissioned  
in 2000, consists of two large male figures seated back to back on the floor in the  
D-pier. Their extended legs act as seats that passers-by can sit upon. During the same  
year, Schiphol commissioned Rob Birza’s Four Seasons. This series of four round discs  
shaped in the form of faces hang on the wall in a corridor leading to the B-pier. They  
are constructed out of a translucent material and backlit using coloured light.  
Adams’s Coda, Holzer’s Untitled, Kemps’s Closed View, and Ruygrok’s So go on  
differ from the usual types of air terminal artworks. Indeed, these installations resem-  
ble other flight-themed pieces since they refer to aspects of air transportation. How-  
ever, they depart from conventional flight-themed artworks that celebrate air travel.  
Coda, Untitled, Closed View, and So go on do not extol the ‘beauty’ of flight, cham-  
pion the innovations that have allowed people to fly, recall nostalgic memories of air  
travel in past times, or convey flight as an unrestrained form of movement. Instead,  
they offer a critical reflection of how passengers experience the actual passage through  
the air terminal—an interior space where their movements are managed, their identity  
is vetted, their body is scanned, and their attention is directed towards a plethora of  
consumption opportunities.  
While these four works are notable in that they address the realistic conditions of  
contemporary air travel, they are equally intriguing when they are considered as a  
counterpoint to the conventional practice of installing artworks in airports. Moreover,  
these four installations are conceptual artworks that are critically self-reflexive of their  
purpose as air terminal artworks. Rather than operating as a pleasurable distraction  
while one waits in the queue before being vetted at the check-in counter, Closed View  
reminds the viewer of the various forms of surveillance employed at the airport. So go  
on refers to how it, as an art installation, is meant to capture the passenger’s attention,  
though not for too long since it urges the traveller to move onwards. Coda’s checkered  
cladding not only refers to its own role as an intended distinctive landmark but also  
to how it, as an air terminal artwork, has been carefully deployed to organize passen-  
ger movement. Holzer’s Untitled, which interrupts the passenger’s trajectory using a  
medium typically used for advertising, makes light of the usual formula for deploying  
art in the terminal—place it near a consumer space to slow travellers down and, hope-  
fully, draw them into a store or restaurant.  
Conclusion  
This chapter has examined how air terminal design operates on an affective regis-  
ter. Air terminal architects carefully design these spaces such that they might trig-  
ger specific feelings or emotions in the air passenger. My analysis has focused on 136 Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control  
artworks installed in air terminals and considered what types of sensations they might  
elicit, particularly those associated with kinaesthesia. Airport artworks often repre-  
sent themes pertaining to movement, and in many cases they depict types of move-  
ment that contrast with those typically experienced by the air traveller. Installations  
such as Wilson’s Slipstream and the Farman biplane at HKIA call to mind a freedom  
of movement that contrasts with the design intention of air terminals, which seeks  
to push passengers into particular directions and to hold them in various spaces of  
containment. Kinetic artworks such as Petalclouds and Kinetic Rain display harmoni-  
ous synchronized flows that contrast with the more mundane experience of moving  
through the terminal. Movement-themed artworks are placed in the terminal for the  
travellers’ enjoyment. In short, they offer an affective and aesthetic experience that  
shifts the passenger’s attention away, even if only momentarily, from their regulated  
passage through the airport.  
Bradford’s Bell Tower, Adams’s Coda, Holzer’s Untitled, Kemps’s Closed View, and  
Ruygrok’s So go on are defined by an entirely different aesthetic. These works are  
meant to draw the passenger’s attention towards their experience within the airport,  
and they are intended to operate on a cognitive level. Furthermore, their placement  
amplifies their meaning; they are site-specific conceptual artworks that are intended  
to provoke thoughts regarding the viewer’s and the work’s location in the terminal.  
The following chapter examines another type of work that is also meant to inspire  
thoughts regarding one’s location—specifically, the city, region, and country within  
which the airport is situated.  
Notes  
1\. Thrift’s \(2004\) conception of affect also relies on theories of embodied knowledge and  
physiological studies such as Charles Darwin’s writing on emotion and animals.  
2\. Tolia-Kelly argues that different “racialized, gendered and sexualized” bodies will have  
markedly different emotional responses to environmental conditions \(2006, 215\). Hayden  
Lorimer \(2008\) notes that criticisms such as Tolia-Kelly’s have helped geographers refine  
their notions of affect.  
3\. Tolia-Kelly \(2006\) argues that scholars need to be wary of Thrift’s \(2004\) article on affect  
and urban space since “there is a singularity of registers of affect and emotion declared in  
this extremely important call” \(2006, 214; italics in original\).  
4\. Anderson \(2006\) draws from Massumi who explains the difference between emotion and  
affect\:  
An emotion is a subjective content, the sociolinguistic fixing of the quality of an experience  
which is from that point onward defined as personal. Emotion is qualified intensity, the  
conventional, consensual point of insertion of intensity into semantically and semiotically  
formed progressions, into narrativizable action-reaction circuits, into function and mean-  
ing. It is intensity owned and recognized. It is crucial to theorize the difference between  
affect and emotion. If some have the impression that affect has waned, it is because affect  
is unqualified. As such, it is not ownable or recognizable and is thus resistant to critique.

response to the work \(Studio Echelman 2011\).

7\. The seven other works include Robert Charles Coyle’s Flight Song, Jonathan Borofsky’s I  
Dreamed I Could Fly, and Katharina Grosse’s Untitled \(Figures 3.6 and 4.4; see Plate 2\).  
8\. Aside from my analyses of air terminal design \(Hubregtse 2016, 2017\), Christopher  
Schaberg’s \(2012\) Textual Life of Airports is one of the few scholarly examinations of air  
terminal artworks. In his assessment of installations that represent forms of avian imagery, Affect, Kinaesthesia, and Control 137  
he examines how Seyed Alavi’s Flying Carpet at Sacramento airport recreates the aerial  
view seen by a passenger or a pilot in an aircraft or by a bird in flight. This work, which is  
situated in a corridor that connects the parking garage to Terminal A, consists of a wool  
carpet that represents an eighty-kilometre section of the Sacramento River valley as seen  
from above. Schaberg notes that this aerial view allows the passenger walking along this  
corridor to adopt the “subject positions” of either a bird or an aircraft in flight \(2012, 137\).  
Although Schaberg suggests that the “human becomes animal,” he does not follow this line  
of thought into considering the kinaesthetic sensations associated with flying free over this  
valley \(2012, 137\). He compares this capacity for a bird’s eye view to a textual analogy of  
Internet browsing\: “Googling is a kind of species behavior, another form of flitting about”  
\(2012, 138\). And, he notes that passengers are able to engage in this type of reading at  
terminals that offer complimentary Wi-Fi.  
9\. Air France \(2015\) aired an advertisement that depicts an experience of flight that contrasts  
with the typical trip aboard a commercial airliner. Rather than being buckled into a seat  
in a small tube, young passengers sway back and forth harmoniously on swings in a large  
barrel vault lined with oval shapes that recall aircraft windows.  
10\. This definition is from Freud’s January 1894 article, “The Neuro-psychoses of Defence,”  
and it derives from his early investigations of how psychotherapy can treat hysteria.  
11\. The informational panel accompanying the work notes that it is a collaborative piece that  
incorporates paintings made by the airport employees’ children.  
12\. Gottdiener contends that “Peircian semiotics allows for the understanding of behaviorly  
oriented stimuli that are encoded in material forms as manipulative environments which  
operate through the power of the index and its experiential basis” \(1995, 13\). He uses  
Peirce’s semiotics to analyze “manipulative environments” such as shopping centres and  
amusement parks, two types of urban spaces which, like airport terminals, are carefully  
designed to facilitate people’s movements and stimulate consumption.  
13\. See also Carl Knappett’s \(2005\) discussion of how some indices are only known because of  
prior knowledge and other indices are signs dependent their performative nature.

are depicted in paintings found at China’s Dunhuang Caves \(Michel Santry Sculptor n.d.\).  
In Chapter 2, I explain why this installation was removed in 2003.  
15\. A panel applied to a pillar below includes Lai’s interpretation\: “‘Multiple Dimension’ pre-  
sents the aircraft in the future as the creation concept. As the advancement in aeronautic  
technology and intelligent transportation system, multiple links among time and space  
bring out the various dimensions and the unbounded imagination.”  
16\. Roger Freeman and his team at Vintage Aviation Services in Texas built the replica \(Clarke  
1997\). Freeman had to reconstruct the aircraft from photographs as there were no existing  
plans for the biplane. The original was destroyed at a riot after one of van den Born’s flights  
in Canton in 1911. Freeman’s replica has a 13.1-metre wing span, is 14.3 metres long, weighs  
544 kilograms, and has a top speed of 61 km/h. Freeman piloted the replica when it made  
its inaugural flight at Chek Lap Kok in November 1997 \(Smith 1997\). In April the following  
year, the biplane was moved into the terminal and suspended from the ceiling \(So 1998\).

replica and was funded by Shell Hong Kong Limited.

19\. See David Bissell’s \(2009\) discussion of train passengers’ kinaesthetic sensations and the  
accompanying views of passing landscapes and how the materiality of railway car interiors  
affects the passengers’ visual practices.  
20\. The Belgian aviator departed and landed at a long beach at Sha Tin at low tide \(Grindrod  
1993\). His inaugural flight had been advertised in the press and drew a number of specta-  
tors. Many left before van den Born took to the air as he had to delay his flight by three  
hours because of strong winds.

24\. Humans since 1982 consists of Bastian Bischoff and Per Emanuelsson.  
25\. In his prison designs, Bentham added a central tower from where the inspector could  
observe each prisoner in his cell. The inmates could not see the inspector in the tower or  
whether they were being observed. This panoptic architecture disciplined the prisoner by  
placing him under what appeared to be constant surveillance \(Foucault 1977\).  
26\. Dodge and Kitchin \(2004\) argue that the airport’s code/space encourages subjects to engage  
in what Foucault calls a “technology of the self”; passengers and staff are persuaded to  
discipline themselves when they encounter the technological structures of a disciplinary  
apparatus that is justified by airport authorities as a necessary tool to combat against secu-  
rity threats. See also Mark B. Salter’s \(2007\) analysis of how passengers reveal personal  
information to airport security in terms of Foucault’s “confessionary complex.” See Lyon  
\(2003\) and Adey \(2004\) for other analyses of air terminals and surveillance.  
27\. Heathrow has commissioned only two artworks for the spaces accessible to all passengers  
at Terminal 5\: Troika’s Cloud and Langlands and Bell’s Moving World \(Night & Day\).  
Neither is situated along a main passenger route. Cloud hangs between two escalators that  
lead to and from one of the British Airways \(BA\) lounges on the airside. Moving World,  
which I examine in Chapter 5, consists of two glass walls located outside at the opposite  
ends of the boulevard running between the main terminal building and the parking garage  
\(Figure 5.4\). Most of the artworks commissioned for the terminal hang in the BA lounges,  
which are reserved for business- and first-class passengers.  
28\. Troika’s Sebastien Noel contends that the sound the flip dots make as they change is  
“instantly reminiscent of travel” \(cited in Lucas 2008, 50\).  
29\. Bell Tower refers to the airport’s region as well. It is made of old plywood panels with worn  
posters and faded graffiti scavenged from construction sites in Los Angeles. A number  
of Bradford’s works are constructed out of found materials and mixed media \(Hill et al.  
2018\).  
30\. Coda has an opening on each of its four sides. Inside are twenty-eight backlit photographs  
of objects painted with the same red-and-white checkered pattern such as a windsock or a  
tower located along a runway or on an apron. These photographs were taken at airports  
in the former Dutch colonies; the place’s name appears at the bottom of each image. These  
pictures call to mind how Schiphol had facilitated the Netherlands’ reach into its colonies  
prior to decolonization.  
31\. Although Ruygrok’s So go on and Adams’s Coda refer to the actual experience of move-  
ment in the terminal, they are not blatant expressions of this experience but subtle point-  
ers to this kinaesthetic feeling. At Vancouver’s YVR, Patrick Amiot and Brigitte Laurent’s  
Flying Traveller clearly expresses the bodily movements that some passengers occasionally  
experience in the terminal. The sculpture, which depicts a man running with two suitcases,  
is a humorous rendition of one’s actual movements while rushing to catch a departing  
airplane. But, this was not the figure YVR’s Frank O’Neill \(1997\) had in mind when he  
approached Amiot and Laurent with a commission to create an acrylic-painted fibreglass  
sculpture for the terminal; he had asked for a sculpture depicting either one of coastal  
British Columbia’s two major resource industries—forestry and fishing. However, in his  
column on YVR’s artworks in the airport’s newsletter, O’Neill reports that Amiot and  
Laurent’s finished sculpture is “perfect for the airport” and that Flying Traveller has been  
popular with passengers transiting through the International Terminal \(1997, 5\).

# and Mobility  
Place-themed installations appear in numerous contemporary international airports.  
These types of designs include signifiers that point to the region’s cultural groups, built  
environment, and physical landscape. Planners usually install place-themed artworks  
and interior designs in order to stimulate passenger spending. This chapter examines  
how planners and architects incorporate these types of installations into terminals at  
airports such as Vancouver’s YVR, Amsterdam’s Schiphol, Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi,  
Delhi’s Indira Gandhi, and Taipei’s Taoyuan International. I consider how these rep-  
resentations of place operate as markers for arrival and departure, and I address why  
planners believe that these installations will appeal to travellers. My investigation also  
addresses political aspects pertaining to these designs. In many cases, airport authori-  
ties choose installations that refer to only one or some of the cultural groups living  
within the region. I discuss the types of identities represented by designs placed near  
the terminal’s commercial areas as well as its border zones. While my analysis concen-  
trates on place-themed installations that refer to cultural groups, I also examine a few  
airports that include natural and pseudo-naturalistic settings to evoke a ‘sense of place.’  
Before addressing what motivates planners to install place-themed installations, I dis-  
cuss how these designs operate as symbols to convey meaning. This chapter’s analysis  
resembles the previous chapter’s investigation; it concentrates on air terminal design with  
regard to its symbolic connotations. Moreover, I do not examine how these designs are  
material things that mediate passengers’ actions, but I consider why representations of  
place are significant in terms of their meaning, especially with regard to their location in  
the terminal. Like my analysis of movement-themed artworks in Chapter 4, I assume that  
a place-themed installation will elicit variable responses among its viewers. However, in  
order to understand these representations, travellers usually require some knowledge of  
the region’s social and cultural contexts. My investigation addresses the meanings that  
planners expect to convey via these place-themed designs. They often explain their cul-  
tural significance via informational panels placed beside these installations. My analysis  
critically assesses these types of narratives; I examine how planners tend to highlight  
cultural groups traditionally associated with the airport’s region, and I discuss why these  
representations of identity are significant with regard to their location in a gateway to  
global destinations and a border zone that filters and screens passengers.  
Conveying Themes of Place Via Imagery and Design  
The last chapter employed Charles Sanders Peirce’s semiotics in order to analyze how  
movement-themed artworks can affect passengers. I illustrated how some of these Place-Themed Designs and Mobility 143  
works operate as indices, icons, and symbols with regard to Peirce’s theory. Architec-  
ture, artworks, and interior designs that refer to the airport’s region primarily func-  
tion as symbols when they convey place-themed connotations. For Peirce, a symbol’s  
meaning depends on information pertaining to its social and cultural context \(Gottdi-  
ener 1995\). Usually, the degree to which one can understand an artwork’s or design’s  
place-themed representational content is contingent upon one’s familiarity with the  
place’s social and cultural relations.  
Kang HeeRa’s Hello at Seoul Incheon’s Terminal 2 is a place-themed work that is  
literally composed of symbols \(see Plate 24\). It consists of one thousand Hangeul char-  
acters of the Korean alphabet suspended from a rectangular panel that hangs from the  
ceiling. Hello was installed in the landside area near the airline check-in counters when  
the terminal opened in 2018. The consonants and vowels contain LED lights, and the  
installation periodically lights up and changes colours; the emitted light reflects off of  
the terminal’s stone flooring. In this case, the passenger can only grasp that the piece  
connotes Korean culture if they recognize that the one thousand suspended objects  
are used as characters in Korean texts. What’s more, Hello’s representational content  
is remarkable with regard to international air terminal design. This jumble of Korean  
characters contrasts with the terminal’s wayfinding signage which uses a minimal  
amount of text. Like many of the terminals discussed in the previous chapters, Seoul  
Incheon’s Terminal 2 is a large open concourse where people can use the ceiling to ori-  
ent themselves in the space, and its planners have installed a limited amount of signage.  
Some of the signs, such as those indicating the zones for the airline check-in counters,  
are comprised of only one capitalized Latin letter. A sign indicating the D-section hangs  
from the ceiling near HeeRa’s installation. Indeed, Hello asserts a Korean cultural iden-  
tity in an international node for air travel that uses Latin letters for wayfinding.  
Steve Smith’s Freedom to Move at Vancouver’s YVR also operates as a symbol in  
order to convey its place-themed meaning \(see Plate 13\). Instead of using text, this  
installation employs a distinct visual language to signify the airport’s region. Smith’s  
cedar panels depict a raven, an eagle, a grizzly bear, and a killer whale in formline, a  
Northwest Coast Indigenous style that is characterized by ovoid forms and U-shapes.  
Similar to HeeRa’s Hello, only those familiar with this mode of depicting subject  
matter will recognize that this piece points to the region within which the airport is  
located. This information, however, can be garnered via the adjacent panel. It explains  
which animals are represented by Smith’s formline designs.  
Unlike Freedom to Move which depicts animals on a two-dimensional surface, Bill  
Reid’s Spirit of Haida Gwaii\: The Jade Canoe renders animal and human figures in  
three dimensions \(see Plate 1\). Passengers unfamiliar with Northwest Coast artworks  
can recognize that this sculpture consists of a boat packed with a number of figures  
who are paddling and steering the watercraft. In this respect, Reid’s piece operates as  
an icon in terms of Peirce’s semiotics since it is a sign that resembles the object it is  
intended to signify. The Jade Canoe, however, also operates as a symbol since the work  
connotes a number of meanings pertaining to the Haida’s culture. Its informational  
panel includes a quote by Reid which explains that this is a traditional Haida dugout  
canoe with “thirteen supernatural creatures, each related in some way to the Haida’s  
mythical past.” They include the Mouse Woman, the Beaver, the Dogfish Woman, the  
Raven, the Wolf, the Frog, the Eagle, the Ancient Reluctant Conscript, and the Bear  
with his human wife and their twin cubs. Reid states that “the tall figure in the middle  
of it all . . . may or may not be the Spirit of the Haida Gwaii.” 144 Place-Themed Designs and Mobility  
Some air terminals signify themes of place via the building’s architectural design.  
At Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Paul Andreu modelled the termi-  
nals’ structures after local building types \(Jodidio and Andreu 2004\). He designed  
Terminals 1 and 2, which opened in 1985 and 1991 respectively, to recall Indonesian  
villages with red-tiled roofed houses separated by greenspace. Both terminals have  
semi-circular footprints with three piers radiating outwards. Each pier extends into  
a natural setting which contains seven separate square-shaped buildings that house  
the gates’ waiting areas. These structures have a hipped roof similar to a Javanese  
joglo house, and they are connected to the pier via passageways that cross through  
the greenery. The terminals’ structural supports also signify traditional building styles.  
The tubular steel posts and beams are visible within the interior, and their structural  
form is based on Indonesian bamboo-framed buildings.  
Skidmore, Owings & Merrill’s Hajj Terminal at the King Abdulaziz International  
Airport in Jeddah also connotes a local traditional architectural form. The building’s  
roof, which recalls a Bedouin tent, is constructed out of fabric and supported by cables  
\(Skidmore, Owings & Merrill n.d.\). The terminal opened in 1981, and it accom-  
modates Muslim pilgrims travelling to Mecca, which is situated approximately sev-  
enty-five kilometres southwest of the airport. Fentress Bradburn Architects’ Denver  
International Airport, which opened in 1995, also employs a fabric roof that refers to  
local forms. The terminal’s numerous steep-pitched white peaks evoke the surrounding  
Rocky Mountain range as well as Native American tepees \(Albrecht 2012\). Fentress  
Bradburn, however, did not choose this type of roof strictly for its place-themed con-  
notations. Rather, the thin membrane ceiling was a cost-effective and efficient design  
that met the airport’s purposes.  
When Beijing Capital Airport’s Terminal 3 is seen from the sky, it conveys a sym-  
bolic meaning pertaining to the People’s Republic of China. The building’s footprint  
consists of two triangular shapes on the northern and southern sides of the terminal.  
These two triangles’ sides curve inwards, and they loosely recall the Chinese char-  
acter 人 \(rén\) which means ‘people’ and ‘person.’ Netherlands Airport Consultants  
\(NACO\) designed the building’s footprint in collaboration with Foster + Partners and  
ARUP when they were competing for the building’s contract. NACO devised its shape  
based on the terminal’s placement between the airport’s runways and the number of  
gates on the airside \(Hein Baijer and Piet Ringersma, pers. comm., April 10, 2018\).  
The architects and planners realized the symbolic connotation after they had deter-  
mined the footprint, and they decided to highlight it as a place-themed quality in their  
competition documents.1 NACO, Foster + Partners, and ARUP won the contract in  
2003 and completed the terminal in time for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing \(Fos-  
ter + Partners 2003\). In its press release that announces the terminal’s official opening  
in February 2008, Foster + Partners states that its design is “\[a\] symbol of place, its

Deploying Place-Themed Interior Designs and Artworks to  
Stimulate Spending  
While airports such as Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta, Jeddah’s King Abdulaziz Interna-  
tional Airport, Denver International Airport, and Beijing Capital Airport convey Place-Themed Designs and Mobility 145  
symbolic place-themed meanings via their terminals’ structural supports and ceil-  
ings, planners tend to evoke a sense of place via the terminal’s interior design and  
artworks. As discussed in Chapter 1, the air terminal’s architectural design \(e.g., its  
footprint, elevation, and ceiling\) is determined by the runways’ location, the number  
of gates, ground transportation access, and passenger circulation. Interior designs and  
artworks are less cumbersome to renovate and replace than an air terminal’s exterior  
shell, and they can be easily changed to accord with passengers’ tastes. At Schiphol,  
for instance, planners have renovated its Holland Boulevard and moved the Rijksmu-  
seum to a different location in this Dutch-themed corridor. The refurbished Holland  
Boulevard and Rijksmuseum reopened in 2017, fifteen years after the museum space  
was first installed in the terminal. This section concentrates on why planners deploy  
these types of place-themed interior designs and artworks to stimulate spending and  
what types of symbolic imagery they choose for this purpose.  
Robbie Gill \(2012\), the director of a firm specializing in the design of air terminal  
consumer spaces, notes that even though there is little evidence that points to the com-  
mercial gains of place-themed designs, most airports aspire to design a terminal or at  
least a duty-free store that evokes a “sense of place” to entice passenger spending.2  
Vancouver’s YVR, which is pictured on the title page of Gill’s article, is perhaps the  
quintessential example of an airport that tries to establish a sense of place.3 Its plan-  
ners and architects have installed numerous Northwest Coast First Nations artworks  
to stimulate spending.4  
The Vancouver International Airport Authority \(VIAA\) began to almost exclu-  
sively commission these types of artworks while it was planning its new International  
Terminal during the early 1990s. This was part of its “North Star” strategic plan,  
established in 1993, that sought to profit from British Columbia’s appeal as a tourist  
location \(Vancouver International Airport Authority 1995\). During this same year, the  
VIAA purchased Reid’s The Jade Canoe for three million Canadian dollars \(CAD\). In  
1994, the VIAA’s director, Peter Newman, defended this expenditure and stated that  
“the sculpture will eventually pay for itself through the sale of souvenir replicas, and  
as a tourist attraction” \(cited in Vancouver Sun 1994\).  
The “North Star” plan also aimed to transform the airport into a significant North  
American destination and transit hub. In the VIAA’s \(1995\) update on this plan, the  
airport included a picture of a globe with Vancouver’s YVR as a central hub between  
Asian, Australian, European, and South American destinations. Aside from Vancou-  
ver and Honolulu, only Asian cities are marked on the globe. They include Singapore,  
Hong Kong, Seoul, and Osaka. Indeed, the VIAA was trying to attract Asian travellers  
to fly to Vancouver as a destination or as a transfer point for flights heading to other  
North American locations.  
As noted in Chapter 3, the VIAA placed Reid’s The Jade Canoe next to the termi-  
nal’s food court \(Figure 3.10; see Plate 1\). YVR’s architects and planners expected  
that this material thing would draw people towards this consumer space, and they  
also believed that the work’s representational content would stimulate retail sales \(Bell  
1996\). They estimated that The Jade Canoe’s symbolic connotation of British Colum-  
bia’s coastal Indigenous peoples would entice passenger spending. Like most of the  
works installed at YVR, its accompanying panel includes a brief artist biography and  
a description of the installation’s meaning. As discussed previously, it explains the  
work’s significance with regard to the Haida’s culture. This information undoubtedly  
amplifies the traveller’s notion that they are in a novel place. Reid’s The Jade Canoe 146 Place-Themed Designs and Mobility  
illustrates how this sense of place is used for commercial purposes. Not only is it situ-  
ated near a café and a number of restaurants, it is also just a few steps away from the  
Lattimer Gallery which sells carvings by Northwest Coast First Nations artists as well  
as blankets, pepper mills, mugs, and water bottles illustrated with Northwest Coast  
First Nations designs.5  
Not all of the terminal’s Indigenous artworks are situated beside stores that sell  
locally crafted goods. Some of these installations are placed beside stores that carry a  
variety of global brands. For instance, Lyle Wilson and John Nutter’s Orca Chief and  
the Kelp Forest and Dempsey Bob’s The Story of Fog Woman and Raven are located  
in the International Terminal’s airside near luxury retailers such as Burberry, Omega,  
Cartier, and Gucci \(see Plate 21\).  
Vancouver’s airport has been successful in terms of generating spending and increas-  
ing its passenger traffic. In a 2012 survey, the airport ranked second in North America  
with regard to dollars spent per passenger \(Lee 2012\). The average amount spent was  
20.11 CAD. The North American airport with the highest per capita spending was  
New York’s John F. Kennedy International where passengers spent on average 24.07  
CAD. Asian tourists were YVR’s highest spenders, especially those from mainland  
China. In 2013, the airport reported that it received its greatest single transaction—a  
70,000 CAD purchase by a Chinese customer \(Luke 2013\). Three years earlier, the  
airport began to cater its wares to the increasing number of Chinese travellers. Susan  
Steine, the VIAA’s director of commercial services, stated that  
we were looking at the Chinese market because we knew we were growing at a  
huge rate from a Chinese perspective. . . . We actually will take a look at the diver-  
sification of passengers and where the growth is in the various markets. When  
we see that there is a specific nationality that is going to be growing, we will go  
out and interview the existing \[passengers\] who are coming through and find out  
what we are missing here at the airport.  
\(cited in Lee 2012, 1\)  
The VIAA found that this demographic preferred to purchase expensive whiskys as  
souvenirs, and it began selling bottles with prices in the tens of thousands of dollars.  
In November 2018, YVR’s worlddutyfree store was selling a bottle of 1937 Macallan  
Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky for 56,540 CAD as well as a bottle of Private  
Collection Glenlivet 1943 Single Malt Scotch Whisky for 64,640 CAD.  
Without a doubt, YVR generates a lot of passenger spending. Even though its plan-  
ners install Northwest Coast Indigenous artworks in order to stimulate consumption,  
we cannot firmly establish whether these pieces cause this effect; as Dorothée van  
Hooff \(1998\) admits, it is not possible to quantify the correlation between spend-  
ing and particular artworks. Nonetheless, YVR’s place-themed design has caught the  
attention of other airport authorities, and this has resulted in more contracts for the  
airport’s architects. In 2001, Architectura’s Stanis Smith noted\: “Vancouver Interna-  
tional Airport led us to win the contract to do the retail space at Chicago O’Hare and  
Detroit \[airports\], which, in turn, led to the Heathrow contract” \(cited in Christmas  
2001, 2\). In 2018, Denver International Airport awarded Stantec \(formerly Archi-  
tectura\) the contract to develop the art masterplan for its terminal, which is being  
renovated at the time of writing \(Noel Best, pers. comm., December 17, 2018\). Stantec  
is collaborating with NINE dot ARTS, a Denver-based art curating organization, to  
establish the criteria and zoning plan for the terminal’s new artworks. Stantec’s Noel Place-Themed Designs and Mobility 147  
Best notes that his firm has developed a substantive reputation for integrating art-  
works into architectural designs, commencing with their work at YVR. Stantec aims  
to achieve a sense of place—although one that is not too Disneyesque or clichéd for  
local residents but still exciting and informative for newcomers. As a designer, Best  
aims to “seek a balance” between these two positions.  
Schiphol has grappled with similar concerns. As noted in the previous chapter, art  
critics lambasted Mark Brusse’s I meet you and Hugo Kaagman’s Nice Trip for their  
stereotypical Dutch subject matter shortly after these pieces were installed in 1993.  
Brusse’s sculpture, which is in the landside arrivals area, depicts one of the country’s  
most widely produced souvenirs—a pair of wooden clogs \(Figure 1.5\). The work’s  
black plinth is also modelled after a Dutch design; it is meant to recall the National  
Monument on Dam Square in Amsterdam \(Schiphol Group 2019a\). Kaagman’s mural,  
which was commissioned for a corridor on the airside, also depicts a common Dutch  
souvenir—Delft Blue tiles. In a monograph on his work, Kaagman comments on the  
country’s general distaste for Dutch-themed media\: “In the Netherlands, you weren’t  
supposed to dive into your own culture, into common tastes, popular sentimental  
songs, Dutch blues; that was all a joke” \(2009, 66\). Indeed, Delft pottery and Dutch  
clogs are similar to Americana in the United States, and this type of imagery is asso-  
ciated with the Netherlands’ predominant white and Christian ethnic group. While  
Kaagman’s Nice Trip includes patterns from Islamic Art, the work largely depicts  
traditional Dutch scenes and does not explicitly convey themes of multiculturalism or  
immigration.  
Even though Schiphol established a plan to install pieces that were less touristic,  
the airport has not removed Brusse’s or Kaagman’s works. What’s more, in 2009  
Schiphol commissioned Kaagman to create a second series of Delftware-themed works  
for Holland Boulevard, a post-security zone that is situated between the E- and the  
F-piers and near a number of shops and restaurants \(Hugo Kaagman n.d.\). The series  
included rectangular tulip-filled planters with Delft Blue-themed designs, which in  
some cases incorporate airport-related imagery such as jet aircraft \(see Plate 25\).  
6 Kaa-  
gman also created ring-shaped signs with “Holland Boulevard” printed on the ring’s  
outer surface and Delft Blue designs on the inner surface. Two years earlier, Schiphol  
Group’s Freek Vermeulen noted that Holland Boulevard needed to be redeveloped  
into a more effective promotional tool for the Netherlands \(Algemeen Nederlands  
Persbureau 2007\). Vermeulen stated that “you could compare it to Vancouver’s air-  
port. When you arrive you see direct elements such as Indigenous sculptures, totem  
poles, and rushing mountain streams. You immediately feel the elements of Vancou-  
ver’s region around you” \(cited in Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau 2007\).7  
Kaagman’s works are not the only Delftware-themed objects in Holland Boule-  
vard. The Dutch Kitchen restaurant and café \(Figure 5.1\), which opened in 2010,  
has tables that resemble oversized plant pots with tulips and large booths designed  
as Delft Blue teacups \(van den Berg 2010; Haarlems Dagblad 2010\). The furniture  
is stamped with Royal Delft’s logo, a company that has made handcrafted Delft-  
ware since 1653. Its products are on display in a vitrine on one of the restaurant’s  
tables.  
These stereotypical Dutch designs are not installed to educate local travellers about  
their culture. Rather, Holland Boulevard is intended to exhibit the Netherlands’  
culture for passengers transferring through Schiphol and not entering the country  
\(Schiphol Group 2014\). These travellers consist of approximately forty percent of the  
airport’s passenger traffic. As noted in Chapter 3, the Rijksmuseum, which is located Figure 5.1 Dutch Kitchen, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Netherlands, 2010.  
Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2013\). Place-Themed Designs and Mobility 149  
in Holland Boulevard, is also aimed at these travellers. The museum’s gift shop sells  
the types of Delftware items that inspired Kaagman’s works and the Dutch Kitch-  
en’s interior design. These include plates, saucers, and vases. In April 2018, the gift  
shop displayed a Royal Delft seventy-seven-centimetre-tall, hand-painted vase worth  
7,750 euros. Interior designs inspired by Delft pottery also appear in shops adjacent  
to Holland Boulevard. The Johnny Walker House, for example, displayed a Delft  
Blue-themed sculpture of its iconic logo in its storefront during July 2017. During the  
same year, it sold its “Dutch label” whisky in a Delftware bottle for 583 euros \(Cohen  
2017\). In 2017, André van den Berg, Schiphol Group’s chief commercial officer, stated  
that he welcomed these types of place-themed products. The airport had seen a decline  
in retail spending, and he expected that unique Dutch-themed goods would appeal to  
passengers.  
Schiphol’s Holland Boulevard, however, does not only highlight traditional Dutch  
artworks and pottery. It also showcases contemporary Dutch design. Next Archi-  
tects, an Amsterdam-based firm, designed a number of “typical Dutch-inspired sitting  
rooms” as part of its redevelopment of Holland Boulevard, which reopened in Sep-  
tember 2017 \(Next Architects n.d.\). These seating areas are defined by bright colours  
and are separated by low walls for the sake of transparency. Some of the nearby shops  
also exhibit colourful contemporary Dutch designs \(see Plate 15\). Studio Tjep’s Say  
Cheese and House of Tulips, both constructed in 2011 and located in Lounge 3 next to  
Holland Boulevard, demonstrate the type of wittiness and humour that characterizes  
Dutch design since the 1970s \(Thomas 2008\). The Amsterdam-based firm designed  
the Say Cheese store with a bright yellow wall that resembles a slice of cheese \(Studio  
Tjep n.d.\). The shop’s counter has a circular shape, and it is constructed out of layers  
of wooden planks stacked on round yellow objects that resemble wheels of cheese.  
The House of Tulips consists of a translucent green structure which is raised upwards  
to open the flower market to passengers \(Lamers 2011\). At closing time, the products  
are moved inside, and the structure is lowered. Studio Tjep used the coloured glass as a  
literal reference to the nation’s greenhouses that grow Holland’s famous tulips. While  
the construction materials and mechanical hoist are undeniably modern, the building’s  
façade refers to a traditional architectural form—Amsterdam’s canal houses. As noted  
in Chapter 3, this eye-catching shop design is a landmark on Schiphol’s maps.  
Like Vancouver’s YVR and Amsterdam’s Schiphol, Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi  
includes a number of place-themed sculptures in its interior. Its planners installed  
these works in response to critiques that the terminal, which opened in 2006, lacked  
any explicit references to Thai culture \(Noobanjong 2009; Ferguson 2014\). The local  
population as well as the Association of Siamese Architects under Royal Patronage  
critiqued Helmut Jahn’s architectural design for not having any distinct Thai-themed  
references.8 On the airside, planners installed Scene of The Churning of The Milk  
Ocean, an elaborate installation comprised of figures including the Hindu deity  
Vishnu and a number of Devas—demi-gods—and Asuras—demons \(see Plate 16\).  
9  
The Devas and Asuras are churning the milk ocean by tugging on opposite ends of the  
serpent king, Vasuki, who is wrapped around a semi-submerged mountain. The work’s  
snake theme is notable with respect to the airport’s location. It is constructed upon an  
area named Nong Ngu Hao which means ‘Cobra Swamp.’ On the landside, planners  
have installed statues depicting mythical characters from the Ramakien, Thailand’s  
national epic \(Figure 5.2\). It is a story about a good king, Phra Ram, who overcomes 150 Place-Themed Designs and Mobility  
Figure 5.2 Viruncamban \(left\) and Tosakanth \(right\), Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,  
Thailand, 2006.

evil demons such as Tosakanth, a green giant with ten faces and twenty hands, and his  
sons, Tosagirithorn and Tosagirivan. The Ramakien is well-known among the Thai  
nation, and it reinforces a notion that a kingdom with a benevolent ruler is an ideal  
power structure \(Poolthupya 2006\). The current Chakri dynasty, which refers to their  
king as Rama, relies on this ideological construct to support their monarchical rule.  
Each figure is approximately five-metres tall and placed upon a podium. They are  
situated between the rows of check-in counters and near the entrances to the security  
checkpoints \(Figure 3.2\).  
While these types of works were installed to evoke a Thai identity, they also appear  
to serve a commercial purpose. Scene of The Churning of The Milk Ocean, which is  
situated in the centre point of the nearly 1.5-kilometre-long concourse, draws the pas-  
sengers’ attention and invites them to linger near the adjacent shops, restaurants, and  
boutiques \(see Plate 16\). Its nearest neighbours are the terminal’s Gucci and Chanel  
outlets. Throughout the concourse, planners have installed open-walled traditional  
Thai salas \(Figure 3.3\). These structures’ multi-tiered steep-pitched roofs and highly  
ornamented gables are similar to those designed for the nation’s temples as well as  
the Grand Palace, the Thai monarchy’s official residence in Bangkok. The salas at the  
east and west ends of the concourse contain gift shops selling Thai-themed souvenirs  
including handbags, textiles, and clothing. Place-Themed Designs and Mobility 151  
Taipei Taoyuan International Airport also includes a number of place-themed  
installations throughout its two terminals. It highlights aspects of its culture, rang-  
ing from traditional practices to modern industries, via themed gates. For instance,  
Gate A9 celebrates Taiwanese opera while Gate B3 showcases the country’s bicycle  
manufacturing industry. Each of these gates has its interior and signage designed  
according to its theme. Some of the gates display objects. Gate C4, the “Taiwanese  
Ceremonial Waiting Lounge,” includes swords and other weapons in glass display  
cases. Gate C7, which examines Taiwan’s postal history, has three mailboxes from  
1906, 1956, and the ‘present day’ that passengers can touch \(see Plate 26\). Other  
gates rely on photographs, videos, and informational panels to educate travel-  
lers about Taiwanese culture. Gate C8 showcases Taiwanese cinema, Gate D8  
addresses the country’s wildlife conservation efforts, and Gate D2 examines vari-  
ous Taiwanese snacks such as delicacies sold at night markets and other types of  
‘street food.’ The latter gate includes round wooden bench seats modelled after  
circular bamboo steamer baskets \(Figure 5.3\). Each bench has an oversized white  
dumpling in the centre circumscribed by six circular flat cushions. Gate D9, the  
“Taiwan Indigenous Culture Park,” has informational panels that introduce pas-  
sengers to sixteen of the nation’s aboriginal tribes such as the Thao and Yami peo-  
ples. It also has glass cases that display their artefacts. Its interior has a small gift  
shop as well as seats and tables made from rough stone with a smooth upper sur-  
face. Beside the gate is a mock traditional Indigenous setting containing artificial  
Figure 5.3 Gate D2, Taipei Taoyuan International Airport, Taiwan.

palm trees, a decorated boat, a person riding a water buffalo, and a thatch-roofed  
granary on stilts.  
Retail shops selling global brands and local goods are interspersed between these  
gates. A Victoria’s Secret outlet, an American lingerie brand, is located beside Gate  
A6, the “Taiwanese Aboriginal Arts Waiting Lounge.” Formosan Aborigines, a store  
that sells Taiwanese gifts, is situated near Gate C2, which celebrates the nation’s avia-  
tion history. A Sanrio shop, which sells goods related to this Japanese company’s  
animated characters, is adjacent to Gate C3 \(see Plate 27\). This gate, however, is an  
anomaly since it does not celebrate an aspect of Taiwanese culture. Rather, it is themed  
according to Hello Kitty, Sanrio’s animated cat who is a schoolgirl living in Britain.  
The Sanrio store sells Hello Kitty-themed goods such as backpacks, purses, and travel  
cushions. The shop and gate have separate entrances, and their exteriors are painted  
in different shades of pink. However, their shared interior wall is open such that pas-  
sengers can move between them. The gate has a play area for children and pastel-pink-  
coloured seating.  
Place-Themed Installations as Markers for Arrivals, Departures,  
and Trajectories Across Cartographic Space  
While we cannot establish how effective these place-themed artworks and installa-  
tions are in terms of stimulating spending, we can assume that their symbolic meaning  
can affect, and in some cases appeal to, the passengers who encounter them. In this  
section, I speculate on how these symbolic references to place might affect travellers in  
terms of their role as markers for arrival and departure. Place-themed representations  
assert that a passenger has entered or is transiting through an area with a distinct iden-  
tity, and they indicate that one has arrived or is about to depart from a specific city  
or region. Like the movement-themed artworks examined in the last chapter, place-  
themed artworks and designs can also stimulate a sense of movement. Unlike the  
kinaesthetic sensations elicited by works such as Slipstream \(Figure I.3\), these works  
evoke an imagined sense of movement across the globe.  
For passengers travelling between Vancouver and Amsterdam, Wilson and Nutter’s  
Orca Chief and the Kelp Forest and Brusse’s I meet you demarcate YVR and Schiphol  
as points of departure and arrival \(Figure 1.5; see Plate 21\). Passengers come across  
the former in YVR’s airside shopping space adjacent to the gates, and they encounter  
the latter at Schiphol upon exiting the airside’s baggage claim area. Without a doubt,  
for those flying to and from these airports, these two pieces convey that they are  
transiting between two different cultural spaces. These types of works also reinforce  
the traveller’s sense that each place is a distinctive point on the globe, and they mark  
their trajectory across a great distance. When this trajectory is considered in terms of  
two points on a map, such as a flight taken from YVR to Schiphol, it is indeed a vast  
movement across cartographic space; however, the air traveller’s lived experience of  
this trajectory is a rather limited experience of movement. On the airplane, the passen-  
ger is confined to a restricted space—they are assigned to a specific seat and expected  
to be belted in place for most of the flight.  
Bruno Latour \(2009\) disputes whether cartographic representations accurately  
depict our lived experience within the world. In a lecture on globalization, he argues  
that his notion of actor-networks and Peter Sloterdijk’s spheres offer more plausi-  
ble conceptions of space.10 Latour also argues that these frameworks allow for more Place-Themed Designs and Mobility 153  
nuanced considerations of apparent global processes and their effects on seemingly  
local sites than the world conceived in terms of res extensa—the Cartesian geometric  
conception of space, which is used to represent the earth’s surface cartographically  
on maps and globes.11 Latour summarizes Sloterdijk’s critique of these assumptions  
that things and people reside in one global space imagined as a geometric expanse\:  
“There is no access to the global for the simple reason that you always move from  
one place to the next through narrow corridors without ever being outside” \(2009,  
141\). Latour’s metaphor resembles many of the actual material spaces of commercial  
air travel that move passengers from place to place across the globe. Departure gates,  
loading bridges, and aircraft cabins are literally “narrow corridors” that move pas-  
sengers and keep them from “ever being outside.”12 However, travellers in these spaces  
are not restricted from having a view to the outside. From the airplane window, they  
see the earth below as a surface, similar to how it is represented cartographically,  
albeit as a view of the earth’s surface scrolled at varying speeds and miniaturized to  
varying scales depending on the airplane’s altitude. This relationship between carto-  
graphic representations and the view of the earth’s surface from the airplane window  
is all the more apparent to air travellers flying with today’s major carriers; many com-  
mercial aircraft have digital screens fixed to seat backings and below overhead bag-  
gage compartments that display maps with the airplane’s location in real time and the  
trajectory of the route already travelled.  
Air travel arguably reinforces a notion of space that is comparable to René Descartes’s  
res extensa. Latour \(2010\) argues that res extensa “is a visual extension of an onto-  
logical projection of a visual representation.” He notes that European perspectival  
paintings influenced Descartes’s conception of res extensa and that he mistakes matter  
for these visual representations of things and spaces. Furthermore, Latour \(2010\) con-  
tends that res extensa is an idealist conception of matter and that it should be referred  
to as “res extensa-cogitans,” as “matter as it is thought by the mind.” Following  
Latour’s argument, I consider cartographic representations and the actual aerial views  
of the earth’s surface as types of res extensa-cogitans that pertain to movement ‘as it is  
thought by the mind.’ While the passenger is moving a great distance from one point  
on the earth to another, the actual experienced movement is one of relative immobil-  
ity within the ‘narrow corridor’ of the aircraft fuselage. The trajectory from YVR to  
Schiphol in terms of res extensa-cogitans, as it is seen on a map or out of an aircraft  
window, is a high-speed crossing across a vast geographic distance; however, if this  
journey’s spatial aspect is considered as Latour suggests, as connections in terms of  
his actor-networks or Sloterdijk’s spheres, then the space linking the departure gate at  
YVR and the arrivals hall at Schiphol is far less expansive than that of the geographic  
distance between them.  
Moving World \(Night & Day\) by Langlands and Bell \(Ben Langlands and Nikki  
Bell\) at Heathrow Terminal 5 addresses how contemporary air travel consists of a net-  
work that allows us to move between distant locations with relative ease \(Figure 5.4\).  
Unlike the other works addressed in this chapter, this piece speaks only generically  
about places, identifying them only by their three-letter airport codes. It consists of  
two eighteen-metre-long glass walls with granite bases that are situated in a boulevard  
between Terminal 5 and its parking garage \(Langlands, Bell, and Wilding 2008; Lynch  
2008\).13 The glass wall by the terminal’s northwest corner is black, and the glass wall  
by its southwest corner is white. The work’s series of three-letter airport codes point to  
an array of faraway destinations that are all accessible from Heathrow. Langlands and Figure 5.4 Langlands and Bell, Moving World \(Night & Day\), London Heathrow Airport,  
United Kingdom, 2008.  
Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2018\). Place-Themed Designs and Mobility 155  
Bell explain that “Moving World is a constellation of the world’s major cities function-  
ing as a non-fiction abstraction to map the persistent transience of modern life. Inter-  
national destinations become a poetry of places, where landing points offer departures  
into the imaginary. In Moving World, human activity is explored through the places  
and structures we inhabit and the routes that penetrate and link them” \(cited in Lynch  
2008, 23\). On both walls, blue neon lights illuminate the three-letter airport codes.  
The lighting sequence varies, but it is not entirely random—the groups of letters lit  
tend to gradually move around the semi-circles from left to right. Langlands and Bell  
allege that this illumination pattern continually stimulates new imagined associations  
between the cities identified.  
Moving World contrasts with most place-themed artworks since it emphasizes the  
interconnectedness of today’s major cities. In many cases, airports that install place-  
themed representations choose to assert an identity associated with a culture that has  
lived within the region for many generations. These depictions of enduring identities  
belonging to particular places are reinforced by the tourist industry; destinations are  
often marketed as places where tourists will encounter the region’s traditional peoples  
and their cultural artefacts. But, places themselves are constantly changing and can  
hardly be defined in terms of an unchanging set of cultures and identities \(Castree  
2003\). YVR emphasizes its local particularity via its numerous Northwest Coast First  
Nations artworks. In this case, airport planners have deployed a type of artwork  
created by groups of people who are the traditional owners of the land in British  
Columbia but are no longer in control of much of this territory—including the island  
where YVR is situated. While many of the province’s First Nations have been stripped  
of the power over their land, their artworks are retained as symbols of the region’s  
identity. Schiphol’s stereotypical Dutch imagery, on the other hand, is symbolic of a  
group that has held control of the region’s territory, albeit with some interruptions,  
since the formation of the Dutch Republic in 1581. This white Christian demographic,  
however, is not the only group residing in the Netherlands; its population consists of  
a diverse group of people, and it became more notably multicultural in the latter half  
of the twentieth century.  
Most place-themed air terminal artworks are similar to those installed at YVR and  
Schiphol; they tend to highlight cultural groups that have lived in the airport’s region  
for an extended period of time. There are, however, some exceptions. Juana Alicia and  
Emmanuel Catarino Montoya’s Sanctuary/Sanctuario at San Francisco’s International  
Terminal refers to recent immigrants living within the city \(see Plate 17\). The fresco  
mural depicts a diverse group of people of various ethnicities. Bas-relief sculptures of  
seabirds adorn its frame and surface. The adjacent panel explains\: “Arrival at SFO  
is the beginning of a new life for many immigrants, just as the surrounding wetlands  
provide sanctuary for shore birds during their annual migration.” The work’s title  
connotes the Sanctuary Movement in the United States during the 1980s that sought  
to protect civil rights for asylum seekers, particularly those from Central America  
\(Ridgley 2008\). San Francisco, which became a City of Refuge in 1985, did not simply  
adopt a symbolic position that supported the movement. The city created municipal  
laws that prevented local authorities from collaborating with federal agencies seek-  
ing to deport illegal immigrants. Sanctuary/Sanctuario is remarkable since it does not  
depict a cultural group that is ‘traditionally’ from the region. The air terminal art-  
work is also noteworthy since it connotes a contentious political issue and airport  
authorities generally avoid displaying controversial themes. However, San Francisco 156 Place-Themed Designs and Mobility  
International is an anomaly; as discussed in Chapter 3, the city’s Arts Commission  
works with the airport to select and install its artworks.  
Even though YVR’s and Schiphol’s place-themed artworks lend to a fixed notion of  
place, these pieces stimulate a sense of movement for those travelling between these  
two locations. These airports’ place-themed artworks define these locations as distinct  
places where one arrives and departs, and their symbolic content informs the pas-  
senger’s idea that they are moving across a vast geographic space \(as it is thought in  
the sense of res extensa-cogitans described above\). Furthermore, these artworks and  
designs point to regions that encompass more space than what these airports occupy.  
At Amsterdam’s Schiphol, Holland Boulevard does not simply point to the airport’s  
metropolitan location, but it refers to the country within which the airport is located.  
At YVR, the Indigenous artworks do not only refer to Vancouver and the Musqueam  
Nation upon whose land the airport is situated; rather, they point to First Nations com-  
munities located throughout British Columbia. The Jade Canoe refers to Haida Gwaii,  
an archipelago approximately seven hundred kilometres away from Vancouver. Reid’s  
sculpture elicits a sense of place that has an even greater cartographic reach than that  
of the metropolitan region surrounding Vancouver’s airport. Moreover, Schiphol’s and  
YVR’s place-themed designs reinforce a notion that arriving and departing passengers  
are entering and exiting distinct and expansive regions which can be identified on  
maps as the Netherlands and British Columbia. What’s more, this expanded sense of  
place bolsters the passenger’s notion that they are travelling a great distance, and it  
amplifies their sensation of movement across cartographic space.  
Transferring passengers at these airports are also reminded that they are passing  
through distinct regions on the globe. Schiphol’s Rijksmuseum, which offers transfer-  
ring passengers a chance to visit a ‘must-see’ sight in the Netherlands, gives them a  
sense that they are passing through a particular place, and its gift shop offers plenty  
of Dutch-themed things to buy as souvenirs \(Figure 3.4\). For a traveller flying from  
Harare to Toronto with a stop in Schiphol, this thoroughfare with artworks by Dutch  
Masters and Delft Blue tea cups and tiles reminds them that they are not simply trans-  
iting between Harare and Toronto but that they are passing over a large expanse of  
water and land which includes numerous nations like the Netherlands. Indeed, this  
sense of imagined movement across cartographic space may appeal to some of these  
passengers, which, in turn, may buoy their mood and entice them to purchase some-  
thing within this Dutch-themed space. At YVR, transferring passengers in the Inter-  
national Terminal’s airside encounter things characteristic of the Pacific Northwest  
\(e.g., Wilson and Nutter’s Orca Chief and the Kelp Forest, a saltwater aquarium, and  
a manufactured rugged creek\) in a commercial space that contains a food court, res-  
taurants, and a number of retail shops.  
Welcoming Arriving Passengers and the Politics of Border Zones  
While place-themed installations are often situated next to commercial areas, some  
airports incorporate these designs into spaces near or within the terminal’s border  
zone. Like the artworks discussed in the previous section, they reinforce a sense of  
transit between countries. These pieces, however, have an even greater effect of stimu-  
lating the sense that one is entering and exiting a country as they are located near the  
area where border agents process and screen travellers. YVR’s International Terminal  
includes artworks in the passageways leading to the border zone to welcome arriving  
passengers. Planners at Delhi’s Terminal 3 have adorned the border screening area Place-Themed Designs and Mobility 157  
itself with artwork. At Hong Kong International Airport, planners have placed an  
artwork that addresses the city-state’s political relationship with China in a space that  
facilitates travel across these countries’ shared border. This section examines the types  
of works chosen for these locations. I consider why their symbolic meaning matters in  
terms of political aspects pertaining to the people that live in these regions, the states  
that govern them, and these countries’ border zones. I also discuss how these pieces  
and their placement differs from the other place-themed artworks in these terminals.  
When the VIAA was planning YVR’s International Terminal during the 1990s, it  
consulted with the Musqueam people—the owners of the unceded territory YVR is  
situated upon \(Musqueam Indian Band 1976\)—to design a passageway that would  
welcome travellers arriving from outside of Canada.14 The VIAA and the Musqueam  
Nation created an installation that is intended to inform passengers that they have  
arrived in a territory where the Musqueam have lived for thousands of years. The  
Musqueam Welcome Area, which consists of artworks by Susan A. Point, Krista Point,  
Robyn Sparrow, Debra Sparrow, Gina Grant, and Helen Callbreath, is incorporated  
into the design of a set of escalators and stairs that lead to the Canada Border Services  
Agency \(CBSA\) screening area \(Figure 4.2; see Plate 28\).  
Rudy Kovach depicted the Musqueam Welcome Area in two watercolours in 1994,  
two years before the International Terminal was completed and opened \(Figure 5.5\).15  
Like Kovach’s rendering of The Jade Canoe examined in Chapter 3, Susan A. Point’s  
Flight \(Spindle Whorl\) is depicted as the central focal point in the space. It hangs on  
the wall adjacent to the stairway’s intermediate landing. The artwork is an enlarged  
version of a tool that is typically fifteen centimetres wide. Unlike the traditional spin-  
dle whorls that the Musqueam use to spin yarn, Point’s sculpture does not include the  
shaft fixed to the centre of the disc. In terms of the two sketches’ compositions, the  
staircase and escalators that lead from the landing to the space below draw one’s eyes  
towards Point’s work. Kovach included a number of passengers in his illustrations.  
While most appear to be moving through the passageway, some are engaging with  
Point’s work, and others have stopped to look at the water cascading in the spaces  
between the stairs and the two escalators heading to the level below. The VIAA and  
the Musqueam Nation intended this rushing water to refer to the Fraser River’s delta,  
the traditional fishing and hunting grounds of the Musqueam people.  
The realized design is similar to Kovach’s sketches from 1994. Passengers walk past  
Flight \(Spindle Whorl\) on the staircase’s landing \(see Plate 28\). This red-cedar disc,  
4.8 metres in diameter, hangs in front of a granite wall with water cascading down  
its face, and it occupies a central focal point for those looking back at the stairway  
from the border screening area \(Figure 4.2\). The water that rushes down the granite  
wall is directed into two channels that flow alongside two escalators flanking a central  
stairway. As travellers head down this lower set of escalators and stairs, they are faced  
with Point’s Musqueam Welcome Figures \(Figure 5.6\).16 These two houseposts stand  
5.2 metres high and are aligned with the two channels of water running on either side  
of the staircase.  
Point intended Flight \(Spindle Whorl\) and her Musqueam Welcome Figures to  
depict two themes\: flight and the Musqueam people \(Laurence 2015; YVR n.d.\). The  
enlarged spindle whorl has two eagles carved into its surface, and the men illustrated  
on the eagles’ wings have salmon ensigns adorned on their chests, which is meant  
to refer to one of the Musqueam’s primary food sources. Point carved the male and  
female figures depicted on the front of each housepost in the traditional Musqueam  
style. The female figure is draped in a ceremonial blanket, a valuable item made with Figure 5.5 Rudy Kovach, Sketch of the Musqueam Welcome Area, 1994. Watercolour.

yarn spun by a spindle whorl. The male figure has two eagles carved into his chest.  
On the back of each housepost, Point attached a circular glass panel with an etching  
of an eagle. Each panel is above a low-relief carving of the same man that Point carved  
onto the eagles’ wings on Flight \(Spindle Whorl\). Below this illustration is another  
low-relief carving. It is a geometric abstraction of two flying geese.  
The VIAA and the Musqueam Nation also commissioned four tapestries which  
now hang from the ceiling beside the two escalators in the Musqueam Welcome Area  
\(see Plate 28\). Krista Point’s, Robyn Sparrow’s, Debra Sparrow’s, and Gina Grant  
and Helen Callbreath’s weavings are examples of the types of blankets which the  
Musqueam used in religious ceremonies. The artists followed traditional weaving pro-  
cesses and replicated the type of imagery applied to these ceremonial blankets. They  
are made from white, yellow, red, and black hand-spun and hand-dyed yarn, and they  
depict abstract shapes including zig zags, diamonds, triangles, squares, and curved  
lines. Debra Sparrow’s tapestry features four winged shapes that mirror the abstracted  
flying geese carved into the base of Point’s Musqueam Welcome Figures.  
As a passageway, the Musqueam Welcome Area achieves a functional aim of  
smooth circulation and successfully directs passengers towards the CBSA screening  
area. However, it is debatable whether it clearly conveys to travellers that they have  
entered Musqueam territory. Unlike the people depicted in Kovach’s watercolours,  
arriving passengers typically rush towards the screening area such that they spend  
less time waiting in the queue and are processed sooner. While Point’s Musqueam  
Welcome Figures appear monumental and certainly capture one’s attention, there are  
no informational panels adjacent to the work to explain their meaning. There are  
small informational panels at the top of the stairs leading into this space that provide  
a brief overview of the Musqueam Welcome Area. These signs, however, are easy to  
miss since they are not placed next to the installations. Point’s Flight \(Spindle Whorl\),  
which also lacks a nearby panel, is less noticeable than her welcome figures since the  
disc is viewed in profile as one walks down the stairs towards the landing. It does,  
however, occupy a central focal point for those looking back at the stairway from the  
border screening area.  
The VIAA’s installation of the Musqueam Welcome Area is indeed a sincere gesture  
that acknowledges the airport’s location on Musqueam land. The installation’s sig-  
nage acknowledges the works’ First Nations authorship, but it does not specifically  
state that YVR is situated on unceded territory nor does it refer to the political aspects  
of First Nations land rights and treaties.17 These political conditions are notable with  
regard to where the Musqueam Welcome Area is situated in the terminal. It is in a  
secured passageway that precedes Canada’s border screening zone, and this area is  
a type of quasi-stateless space. The nebulousness of the law in the international ter-  
minal’s airside was brought to the world’s attention in 2013 when Edward Snowden  
avoided extradition to the US by staying in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International  
Airport. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, argued that his country could not extra-  
dite Snowden because he had not exited the airside onto Russian soil \(Jakes 2013\).  
This case illustrates how the post-security airside appears to be a ‘no man’s land.’ This  
seemingly stateless zone is located before and is apart from the border security area.  
In these screening spaces, the state’s control over passengers is amplified; passengers  
can be detained and deported, and they often cannot dispute these decisions. This  
checkpoint can also be considered a ‘no man’s land,’ particularly with respect to its  
military meaning. Cornelia Vismann \(1997\) describes how the ‘no man’s land’ during  
WWI was a border not defined by a line but by a zone where combatting soldiers were Place-Themed Designs and Mobility 161  
unsure of whether they were on “hostile ground.” Vismann notes that it “finds its  
legal equivalent” in Carl Schmitt’s state of exception, “where the enforcement of posi-  
tive law is suspended” \(1997, 57\). Giorgio Agamben \(2005\) argues that George W.  
Bush’s administration enforced a similar state of exception when it enacted a “military  
order” on November 13, 2001, that allowed the US to detain terrorists for indetermi-  
nate periods and deny them legal status. US authorities have used the airport security  
zone to enforce this state of exception. Agents can intercept anyone deemed to be a  
threat and detain them without charges.18  
Curiously, the artworks installed in the arrivals area at YVR’s International Terminal  
speak to the passage from the ‘no man’s land’ on the airside of the terminal to the state  
of Canada on the landside. At YVR, the Musqueam Welcome Area occupies a set of  
escalators and stairs that all international travellers arriving at YVR must pass through  
on their way to the CBSA screening area \(Figure 5.6\). As noted, this installation is meant  
to signify that YVR is built on land where the Musqueam people used to live, hunt, and  
fish. The Musqueam Welcome Area’s location in the terminal, in the ‘no man’s land’  
situated between one’s arrival gate and the border screening area, is particularly notable  
considering that YVR occupies a space on unceded Musqueam territory. Its placement  
in the one zone of the terminal that in practice has shown to be a quasi-stateless space  
reflects the disputed nature of the Musqueam’s ownership of the land upon which the  
airport is situated. This correlation between the Musqueam Welcome Area and the con-  
tested nature of the space is even more strongly suggested when the artworks of this  
welcome area are contrasted with the pieces in the landside of the terminal. For instance,  
Reid’s The Jade Canoe, which is in the publicly accessible landside area, does not point  
to the Musqueam people and their territory but to Haida Gwaii, which is over seven  
hundred kilometres away \(see Plate 1\).  
19 This artwork is also symbolic of the Canadian  
state. The only other cast of this work, The Black Canoe, was installed in 1991 at the  
Canadian Embassy in Washington D.C. \(Gournay and Loeffler 2002\).20 An etching of  
this work appears on the Canadian twenty-dollar bill printed between 2004 and 2012.21  
The Musqueam Welcome Area and The Jade Canoe are also notably different in terms  
of how passengers view these works. While the Musqueam Welcome Area is a symbolic  
representation and political statement which all arriving passengers will see, it is situated  
in a place where most travellers pass by and spend little time. Reid’s The Jade Canoe, on  
the other hand, is in a place where people are encouraged to wait. Passengers and visi-  
tors can sit in the theatre-like space surrounding the work or wander around the piece  
and read the adjacent informational panel.  
When passengers exit the Canada Customs screening zone and baggage claim area,  
they are greeted by another couple of Indigenous welcome figures \(see Plate 29\). The  
VIAA installed Joe David’s Welcome Figures in 1998 in the publicly accessible area  
of the arrivals level where meeters and greeters await arriving passengers \(O’Neill  
1998; SkyTalk 1998\).22 Although they are not as strong of a visual synecdoche for  
the Canadian state as Reid’s sculpture, David’s Welcome Figures also point to Canada  
and the Province of British Columbia. The Nuu-chah-nulth artist carved the male and  
female figures for the British Columbia Pavilion at Expo ’86, the world’s fair hosted  
in Vancouver that celebrated a theme of transportation. Like Reid’s The Jade Canoe, a  
Musqueam artist did not carve these cedar statues nor do they refer to the Musqueam  
people or their culture. Rather, they are modelled after the traditional welcome fig-  
ures installed in Clayoquot Sound, a coastal region located two hundred kilometres  
away on Vancouver Island. Unlike Point’s Musqueam Welcome Figures, there is an  
informational panel next to David’s cedar statues. It notes\: “Carved in the Clayoquot 162 Place-Themed Designs and Mobility  
tradition, figures such as these would be taken from storage and temporarily posi-  
tioned, with arms raised, on the beach in front of the village, to welcome guests to  
special events.” The Nuu-chah-nulth people would lower these figures’ arms if they  
wanted to signal visitors to stay away.  
David’s two figures, whose arms are raised, are the first artworks that passengers  
encounter after they have officially entered Canada \(see Plate 29\). Although the trav-  
eller’s entry into the state occurs in the CBSA screening zone and baggage claim area,  
the perception that one has actually entered into Vancouver and Canada occurs as  
one passes through the automatic door that separates the public greeting area from  
the secure side of the terminal—David’s Welcome Figures are within the scope of the  
passenger’s view as they cross this boundary. This experience contrasts with how trav-  
ellers move past the welcome figures in the Musqueam Welcome Area \(Figure 5.6\).  
They encounter these figures shortly after they have disembarked from their plane  
and as they walk down the staircase towards the screening area. Even though passen-  
gers often spend a fair amount of time in the space where these sculptures are visible,  
most will spend little time looking at these welcome figures. Moreover, passengers  
who have filed into the queue waiting to be deemed admissible to enter Canada stand  
before the CBSA agents with their backs turned towards Point’s Musqueam Welcome  
Figures, a visual synecdoche for the rightful owners of the land YVR is situated upon.  
International passengers arriving at Delhi Indira Gandhi’s Terminal 3 also encoun-  
ter a place-themed artwork as they approach the border screening zone \(see Plate 3\).  
Ayush Kasliwal’s wall installation, which runs the length of the immigration processing  
area, consists of copper discs and twelve oversized hands depicting mudras. Like YVR’s  
International Terminal, travellers entering this border screening zone descend to a lower  
level via escalators and stairs. However, passengers are not able to rush past Kasliwal’s  
installation since it does not precede the screening area; it is incorporated into its design,  
and it is clearly visible as one waits in the queue leading to the border security officers.23  
Incubis Consultants, an Indian design firm, and Landor Associates, a US branding  
company, devised the terminal’s “Expressive India” decorative scheme \(Lahiri 2010;  
Banerjee 2010\). At the time of the terminal’s opening in 2010, Incubis’s Amit Gulati  
noted that the airport’s operator, GMR Group, was “keen to give the terminal an  
Indian context and infuse it with Indian values” \(cited in Lahiri 2010\).24 Gulati, how-  
ever, asserted that the hand gestures depicted in Kasliwal’s mural do not have any  
religious significance\:  
All classical Indian dance forms use mudras. . . . It’s a common vocabulary. . . . We  
have deliberately avoided any religious motif \[in the hand gestures chosen\]. They  
represent an open-ended symbology rather than a religious philosophy. I would  
say the mudras are not really Hindu in themselves. They represent them in Bud-  
dhist art, Southeast Asian art uses the same kind of mudras. It also ties in with the  
whole idea of yoga, which is again very global. Yoga also has religious undertones  
but it’s perceived as a secular thing.  
\(cited in Lahiri 2010\)25  
Even if these mudras are simply secular statements that do not recall a particu-  
lar religious connotation, these hand gestures do express a cultural meaning. While  
mudras appear in Buddhist art, Kasliwal’s installation calls to mind their use in Hindu  
culture, particularly since these oversized hands are located in a capital city whose Place-Themed Designs and Mobility 163  
population is largely Hindu. Furthermore, they recall the type of ‘Hindu-ness’ that  
the Hindutva nationalist movement seeks to express as India’s culture \(Jaffrelot 1998;  
Hansen 1999; Adeney and Saez 2005; Chacko 2019\). This ideology identifies those  
living on the Indian subcontinent as one cultural group that shares similar Hindu  
values. Unfortunately, the movement has spurred xenophobic sentiments and violence  
against minorities such as Muslims. The Bharatiya Janata Party \(BJP\), which has gov-  
erned India from 1998 until 2004 and from 2014 until the time of writing, supports  
various Hindu nationalist ideals. Priya Chacko examines how the BJP has associated  
the Hindutva ideology with economic growth, and she notes that the party’s “poli-  
cies seek to create an entrepreneurial consumer whose behaviour is regulated by the  
cultural framework of Hindu majoritarianism and is aimed at advancing the Hindu  
nation” \(2019, 407\). India’s current Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has promoted  
cultural practices such as yoga alongside his efforts to expand the country’s economic  
ties abroad. These policies are notable with regard to Kasliwal’s impressive mudras;  
Terminal 3, which opened in time for the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, was  
meant to show the world how India’s economy was flourishing.  
This wall installation is also remarkable compared to the other sculptural works  
installed in Terminal 3. Not only is it the building’s largest work, it is also the piece that  
is most thoroughly incorporated into the terminal’s design. Other sculptures such as The  
Indian Elephant, Satish Gupta’s Surya The Resplendent One, and Nikhil Bhandari’s  
Surya Namaskar are all approximately three to four metres tall and installed within  
the interior without any apparent changes to the building’s design \(Figure 5.7\). They

port, India, 2010.

are placed upon the terminal’s flooring material and surrounded by a guarding wall  
consisting of glass planes approximately one metre high. Like Khaliswal’s rendering of  
mudras, these three sculptures assert a Hindu identity. The informational panels accom-  
panying The Indian Elephant and Surya The Resplendent One explain how these works  
are symbolic of Hindu gods. The Indian Elephant, which is located near the departure  
level’s airline check-in counters, consists of two bronze elephants, an adult and a juve-  
nile. Its panel states\: “The elephant takes many forms, as the vehicle of the gods and in  
the form of Ganesha, the popular and ubiquitous deity of new beginnings, wisdom and  
success.” Gupta’s Surya The Resplendent One is placed in the airside near the gates that  
serve international flights. Its informational panel explains that it represents Surya, the  
Sun God, and that its form is inspired by eleventh-century South Indian Chola bronze  
sculptures. It explains\:  
Surya, the Sun God is rooted in our tradition since Vedic times. It is an integral  
part of our living culture and crosses all religious, state and national boundaries.  
The imposing sight of the Lord of the Universe resplendent in copper and gold  
responds to the impressive architectural volume of the terminal and is a fitting  
tribute to the spirit of India.  
Bhandari’s Surya Namaskar is located in the airside that serves domestic flights and  
depicts the ‘sun salutation’ yoga sequence. It contains twelve figures ascending on a  
spiral performing the sequence’s twelve bodily poses.  
Like Vancouver’s International Terminal, Delhi’s Terminal 3 has an impressive  
place-themed installation that welcomes international passengers before they offi-  
cially enter India. However, the placement of Kasliwal’s installation within the ter-  
minal interior and its relation to the state differ from the Musqueam Welcome  
Area at YVR. In Vancouver, travellers tend to hurry past the Musqueam artworks  
before entering the border screening zone. Whereas in Delhi, passengers face Kasli-  
wal’s monumental piece while they wait in the queue leading to the border security  
agents. While the Musqueam Welcome Area is situated in the airside’s quasi-state-  
less space prior to Canada’s border screening zone, Kasliwal’s piece is placed at the  
point of entry into India. The oversized mudras and copper discs hang above the  
immigration officers, and passengers must stand below them while they are being  
deemed admissible or inadmissible into India. In this respect, its incorporation  
into the border screening area asserts that this piece, which is intended to express  
“Indian values,” is identified with the Indian state. What’s more, these values are  
synonymous with those held by the country’s Hindu majority, and this piece, unlike  
the Musqueam Welcome Area, is associated with the country’s current dominant  
cultural group.  
At Hong Kong International Airport, passengers do not encounter place-themed  
artworks in or on the way to the border screening zone. However, the airport’s  
authority has installed a work in a space dedicated to travel between Hong Kong and  
China, and it addresses the political relationship between these countries. Auspicious  
Coloured Ribbon is situated in Terminal 2 in a publicly accessible waiting area for  
coaches travelling to mainland China \(Figure 5.8\). Passengers boarding these buses  
are screened at a border checkpoint approximately forty-five kilometres away from  
the airport. A plaque, which has been installed beside the work, explains that the  
3.6-metre-tall and 2.4-metre-wide sculpture represents a ribbon floating in the air, and Figure 5.8 Auspicious Coloured Ribbon, Hong Kong International Airport, Hong Kong, Date  
Unknown.  
Source\: Menno Hubregtse \(2014\). 166 Place-Themed Designs and Mobility  
it ardently associates this form with an overly idealized relationship between Hong  
Kong and China. It states\:  
An auspicious symbol, it conveys the wish for the people of Hong Kong to have  
bliss and fortune. Round, coherent and smooth, the ribbon implies ethnic solidar-  
ity, national unity, social harmony and business prosperity. Red on one side and  
blue on the other, the ribbon gradually turns golden as it rises, symbolising the  
success of the concept of ‘one country, two systems’. The gold and silver leaves  
decorating the ribbon signify the return of the fallen leaves to their roots—the  
return of Hong Kong to the motherland—as well as the cyclic rhythm of life.  
This positive assessment of Hong Kong’s return to China is no doubt due to the  
conditions of its manufacture. This artwork is one of thirty-one gifts that China gave  
to the Hong Kong Special Administrative region as part of its handover ceremony  
in July 1997 \(Mickleburgh 1997\). However, this relationship is far from harmoni-  
ous at the time of writing. Throughout 2014, many Hong Kong residents protested  
against China’s control over which candidates are permitted to run for the city-state’s  
leadership \(Vanderklippe 2014\). Protests surged again in 2019 when Hong Kong’s  
China-backed government proposed an extradition law that would allow Hong Kong  
residents and foreigners to be sent to mainland China for trials.26 Some of these dem-  
onstrations took place at Hong Kong International Airport. On July 26, 2019, pro-  
democracy activists assembled at the airport to share their concerns with tourists  
landing in the city-state \(CBC News 2019b\). Protests at the airport, however, were far  
more disruptive on August 12 and 13, 2019, when activists stormed the departures  
area and caused hundreds of flight cancellations \(CBC News 2019a\).  
The sculpture’s location near the transit point linking mainland China to Hong  
Kong International Airport is notable. It appears that the airport’s management pur-  
posely placed a work that reinforces the idea of ‘one country, two systems’ in a space  
frequented by Chinese nationals. Travelling by coach is a convenient option for Chi-  
nese nationals flying into Hong Kong and returning to nearby locations in mainland  
China. While there are indeed some international tourists who travel by coach to  
mainland China, most of the international passengers transiting through the airport  
will not encounter this work since it is on a level below Terminal 2’s check-in area.  
As noted in Chapter 1, Terminal 2 does not have an arrivals area or departure gates;  
it serves as an extra space for the airport’s airline check-in counters and pre-boarding  
security. All arrivals at Hong Kong’s airport are processed in Terminal 1’s arrivals  
area.  
International passengers are more likely to encounter Van Lau’s Ying Yang and the  
replica 1910 Farman biplane, the airport’s only two other permanent installations.  
Ying Yang is situated in a shopping space on the western side of Terminal 1 where the  
concourse branches to two angled north and south wings \(Figure 5.9\). This aluminium  
and brass sculpture is installed under an escalator that leads to first-class lounges a  
floor above. A plaque at the base of the sculpture explains\:  
With an aluminium ring as the principal form, brass forms of Ying and Yang \(Chi-  
nese cosmo elements\) are added and etched with traditional Chinese decorative  
patterns, making it an art work to suggest the mythical philosophical thoughts  
that merging of Ying and Yang elements will give rise to cosmo evolution and

While the description of this work refers to Van Lau’s use of Chinese traditional  
forms, it does not refer to Hong Kong’s political relationship with China. The Farman  
biplane, discussed in Chapter 4, greets arriving and departing passengers in Terminal  
1 \(Figure 4.7\). It is in some respects a place-themed installation since it is a replica of  
the first aircraft to depart from Hong Kong’s soil. Unlike Auspicious Coloured Ribbon  
and Ying Yang, the work does not symbolically refer to Hong Kong’s ties to China.  
Rather, it symbolizes how Hong Kong is a space of international flows since the plane  
was manufactured in France and its pilot, Charles van den Born, was Belgian.  
Like the Musqueam Welcome Area in Vancouver’s International Terminal, Aus-  
picious Coloured Ribbon refers to a contested relationship between the people liv-  
ing in the airport’s region and their government. While the panels accompanying the  
Musqueam artworks do not explain the political aspects of the Musqueam’s tradi-  
tional ownership of the land YVR is built upon, the plaque adjacent to Auspicious  
Coloured Ribbon explicitly defines Hong Kong’s subordinate relationship to China,  
albeit in strictly positive terms. Furthermore, Auspicious Coloured Ribbon differs  
from Kasliwal’s installation in Delhi and the Musqueam Welcome Area since it does  
not appear to be aimed at all international passengers arriving at the airport. Chinese  
travellers transiting between mainland China and Hong Kong are the people who  
most frequently encounter this work, and its meaning specifically addresses a conten-  
tious domestic political issue. While Kasliwal’s piece and the Musqueam artworks 168 Place-Themed Designs and Mobility  
symbolically connote political aspects regarding state governance, these installations  
do not overtly address these issues; these pieces are intended to simply welcome travel-  
lers and convey that they have arrived in a distinct place. As noted, planners often try  
to evoke a sense of place to stimulate spending. Kasliwal’s wall installation is notable  
in this regard since passengers exiting the border screening area are directed into a  
walkthrough duty-free store before entering the terminal’s landside.  
Signifying Place Via Natural and Pseudo-Natural Settings  
Cultural artefacts, symbols, and imagery are not the only inspiration for place-themed  
designs in today’s international airports. Some air terminals include natural and pseudo-  
natural settings to evoke a sense of place. The satellite building for Terminal 1 at Kuala  
Lumpur International Airport contains an open-air ‘jungle’ with a waterfall \(Figure 5.10\).  
This structure has a Greek cross footprint, and the greenspace is in a courtyard in the  
centre. Passengers can enter this enclosed area and walk through the tropical trees and  
plants on a boardwalk. This satellite building serves international flights and is acces-  
sible from Terminal 1’s main building via a train which passes under a taxiway. A tall  
glass wall encloses the circular courtyard, and it blocks one’s view of the apron, the  
runways, and the aircraft accessing the terminal’s gates. While this jungle is an intrigu-  
ing amenity within the satellite terminal, it does not function well in terms of wayfind-  
ing. This courtyard blocks the passenger’s view of the wings branching out from the  
centre, and it prevents them from getting a sense of the building’s layout.  
At Singapore Changi, passengers on the airside can look out to the apron from  
three open-air gardens\: the Cactus Garden and Water Lily Garden in Terminal 1 and  
the Sunflower Garden in Terminal 2. In Terminal 3, passengers can visit the Butterfly  
Garden. It is situated inside the terminal adjacent to a floor-to-ceiling glass wall. The  
garden contains a waterfall as well as a variety of plants and flowers for the hun-  
dreds of butterflies that inhabit this enclosure. In Terminal 2, travellers encounter the  
Orchid Garden in an interior space near a number of retail shops \(see Plate 30\). It  
contains approximately one thousand orchids and is constructed around a waterway  
containing live koi fish. It offers a place to sit away from the glittering shopfronts and  
the streams of passengers rushing to catch their flights. Not all of Changi’s gardens  
offer a respite from commercialism. The Cactus Garden and the Water Lily Garden  
have cafés that sell beverages.  
Changi’s gardens do not contain plants that are solely endemic to the region. The  
Cactus Garden, for instance, contains species from Asia, Africa, and the Americas.  
Even though these gardens include an international selection of plants, they reinforce  
a distinct Singaporean identity—the city promotes itself as a ‘Garden City.’ Since the  
1960s, the city-state’s government has set policies that require greenspace develop-  
ment throughout the growing metropolis \(Yuen 1996\).  
Like Singapore Changi, Vancouver’s YVR incorporates greenery into its termi-  
nals. Unlike Changi’s gardens, which recall Singapore’s manicured and man-made  
greenspaces, YVR’s settings point to British Columbia’s wilderness. These rainforest-  
themed installations, however, consist of a number of artificial plants and animals. For  
instance, the stream running adjacent to the food court in the International Terminal’s  
airside is lined with manufactured rocks and artificial ferns \(see Plate 21\). A few fish  
sculpted from glass are placed in the water to appear as though they are swimming  
in the stream. The airport’s most elaborate pseudo-naturalistic installation is Pacific Figure 5.10 Kisho Kurokawa Architect and Associates, Satellite Building, Terminal 1, Kuala  
Lumpur International Airport, Malaysia, 1998.

Passage \(see Plate 31\), an “arrivals theatre” that welcomes passengers flying from the  
United States \(MacQueen 2000; SkyTalk 2000; Raphael 2000\).27 This outdoor scene,  
which is purportedly similar to the landscapes on Haida Gwaii, includes motion detec-  
tors that activate a sound system that plays loops of bird songs and animal sounds  
\(Conceptron Associates n.d.\). There is also a sound loop of water crashing against  
rocks to evoke the sensation that one is walking along British Columbia’s coastline.  
The passageway consists of a manufactured beachfront and replicated sections of for-  
est made with real timber and ornamented with artificial shrubs and ferns. A number  
of carved wooden figures depicting waterfowl are incorporated into the scene. There is  
also a whaling canoe carved by Nuu-chah-nulth artist Tim Paul and a wharf that pas-  
sengers can walk onto. Connie Watts’s Hetux, a thunderbird, hangs from the ceiling.  
This west-coast-themed “arrivals theatre” is in an elevated glass walkway. The air-  
port’s architects deliberately installed these types of walkways throughout the Inter-  
national Terminal so that arriving passengers could see Vancouver’s coastal mountain  
range and have a sense that they have arrived in British Columbia \(Odam 1994; Dan-  
iels 1995\). In the Pacific Passage, however, the traveller’s gaze is directed towards a  
pseudo-naturalistic scene rather than the real landscape located outside of the terminal.  
At Schiphol, passengers also encounter a nature-themed installation that includes  
a sound loop of singing birds. Unlike YVR’s Pacific Passage, Cor Dera’s Flora of the  
Low Lands does not include life-size replicas of plants and animals \(see Plate 32\). The  
piece, which was installed in 2007 in a corridor leading to the G- and H-gates, consists  
of photos of mammals, birds, and insects and an extensive textual list of plants com-  
mon to the region. Dera’s photos and texts are translucent images and words applied  
to the windows that look out onto the airfield. The work’s placement does not entice  
travellers to stop and read all of the lifeforms listed; it is located next to a travellator  
that whisks passengers along the corridor. Furthermore, the sound loop of chirping  
birds is almost imperceptible since it plays at a low volume and is muffled by the noise  
of bustling passengers and the rolling wheels of their carryon luggage.  
Like the manufactured outdoor scenes at Vancouver’s YVR, Dera’s Flora of the  
Low Lands highlights the wildlife and plant-life that would normally inhabit the land  
occupied by the airport. While their subject matter is similar, their overall effect is  
entirely different. YVR’s Pacific Passage and the stream located near its International  
Terminal’s food court are settings that divert the passenger’s attention away from the  
usual experience of air travel. Dera’s Flora of the Low Lands, on the other hand, asks  
the viewer to contemplate the natural environment without drawing their attention  
away from their current role as an air passenger moving through the airport. In Dera’s  
work the imagery is applied to the windows, and the piece urges the viewer to direct  
their gaze to the aircraft, the jet bridges, and the tarmac outside. In this regard, Dera’s  
installation is remarkable since it reminds the traveller that they are part of a mobility-  
system that negatively impacts the environment. The translucent images emphasize  
how the animals and plants they depict are not in the immediate vicinity; most have  
been displaced by the runways, jet engine noise, and the airport’s operations.  
YVR’s and Schiphol’s exhibition of avian imagery and sound loops of bird songs are  
also notable since airports try to maintain a bird-free zone in the airspace surrounding  
the airfield. Bird strikes can severely damage a jet engine, and in some cases cause a jet  
to crash. For example, on January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 struck a flock  
of Canada geese shortly after taking off from New York City’s LaGuardia Airport.  
The jet engines immediately shut down upon impact. Thankfully, Captain Chesley Place-Themed Designs and Mobility 171  
Sullenberger managed to glide the aircraft into the Hudson River, and all passengers  
and crew on board survived. In order to avoid such mishaps, airport officials use  
various methods to manage the bird population. Schiphol chases birds away using  
loud noises and scarecrows, and it plants types of grasses, shrubs, and trees that are  
unappealing to birds \(Schiphol Group 2019b\). The airport also employs fifteen “bird  
controllers” who patrol the airfield with all-terrain vehicles. Occasionally, they need  
to shoot birds to maintain an airspace safe for jet aircraft.  
Conclusion  
Architects and planners incorporate place-themed installations into air terminal inte-  
riors since they believe that these designs will evoke a sense of place and generate pas-  
senger spending. These artworks and interior designs generally operate as symbols in  
order to convey meanings regarding the airport’s region. Some airports include natural  
or pseudo-natural settings that recall local greenspaces and landscapes. However, most  
place-themed designs point to cultural groups living within the area. Planners often  
highlight only some of these groups while eliding others, and these choices are usu-  
ally determined by commercial imperatives—they select themes that they believe will  
appeal to tourists as well as local travellers. Usually, these representations of regional  
identities highlight groups that have lived in the area for numerous generations. In  
some cases, such as Schiphol, place-themed imagery points to a dominant group with  
regard to the country’s governance. Vancouver’s YVR, on the other hand, celebrates  
a group that has little control over the territory they traditionally own. While these  
representations of identity certainly generate questions regarding their political condi-  
tions, the text panels that accompany these works usually do not refer to these affairs.  
Furthermore, planners generally choose place-themed installations that do not overtly  
address political issues. This is unsurprising since airport authorities aim to create a  
‘comfortable’ environment that is conducive to spending. Nonetheless, these repre-  
sentations of cultural groups are noteworthy with regard to the country’s politics.  
As I have illustrated, these designs’ location in the terminal is significant with regard  
to how and why they assert a particular identity. Kasliwal’s oversized mudras, for  
instance, assert a Hindu identity in a border zone where one is deemed admissible  
or inadmissible to India. While this work’s placement is remarkable in terms of its  
political significance, it is equally notable with regard to commerce. Passengers are  
filtered into a walkthrough duty-free store upon exiting the airport’s border screening  
zone. Indeed, Kasliwal’s installation is like most place-themed designs. These repre-  
sentations of place reinforce that a passenger is arriving or departing from a distinct  
location, and airport planners expect this to be an appealing sensation that encourages  
travellers to spend.

2\. The aviation consulting firm, InterVISTAS, suggests that stores should intersperse local  
products among global brands in order to elicit a sense of place and stimulate passenger  
spending \(Currie and Nunes 2014\). 172 Place-Themed Designs and Mobility

ten-metre-tall totem pole, Celebrating Flight, in YVR’s Link Building.  
4\. See Robin Laurence \(2015\) for a cursory overview of the First Nations artworks installed  
at YVR. Her book catalogues the art pieces installed in the airport and includes descrip-  
tions similar to those listed on the informational panels accompanying the artworks in the  
terminal. See also Sandra Alfoldy’s \(2012\) analysis of the airport’s Northwest Coast First  
Nations’ artworks.  
5\. The Jade Canoe is notable with regard to the history of Indigenous souvenir production  
within coastal British Columbia. Reid’s artworks are inspired by Charles Edenshaw’s wood  
and argillite carvings, which in some cases were created for settlers and travellers visiting  
the Pacific Northwest during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century \(Duffek 1986;  
Warrior 1999\). Edenshaw is Reid’s maternal grandfather’s uncle. When Reid started making  
jewellery and carvings during the 1950s, he replicated Edenshaw’s style and subject matter.  
6\. These planters have been removed. Schiphol redeveloped Holland Boulevard in 2017  
\(Cohen 2017\).  
7\. My translation of the original text in Dutch\: “Je zou het kunnen vergelijken met het vlieg-  
veld in Vancouver. Daar zie je als je aankomt vrijwel direct elementen als indianenbeelden,  
totempalen en stromende bergbeken. Je voelt meteen de elementen van het gebied waar  
Vancouver ligt om je heen.”  
8\. Even though Bangkok Suvarnabhumi’s architecture does not include any symbolic refer-  
ences to Thai identity, the building’s translucent fabric roof is designed specifically for its  
local conditions. Helmut Jahn, in collaboration with Werner Sobek and Matthias Schuler,  
employed a three-layer membrane to protect the interior from Bangkok’s tropical heat,  
high humidity, and intense sunshine while dampening the roaring sounds emitted from the  
jet engines on the apron \(Jahn et al. 2007\).  
9\. While Thailand is largely a Buddhist nation, some of its mythologies draw from Hindu  
sources.  
10\. Sloterdijk \(2009\) arrives at his theory of space by using spheres as a metaphor, which is  
partly influenced by German biologist Jakob von Uexküll’s umwelten. Rather than positing  
that all living beings reside in one universal global space, von Uexküll contends that each  
organism resides in its own perceived world or umwelt.  
11\. In a paper presented at Internationales Kolleg Für Kulturtechnikforschung und Medien-  
philosophie in Weimar, Latour \(2010\) argues that res extensa is not only incongruent with  
how humans perceive and experience lived space but also how material things exist in the  
world.  
12\. There are, of course, many other spaces within airports that are wide expanses such as the  
concourses at Hong Kong International Airport’s Terminal 1 and Heathrow Terminal 5.  
13\. Sadly, only few passengers departing from and arriving at Heathrow Terminal 5 encounter  
Moving World since it is situated in a space where there is barely any passenger traffic.  
The glass walls are situated a fair distance from the nearest covered passageways that con-  
nect the car park to the terminal. Only those who glance off to the building’s perimeter  
while crossing the thirty-five-metre gap might see Langlands and Bell’s work—the walls are  
somewhat obscured by a row of trees on each side of the terminal. When Moving World  
was commissioned, it was expected to be in an urban space alive with numerous pedes-  
trians \(Langlands et al. 2008\). However, during my numerous visits to the terminal, there  
were only a few passengers that ventured away from the covered walkways to spend some  
time outside in the boulevard between the terminal and the parking garage. Most of the  
people that I noticed in this outdoor space were airport workers having a cigarette break or  
eating their lunch while sitting on the granite plinths at the base of Moving World’s walls.  
14\. The VIAA consulted with the Musqueam Nation to determine the installation’s general lay-  
out and which artworks would be appropriate for the airport. See Shannon Leddy’s \(1997\)  
and Alexa Fairchild’s \(2001\) discussions of this consultation process.  
15\. 16. Kovach’s watercolours appear in SkyTalk \(1994\) and Day \(1994\).  
When the terminal first opened, the Musqueam Welcome Figures consisted of a male carved  
by Shane Pointe and a female carved by Susan A. Point \(O’Neill 1997\). In May 1997, the  
VIAA replaced Shane Pointe’s male figure with a new male figure by Susan A. Point, which  
she carved out of the same red-cedar log as her female figure. The VIAA moved Shane Place-Themed Designs and Mobility 173  
Pointe’s male figure to the Domestic Terminal and installed it alongside a female figure  
carved by Pointe.  
17\. While none of YVR’s information panels address that the airport is located on unceded ter-  
ritory, they do suggest that British Columbia’s Indigenous peoples have lived in the region  
since time immemorial. Moreover, the VIAA portrays Northwest Coast First Nations peo-  
ple as being ‘one with the land,’ and it has largely chosen First Nations artworks in a tradi-  
tional style. These pieces differ from more critical works by artists such as Lawrence Paul  
Yuxweluptun, whose work addresses land claims, and Brian Jungen, whose work critiques  
the commercialisation of Indigenous art \(Barton 2001\). Marianne Nicolson’s The Rivers  
Monument, however, is an exception \(Figure 3.11\). The installation’s two poles refer to  
how colonization has negatively impacted the Columbia River and the Fraser River. While  
its informational panel describes how dams have harmed salmon runs and damaged Indig-  
enous petroglyphs and pictographs, it does not explicitly address issues regarding treaties  
and unceded territory. The VIAA’s overall apolitical display of First Nations art certainly  
supports its larger aim to create a ‘comfortable’ environment where passengers are encour-  
aged to spend. Dylan Robinson \(2016\) discusses how YVR’s welcome figures and other  
Indigenous gestures of welcome in Vancouver highlight First Nations culture but elide  
issues regarding Indigenous sovereignty. Charlotte Townsend-Gault \(2011\) provides an in-  
depth discussion of how First Nations are represented with respect to land issues \(see also  
Cardinal-Schubert 1997; Braun 2002; Townsend-Gault 2004; Young and Brunk 2009\).  
18\. Sometimes passengers are detained for erroneous reasons. US authorities interrogated and  
held Maher Arar, a Syria-born Canadian, at JFK Airport in New York on September 26,  
2002, based on wrong information \(Lobel 2008\). They confined him in this ‘no man’s land’  
before deporting him to Syria, where he was incarcerated for more than a year.  
19\. See also Leddy’s \(1997\) analysis of Reid’s The Jade Canoe as a Haida artwork in a building  
on Musqueam land.  
20\. YVR’s The Jade Canoe is the second and final casting of Reid’s sculpture. Unlike The Black  
Canoe, it is painted with a jade-green patina.  
21\. Canada’s recent celebration of Haida artworks contrasts with its efforts to eradicate this  
culture in the late-nineteenth to mid-twentieth century. From 1884 to 1951, the federal  
government banned potlatches, a Northwest Coast Indigenous gift-giving celebration that  
often involved an exchange of carved goods. During the 1880s, it also initiated its residen-  
tial school system, a program that forced First Nations children out of their communities  
and assimilated them into the dominant settler culture. Thankfully, the Northwest Coast  
First Nations people did not entirely lose touch with their traditional carving practices; a  
number of artists maintained their skills by carving goods for their own communities as  
well as souvenirs for tourist markets \(Phillips 2010\).  
22\. 23. Joe David’s Welcome Figures are on loan from the Museum of Vancouver.  
Kasliwal created a similar mural for Terminal 3’s domestic arrivals area. It hangs above the  
passageway leading to the baggage claim.  
24\. GMR Group is a private airport development firm. In 2006 it won the commission to man-  
age Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport and build its new Terminal 3 \(Delhi Indira  
Gandhi International Airport n.d.\).  
25\. Kasliwal’s piece depicts the following nine mudras\: Abhaya, Varada, Akasha, Mayur,  
Chatura, Tripataka, Prana, Trishul, Pranayama \(DIAL and Incubis Consultants n.d.\).  
26\. One of the largest protests occurred on June 16, 2019 \(BBC News 2019\). The organizers  
estimated that approximately two million of the city’s seven million residents joined the  
demonstration. The city’s police force, on the other hand, counted 338,000 people during  
the protest’s peak period.  
27\. Architectura, now Stantec, designed Pacific Passage as part of an expansion to the Inter-  
national Terminal. This included an extension of the concourse, completed in 1999, and  
seven new gates, completed in 2000, that were dedicated to flights departing to and arriv-  
ing from the United States. 174 Place-Themed Designs and Mobility

art/musqueam-welcome-area. Conclusion  
I have illustrated how architects and planners design air terminal interiors to affect  
passenger behaviour and to actively contribute to the airport’s operation. These inte-  
riors, which often include artworks, support the terminal’s primary function which is  
to move air travellers from the curb to the plane and to encourage them to spend their  
money while they spend their time waiting. Ceiling designs, flooring patterns, lighting,  
artworks, and many other aspects of the building’s interior are designed to direct pas-  
sengers to walk along routes in the terminal that are lined with numerous stores and  
restaurants. Most new terminals are large open concourses with floor-to-ceiling glass  
walls, and architects incorporate sightlines facing the apron since views of the aircraft  
help with orientation. Architects and planners use these strategies to make it easier for  
passengers to navigate the terminal and to limit the amount of signage in the space.  
Moreover, they attempt to create an interior where travellers follow intuitive cues and  
do not need to rely on signs for every step of the way.  
These planning principles, which assume that the material aspects of air terminal  
design can facilitate passengers’ actions, resemble one of actor-network theory’s cen-  
tral concerns—non-human things have agency and can affect social relations. I have  
concentrated on designs such as skylights and flooring patterns that predominately  
operate on a visual register to direct passenger movement. I argue that these designs  
constitute an aesthetic type determined by their purpose and that this functional aes-  
thetic pertains to their effectiveness for wayfinding. My analysis, however, has not  
concentrated on judging air terminal designs for their value. But, by theorizing air ter-  
minal design in terms of a functional aesthetic, I have outlined some of the parameters  
for those who do wish to cast a judgement on these things’ aesthetics and efficacy.  
In some cases, architects and planners install air terminal artworks to aid with  
passenger navigation. These pieces are material and visual cues that support wayfind-  
ing, and they constitute a similar functional aesthetic. Architects and planners often  
choose conspicuous installations as eye-catching landmarks for orientation, and they  
usually place them near food courts and stores to draw travellers into these consumer  
spaces. They also place artworks and designs such as water walls near the airport’s  
screening zones in order to calm passengers. Indeed, architects and planners select  
artworks with particular material qualities based on their purpose as a landmark or  
as a pacifying installation. Yet, they also choose pieces with specific types of symbolic  
imagery. Airport authorities often commission artworks and other interior designs  
that convey themes related to the region in which the airport is located. They presume  
that these installations, which lend to the terminal’s sense of place, will positively  
affect passengers’ moods and spur them to spend. Conclusion 179  
Another prevailing theme among air terminal artworks is movement. These installa-  
tions often connote types of movement that are relatively free and unrestricted. I argue  
that this type of imagery is able to affect passengers and generate sensations of kin-  
aesthesia. The tendency to install artworks defined by an aesthetic of unregulated  
movement is notable when considering the environment they are located in—one that  
is purposely designed to organize passengers into directional flows. These representa-  
tions of unrestricted movement are conveyed by works consisting of static compo-  
nents. There are some kinetic artworks that also depict movement, but these works  
tend to replicate smooth harmonic flows. Singapore Changi has installed these types  
of pieces to create a calming ambiance that alleviates passenger anxiety. Like repre-  
sentations of unconstrained movement, these depictions of harmonic motions contrast  
with the stop-and-go processes that airports employ to direct passenger streams, and  
they divert the traveller’s attention away from their experience of regulated mobility  
in the terminal.  
In this book, I have examined what architects and planners expect passengers to  
feel when they interact with these installations. I have also speculated on how these  
artworks might affect passengers, and I have considered how this experience can be  
different for each traveller. However, this analysis is based on the designers’ inten-  
tions and my perspective and not on the experiences of the millions of passengers that  
view these works each year. Even though this analysis of the affective potential of  
air terminal artworks is based on an assumption of how these things might affect air  
travellers, it illustrates the types of effects air terminal planners believe artworks will  
have on passengers. In short, airport authorities commission and install artworks that  
they believe will buoy one’s mood, and they hope that this will stimulate consumption.  
Yet, the co-relation between increased passenger spending and artworks has not been  
proven. The actual effect that these artworks have on air travellers is indeed a topic  
for future study.  
This investigation also demonstrates how air terminal artworks constitute a unique  
form of public artwork. Other commercial spaces such as shopping centres and down-  
town retail streets incorporate artworks; however, these places do not contain their  
publics for extended periods of time. Air terminals, on the other hand, hold pas-  
sengers in commercial areas such as post-security departure lounges. In many cases,  
travellers are required to walk past an artwork or wait in a space next to an instal-  
lation. Passengers departing from Schiphol’s Departure Hall 3 must walk past Daan  
Roosegaarde’s Beyond on their way to the pre-boarding security area, and travellers  
arriving on international flights at Delhi Indira Gandhi’s Terminal 3 must stand below  
Ayush Kasliwal’s oversized mudras while they wait in the border screening area \(Fig-  
ure 4.1; see Plate 3\). The latter artwork illustrates how air terminal installations are  
a noteworthy and distinctive type of public art due to their placement in a node that  
filters flows of people across borders. For many travellers, their first actual impression  
of a country occurs within the air terminal. Artworks, particularly those that convey  
themes of place, suggest what is culturally significant for the nation. Furthermore, air  
terminal installations are steadily becoming more meaningful for more people; with  
the rise of low-cost airlines, more people are choosing to fly and passenger traffic  
keeps increasing in today’s terminals.  
International airports are part of a global infrastructure that assists the flows of peo-  
ple and capital. This book demonstrates that their terminal buildings—designed largely  
in terms of utilitarian purposes—should not be dismissed as entirely characterless 180 Conclusion  
‘non-places’ lacking aesthetic consideration. Air terminals are designed by architects  
and planners who make aesthetic choices that are particular to each location and are  
meant to fulfil the functional aims of these carefully engineered spaces, which are  
experienced materially, affectively, aesthetically, and kinaesthetically by the passengers  
transiting through them. Index
