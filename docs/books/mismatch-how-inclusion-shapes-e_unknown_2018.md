viii FOREWORD  
When I started to blog about the topic of design in the early 2000s,  
it was a time when there were still DVD players and the iPhone  
hadn’t emerged yet. The cloud was just starting to cover the hori-  
zon of the sky- of- user- experience, and technology was just starting  
to make us happier and yet unhappier too. There needed to be a  
way to connect how technologists make products with the way pre-  
technologies were crafted by design— and thus the Laws of Simplic-  
ity \(LoS\) were born.  
Luckily, I learned at an early enough age that I really don’t have  
all the answers. So I have been actively looking these past few years  
for ways to think of design in the future by searching out the rising  
lights. A chance search hit on the Internet led me to the work of  
Kat Holmes on “inclusive design.” This was back when she was at  
Microsoft— and frankly back then, Microsoft wasn’t the first name FOREWORD  
you’d think of when you wanted to imagine the future of design.  
But, I thought, “This is it!”  
Because, spending time in Silicon Valley and working across  
hundreds of technology startups as a partner at venture capital firm  
Kleiner Perkins, I intuitively felt that Kat had the solution to some-  
thing truly important. Inclusive design was what was missing in  
the tech products being shipped to millions— ultimately leading to  
a fundamental mismatch between what people needed and what  
the techies in Silicon Valley were shipping out to them. I firmly  
believe that Kat holds the key to addressing the unfortunate set of  
common biases in how we make products in tech\: for “ourselves” as  
a representative sample of the people in the world. So I reached out  
to her with a cold email and have been grateful ever since that she  
returned that first email message.  
Kat Holmes brings us the right message about design, at just the  
right time. Her message isn’t one of simplicity at all— she forces us  
to think about the complexity. According to how Kat sees the world,  
there can be no simplicity unless we understand the complexities  
of how and why products get built today. As you may recall, the 5th  
Law of Simplicity says\:  
Simplicity and complexity need each other.  
Designing for simplicity tomorrow will be impossible unless we  
make the effort to understand the underlying complexities of how  
we design today. If we don’t, we’ll only create more mismatches. We’ll  
create experiences that are simple for people like ourselves, only.  
We need to ask the difficult question of who gets to make the  
products that we use today— because it ties directly into what gets  
x FOREWORD  
made. This is the central question that Kat helps us wade into,  
with tact, theory, and concrete actionable advice for how to navi-  
gate this new way to design that is essential for any product maker  
out there.  
As Kat says, “For better or worse, the people who design the  
touchpoints of society determine who can participate and who’s left  
out. Often unwittingly.” And, “If design is the source of mismatches  
and exclusion, can it also be the remedy? Yes. But it takes work.”  
Good luck in doing that work. I’m doing that work right now too.

Soon after I agreed to write Mismatch, my house flooded. Fifty thou-  
sand gallons of water and thirty- five thousand words later, it’s all a  
bit of blur. These pages were written nomadically\: in airplane seats,  
hotel lobbies, coffee shops, kitchen tables, library corners, and  
even on the front steps of several porches. I’m deeply grateful to  
all the people who shared their homes, meals, and friendship with  
my family during this time. In particular, the Woodman, Wither-

And finally, to my partner, Don, the rock that our family is built  
upon. When I decided to write a book, you didn’t even flinch. While  
I wrote, you shifted entire planets around me so I could focus.  
Remember when I made you read scores of disparate pages, over  
and over again, and then accused you of not really having read the  
book? Thanks for thinking that was funny. Our life is made possible  
by all that you create.  
xv 1 WELCOME  
Mismatches make us misfits.  
Where did you love to play as a child? Maybe it was a tree near  
your home. A video game where you battled your way through new  
worlds. Or, like me, a fort you built out of boxes and blankets.  
I’ve been talking about playgrounds a lot lately. I’ve been sliding  
on a lot of slides and trying out a lot of swings. I’ve listened to peo-  
ple talk about why they came to play and wondered who wasn’t able  
to join in. All this may seem odd for an adult who designs technol-  
ogy for a living, but here’s why it matters\: Designing for inclusion  
starts with recognizing exclusion.  
A playground is a perfect microcosm for learning how to start.  
Think back to the objects and people that occupied your play space.  
Try to remember what worked well for you. It’s likely there were  
moments when you were happy to play alone and other moments  
when you played together with many children. Can you describe  
what it was that made those spaces inclusive? CHAPTER 1  
It’s also likely there were moments when you felt left out, either  
because there was an object that you couldn’t use, or because you  
were ostracized by the people around you. What was it that made  
these spaces exclusionary?  
The objects and people around us influence our ability to partic-  
ipate. Not just when playing on a playground, but in all aspects of  
society. Our cities, workplaces, technologies, even our interactions  
with each other are touchpoints for accessing the world around us.  
When we meet those access points, sometimes we can interact with  
them easily and sometimes we can’t. When we can’t interact with ease,  
many of us will try to adapt ourselves to make the interaction work.  
There are also times when no degree of creativity will make it possible  
to use a solution that simply doesn’t fit a person’s body or mind.  
Examples of this are all around us. It’s the reason why a child  
climbs onto a counter to wash their hands at a sink. It’s why people  
are left searching for instructions on how to navigate a software  
application when it’s updated with new features. Anyone who’s  
tried to order lunch off a menu that’s written in a language they  
don’t understand is in the middle of a mismatched interaction.  
This is the power of mismatches. They make aspects of society  
accessible to some people, but not all people.  
Mismatches are barriers to interacting with the world around us.  
They are a byproduct of how our world is designed.  
Mismatches are the building blocks of exclusion. They can feel like  
little moments of exasperation when a technology product doesn’t  
work the way we think it should. Or they can feel like running into a  
locked door marked with a big sign that says “keep out.” Both hurt.  
In this book we’ll take a deep dive into how inclusion can be a  
source of innovation and growth, especially for digital technologies.  
2 WELCOME  
Figure 1.1  
Human- to- human interactions are full of mismatches, but people are  
able to adapt themselves in an effort to connect with each other.  
It can be a catalyst for creativity and an economic imperative. And  
we’ll contend with a central challenge\: is it even possible to design  
for all human diversity?  
I’ve built a career promoting inclusion through design methods,  
also known as inclusive design. Like many people, I initially took  
inclusion at face value as a good thing. Yet I also found that people  
rarely made it a consistent priority. I wanted to understand why.  
3 CHAPTER 1  
There are many challenges that stand in the way of inclusion,  
the sneakiest of which are sympathy and pity. Treating inclusion  
as a benevolent mission increases the separation between people.  
Believing that it should prevail simply because it’s the right thing  
to do is the fastest way to undermine its progress. To its own detri-  
ment, inclusion is often categorized as a feel- good activity.  
With this in mind, we will test our assumptions about inclusion  
and how it shows up in the world around us. We’ll explore the rea-  
sons why our society perpetuates exclusion and new principles for  
shifting that cycle toward inclusive growth.  
MISFITS BY DESIGN  
What happens when a designed object rejects us? A door that won’t  
open. A transit system that won’t service our neighborhood. A com-  
puter mouse that doesn’t work for people who are left- handed. A touch-  
screen payment system at a grocery store that only works for people  
who read English phrases, have 20/20 vision, and use a credit card.  
When we’re excluded by these designs, how does it shape our  
sense of belonging in the world? This question led me from play-  
grounds to computer systems, from Detroit public housing to vir-  
tual gaming worlds.  
Ask a hundred people what inclusion means and you’ll get a hun-  
dred different answers. Ask them what it means to be excluded and  
the answer will be uniformly clear\: It’s when you’re left out.  
Imagine children climbing on a playground. How are they climb-  
ing? Are they on a ladder, stairs, ramps, ropes, boulders, or maybe  
a tree? Now imagine who designs the features of that playground  
and the assumptions they make about the people who will play in it.  
4 WELCOME  
As you might expect, many playground designers are extraordinary  
advocates for inclusive spaces.  
One cloudy San Francisco morning, while we were interview-  
ing Susan Goltsman, she led our team through a park that she  
designed, pointing out the features that make it inclusive. A gently  
sloping ramp that reaches the highest lookout points. A harmoni-  
ously ringing gamelan, an Indonesian instrument on which “you  
can’t play a bad tune.”  
A frenzy of children of various ages and abilities play together  
throughout the park. Their shouting and laughter are hard to compete  
with. With her feet in the sand, next to a giant sculpture of a sea turtle,  
Susan revealed the most important aspect of her design process\:  
We interviewed kids with varying levels of disability, and the more severe  
the disability, the more vicarious the play. So the child who could not move  
very much was playing full- on in their brain, using other kids out on that  
play area to play through. So access means a lot of different things to a lot  
of different people.  
Goltsman was a founding principal of the design firm Moore,  
Iacofano, Goltsman \(MIG\). Her influence extended far beyond  
childhood play spaces. One of the early pioneers in inclusive design,  
her contributions to policy and standards have influenced many  
major North American cities.1  
An inclusive environment is far more than the shape of its doors,  
chairs, and rampways. It also considers the psychological and emo-  
tional impact on people. In partnering with Goltsman I learned that  
what’s true for a playground is true for all human habitats, includ-  
ing the online world.  
From a young age, we test the waters of acceptance by asking  
“can I play?” The response to this question can make our hearts  
5 CHAPTER 1  
soar or crush us. Over our lives we learn how to ask more subtly or  
we simply stop asking. Sometimes we push forward, regardless of  
rejection, to prove ourselves.  
Core elements of our identities are formed by our encounters  
with inclusion and exclusion. We decide where we belong and  
where we’re outsiders. It shapes our sense of value and what we  
believe we can contribute. Exclusion, and the social rejection that  
often accompanies it, are universal human experiences. We all  
know how it feels when we don’t fit in.  
Figure 1.2  
Mismatches between people and objects, physical or digital, happen  
when the object doesn’t fit a person’s needs. People often have to adapt  
themselves to make an object work.  
For better or worse, the people who design the touchpoints of  
society determine who can participate and who’s left out. Often  
unwittingly. A cycle of exclusion permeates our society. It hinders  
6 WELCOME  
economic growth and undermines business success. It harms our  
collective and individual well- being. Design shapes our ability to  
access, participate in, and contribute to the world.  
If design is the source of mismatches and exclusion, can it also be  
the remedy? Yes. But it takes work.  
We must broaden our definition of design and designers. We must  
test our assumptions about human beings. We must wonder “who  
am I excluding?” and allow the answers to change our solutions.  
Above all, we must be willing to acknowledge how much we don’t  
know about inclusion. No one is an expert in inclusion in all areas  
of life. We are naturally better at exclusion, for reasons that we’ll  
explore in the coming chapters. Knowing this, we can find better  
ways to forge ahead.  
FEARS AND OPPORTUNITIES  
There is a growing interest in making inclusion a positive goal for  
companies, teams, and products. The first actions for reaching that  
goal can be the most challenging. As with any expertise, inclusion  
is a skill that’s developed with practice over time.  
Where in life do we learn inclusive skills? In my education as an  
engineer, designer, and citizen I never formally learned about inclu-  
sion or exclusion. Accessibility, sociology, and civil rights weren’t  
required curricula for learning how to build technology.  
As I grew in my career as a technologist, I noticed a void of  
information on how to practice inclusive design for digital tech-  
nologies. Most examples of universal design applied to sidewalk  
curb cuts and kitchen utensils. It was unclear how to achieve  
similar outcomes in the design of digital technology. In search  
7 CHAPTER 1  
of guidance, I realized that many people had the same question\:  
where do I start?  
Today, my answer to this question is always the same. There are  
many misconceptions about inclusion. It’s important to know what  
you’re getting into. These three fears of inclusion will likely strike you  
at some point. If so, you’re not alone. But from each of them grows an  
insight into the nature of inclusion.  
1\. Inclusion isn’t nice  
One of the most common fears related to inclusion is a fear of using  
the wrong words. Many leaders would rather avoid the topic than  
look bad or offend someone. There isn’t a robust lexicon for inclusion.  
There are many different interpretations of the word “inclusion,” but  
very little guidance on what exactly this word means.  
As a result, it can be easy to mistake nice words for good inten-  
tions. A person or company that offers the right language might  
not take meaningful action. It can also be easy to chastise some-  
one who is committed to inclusion but who uses the wrong words.  
There’s a strange irony when a group of people who are passionate  
about inclusion ostracize a person for saying the wrong thing. This  
is common across different languages and cultures.  
That said, people sometimes say hateful things— and fully mean  
it. These words can reflect their true motivations. Often, they can be  
aimed at hurting groups of people who already experience the great-  
est amount of exclusion. This dangerous behavior is not addressed in  
this book. Instead, we will focus on the types of exclusion that emerge  
from being new to the topic and from unchecked exclusionary habits.  
Inclusion isn’t nice. It’s challenging the status quo and fighting  
for hard- won victories. The opportunity is to be clear and rigorously  
8 WELCOME  
improve our lexicon for inclusion. We can work on clarifying what  
we mean and why we care. We can create better resources through  
education and awareness. Asking questions, and then simply listen-  
ing, is often the most courageous way to start.  
Words hold a power to facilitate or freeze progress toward inclu-  
sion. Without a shared language, teams struggle to produce tan-  
gible results. The topic can often become emotionally charged if  
personal biases and pain dominate the conversation. Building a  
better vocabulary for inclusion starts with improving on the limited  
one that exists today. Sometimes we will use words that hurt people.  
What matters most is what we do next.  
2\. Inclusion is imperfect  
The second fear is of getting it wrong. And you likely will, at first.  
You’ll likely never achieve a perfectly universal solution that works  
for everyone in every situation. A common concern of designers is  
being forced to create a lowest- common- denominator design. Try-  
ing to please everyone is good for no one.  
The underlying challenge is the vast complexity of human diver-  
sity. There are endless nuances and considerations when designing  
for people. There is no single answer that suits everyone. Accessible  
solutions are always, inevitably, accessible to some but not all peo-  
ple. A bathroom stall designed for a person who uses a wheelchair  
is often inaccessible to someone who stands three and a half feet  
tall.  
Inclusion is imperfect and requires humility. It’s an opportunity  
to be curious and approach challenges with a desire to learn. It  
teaches us new ways to adapt our solutions to what people need,  
which is sometimes different from how a designer thought their  
9 CHAPTER 1  
solution would work. In this book we’ll look for unifying threads to  
guide us as we design for human diversity.  
3\. Inclusion is ongoing  
The third fear is scarcity. There are rarely enough talented peo-  
ple, time, and money to make a sudden sea change in inclusivity.  
Urgency, especially in growth- led businesses, is a constant pres-  
sure. The tradeoffs are never easy.  
As a result, the work of inclusion is never done. It’s like caring  
for your teeth. There is no finish line. No matter how well you clean  
your teeth today, over time they require more care. With inclusion,  
each time we create a new solution it requires careful attention in  
its initial design and maintenance over time.  
This underscores the beauty of constraints. We can learn how to  
choose great design constraints, ones that incorporate perspectives  
we haven’t yet considered. It’s a skill that we can sustain indefinitely  
if we build it into how we work, embedded into the entire process of  
creating solutions.  
Inclusion is ongoing and in search of a better vocabulary. By asso-  
ciation, so is this book. In writing it, I had to constantly remind  
myself that no one has all the answers. As a reader, I invite you to  
remember this as well.  
In fact, I have a sneaking suspicion that it might not be possible  
to definitively design this elusive thing we call inclusion. Exclusion,  
conversely, is recognizable. It’s measurable and tangible. When  
someone is excluded they know it unequivocally. The experience  
has an emotional and functional impact on them.  
Perhaps, instead, all we can do is recognize and remedy the mis-  
matched interactions in our world. The concrete nature of exclusion  
10 WELCOME  
gives us something we can deconstruct. With our fears and imper-  
fections in tow, exclusion is where we’ll start.  
WHY YOU, WHY NOW?  
This book isn’t an argument that everyone should be inclusive all the  
time. It’s a case for why we should take responsibility for inclusion  
as a matter intentional choice, rather than risking an unintentional  
harm. Can we understand the exclusion created by our solutions  
before we release them into the world, and design something better?  
Exclusion isn’t inherently bad, nor inclusion inherently good. But  
in a society that sets goals such as a constitutional promise of equal  
rights and opportunity, barriers to that equality are problematic. For  
groups with capitalistic motivations, exclusion hinders business  
growth. A mismatch haunts any designer or technologist who aims  
to create great solutions but realizes just how much people struggle to  
successfully use their design.  
These factors are amplified by the digital age. Technologies are  
permeating our public and private spaces. The modern marketer,  
engineer, or designer is expected to build solutions that reach mil-  
lions if not billions of people. At that scale, one small exclusionary  
misstep can have an amplifying negative effect. Conversely, one  
small change toward inclusion can benefit many people in a pos-  
itive way.  
With respect to business justifications for inclusive design, there  
are four key categories that we’ll explore in the stories ahead, with a  
review of each one in chapter 8\:  
■ Customer engagement and contribution,  
■ Growing a larger customer base,  
11 CHAPTER 1  
■ Innovation and differentiation,  
■ Avoiding the high cost of retrofitting inclusion.  
There are also concrete social benefits to inclusion. Each time we  
remedy a mismatched interaction, we open an opportunity for more  
people to contribute to society in meaningful ways. This, in turn,  
changes who can participate in building our world.  
Designing for human diversity might be the key to our collective  
future. It’s going to take a great diversity of talent, working together,  
to address the challenges we face in the 21st century\: climate change,  
urbanization, mass migration, increased longevity and aging pop-  
ulations, early childhood development, social isolation, education,  
and caring for the most vulnerable among us in an ever- widening  
gap of economic disparity. You never know where, or who, a great  
solution will come from.  
Already there are inclusive solutions quietly at work in our  
world. They are the early examples by which to measure inclusive  
outcomes. Their features, and the people who created them, share  
common threads which are captured here as three inclusive design  
principles. These will reappear in the coming chapters.  
Recognize  
exclusion.  
Figure 1.3  
Learn from  
diversity.  
Solve for one,  
extend to many.  
12 WELCOME  
■ Recognize exclusion. Exclusion happens when we solve problems  
using our own biases.  
■ Learn from human diversity. Human beings are the real experts in  
adapting to diversity.  
■ Solve for one, extend to many. Focus on what’s universally impor-  
tant to all humans.  
These principles are derived from partnerships with inclusive  
design leaders, a heritage of successful innovations, and thousands  
of hours of applying them to product development. To include is a  
verb. In turn, these principles are also action- oriented.  
In business and technology, we commonly look to leaders for  
guidance on how to be successful in new areas of expertise. I’m  
often asked for names of companies that are leading examples  
of inclusion. It’s debatable whether any company is leading, yet.  
Many are talking about it, most are still early in their journey  
toward improvement. When it comes to inclusion, companies, and  
their leaders, have a lot to learn from a very specific kind of leader.  
It’s not the prominent executive at a high- profile company. Not the  
faces that grace the covers of industry magazines. Not the people  
with the highest social media following.  
We have the most to learn from leaders who’ve experienced great  
degrees of exclusion in their own lives.  
Their expertise in exclusion means they can acutely recognize  
it in the world. It fuels their talent as problem solvers. This book  
follows leaders who are turning this expertise into action through  
design. They don’t have all the answers, but they are finding better  
problems to solve. They are working through it, trying new angles,  
and navigating new paths that will benefit all of us.  
13 CHAPTER 1  
With this in mind I’ve chosen specific stories of pioneers whose  
work on inclusion stems from their own exclusion. When they, and  
many more leaders with similar expertise, fill the ranks of the most  
visible positions in society, we’ll know that all of us were good stu-  
dents of their work. Until then, I encourage you to seek out the  
excluded leaders in your community.  
Often I meet new people, stories, and tools dedicated to advancing  
inclusion. I collect these at www.mismatch.design. These resources  
are a living companion to this book. I look forward to sharing them  
with you and evolving them with your input.  
Whatever your reason for choosing this book, thank you for  
reading. Your contributions to building a more inclusive world will  
reach farther than you can imagine. You will find new ways to recog-  
nize and resolve mismatches in the world around you. In turn, you  
might be surprised by who shows up to play.  
Welcome.

TAKEAWAYS\: MISMATCHES MAKE US MISFITS  
■ Inclusion is about challenging the status quo and fighting for  
hard- won victories.  
■ People’s touchpoints with each other and with society are full of  
mismatched interactions. Design is a source of these mismatches,  
and can also be a remedy.  
■ Inclusion is ongoing, imperfect, and not nice.  
■ Exclusion isn’t inherently negative, but it should at least be an  
intentional choice rather than an accidental harm.  
14 2 SHUT IN, SHUT OUT  
The games we play.  
Imagine you work in an office with other people. One day, you  
arrive at work to discover a new rule is in effect. Maybe it’s sent to  
you by the CEO of the company, or simply printed on a poster by  
the coffee machine\:  
You can’t say “you can’t play.” Effective immediately, if anyone wants to par-  
ticipate in your project you must agree to let them join. Yes, you will still be  
held accountable for the success of your work.  
How would you react? Although the exact results might vary,  
there’s a good chance that most adults might mirror the reactions  
you’d find with a group of young children\: anger, defiance, and a  
few tears.  
In her book You Can’t Say You Can’t Play, teacher Vivian Gussin  
Paley recounts what happened when she proposed this rule to her  
kindergarten class. CHAPTER 2  
Before enacting the rule, she and her students speculated on what  
might happen. Their own reactions ranged from fear to excitement.  
Fear that their games would cease to be fun. Fear that an over-  
whelming number of people would want to join in, thus ruining  
the game. Or that unwanted people might intrude into the game.  
And the children who were most often excluded were excited about  
the protection the new rule would provide them.  
Paley was inspired to introduce the rule after teaching countless  
students. Every year a few children in each class would be consis-  
tently excluded, sometimes to an extreme. As her former students  
became adults, they would recount stories of rejection as the most  
difficult times in their education. She created the rule as a way to  
study why this happened year over year, looking for ways to disrupt  
the pattern. Paley writes\:  
Exclusion is written into the game of play. And play, as we know, will soon  
be the game of life. The children I teach are just emerging from life’s deep  
wells of private perspective\: babyhood and family.  
Then, along comes school. It is the first real exposure to the public  
arena. Children are required to share materials and teachers in a space that  
belongs to everyone.  
Equal participation is the cornerstone of most classrooms. This notion  
usually involves everything except free play, which is generally considered a  
private matter. Yet, in truth, free acceptance in play, partnerships, and teams  
is what matters most to any child.1  
Paley’s classroom of kindergarteners can help highlight why  
exclusion dominates many shared environments. Their unfiltered  
honesty gives us a clear view of why exclusion persists and how to  
evolve it. It starts with language.  
16 SHUT IN, SHUT OUT  
THE CIRCLE  
Many cultures have different approximations of the words “inclu-  
sion” and “exclusion,” with unique origins and exact meanings. For  
the purposes of this book let’s take a closer look specifically at the  
English words “include” and “exclude.”  
Both words are based on the Latin root claudere, which means “to  
close or shut.” It represents a literal enclosure, but it also represents  
a mental model of separation. The most common image that comes  
to mind is a boundary created by a closed circle.  
Figure 2.1  
A shut-in-shut-out model of exclusion is centuries old and leads to a  
fixed way of thinking about inclusion.  
17 CHAPTER 2  
Many modern- day societies use “inclusion” and “exclusion” to  
describe aspects of everyday life. Over time, such circular bound-  
aries have been applied in new ways. They have been used to  
protect types of power and to separate people by gender identity,  
skin color, ability, language, religion, and other facets of human  
difference.  
As a result, these societies also inherited the shut-in-shut-out  
mental model represented by these words.  
When inclusion means so many different things to so many  
different people, understanding how to build it is far from self-  
evident. When companies talk about having an “inclusive culture,”  
it’s unlikely they want to shut people inside their walls. Inclusion is  
generally meant to express something more closely related to equity,  
empathy, access, or a sense of belonging. Somehow this little word  
has come to represent a vast world of good intentions, but if we  
can’t describe exactly what it means, how can we start building it?  
In the shut-in-shut-out model, what is the goal of inclusion? Is it  
for the people inside the circle to graciously allow people outside it to  
join them?  
Are people who are shut out trying to break into the circle? Is  
the goal to obliterate the circle altogether and intermix freely in a  
utopian manner? The models that we use to describe the nature of  
exclusion inform how we think about solutions.  
The circle encapsulates things that we want to protect, often power  
and possessions. The people we consider friends. The resources we  
believe are critical to our survival and success. As kids, we guard  
these things with phrases like\:  
“We already have enough people for this game.”  
“The game already started, we can’t stop for you.”  
18 SHUT IN, SHUT OUT  
Figure 2.2  
With a shut-in-shut-out model of exclusion, inclusion becomes a strug-  
gle between those in and those out.  
“You don’t have the right kind of toy to join us.”  
And yet, after the new rule was put into effect, Paley’s students  
adapted their play with minimal conflict. The change was most dif-  
ficult for a small number of children who consistently instigated  
games, set the rules, and enjoyed being the boss.  
The children who had been most consistently excluded were no  
longer isolated. How they saw themselves and their contribution to  
the classroom shifted in positive ways. We’ll explore this bene-  
fit in the next chapter along with the physiological effects of social  
rejection, such as physical pain and depression.  
19 CHAPTER 2  
However, the subtlest and broadest benefit was that every child in  
the classroom gained new friendships, and the games they played  
got a lot more interesting.  
When they could no longer exclude each other, they learned  
how to adapt their games. They also adapted the roles they were  
willing to play within a game. They tried on different identities.  
The kid who was always the villain could now be the newborn  
baby. The heroes could be the villains. The father could be the  
mother. Despite all initial concerns, their games were still fun  
to play.  
These childhood fears ring true in our adult lives. We meet the  
same concerns when improving the inclusivity of our workplaces,  
products, and public environments. Paley’s classroom experiment  
illustrates that exclusion isn’t based on a fixed circle.  
It’s a cycle of our own making.  
A FRAMEWORK FOR CHANGE  
Unlike in Paley’s classroom, we don’t always have, or want, a higher  
authority posting rules on our walls to mandate our behavior. The  
good news is we each hold the power to make or break inclusion.  
The bad news is we don’t always know that we have this power, or  
what to do with it.  
We each know what it feels like to be excluded. Sometimes we can  
recognize when someone else is left out. Yet we often have a very dif-  
ficult time anticipating how people might be excluded in the future.  
This is what makes inclusion so relevant to design.  
A design has an intent. It’s meant for a purpose. The act of  
designing inherently requires thinking about the future ways that  
20 SHUT IN, SHUT OUT  
someone might use a solution. And it’s successful only when the  
recipient of a design confirms it has achieved its purpose.  
Inclusion complements design as a way to align what a solu-  
tion can be with what a person needs it to be. This dynamic is best  
described by Dr. Victor Pineda, a leader in accessible urban design  
and co- founder of the Smart Cities Initiative\:  
Inclusive design is about engaging with people that can be completely dif-  
ferent than you, it stretches your imagination of what’s possible. It has a  
trickle effect, it has a multiplier effect in that it changes those people and,  
in a sense, changes society.  
Because the fact that the designer thought about a wider group of people  
opens up for society to see these people that were once invisible.2  
Dr. Pineda speaks from experience. He’s one of the most well-  
traveled people you’ll ever meet, having visited over seventy countries.  
As a person who uses a wheelchair he has expertise in navigating  
obstacles in public spaces. He has a combination of strategies, from  
personal assistants to assistive technologies, that are critical to each  
of his journeys.  
He has an intimate understanding of how interrelated elements,  
from designed objects to city policies, can create and remove barri-  
ers to access. And what happens when they do\:  
Designers, whether they’re designing a school or software, hold the key to  
unlocking human potential. Because I want to give all I have to society. You  
can do that. You can change the rules of the game so the game includes me  
and includes my talents.3  
What makes exclusion a cycle? It’s the enduring notion that “we  
shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us.”4 What we pro-  
duce has an effect on society, which in turn shapes the next set of  
problems we aim to solve. A solution becomes a barrier when it’s  
21 CHAPTER 2  
designed only for people with certain abilities. The brainpower  
and ingenuity of anyone who doesn’t match that design are simply  
untapped. When we create new ways for people to contribute their  
talents, their contributions influence everyone.  
Exclusion is also cyclical because it’s constantly renewed by our  
choices. For example, changing the colors of a website could seem  
like a small adjustment. Or it could suddenly make that website  
inaccessible to nearly 8% of men and 0.4% of women who have  
color blindness.5 The cycle is always in motion and shifts with each  
design decision.  
We will use the framework of a cycle to examine how we perpetuate  
mismatched designs and how to shift toward inclusion. There are five  
elements to this cycle, and each of them is interrelated with the others.  
■ Why we make. We’ll focus on the motivations that are innate to the  
problem solver.  
■ Who makes the solution. This is the problem solver, the person  
who is accountable for the success of a solution.  
■ How we make. These are the methods and resources employed by  
the problem solver.  
■ Who uses it. These are the assumptions that the problem solver  
makes about the people who will interact with, receive, or benefit  
from the solution.  
■ What we make. This is what the problem solver creates.  
You might notice that the cycle doesn’t include when we make.  
This is because exclusion can show itself at any moment in the  
development process. Conversely, the best time to start remedying  
exclusion is right now. It is most effective, and generally less expen-  
sive, to prioritize inclusion as early as possible and build inclusive  
solutions from the ground up.  
22 SHUT IN, SHUT OUT  
Figure 2.3  
The five elements that contribute to a cycle of exclusion.  
But design rarely starts with a blank canvas. Nor does it follow a neat  
and sequential process. When inclusion is characterized as a separate  
category of activities reserved solely for the early stages of a design  
process, it can easily be deferred indefinitely. In short, right now is  
better than never.  
That said, in chapter 8 we’ll take a closer look at examples of  
inclusive design. Some of these are modifications of existing solu-  
tions. Others were created by applying inclusive design in the early  
stages of a new business or product. We don’t need to tear down  
existing solutions to make inclusive ones. The cycle of exclusion is  
23 CHAPTER 2  
pervasive and ongoing. Similarly, a shift to inclusive design means  
we are constantly looking for and resolving mismatches through all  
stages of a development process.  
As an individual or a member of a small team, you might have a high  
degree of control over all of the elements in this cycle. With practice,  
you can learn to recognize and remedy exclusion at your own pace.  
Larger organizations often have a harder time coordinating the  
elements of this cycle. Sometimes the elements are isolated silos  
that are disconnected from one other. This issue is aggravated when  
leaders try to build inclusion through only one element of the cycle.  
Leaders often focus on the single element that relates to their pro-  
fessional expertise. An engineer might focus on accessibility issues  
with the product they develop. A leader in human resources might  
focus on hiring practices. An information technology professional  
might focus on how to make communication tools work better  
between global teams that have different native languages.  
The success of inclusion for each element is gated by the success  
of the other elements.  
Hiring a new engineer whose first language is Mandarin and  
requiring them to use English- only tools could impede their ability  
to perform to their full potential. A team that consists of people with  
perfect eyesight might build a touchscreen interface for a camera  
without ever taking into consideration how it would work for some-  
one with vision loss.  
Whether by lack of awareness, siloed decisions, or simple neglect,  
it can be difficult for organizations to drive toward inclusion if they  
don’t have a full picture of how their existing culture perpetuates  
exclusion. As a result, the default state for most organizations is a  
cycle of exclusion.  
24 SHUT IN, SHUT OUT  
The power to change that cycle doesn’t just belong to the person  
who starts the game, but to all who participate in it.  
■ ■ ■  
TAKEAWAYS\: THE GAMES WE PLAY  
■ The shut-in-shut-out model of inclusion can make it seem like  
exclusion is a fixed state, rather than an active choice.  
■ Reframing exclusion as a cycle helps us recognize the ways that  
our design choices can lead to mismatches.  
■ The five elements of the cycle of exclusion are interrelated. Each  
can be a useful place to start shifting toward inclusion.  
25 3 THE CYCLE OF EXCLUSION  
Why it’s time to kick the habit.  
What do a public bathroom and a smartphone have in common?  
From the standpoint of inclusion, they’re similar. The cycle helps  
illustrate just how much.  
Public bathrooms are vivid examples of exclusion. An “accessible”  
bathroom is most commonly one that meets basic building stan-  
dards for wheelchair accessibility. Architectural features that create  
access for someone who uses a wheelchair are critical, and mandated  
by law in some countries. And yet, the next time you visit a public  
restroom, take a moment to consider who, exactly, it is accessible to.  
Here’s a cringeworthy example. There’s an increase in toilets that  
can only be flushed by waving your hand over a sensor on the back  
of the toilet. It’s a futuristic invention, complete with a friendly  
icon of a waving hand to demonstrate how to activate the toilet.  
Unless, of course, you’re unable to see the icon and are expect-  
ing some form of button or lever to flush. One of the last things CHAPTER 3  
anyone wants to do is reach around a public toilet in search of how  
to flush it.  
Here are a few more perspectives to consider. Are the door locks  
and toilet seats reachable for someone who’s under four feet tall? Or  
over seven feet tall? What physical features are required to access  
the sinks and faucets? Do the automated soap dispensers respond  
to people with a wide range of skin tones? Is it a safe space for peo-  
ple across a range of genders? How well does the space work for  
children and their parents? How well does it work for people with  
luggage? For a person with a broken ankle?  
For a team that designs bathrooms these are important ques-  
tions to ask. If someone on the team has experienced these kinds  
of exclusion, they likely have expertise that’s helpful to creating a  
better solution. If a team doesn’t have the experience, and isn’t held  
accountable for finding a solution, they will likely build a solution  
that excludes.  
For bathroom visitors, often the person who needs to use the solu-  
tion can’t simply choose not to use it. An exclusive design places  
a burden on people to find their own workarounds. A hands- free,  
sensor- enabled toilet leaves people searching the surface of a toilet  
for a handle to flush, or asking another person to help them. These  
can be dehumanizing experiences.  
Public spaces, like bathrooms, serve universal human needs.  
They are access points for health, safety, education, economic  
opportunity, and Internet connectivity. It makes sense to have rigor-  
ous criteria that minimize exclusion in these spaces. But do design-  
ers need to be as mindful when designing technology? Absolutely.  
Disability is critical to any conversation about exclusion. It touches  
everyone’s life, eventually. Yet disability is commonly misunderstood  
28 THE CYCLE OF EXCLUSION  
as applying to only a marginal percentage of the human population.  
This is simply untrue.  
According to the World Bank, one billion people, or 15% of the  
world’s population, experience disability.1 To put it another way, there  
are over 6.4 billion people who are temporarily able- bodied.  
As we age, we all gain and lose abilities. Our abilities change  
through illness and injury. Eventually, we all are excluded by designs  
that don’t fit our ever- changing bodies. We’ll take a much closer look  
at this dynamic in chapter 7 as we challenge some outdated notions  
about what it means to be a normal human being.  
Figure 3.1  
Everyone gains and loses abilities over the course of their lifetime.  
Consider how much of our world is visual. Large amounts of  
information are conveyed through computer screens, street signs,  
and various uses of light. An icon isn’t just an icon. It’s a way to  
communicate information. All people, regardless of their degree  
29 CHAPTER 3  
of eyesight, want to be able to access these kinds of information,  
whether in reading a lunch menu or sharing a quirky selfie with  
your best friend.  
Touchscreens are making their way into many environments, often  
replacing human beings with an automated system. They are often the  
key to buying groceries, navigating transit stations, pumping gas-  
oline into a car, and even completing classroom assignments. But  
touchscreens can make these spaces inaccessible to people who are  
unable to see or touch the screen.  
These kinds of exclusion impact many people with varying  
degrees of sightedness. There are people who are born blind. People  
with one of many kinds of color blindness, or partial vision. There are  
people with light sensitivity, farsightedness, nearsightedness. Given a  
long enough life span, everyone loses some degree of their eyesight.  
As our bodies change, we encounter more mismatched designs,  
simply because the designs that once worked well for us don’t  
change with us. There are two key side effects that stem from being  
subjected to high degrees of exclusion\: societal invisibility and the  
pain of rejection. Let’s take a closer look at each one.  
INVISIBLE BY OMISSION  
Exclusion isn’t evenly spread across social groups. Although we all  
experience it in our lives, some communities of people are ostra-  
cized in more ways and over longer periods of time.  
A designer recently confessed to me that they would like to learn  
more about disability, but that the diversity topic that they cared  
most about was gender. Why would they feel the need to choose one  
and omit the other?  
30 THE CYCLE OF EXCLUSION  
This is another kind of mismatch. How we categorize people  
often doesn’t reflect how they really are\: multifaceted. When we  
design, which facets of human beings are most relevant to our solu-  
tions? We’ll explore this question in chapter 4.  
Grouping people based on oversimplified categories like “female”  
or “disabled” or “elderly” can seem like a helpful shorthand when  
making business or design decisions. But there’s one big problem\:  
Some categories of people are always last on the list of priorities,  
or wholly forgotten.  
As Paley noticed with her students, the same few children were  
rejected year after year. They were “made to feel like strangers.”2  
This phenomenon can happen to entire categories of people.  
Disability is one such category. Exclusion has a profound impact  
on disability communities, and the consequences are rarely given the  
attention they deserve. The societal omission of disability runs deep. So  
deep that entire populations of people are virtually invisible in society.  
For example, disability rights and history are rarely incorporated  
in school curricula. Accessibility is scarcely a required course for  
engineers and designers. Formative disability rights leaders and the  
movements they champion are seldom mentioned alongside other  
civil rights leaders. These omissions can further reinforce stereo-  
types and isolate people with disabilities from society.  
Yet the influence of these leaders permeates the design of our  
world. Curb cuts are the quintessential example. A curb cut is the  
sloped transition from a sidewalk to a street that makes the crossing  
accessible to people who use wheelchairs.  
Between 1970 and 1974 Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley became an  
extensively accessible route for wheelchairs, making it one of the  
first streets in the United States to do so. It was one culmination of  
31 CHAPTER 3  
changes sparked by Ed Roberts and leaders of the Independent Liv-  
ing Movement, in their fight for disability rights on the University of  
California campus. The design was evolved and refined over time to  
include adjustments for people who are blind, who had relied on the  
shape of the curb as a way to avoid accidentally walking into street  
traffic. Different textures were used to indicate the transition into  
a street, as many corners continue to do today. Curb cuts are also  
widely used by anyone who’s pushing a baby stroller, towing a suit-  
case, or riding a bike.  
Another example of societal invisibility is the low labor partici-  
pation rates for people with disabilities. Just 35.2% of people with  
disabilities in the United States were employed in 2015.3 This is  
compared to a 62% labor participation rate for people without dis-  
abilities in the same year.4 Multiple sources have different statistics,  
but they all point to the same general truth.  
There are many other significant gaps in equality for people with  
disabilities. Design, alone, isn’t going to close all of these gaps.  
Yet designers, engineers, and business leaders can make progress  
toward equality with every design decision they make. And it starts  
with building a baseline understanding of the accessibility policies  
that impact their work.5  
These examples reflect how exclusion impacts people with dis-  
abilities. Similar examples can be found for communities that are  
excluded based on ethnicity, gender, economic status, and more.  
For designers, one important way to change invisibility is to seek  
out the perspectives of people who are, or risk being, the most  
excluded by a solution. Often, the people who carry the greatest  
burden of exclusion also have the greatest insight into how to shift  
design toward inclusion.  
32 THE CYCLE OF EXCLUSION  
HEARTBREAKING DESIGN  
If we could prove that exclusion causes physical pain, what would  
we change about the design of our classrooms? Our workplaces?  
Our technologies?  
We have rules in schools and society against physically harming  
each other, but for some people being left out is treated as a fact  
of life. It’s just part of the way the game was designed. It’s fairly  
common for people to treat social rejection as a necessary part of  
learning to survive in the world of humans.  
Yet multiple studies show that social rejection might manifest in  
our bodies in ways that approximate physical pain.  
This is exactly what Ruth Thomas- Suh reveals in her film Reject.  
She features a community of researchers and academics working to  
understand the links between exclusion and pain.6 They all point  
to a similar insight\: rejection hurts.  
More specifically, they found that the regions of the brain that  
“regulate the distress of social exclusion” were similar to the regions  
that regulate physical pain.7 In other words, being socially rejected  
might directly affect our physical well- being.  
This rejection has many consequences\: anxiety, insecurity, anger,  
hostility, feelings of inadequacy, a sense of being out of control.  
Even the words that people use to describe social exclusion approx-  
imate physical pain. Hurt feelings. A broken heart.  
What if an object rejects us? Is it as painful as being rejected by a  
person?  
Dr. Kipling Williams was relaxing at a park one afternoon when  
a wayward frisbee landed in his lap. He stood up and tossed it back  
33 CHAPTER 3  
to two people who were playing frisbee. They started throwing the  
frisbee to Williams, including him in their game.  
Suddenly, without a word, they stopped. They continued to play  
with each other, but Williams was no longer included. The experi-  
ence stuck with him, with its feeling of dejection.  
He quickly realized that he could recreate this experience in his  
laboratory at Purdue University to study the effects of exclusion.  
He made a simple computer simulation, called Cyberball, in which  
two characters on a screen tossed a virtual ball to the research par-  
ticipant, who was led to believe that the two other players were real  
people in another room. Then, suddenly, the two characters stopped  
tossing the ball to the research participant, effectively excluding  
them for the rest of the game.  
People who participated in Williams’s Cyberball studies typically  
reported a degree of sadness and anger that often accompanies  
rejection. This was expected.  
What surprised Williams was that their anger increased once they  
learned that the two other players were controlled by a computer, not  
by real people. One person aptly described their reaction as, “You know  
that people will let you down, but computers aren’t supposed to.”  
We expect people to be unfair. People are fallible and prone to  
faults. Yet we expect technology to be impartial. Maybe it doesn’t  
always work the way it’s supposed to, but we tend to believe that  
inanimate objects are largely unbiased.  
That is, until we’re locked out of accessing a building, product,  
or event that most people can access without difficulty. When the  
cycle of exclusion is in effect, the resulting designs are far from fair.  
Not all exclusive designs are negative. They simply reflect a series  
of choices made by people who have the power to set the rules of  
34 THE CYCLE OF EXCLUSION  
a given design. Clothing made to fit certain body shapes. Special-  
edition products created to generate interest in a new business. An  
invitation- only birthday for an inner circle of friends. Sometimes  
creating limited access can have positive benefits.  
The problem comes when there’s a mismatch between the stated  
purpose of a design and the reality of who can use it.  
When a solution is meant to serve any member of society and  
then doesn’t, the effects of exclusion can be negative. The expe-  
rience can feel like rejection from society itself. Especially in the  
shared physical and digital spaces where we learn, work, share,  
heal, advocate, create, and communicate.  
There is a risk that exclusion will become more prevalent as tech-  
nology moves into every area of our lives, because interactions that  
were once human- to- human are now facilitated by machines. Every  
human interaction that includes technology gains a wild card\: who  
will it reject and who will it accept?  
EXCLUSION HABITS  
What leads to cycles of exclusion and why are they more prevalent  
than inclusion?  
Every day, design teams make incorrect assumptions about peo-  
ple. They might presume that someone who’s blind doesn’t use a  
camera. Or that a person who’s deaf doesn’t use a music streaming  
service. Is it malicious intent? Not likely.  
Let’s consider the first element of the cycle\: Why we make.  
As we set out to solve a problem, let’s imagine that most peo-  
ple have best intentions to create a beneficial solution. Their goal  
might be to solve a known issue for their existing customers. This  
35 CHAPTER 3  
is often in competition with other goals, like meeting a due date,  
looking good in front of someone in an authority position, or earn-  
ing a reward for driving new business growth. In the crucible of  
competing goals, even the best intentions can get lost in the shuffle.  
There can be little time to think. We might want to pursue our  
best intentions for inclusion, but there’s a constant pressure to keep  
growing and moving quickly. Like a carousel on fast forward. In  
these moments, assumptions become a necessary shorthand.  
And then something much more powerful takes the lead\: habit.  
Paley refers to this as the habit of exclusion. Without an explicit  
understanding of how exclusion works, our default habits— habits  
we formed in our early childhood— can dominate, creating a cycle  
of exclusion.  
An exclusion habit is the belief that whoever starts the game also  
sets the rules of the game. We think we don’t have power to change  
a game, so we abdicate our accountability. We keep repeating the  
same behaviors, over and over.  
In short and simple games, it might be easy to call on the one  
who’s responsible for changing the rules to make it more inclu-  
sive. Over time, games get more complex, leaders change, and  
we can forget who authored the original rules. In some organi-  
zations, the cultural behaviors were set a long time ago and the  
founders of that culture are long gone. Or we believe it’s someone  
else’s job to rewrite the rules, maybe the leaders in our business  
or community.  
We also forget that those rules were initially written by human  
beings and can be rewritten. Those of us who are now playing the  
game have a responsibility to adapt it as needed. If we don’t, we  
are accountable when someone’s left out— not some leader from  
36 THE CYCLE OF EXCLUSION  
Figure 3.2  
Exclusion habits are the reason why we make mismatched designs.  
They stem from deep- seated assumptions about the people who  
receive our designs.  
the distant past. We can respect the intent of the game, but also  
adapt the rules to make it more inclusive.  
An architect might create a building with a grand staircase lead-  
ing to its front entrance on the basis of tradition or aesthetics.  
Meanwhile, people who use wheelchairs might be searching for  
back- alley entrances and convoluted hallways to access the building.  
When making choices in the design of a solution, we might think  
“those are just the rules, I didn’t make them up.” It’s easy to defer  
37 CHAPTER 3  
responsibility by claiming this is just how the world worked when  
we arrived.  
This is why it’s important to distinguish why we make solu-  
tions, especially when we work on behalf of companies and orga-  
nizations. While anyone can start to shift their personal reasons  
for creating solutions, inclusion often needs to be made part of  
an organization’s culture by people in the most senior leadership  
roles. If inclusion isn’t explicitly part of that leadership, exclusion  
will be the default.  
BUILDING NEW HABITS  
Exclusion habits can be hard to break. But, like any habit, they can  
be changed over time with new practices to challenge our mindsets  
and behaviors. When we say that we’re committed to inclusion, it’s  
like declaring that we’ll learn a new language. We start the next day  
full of enthusiasm and optimism, but become quickly aware of our  
huge gap in expertise.  
Learning a new language can take planning, training, and deter-  
mination. But above all, it means engaging with people who are  
native in the new language you want to learn.  
To gain fluency, you will need to change aspects of your routine  
and adjust some the elements of your life to support your new  
goal. You might even relocate to a community where your new lan-  
guage is spoken every day. The same is true for building skills for  
inclusion.  
These skills can be learned from people who interact with unwel-  
coming designs every day of their lives. They often have an intimate  
understanding of all the angles to consider. These are the designers,  
38 THE CYCLE OF EXCLUSION  
engineers, and leaders who have the greatest power to disrupt the  
cycle of exclusion.  
Learning from these experts, we will identify the top exclusion  
habits for each element of the cycle. And we will highlight ways to  
shift the cycle toward inclusive design.  
■ ■ ■  
TAKEAWAYS\: WHY IT’S TIME TO KICK THE HABIT  
■ Mismatched designs contribute to the societal invisibility of cer-  
tain groups, like people with disabilities.  
■ When a designed object rejects a person, it can feel like social  
rejection and approximate physical pain.  
■ Exclusion habits stem from a belief that we can’t change aspects  
of society that were originally set into motion by someone other  
than ourselves.  
39 4 INCLUSIVE DESIGNERS  
Building the skills to recognize and resolve mismatches.  
John R. Porter’s bedroom would make any die- hard gamer feel right  
at home. Among the personal computers, beyond the Run Lola  
Run movie poster, across from a MakerBot busily extruding plas-  
tic threads into an unidentifiable widget, is a large black pegboard.  
The kind of board my grandfather used for hanging hammers and  
wrenches in his garage.  
Mounted on the pegboard, like hunting trophies, are dozens of  
video game controllers dating back decades. Among them is the  
1977 nostalgia- inducing Atari Video Computer System controller,  
with its joystick and single red button. Hundreds of millions of peo-  
ple used this kind of controller to play the legendary game Pong.  
Next in line is the 1985 iconic block- shaped Nintendo Entertain-  
ment System controller with two buttons and a T- shaped directional  
pad that players used to maneuver through Super Mario Bros, one of  
the most popular video games of all time. CHAPTER 4  
Symbiotically, video games and their controllers grew more complex  
in the 1990s as home video games grew in popularity. Porter’s peg-  
board features the contoured dual grips of the 1994 Sony PlayStation  
gamepad and a few hefty Microsoft Xbox controllers released since  
2001, adorned with buttons, sticks, triggers, and a directional pad.  
Figure 4.1  
Early designs for Atari, Nintendo, Sony’s PlayStation, and Microsoft’s  
Xbox game controllers.  
Moving along what Porter calls his Wall of Exclusion, it’s easy to  
notice how the controllers grew larger, heavier, and more complex  
over time. But one thing unites them all. They all require two hands  
to play.  
These controllers are gateways to vast virtual worlds. In these worlds  
players achieve new skills, explore complex landscapes, and connect  
with each other. For many years, Porter admired these games from a  
distance, excluded from playing them by the shape of the controllers.  
We first met when Porter was a design intern at Microsoft. He  
was working on his PhD while teaching at the University of Wash-  
ington’s Human Centered Design and Engineering program.  
Better than most people, Porter can tell you exactly how to cre-  
ate an inclusive solution. Technology is very tightly integrated with  
everything he does. He uses a wheelchair to get around and assis-  
tive technologies to extend his own abilities. These technologies  
42 INCLUSIVE DESIGNERS  
help Porter bridge the mismatched designs that he encounters  
when using everyday objects and spaces.  
In a world where most technology is designed to be used with a key-  
board, mouse, or touchscreen, Porter depends primarily on speech  
recognition. He uses his voice to interact with computers through  
a software program called Dragon, created by Nuance Communi-  
cations, Inc. Dragon listens and follows his commands. By talking  
naturally to his computers Porter can create lesson plans, compose  
written communications, and participate in online gaming.  
He’s active in a community of gamers with disabilities that  
share elaborate techniques for how to hack together alternate ways  
to play their favorite games. Sometimes this is a hardware hack,  
like a switch controller that can be modified to work through head  
movement. And sometimes it’s a software hack, like programming  
a sequence of game actions into one simple command. For exam-  
ple, just by saying “prepare for attack,” a program can coordinate  
multiple characters to aim in the same direction at once, rather than  
having to align each one manually.  
Porter ties his experience with gaming to everyday life, making  
insightful connections between play and inclusion. Here are some  
excerpts from a conversation with Porter to guide our exploration of  
the second element in the cycle of exclusion\: who makes it.  
Why did you build a Wall of Exclusion?  
I keep these here to remind me of all the assumptions that we, as  
designers, make about people. The design of these products clearly  
signals that gaming is for some people, and not for others. A game  
controller says “This is for you” or “This is not for you.” This is true for  
everything we design.  
43 CHAPTER 4

uses it it’s made  
Figure 4.2  
The people who make solutions hold a power to determine who is and  
who isn’t able to participate.  
What happens when designers make assumptions about people?  
All of these games are based on a broad assumption that you’ll be using  
your fingers and your hands to interact. And for me that is almost  
entirely moot. I have some physical mobility that I can use to move  
my wheelchair, but everything I do in the digital realm is mediated  
through other avenues of interaction, primarily speech.  
Whenever I’m using technology I use speech to control it even  
though it was never designed to work for speech. It’s not just that a  
game isn’t optimized for my abilities. It was made without ever even  
44 INCLUSIVE DESIGNERS  
considering the possibility that someone would need to interact with  
it in the ways that I do.  
That places the onus on me to figure out all these workarounds. For  
gamers with disabilities, we have to spend as much time figuring out  
how to play a game as we do actually playing.  
How does a designer make something inclusive?  
Games that only allow a user to play in one way, that have a very pre-  
scriptive notion of who a player is, those tend to be the ones that are  
the least accessible. But games that allow more freedom and flexibility  
tend to be a lot more inclusive.  
I often like to point out World of Warcraft as one of the really great  
inclusive games. There are players who don’t have the motor ability to  
interact fast enough to engage in combat. But I know people with disabil-  
ities who have played this game for years. They have all of their crafting  
skills maxed out because for them, the game isn’t about doing quests.  
The game is economics.  
The game is building a leather- working empire and making gear  
that people can buy from them. And I don’t know if anyone at Bliz-  
zard Entertainment would say that they envisioned that as a viable play  
style. But nevertheless, they built an inclusive system.  
What’s the role of gaming in your life?  
I still remember the day that my uncle Mike came over to give me  
Final Fantasy VII as a 12th birthday present. It was my favorite game,  
despite the fact that I’d never played it. I’d watched him play it, but  
was never able to join in. I was able to play games until I lost the  
ability to use game controllers around the age of 10. For me, gaming  
was becoming a spectator sport.  
My uncle once spent an entire afternoon trying to tape little pieces of  
wood onto his controller to make it work for me. When the efforts were  
45 CHAPTER 4  
unsuccessful, I told him not to worry about it. Final Fantasy just wasn’t  
for me. “Sure it is,” he reassured me as he picked up the modified con-  
troller, “we just need to stop this thing from getting in the way.”  
I don’t just play. I work to figure out how to play. It’s figuring out  
how to participate in societal moments. Which is a burden sometimes.  
I think of it as a metagame that I play in all areas of my life. It’s a puz-  
zle to be solved and shared.  
How is gaming shifting from exclusion to inclusion?  
There is a natural inclination to use yourself as a shortcut to make  
assumptions about the people that you’re designing for. And I think  
that’s especially rampant in the world of game design.  
Historically, the industry has been incredibly homogenous. Games  
have been created by people who feel like they are never going to  
be different than they are in that moment. Many of them feel like  
they are the only users who really need to be considered. And that’s  
changing, which is good.  
I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the increasing diversity amongst  
game designers is happening concurrently with the release of more  
inclusive games. I think those two things go together.  
Porter also points out that for decades, games and consoles were  
made exclusively by large companies with massive technology  
requirements that took years to release. Only an elite group of  
designers worked for these companies.  
Today, a growing community of gamers with disabilities, and  
organizations like AbleGamers, are pushing the creative boundar-  
ies of how people design and access games. Years of patience and  
sheer resourcefulness are opening up the benefits of gaming to a  
much wider audience.  
46 INCLUSIVE DESIGNERS  
Also, with multiple open ways to make and publish games, a  
more diverse group of people are creating more diverse content for  
people to play. A new generation of inclusive- minded designers and  
enthusiasts is gradually transforming the gaming industry.  
Inclusive designers can emerge from traditional design disci-  
plines. They also come from unexpected backgrounds. It’s impor-  
tant to define the specific design skills that contribute to inclusion,  
so that more people can become practitioners. This is also why we  
must reimagine what it means to be a designer.  
DECIDING WHO DESIGNS  
The power of shifting who makes has had a similar effect in indus-  
tries beyond gaming. More designers are focused on how to adapt  
objects to make them work for a diversity of people. Open- source  
tools enable more people to contribute to the design of everything  
from education to artificial intelligence. The cycle of exclusion  
shifts toward inclusion when more people can openly participate as  
designers.  
Anyone who has ever solved a problem is, in a certain sense, a  
designer. The only real difference comes in how much ownership  
you take over the identity of yourself as a designer. You might be a  
designer if you say that it’s not enough to design for yourself and  
you want to design experiences for other people too.  
Consider the rigid ways that companies hire new employees.  
Many companies require candidates to complete an online applica-  
tion, an often- tedious process that requires specific language com-  
petencies, access to the Internet, and an ability to focus on detailed  
information for long periods of time.  
47 CHAPTER 4  
In the tech industry, a common approach to interviews is for a  
candidate to meet sequentially with multiple people in a face- to- face  
verbal interview. The questions are designed to assess how likely a  
person would be to be successful in the role they’re applying for. As  
the day wears on, a candidate needs to have a high degree of physi-  
cal and mental stamina to endure the process.  
In the end, the hiring process itself can send a clear signal that  
the job is “for you” or “not for you.” Yet how many aspects of this  
process have a direct correlation to how well a person will really  
perform in a role over a multiyear career?  
With this in mind, let’s take a closer look at three skills of success-  
ful inclusive designers\:  
1\. Identify ability biases and mismatched interactions between peo-  
ple and world.  
2\. Create a diversity of ways to participate in an experience.  
3\. Design for interdependence and bring complementary skills  
together.  
ABILITY BIASES AND MISMATCHED INTERACTIONS  
Many organizations create solutions for thousands if not millions  
of people. Creating solutions at such a large scale means hundreds,  
maybe thousands, of designers and engineers are working together  
on various aspects of a solution. When all those team members  
bring their own biases to the process, it can be challenging to make  
a solution that works well for all the people it is intended for. In fact,  
it can seem absolutely impossible.  
The underlying challenge is human diversity.  
48 INCLUSIVE DESIGNERS  
A common starting point for teams is to focus on increasing the  
demographic diversity of their team members. Representation of  
diversity is important. However, changing representation doesn’t  
necessarily change culture. Culture change can be hard and takes  
time. If we increase diversity of a team but don’t also evolve the cul-  
tural elements that surround that team, it can place an extra burden  
on people to navigate the “metagame” of exclusion in their work envi-  
ronment while also delivering successful solutions for the business.  
Ability is one of the few categories that transcends all other types  
of human diversity.  
We are all born and gain abilities as we grow. We lose those abil-  
ities as we age. As we move through life, our abilities change as a  
result of illness or injury. They even change when we move from  
one environment to the next. Our vision changes when we move  
from a dark movie theater into the bright sunlight. Our ability to  
hear a conversation changes from a quiet elevator to a crowded  
party.  
Human ability, in its many physical, cognitive, and societal  
forms, is a building block of design. A person’s capabilities and  
limitations are always a factor in how successfully they interact  
with a solution.  
Furthermore, something extraordinary happens when we make  
human ability our first consideration. Everyone can relate to the idea  
that abilities are limited and ever- changing. It rings true regardless  
of nationality, professional training, unconscious biases, or world-  
view. It enables a common ground from which to start designing  
inclusive solutions.  
Of all the biases that designers bring to their work, ability biases  
are the sneakiest.  
49 CHAPTER 4  
Figure 4.3  
Designing with our own abilities as a baseline can lead to solutions  
that work well for people with similar abilities, but can end up exclud-  
ing many more people.  
An ability bias is a tendency to solve problems while using our  
own abilities as a baseline. When we do so, our solutions end up  
working well for people with similar abilities and circumstances,  
but can exclude a much wider group of people.  
Even the most empathetic designer will typically create a solution  
that she herself can see, hear, and touch. She’ll use her own logic  
and preferred ways of communicating. Her eyesight acuity, hand  
dexterity, and language fluency will influence the way she creates  
solutions. Even the design tools that she uses to create a solution  
will reinforce her ability biases.  
50 INCLUSIVE DESIGNERS  
Ability biases aren’t inherently bad. They aren’t necessarily some-  
thing to eliminate. In fact, they can be strengths. Once a designer  
develops the skill to recognize their own ability biases, they can start  
to recognize the ability biases in other people as well.  
Porter’s ability biases as a gamer are speech commanding, stra-  
tegic coordination, and navigating problems through experimenta-  
tion. But he doesn’t simply design solutions that work for his own  
abilities. As an inclusive designer, he creates solutions that consider  
a range of abilities beyond his own, so that a wider audience can  
successfully use his designs.  
How do we extend beyond our own ability biases? No degree  
of wearing a blindfold will ever be equivalent to the experience of  
being blind. The blindfold can actually give designers a false  
sense of empathy, especially if they attempt to simulate disabil-  
ities without ever meeting or working alongside people with  
disabilities.  
If we are designing a solution that will be used by millions of peo-  
ple, and our ability biases are inevitable, where do we start?  
To unlock this conundrum, I invite you to consider diversity  
through the lens of human interactions. That is, our interactions  
with each other and with the world around us.  
In 2011 the World Health Organization published their World  
Report on Disability, referring to disability as “a complex phenome-  
non, reflecting the interaction between features of a person’s body  
and features of the society in which they live.”1 This is also known  
as the social definition of disability. These points of interaction are  
where mismatches occur.  
For designers, this can open a new mindset. It’s a profound  
shift from thinking about disability as a personal health condition  
51 CHAPTER 4  
# Disability

Figure 4.4  
When we think about disability in terms of mismatched  
interactions, it highlights the responsibilities of people who  
make solutions.  
outside of the range of “normal.” When we consider disability as  
a mismatched interaction, it underscores the responsibilities of  
the designer. Every choice we make either increases or decreases  
the mismatches between people and the world around them.  
A well- loved example of mismatched design that led to innovation  
is OXO tools. Betsy Farber was having difficulty using kitchen uten-  
sils due to arthritis in her hands. The thin metal handles of objects,  
like a potato peeler, were difficult and painful to hold. Her husband,  
Sam Farber, worked with her to develop a new grip design. The new  
design was rounded to fill the hand and was made of flexible rubber  
that could shape to the unique grip of each user. The Farbers created  
their first set of fifteen OXO Good Grips kitchen tools in 1990.  
The design was dramatically more comfortable for Betsy, but also  
worked well for anyone who had difficulty holding kitchen utensils  
due to wet or slippery hands.  
52 INCLUSIVE DESIGNERS  
A DIVERSITY OF WAYS TO PARTICIPATE  
Mismatched interactions also arise when we create solutions with  
only one way to participate. In our gaming example, this can be a con-  
troller that requires two thumbs, a high degree of manual dexterity, or  
a high degree of hand strength. It’s also about the range of roles that  
players can act out in a game \(warrior, merchant, coach, athlete, etc.\).  
Inclusive designers create a multitude of ways for people to par-  
ticipate in and contribute to an experience.  
To better understand this, let’s take a closer look at several defi-  
nitions of inclusive design. Although the term has been around for  
decades, it was largely an academic practice until recently. When I  
first learned about inclusive design, very few companies were apply-  
ing it to their work in a repeatable way. At Microsoft, we sought out  
mentors from universities. Most importantly, Jutta Treviranus and  
her team at Ontario College of Art and Design. Treviranus founded  
the Inclusive Design Research Centre in 1993 to focus on ways that  
digital technology can improve societal inclusion. She has a clear  
approach to selecting each new cohort of designers\:  
We need designers who have experienced barriers. What we want to pro-  
duce is not a uniform set of individuals with specific competencies, but  
a group of individuals that can work as a team, that each can contribute a  
diverse perspective.2  
Another mentor in our early days was the inclusive design leader  
that I referenced in the opening of this book, Susan Goltsman. Her  
definition of inclusive design will always be my favorite\:  
Inclusive design doesn’t mean you’re designing one thing for all people.  
You’re designing a diversity of ways to participate so that everyone has a  
sense of belonging.3  
53 CHAPTER 4  
Goltsman led her design projects with what she called the I- N- G’s.  
She would sit and observe how many different human activities were  
happening in a park. Goltsman would ask, “what I- N- G is most impor-  
tant to this environment?” Maybe it was running, digging, swinging,  
climbing, or sleeping. Whatever the I- N- G, the next question was  
always “how many ways can human beings engage in that activity?”  
Imagine a playground full of only one kind of swing. A swing  
that requires you to be a certain height with two arms and two legs.  
The only people who will come to play are people who match this  
design, because the design welcomes them and no one else.  
And yet there are many different ways you can design an experi-  
ence of swinging. You can adjust the shape and size of the seat. You  
can keep a person stationary and swing the environment around  
them. Participation doesn’t require a particular design. But a partic-  
ular design can prohibit participation.  
The same phenomenon applies to technology. If writing stories  
required a keyboard, computer screen, and fluency in English,  
the only stories we’d read would be from people who match these  
requirements. Each feature created by designers determines who  
can interact with an environment and who is left out.  
Building on Treviranus’s and Goltsman’s guidance, here’s a working  
definition of inclusive design that we developed at Microsoft, after apply-  
ing it with thousands of engineers, designers, and business leaders.  
Inclusive design\: A methodology that enables and draws on the full range of  
human diversity. Most importantly, this means including and learning from  
people with a range of perspectives.4  
We also found it helpful to distinguish inclusive design from  
related concepts, like accessibility and universal design. Here’s a  
quick primer that guided our work\:  
54 INCLUSIVE DESIGNERS  
Accessibility\: 1. The qualities that make an experience open to all. 2. A pro-  
fessional discipline aimed at achieving No. 1.  
An important distinction is that accessibility is an attribute, while  
inclusive design is a method. While practicing inclusive design  
should make a product more accessible, it’s not a process for meet-  
ing all accessibility standards. Ideally, accessibility and inclusive  
design work together to make experiences that are not only compli-  
ant with standards, but truly usable and open to all.  
Most accessibility criteria grew out of policies and laws that were  
designed to ensure barrier- free access for specific disability commu-  
nities. Wheelchair access in architecture only became prominent  
across the United States after the Americans with Disabilities Act was  
passed by Congress in 1990. The 1998 Section 508 amendment to  
the United States Workforce Rehabilitation Act of 1973 mandated that  
all electronic and information technology be accessible to people with  
disabilities. The United Nations created a Convention on the Rights  
of Persons with Disabilities in 2006, as an international agreement  
to focus on the full societal integration of people with disabilities.5  
Inclusive design should always start with a solid understanding  
of accessibility fundamentals. Accessibility criteria are the founda-  
tion of integrity for any inclusive solution.  
Another concept that is closely related to inclusive design is uni-  
versal design.  
Universal Design\: The design of an environment so that it might be  
accessed and used in the widest possible range of situations without the  
need for adaptation.6  
Universal design was born out of the built environment. It is  
rooted in architecture and environmental design. It emphasizes the  
end solution, most often one that is physically fixed. The principles  
55 CHAPTER 4  
of universal design are focused on attributes of the end result, such  
as “simple and intuitive to use” and “perceptible information.”7  
In contrast, inclusive design was born out of digital technologies  
in the 1970s and 80s, like captioning for people who are deaf and  
audio recorded books for blind communities. Inclusive design is  
now growing into adulthood alongside the Internet.  
In some areas of the world, the term inclusive design is used  
interchangeably with the term universal design. I prefer to make a  
distinction between them in two ways.  
First, universal design is strongest at describing the qualities of a  
final design. It is exceptionally good at describing the nature of phys-  
ical objects. Inclusive design, conversely, focuses on how a designer  
arrived at that design. Did their process include the contributions of  
excluded communities?  
The second distinction, initially coined by Treviranus\: Universal  
design is one- size- fits- all. Inclusive design is one- size- fits- one. We’ll  
explore this further in chapter 7 with a technique called a persona  
spectrum.  
Inclusive design might not lead to universal designs. Universal  
designs might not involve the participation of excluded communi-  
ties. Accessible solutions aren’t always designed to consider human  
diversity or emotional qualities like beauty or dignity. They simply  
need to provide access.  
Inclusive design, accessibility, and universal design are impor-  
tant for different reasons and have different strengths. Designers  
should be familiar with all three.8  
An inclusive designer is someone, arguably anyone, who recog-  
nizes and remedies mismatched interactions between people and  
their world. They seek out the expertise of people who navigate  
56 INCLUSIVE DESIGNERS  
exclusionary designs. The expertise of excluded communities gives  
insight into a diversity of ways to participate in an experience.  
MAKING ACCESSIBILITY ACCESSIBLE  
If you aren’t already familiar with the basics of accessibility for your  
field, you’re not alone. The good news is you don’t need to become  
an expert in solving everything. You just need to know enough to  
know when you need to bring in a true expert. You need to know  
how to recognize accessibility issues and how to design solutions  
that work well with the assistive technologies that people rely on.  
Here are four unique challenges that people commonly face when  
they’re new to accessibility.  
■ Lack of educational resources. Accessibility fundamentals are rarely  
taught in school or by employers. The companies that are leading  
in inclusion are creating curricula to help engineers and design-  
ers learn the basics. There’s a community of accessibility special-  
ists who are also producing great educational content. Much of this  
information is available online in open formats, for free. This will  
give a general introduction to what you need to know.  
■ Complex legal verbiage. Accessibility focuses on legal standards.  
The language of these standards can be intimidating, unless you’re  
a lawyer. Some companies hire external agencies to conduct confor-  
mance testing for accessibility standards. Accessibility criteria can  
also be inexact. That is, they might not give specific details on how  
to create an accessible solution or measure whether it’s successful.  
■ Finding the signal in the noise. It can take significant investment  
and time to build a custom set of criteria that apply to your business  
or solution. You can also create your own checklist of top exclusion  
57 CHAPTER 4  
issues to avoid and test for throughout your design process. In gen-  
eral, we need better ways to validate that inclusive solutions are  
working as intended in the real world.  
■ A highly manual process. After decades of being underprioritized,  
the tools for checking accessibility haven’t kept pace with advances  
in technology. As a result, a lot of product testing is conducted line  
by line, by human beings. This seems to be changing quickly as  
more people are building the requirements of accessibility right  
into development tools. Ideally it would be difficult, if not impossi-  
ble, to produce an inaccessible product.9  
INTERDEPENDENCE AND COMPLEMENTARY SKILLS  
In cultures that overemphasize independence, it’s less common to  
design solutions with interdependence in mind. In the United States,  
there’s a deep attachment to the idea of a rugged, lone pioneer \(or  
astronaut, or entrepreneur, or cowboy\) venturing out into the great  
unknown to make their way in the world. When they succeed they’re  
hailed as self- made heroes of strength, ingenuity, and resourceful-  
ness. These stories of independence rarely reflect the truth of our  
lives, which are full of dependencies.  
People with disabilities often depend on human assistants and  
assistive objects. The skills of these assistants are vital to closing the  
gaps between the implements of daily life and a person’s abilities.  
And all people are increasingly dependent on technology to engage  
with the world.  
Interdependence is about matching complementary skills and  
mutual contributions. Thinking back to Porter’s example of online  
gaming, vast worlds are inherently more inclusive when they have  
58 INCLUSIVE DESIGNERS  
a diversity of ways to contribute to the game. These games, like any  
society, don’t thrive solely on the skills of hunters and warriors.  
The society is a system of interdependent skills, an economy that  
includes many different types of novices and masters.  
When designing a solution, it’s easy to treat people as individual enti-  
ties. Even in the design of shared products, especially in social media,  
many solutions assume that groups of people behave merely as collec-  
tions of independent individuals. Each person is treated as a separate  
entity, blasting bits of information out to other individual people and  
waiting to count the number of likes that they receive in return.  
An inclusive designer thinks in terms of interdependent systems.  
They study human relationships. They observe the ways that peo-  
ple bring their skills together to complement each other. Inclusive  
designers seek out a diversity of ways that people build collective  
accomplishments.  
As inclusive designers, interdependence challenges us to think in  
broader ways about systems of contribution. It prompts us to ask what  
human activities, which I- N- G’s, are most important to the things that  
we design. Designing for interdependence changes who can contribute  
to a society, what they contribute, and how they make that contribution.  
WE ARE ALL DESIGNERS  
The traditional design professions are rapidly changing, especially  
in areas of technology where the required skills change so quickly  
that many universities are struggling to maintain a relevant cur-  
riculum. Much of today’s design work isn’t limited to people with  
the word “design” in their professional titles. Among those evolving  
design roles there is a new category of skills in inclusive design.  
59 CHAPTER 4  
This is critical in many areas of society, but urgently needed in  
technology design. As technology permeates intimate areas of our  
lives, design becomes an intimate act. People invite products into  
their homes. They share their secrets with personal devices. They  
use digital technology to facilitate moments of sharing, celebration,  
and mourning. Each of these technologies is built by people who  
are making assumptions based on their own biases. For better or  
for worse, these choices can also determine who gets to participate  
in society.  
People who’ve experienced great degrees of exclusion can trans-  
late that expertise to the solutions they create. Their experience can  
shape every other aspect of the cycle of exclusion. But this strength  
isn’t the result of being considered “different” from other designers  
by some facet of demographic diversity.  
Their expertise stems from being familiar with exclusion and  
what makes it a universal human experience. This knowledge can  
make it easier to recognize the exclusion that many more people  
face, bringing a greater appreciation of what is gained when a design  
process is truly open to diverse perspectives. This is how inclusive  
designers learn to flex their ideas and combine their strengths.

traditional skills.  
61 5 WITH AND FOR  
How generations of exclusion are made and broken.  
The next time you’re at a street corner, waiting to cross, take a  
moment to notice the details of its design. Note the orientation  
of buildings, the intensity of sounds or crowds of people. Who  
designed that street corner? How are their choices influencing your  
ability to move? Or to interact with other people?  
Of the many professionals who contribute to the design of our  
world, architects have to achieve some of the most stringent cri-  
teria before being allowed to practice. The degree of training and  
testing required to become a licensed architect is incredibly high.  
After completing the necessary education, the credentialing process  
requires years of experience and thousands of dollars to complete.  
The whole process can take 12.5 years, on average.1  
With public safety at stake, this makes sense. In contrast to the  
industry of video games, where open- source platforms are making CHAPTER 5

exclusion.  
Cultural context and preexisting methods can perpetuate the cycle of  
it easier for anyone to become a game designer, it’s hard to imagine  
the same thing happening in architecture.  
This makes the role of an architect a useful lens to examine how  
we make. There’s a greater context, beyond the individual designer,  
that influences exclusion and inclusion.  
In addition to business criteria and technical requirements, a  
design is shaped by the history of events that precede it. This means  
that shifting a cycle of exclusion toward inclusion isn’t simply a  
matter of designing an object in new ways. We also need to disrupt  
the momentum of how things have been done for a long, long time.  
64 WITH AND FOR  
A CITY OF DESIGN  
The whirring of power saws and high- pitched beeping of con-  
struction trucks fill the downtown streets of Detroit. The skele-  
tons of new high- rises stand tall alongside historic buildings with  
some of the most beautiful examples of art deco in the country.  
In 2015, Detroit became the first U.S. city to be named a UNESCO  
City of Design. The distinction is an acknowledgment of the city’s  
rich architectural heritage and a long list of influential local archi-  
tects and designers who defined American Modern design.2 While  
Detroit is well known as the heart of the American automotive  
industry, its artistic strengths are equally impressive.  
In my first visit, Tiffany Brown guided me through the city. An archi-  
tectural designer and native Detroiter, Brown is exceptionally talented  
at building connections with people. We wove in and out of parks,  
restaurants, and cathedral- like lobbies of office buildings. She moved at  
a breakneck pace, sharing vivid details about each location. The nuances  
of each design and the names of the architects were all new to me.  
Brown describes the features of architecture through the stories  
of the people who gather there to celebrate, mourn, create, and  
build. The best restaurants for birthday parties. The murals in a  
quiet alleyway that transforms into a concert venue on weekends.  
She has a keen sense of how spaces bring people together and how  
design creates a sense of belonging.  
A growing number of architects, like Brown, believe the people  
who inhabit a space should contribute directly to its design. Her  
firsthand experience with how design can fail communities moti-  
vated her to pursue architecture. She understands how designing  
for, not with, people can lead to exclusion.  
65 CHAPTER 5  
We pass through a small triangular park with the words “Para-  
dise Valley” engraved on the ground. Brown points out vacant store-  
fronts that once formed a thriving economic center for hundreds of  
Black business owners. People gathered in these streets to hear jazz  
legends like Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, and  
Louis Armstrong. This park marks the north end of what used to  
be Black Bottom, named for its rich marsh topsoil, one of the few  
neighborhoods where African Americans were allowed to live in the  
1920s through the 1950s.  
In the early 1900s Detroit was a beacon of economic opportunity,  
especially for African Americans. The city’s population exploded  
from less than 500,000 in 1910 to over 1.5 million people in 1930.3  
Many of these new residents were African American migrants from  
the south.4 Neighborhoods like Black Bottom were places whose  
inhabitants knew and looked out for each other. Residents inter-  
mingled with national heroes, like boxer Joe Lewis, and there was a  
palpable belief in the community that anyone could be great.  
Over the course of the decline of the local automotive industry,  
the nationwide recession in 2008, and the city declaring bank-  
ruptcy in 2013, more than one million people left Detroit, likely  
never to return.  
Urban planning and architecture played a role in this decline.  
Black Bottom was demolished in the early 1960s to make way for the  
Chrysler Freeway and a new mixed- income neighborhood designed  
by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The thriving center of Detroit’s Afri-  
can American community was destroyed and most Black Bottom  
residents moved to public housing projects across the city.  
Brown drives us to the edge of what once was the Brewster-  
Douglass housing projects. The pace of construction is dramatically  
66 WITH AND FOR  
softer. The pounding of a hammer starts and stops from inside a  
brick shell of a partially demolished home. Across the street is a com-  
mon sight in Detroit\: a large lot, empty and overgrown, surrounded  
by a wire fence with a bright white sign reading “road closed.”  
The Brewster Homes, which later grew to become Brewster-  
Douglass, was the first federally funded housing project in the  
United States. It was opened with a ceremony attended by Eleanor  
Roosevelt in 1935. The Brewster Homes promised to be family-  
oriented residences for working- class African Americans who, at the  
time, had limited housing options. These first homes were largely  
funded by private benefactors. For several decades, these homes  
were well managed and maintained by the federal government.  
The promise of family- oriented housing started to change when  
the Frederick Douglass towers were added to the Brewster Homes  
in 1951. The stark, cramped design of these twenty- story block-  
shaped towers was a far cry from the original town homes.  
Figure 5.2  
A Douglass tower standing next to the orig-  
inal Brewster Homes in Detroit.  
67 CHAPTER 5  
This style was typical of the rising modernist movement in archi-  
tecture that borrowed heavily from a vision set by Swiss- French  
architect Charles- Edouard Jeanneret- Gris, known as Le Corbusier.  
His concept of “towers in the park” was just one example of his  
mathematically precise approach to architecture, based on béton  
brut— French for raw concrete.  
Le Corbusier’s approach to architecture made a strong impres-  
sion on Robert Moses, a man known as the “master builder” of  
New York City in the mid- twentieth century. He was also demon-  
strably racist, as detailed in Robert Caro’s Pulitzer Prize- winning  
biography, The Power Broker. Moses built extensive parks, beaches,  
roadways, tunnels, and bridges that transformed New York City  
during the decades of his tenure as an appointed public official.  
And he did so with a keen focus on excluding communities that  
he deemed unworthy to enjoy them. In one infamous example, he  
lowered the height of overpasses to prevent the passage of pub-  
lic buses, the primary mode of transit for low- income and African  
American residents.  
One of the practices that Moses embraced, in the footsteps of Le  
Corbusier, was to demolish what he deemed “blighted” areas, dis-  
placing over half a million residents in pursuit of his vision. He  
would raze entire neighborhoods to the ground, creating a blank  
slate for new housing projects and expressways. This top- down  
approach to planning architecture became a beacon of modern  
urban development, and was replicated in cities across the United  
States.  
Through the 1950s and 1960s Congress allocated fewer and fewer  
funds to building and maintaining high- quality public housing. As  
they did, the design quality declined. High- rise towers, often with  
68 WITH AND FOR  
one elevator to service scores of families, became a design standard  
for public housing projects across the United States.  
With reduced funding, restrictive policies, and neglected mainte-  
nance, the buildings of Brewster- Douglass fell into disrepair in the  
late 20th century. Once home to nearly 10,000 Detroiters, they were  
marked for demolition, with the promise of rebuilding people’s  
lives on a foundation of entrepreneurship and training for new jobs.  
The last residents were moved out in 2008. Federally funded Sec-  
tion 8 housing vouchers were the only way that many people could  
afford to live outside of the development, which meant moving into  
private landlord- owned homes in disparate areas of the city. Many  
residents protested. Some refused to leave their homes and were  
forcibly removed.  
This story isn’t unique to Brewster- Douglass. The pattern of  
destroying Black and low- income neighborhoods to make way  
for “urban renewal” projects has been repeated across Detroit for  
decades. As the city’s design evolved, it gained new features that  
excluded people from each other and from economic opportunities.  
A racial distribution map underscores this point. Today, the  
population of Detroit is roughly 700,000 and over 80% are Afri-  
can American.5 The surrounding metropolitan and suburban  
areas are predominantly Caucasian. The spaces between commu-  
nities are marked by clear physical boundaries that correspond to  
major roadways.  
The final stages of the Brewster- Douglass demolition were super-  
vised by Brown in 2014 while she was working for the architecture  
firm Hamilton Anderson Associates. During the project she met  
with former residents who arrived to watch as buildings were being  
deconstructed. They shared family stories, remembered loved ones  
69 CHAPTER 5  
Figure 5.3  
Racial distribution in Detroit is sharply segregated along roadways and  
waterways \(shown in white\). The population of the areas shown in gray  
is over 80% African American, and closely follows the boundaries of

suburban areas, shown in black, is over 80% Caucasian American.  
\(Based on data from the 2010 U.S. Census.\)  
lost, and recalled the places where lifelong friendships took root.  
People gathered to recognize this place that shaped their lives in  
profound ways.  
The Brewster- Douglass demolition held special meaning for  
Brown because the complex shared a lot of traits with her childhood  
home, Herman Gardens, several miles away. As we drove along the  
70 WITH AND FOR  
edge of the now empty multi- acre lot, she pointed out her schools  
and the home her family was relocated to when Herman Gardens  
was demolished.  
These important spaces from Brown’s life now stand vacant and  
deteriorating. These places influenced her choice to pursue archi-  
tecture. Not out of passion for the buildings, but for the countless  
neglected residents that they represent.  
Many displaced residents, including Brown’s grandmother,  
returned to live in a small cluster of new homes at the edge of  
the former Herman Gardens site. From her front porch, we watch  
her grandchildren climb atop a playground while she recounts  
the city’s promises of new economic development that never  
materialized.  
She can vividly recall the original community and each space  
where people gathered. Once the homes were destroyed, the local  
schools lost students and were closed. Businesses lost customers  
and ceased to exist. She can describe in detail which aspects of Her-  
man Gardens’ design worked and which didn’t.  
Brewster- Douglass was built for low- income African American  
families. But who created the design? Who chose what to tear  
down and what to rebuild? What was their cultural agenda? Its  
construction and deconstruction happened without any mean-  
ingful inclusion of residents. This practice isn’t isolated to archi-  
tecture. It happens in many areas of design, including digital  
environments.  
When we break from the past, how we get to the next stage  
has an impact on who can move forward with that progress and  
who’s left out. What does it take to shift long- standing cycles of  
exclusion?  
71 CHAPTER 5  
400 FORWARD  
From her years as a young resident in public housing to her career as an  
architectural designer, Brown has encountered many layers of designs  
that contribute to exclusion. And as she works toward her architecture  
license, there’s one number she always keeps in mind\: 400.  
In the history of the profession, just over 450 architects have been  
African American women. In 2017 there were approximately 110,000  
licensed architects in the United States. Just over 400 of these active  
practitioners, roughly 0.3%, are African American women.  
The City College of New York conducted a comprehensive study  
of inclusion in architecture and concluded that the extremely low  
percentage of African Americans in the profession, just 2% across  
genders, is the result of specific inequalities in the process of  
becoming an architect and the support received once new archi-  
tects are in role. Improving inclusion in the profession, they state,  
requires deeper study of the “considerations of how minority youth  
are socialized to think about the field of architecture, and an under-  
standing of the influence of social/peer networks, family guidance,  
and educational awareness.”6  
The credential process is not the only way to describe the pro-  
fession. There are countless African American builders and archi-  
tects who have shaped the American landscape. But credentialing  
matters, because critical decisions about the future of our cities are  
often made from positions of seniority and power. And these leader-  
ship positions are heavily gated by required credentials.  
Brown works with young people as a way to shift the future ranks  
of leadership. She co- founded the Urban Arts Collective, an organi-  
zation that uses art, music, and interactive workshops to introduce  
72 WITH AND FOR  
minority students to architecture and design. Her most recent ini-  
tiative, 400 Forward, is aimed at empowering the next 400 African  
American female architects.  
Here’s how she describes that journey.  
How did you choose architecture?  
Growing up in Detroit’s inner city, we didn’t have doctors, lawyers, and  
engineers running to our schools for career day. We had little access to  
the arts and zero exposure to architecture. Something like architecture  
surely felt out of reach for us. I was a student at what was considered a  
failing public school, and a college recruiter came to an assembly when  
I was in 12th grade. That fall, I was studying architecture. It changed  
my life, and also changed my outlook on life.  
Returning to my old neighborhood to construct new housing was  
one of many full circle moments for me. Many of my family members  
still live there, many of my friends. I’ve been asked if I would change  
the way I grew up. My answer is always no. It is a place where I gained  
friendships that started from kindergarten and last to this day. My par-  
ents’ generation can say the same thing. To some, it was one of the  
most dangerous places in the city. To us, it was the only community we  
knew and called home.  
I was once convinced the term “disadvantaged youth” was a proper  
title for young people deemed unable to achieve success because of their  
environment or social class. That they were less likely to have, let alone  
achieve, their goals.  
I remember being referred to as a disadvantaged youth by educa-  
tors, if and when they did come to my school. I did not like how it  
made me feel. I once believed there were certain things beyond my  
reach because of my upbringing, because I’m female, and because of  
my skin color. But then I realized this term did not define me. I began  
to see it as the reason I would prove them all wrong. I am a “disadvan-  
taged youth” who now has three college degrees, two in architecture.  
73 CHAPTER 5  
How does a designer shape inclusion?  
I would sum it up with a Latin expression, “Nihil de nobis, sine nobis”  
or “Nothing about us, without us,” which was made prominent by the  
disability rights movement. This phrase personifies the idea of design-  
ing with a community\: that no course of action should be decided  
without total contribution from the people affected by that course of  
action. Especially groups of people who have been socially excluded,  
categorized by disability or cultural heritage.  
This expression has largely been disregarded in relation to design. As  
an example, I recently rode the new Q- Line transit system in Detroit. The  
design of this service emphasizes electronic forms of payment. When  
it first opened, none of the kiosks offered instructions on how to pay  
with cash, a secondary option that was only available inside a train. This  
alienated people in the city who must use change or cash. As a result,  
it became a way to transport a certain class of people from midtown to  
downtown and bypass those excluded people. It rides alongside the city  
bus, stopping at the same traffic lights, held up in the same traffic.  
I have personally experienced the outcomes of designing for a par-  
ticular demographic. The results can be oppressive and unjust. Inhab-  
itants are made to feel powerless and dependent.  
What’s your approach to inclusion?  
While studying architecture, I realized I learn in ways that are different from  
many of my peers. I did fine in high school, but had a hard time adjusting  
to college. There was a disconnect between my thought process and how  
coursework was presented to me. A lot of students with similar upbringings  
run into this issue and might think that design is not for them.  
I need to take the time to get to the root of a problem before I can try  
solving it. I have to see the big picture and how things flow together.  
Making sense of how things are related to each other helps me make  
it personally meaningful.  
74 WITH AND FOR  
I also find meaningful connections by meeting with people who are  
going to be affected by the design.  
My passion is to create an entirely new leadership base for architec-  
ture so that the profession reflects the communities we serve. Diversity  
paired with passionate creativity improves the quality of life. It should  
outweigh this “superhero” approach to design that we have today.  
How do you make design accessible?  
There was a student who was struggling in one of our architecture  
workshops. The task was to create a city block, using Lego pieces. She  
didn’t have a logic behind why she’d laid out her city block in a partic-  
ular way. As designers we try to have some kind of reason for what we  
did and some kind concept that we start with. Rather than jumping  
to a design and then rationalizing why we did it. You get to a design  
because something led you there.  
I asked her to think back to something that was emotional for her.  
She had placed a lot of stores along the front of the city. She explained  
that shopping was something she did with her mom when she was alive.  
I knew right then that she had an emotional story to tell. We talked  
as she created this block filled with things that she liked to do with her  
mom. She didn’t have to understand design thinking. She just needed  
to take a step back and clarify the reason why she was making certain  
choices. Why is this needed? Why is this important?  
I want to make architecture and design feel reachable for kids in  
neighborhoods like the ones I grew up in. This includes them engag-  
ing with someone who’s from the same type of neighborhood. Some-  
one who has defeated the same odds they face and became successful.  
When she describes inclusion, Brown focuses on the greater context.  
The historical moments that led to an existing design. The orientation  
between designers and users. The leaders who initiate wide- sweeping  
75 CHAPTER 5  
changes. Above all, her lens highlights the key to making inclusive  
solutions\: including the expertise of excluded communities.  
When people are excluded by mismatched designs, they grow  
intimately familiar with the nature of the exclusion and how it  
might be resolved. Given the opportunity, they can apply this exper-  
tise toward building inclusive solutions.  
The next chapter demonstrates how someone who understands  
the mismatch can resolve it in creative ways. And how this differs  
from a person who tries to make a solution based on stereotypes or  
benevolent pity for someone they perceive as unlike themselves.

How to shift toward inclusion  
■ Zoom out, consider the system of relationships that led to a solu-  
tion. Ask how previous designs might be important to future designs.  
■ Identify a personal connection to an aspect of inclusion that is  
meaningful to you and your community.  
■ Study the history of how a solution came to be. Why is it shaped a  
particular way? Who influenced those decisions, and what was their  
motivation?  
76 6 MATCHMAKING  
How exclusion experts resolve mismatches.  
There’s a rise in interest in designs that have a positive social impact.  
A number of projects are focused on “designing for” a community  
of people that’s presumed to be disadvantaged. New technologies  
for students in developing countries. Design contests to create solu-  
tions for elderly people or people with disabilities.  
While these are often well- intentioned, there are some poten-  
tial pitfalls to designing for people with this superhero- victim or  
benefactor- beneficiary mindset. It can lead to specialized solutions  
that cater to stereotypes about people.  
US AND THEM  
To illustrate the problem let’s consider the Dodge LaFemme, a car  
designed specifically for women, brought to market in 1955 and  
canceled in 1956. The car was pink, inside and out, decorated with CHAPTER 6  
Figure 6.1  
A review of Dodge’s LaFemme, published by Popular Mechanics in July 1955.  
small roses. It featured a fully equipped matching purse that fit into  
the back of the passenger side headrest. It was marketed with the  
headline “By Special Appointment to Her Majesty . . . the American  
Woman.”  
While it’s somewhat easy to dismiss this as an artifact of a bygone  
era of male chauvinism, let’s also consider the failed launch of Bic  
for Her in 2012. This was a line of pens designed specifically for  
women that were thinner than standard pens and available in pastel  
shades of pink, purple, and turquoise. It was marketed on Amazon  
as having an “elegant design— just for her!” and a “thin barrel to fit  
a woman’s hand.”  
Thin barrel or not, the pens are now a hallmark example of how  
not to design and market your product to women, thanks to writer  
Margaret Hartman who sparked thousands of people to write  
entertainingly sarcastic reviews on Amazon.com. The product was  
quickly removed from market.  
78 MATCHMAKING  
In a more serious example, the automotive industry conducts  
safety testing with models of humans, also known as crash test  
dummies. For decades these models were made to match the aver-  
age male body type, though it was widely known that women were  
significantly more likely to be injured in a car accident.  
In 2011 the federal government started an initiative to reduce  
demographic disparities in public health. Car accidents ranked high  
on the list of public health risks. Passenger- side safety ratings plum-  
meted as cars were tested with a petite female crash test model that  
was 4 feet 11 inches tall and 108 pounds.1 That year, studies revealed  
that a female driver, wearing a seatbelt, faced a 47% higher risk of  
death or serious injury than a male driver.2  
Decades of design choices where made based on average male-  
sized testing standards. Engineers and designers were trained to  
optimize to these standards. It wasn’t that the cars were suddenly  
less safe. They had always been less safe. It just hadn’t been recog-  
nized as a problem.  
This wasn’t a sex- specific disparity. The average male crash test  
model is 5 feet 9 inches tall and 172 pounds. Once the industry  
started using a range of body types in their safety testing, there was  
an improvement for any person whose body didn’t match the design  
of the male crash test model, across all genders, sizes, and ages.  
We can see from these examples how the deep perceptions people  
have about one another can be manifested in the design of products  
and environments. Many features of the most famous American city-  
scapes were constructed with a specific intention to exclude groups of  
people from social and economic opportunities. Even after those struc-  
tures are demolished, retrofitted, or long gone, it’s striking how an us-  
and- them mindset continues to manifest in the designs around us.  
79 CHAPTER 6  
Some designs are intentionally created to exclude groups of people.  
It isn’t always a matter of mindlessness or forgetting to consider a  
community, but a targeted act of discrimination motivated by racism,  
ableism, sexism, classism, or related motivations to exploit power.  
Rectifying these forms of exclusionary design requires a shift in cul-  
ture and a laser- sharp focus on changing the root of that exclusion.  
An unspoken hierarchy also appears when attempting to design  
solutions for groups that are perceived as needing help. Without an  
authentic and meaningful understanding of a person’s life experi-  
ences, stereotypes can prevail. All too often, designers and archi-  
tects perceive the recipients of their solutions as “other people.”  
This mindset distances the designers from people they perceive as  
disadvantaged beneficiaries of their design.  
The problem is separation. It’s rooted in the ways we categorize  
human diversity. The most common ways that we group people by  
diversity are single dimensions like ability, gender, race, ethnicity,  
income, sexual orientation, and age. Even if we know that people  
are more complex than a single dimension, businesses regularly try  
to solve problems based on these monolithic groupings.  
Many of these demographic categories have more to do with  
business or social power structures than with how people actually  
interact with the world. It’s unclear why a software designer needs  
to know the gender identity of a customer, or whether or not they  
have two X chromosomes, in order to create a better way to orga-  
nize photos. Unchecked assumptions about any group of people,  
especially when treated as a monolithic group, might misdirect us  
toward ineffective, even offensive, solutions.  
How we categorize people shapes how we make. With a growing  
interest in participatory design methods across many professional  
80 MATCHMAKING  
fields, how is that participation to be facilitated? What kinds of  
questions do you lead with? Do you meet people in their homes, or  
require them to visit your office? What tools do you ask them to use  
when providing input to the design, and are they comfortable using  
them? Meaningful inclusion is much more than hosting listening  
tours, focus groups, or interviewing people on the street.  
One way to start is by building an extended community of “exclu-  
sion experts” who contribute to your design process. These are  
people who experience the greatest mismatch when using your  
solution, or who might be the most negatively affected. Develop  
meaningful relationships with communities that contribute to a  
design. Designing with, not for, excluded communities is how we  
put the inclusive in inclusive design.  
DISRUPTIVE CHANGE  
In the pursuit of innovation, it’s common for teams to focus solely  
on the functional elements of design. It’s equally important to  
understand the emotional considerations of a design, in particular  
the familiarity people have already developed with an existing solu-  
tion. What are their patterns of using a solution? What makes these  
patterns important to their lives?  
Consider a person who takes a carefully planned path through a  
city to make it on time to work every day. Or the ways they organize  
important files in their personal computing devices. Something as  
simple as changing the name of a feature in a software application  
or a street name in a city could be disorienting for them.  
This exclusion habit is often motivated by economic factors.  
Change for the sake of newness. Growth for the sake of progress.  
81 CHAPTER 6  
Delight for the sake of differentiation. Fixing perceived disorder into  
order. Along the way, design changes can disrupt human patterns  
and relationships. Especially when the problem solver, whether  
an architect, designer, engineer, or business leader, presumes that  
their own professional expertise supersedes the life expertise of  
people who are affected by those changes.  
The same thing happens in digital spaces when we change prod-  
ucts that people are familiar with. Each time we change a design, by  
adding new features or moving things around, we require people to  
learn something new. They have to form new relationships and new  
patterns of behavior.  
The problem is, everyone adapts in their own ways. Not everyone  
solves problems or learns through the same approaches. But when  
designers make changes to a product or space, their ability biases  
can lead the way.  
As an example, while at Microsoft, I received a phone call one  
evening from a product leader who was concerned that there were  
far fewer women using their product than they expected. He was  
also concerned by the early solutions that teams were proposing to  
address this issue.  
We took a closer look at the patterns of behavior that were hap-  
pening in the product. We studied the research of Oregon State  
University professor Margaret Burnett, who has spent over a  
decade studying the relationship between gender and software. In  
her GenderMag project, Dr. Burnett identified a set of facets that  
consistently lead to differences in how software is used by persons  
identifying as women or men.3  
One facet, in particular, stood out to us\: how people prefer to  
learn. Dr. Burnett also refers to this as a person’s willingness to tin-  
ker with new software. She describes a spectrum that spans between  
82 MATCHMAKING  
two approaches to learning new technology. On one end is a prefer-  
ence to learn through a guided approach, or with the assistance of  
a human being. On the other end is a high willingness to explore a  
software interface through trial and error.  
The research showed that people who identified as women dis-  
tributed relatively evenly across this spectrum. There was a wide  
range of learning styles that different women used when learning  
new software. People who identified as men, however, clustered  
heavily toward the end of the spectrum for tinkering and trouble-  
shooting solutions.

This insight helped us reframe the problem. Was it possible that  
our product favored a particular learning style? We restructured our  
research to recruit people by learning style, and interviewed people  
from multiple genders, including transgender participants.4  
We found that people who preferred a guided learning approach,  
regardless of gender, felt alienated and confused by recent changes we  
83 CHAPTER 6  
made in the product. They were concerned that important programs  
had disappeared. Or they couldn’t figure out how to complete tasks  
they’d known how to do for years, because the interface had changed.  
It turned out that when we updated our product, we required peo-  
ple to learn something new. But we did so in a way that reflected  
our own internal learning styles. This differed from how many of our  
customers learned. After all, what percentage of the general popula-  
tion is trained to think like engineers? Design decisions were made  
with the assumption that people would just hunt around and try  
things until they found what they needed, reflecting our team’s own  
learning styles and disproportionately benefitting men.  
A SENSE OF BELONGING  
This ties back to Brown’s insight about her own ways of learning. It  
isn’t about needing help. It’s about making a personal connection.  
Guided learning is one way for people to understand why a solution  
works the way it does, which helps them feel more confident in  
their abilities to utilize a solution.  
We applied inclusive design and sought out customers, across  
genders, who preferred a more guided learning approach. The pro-  
cess was similar to seeking out people who have ability biases that  
complement the dominant ability biases of our teams.  
These conversations helped us understand elegant ways to con-  
nect customers to existing product guidance, and present it in  
ways that were relevant to the task they were trying to complete.  
Even more importantly, the engineering and design teams were  
united around the idea that we could tangibly include customers  
who could fill the gaps in our own knowledge. We isolated what  
84 MATCHMAKING  
we didn’t know and sought out this expertise from customers who  
felt alienated. Then we asked thoughtful questions, and let their  
answers change our design process.  
Disruptive changes can especially be an issue for people with  
disabilities who might depend on a particular technology to com-  
plete essential tasks in their lives. If a software program or website  
is updated, but the right steps aren’t taken to ensure the updates  
are compatible with assistive tools like screen readers, the result-  
ing changes can literally prohibit someone from doing their job. Or  
prevent them from using a form of transit that they need to get to  
work on time. A change to a payment system can impact a person’s  
livelihood.  
These learning biases can be further reinforced by feedback from  
customers. Many companies depend on their most engaged users,  
people who love products as much as the people who make them, to  
spend time providing feedback.  
How feedback is collected often reflects the preferences of  
the team that builds the product. As you might imagine, if you  
only take online feedback, or only provide customer support in  
English, the only people you’ll hear from are people who match  
this profile. This has a profound impact on which feedback makes  
its way to the design team.  
These feedback channels can also be a signal to customers that they  
either do or don’t belong with the product. With technology, many  
customers have a tendency to blame themselves for not being able to  
figure out the changes on their own. Common indicators are custom-  
ers who say “I feel like technology is moving so much faster than I  
am” or “I’m probably not smart enough to figure this out.” In essence,  
they feel excluded. The impact on people can be deeply emotional.  
85 CHAPTER 6  
Shifting that sense of exclusion requires careful attention to who’s  
missing from a solution and from feedback channels. Whose voices  
are the loudest and whose are missing? Seek out who’s missing and  
learn about their existing patterns of behavior. Design solutions that  
bring them successfully through your changes. Provide a diversity  
of ways to get guidance on what’s new and help customers get reori-  
ented with a product they’ve known and used for years.  
We can also shift the sense of belonging by opening up the ways  
that people can contribute to the design process itself. Contributing  
to the design of a product or environment, even in the smallest ways,  
increases the emotional connection between a person and that solution.  
The push to accelerate growth and change, for cities or software,  
is often necessary. But how it is implemented is vitally important.  
People create emotional connections to a design that make a place,  
or a product, feel like their own. Introducing change isn’t just about  
breaking apart concrete or bits of code. It’s breaking apart human rela-  
tionships. The result may be that people will leave and never return.  
Making a change without disrupting a sense of belonging can be  
difficult. It’s a challenge because it’s an emotional choice, not just a  
rational one. Those emotional considerations are best described by  
people who are the most excluded from your solution. Or those who  
stand to lose the most during times of change, including kids who will  
interact with the next generation of designs. Their contributions will be  
one of your greatest resources in designing where to go next.  
MY HOUSE, MY RULES  
Leaders can be powerful advocates for creating inclusion. They set  
the house rules. Although leadership can come from anyone in a  
86 MATCHMAKING  
team, there is a unique responsibility for people at the most senior  
levels of an organization. They must be willing to do the personal  
work of understanding inclusive design. Certainly there are func-  
tional investments that are important, but a senior leader can make  
or break a culture of inclusion.  
When someone in a leadership position declares they are com-  
mitted to inclusion, some people will be inspired to follow. Others  
will be skeptical after years of knowing the opposite to be true. And  
absolutely everyone will be waiting for what happens next.  
People are often caught off guard after they declare a commitment  
to inclusion. The first thing they need to contend with is everything  
that isn’t inclusive. It will show up and make itself known. How a  
leader listens to, learns from, and invests in shifting these exclu-  
sions will be the greatest indicator of their true intentions. Here are  
four considerations for leaders who want to improve the inclusion  
of their team.  
■ Make promises that you can keep. Acknowledge the current  
state of inclusion in your organization and address fundamental  
issues of access before moving on to other areas of inclusion.  
Greater damage to inclusion comes from declaring it a promise  
while having no plan for how to implement the change. Or build-  
ing new innovations on top of systems that lack basic accessibility.  
A broken promise is more detrimental than making no promise in  
the first place.  
■ Set an expectation that inclusion is a long game. Balance the cul-  
tural history that led us to where we are today with the reasons why  
inclusion matters to the future of an organization. Have measured  
plans for how to address entrenched exclusion habits. These have to  
account for the tradeoffs in resources that need to be made in order  
87 CHAPTER 6  
to build inclusive solutions. Specific people need to be accountable  
for completing the work. The work is hard and the road is long. But,  
as progress begins to happen, inclusion can be one of the stron-  
gest ways to mobilize people around a shared purpose. The work is  
meaningful, not just because it benefits overlooked communities,  
but because it can drive new ideas for growth with untapped inge-  
nuity and fresh thinking.  
■ Create a system of incentives and rewards that will motivate people  
to make inclusive designs. If the incentive structure for an engi-  
neer, designer, or marketer specifically calls out rewards for mak-  
ing inclusion a priority at the beginning of the design process, it  
demonstrates that an organization is truly committed to inclusion.  
If investments in inclusion, like accessibility, are treated as an added  
tax, paying that tax will always be deferred in favor of other business  
priorities. What we measure shows what we value.  
■ Bring people along in the process. Create a diversity of ways for peo-  
ple to contribute to changing your perspective as a leader. Apply the  
power of your leadership position to uplifting the excluded commu-  
nities that are affected by your choices.  
It isn’t organic. It doesn’t happen purely through goodwill. It  
takes intention, planning, and stamina.  
CONNECTING PEOPLE  
Inclusive solutions connect people, whether they’re in a neighbor-  
hood or somewhere on the Internet. The solutions that we build can  
be economic catalysts for excluded communities. Cities and tech-  
nologies can bridge people to better opportunities through access to  
work, education, and social resources.  
88 MATCHMAKING  
But how we go about making those solutions sets the stage for  
who benefits from the opportunities. This is what distinguishes  
inclusive growth from growth that only benefits a few.  
Design influences how people view themselves and their commu-  
nity. The outcomes of design carry the imprints of the professionals  
who crafted them. They are scratched and scored by the remnants  
of their creators’ thought processes and assumptions. Even after the  
architect or designer is long gone, their mark endures. The genera-  
tions of people who live with those designs every day can tell you the  
exact ways in which that design was a success and a failure.  
In times of growth and revival, how we go about creating our  
solutions can be the difference between perpetuating or transform-  
ing the cycle of exclusion. Moments of change are the ideal time  
to focus on inclusion. The key to success is matching great design  
challenges with great guidance from exclusion experts.  
■ ■ ■  
TAKEAWAYS\: HOW EXCLUSION EXPERTS RESOLVE MISMATCHES  
Exclusion habits  
■ A “for others” or “superhero” mindset, where pity and stereotypes  
influence design decisions without any meaningful contribution  
from excluded communities.  
■ A top- down approach to making decisions. Presuming that pro-  
fessional expertise supersedes life experience.  
■ Disregarding existing patterns of familiarity in pursuit of growth.  
Change for the sake of change.  
89 CHAPTER 6  
How to shift toward inclusion  
■ Identify exclusion experts. These are people who stand to lose the  
most or face the greatest mismatches with any changes you make to  
a solution.  
■ Design with, not for. Facilitate meaningful ways for exclusion  
experts to contribute to your design process.  
■ Understand the emotional value that people have already invested  
in an existing solution. Incorporate these emotional considerations  
as you create new designs.  
■ Maintain an ongoing community of exclusion experts who can fill  
your own gaps in perspective. Build relationships with local organi-  
zations that support excluded communities. Understand the role  
your product plays, or could play, in people’s lives.  
■ Review the techniques you use to collect, sort, and analyze cus-  
tomer feedback. Analyze how the design of that system determines  
who is willing and able to contribute feedback. Whose voice is loud-  
est? Whose is missing?  
90 7 THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS NORMAL  
Testing our assumptions about human beings.  
Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else.  
— Dr. Margaret Mead, pioneer in cultural anthropology  
How many different kinds of human beings are there in the world?  
If we aim to create solutions that benefit millions, even billions  
of people, our solutions need to work across a wide range of human  
diversity. But that’s easier said than done. People can be highly  
unpredictable. How do we design for so much complexity?  
A common exclusion habit is to oversimplify who uses or receives  
a solution. And then we forget to add human diversity back into our  
design process.  
Designers use many techniques to envision masses of people. Many  
of them are plagued by one dangerous idea\: the “normal” human.  
Our notions of normal were heavily influenced by a 19th- century  
Belgian astronomer and mathematician, Adolphe Quetelet. Here’s CHAPTER 7

# uses it

Figure 7.1  
Designers and engineers often use their personal assumptions about  
people to simplify the ways they think about users.  
a quick peek into that story, derived from Todd Rose’s exceptional  
book, The End of Average.1  
Quetelet had ambitions to be as well- known as Isaac Newton.  
Newton’s laws of motion and thermodynamics had brought cer-  
tainty to seemingly unpredictable phenomena in the universe.  
Probability and mathematical prediction grew in popularity, spark-  
ing new fields of science.  
Quetelet turned his ambition toward a new pursuit\: using math-  
ematical methods to make sense of uncertainty in human society.  
92 THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS NORMAL  
He started measuring human beings and amassing that data into  
statistical models.  
There was one mathematical model that dominated Quetelet’s  
approach\: the Gaussian distribution. It’s more commonly known  
as the bell curve. Carl Friedrich Gauss, a German mathematician,  
developed the proof of a concept that had been introduced decades  
earlier by Abraham de Moivre, a French mathematician and con-  
temporary of Newton’s.  
Gauss proved that the probability of an event \(like the positioning  
of an astronomical object, or the flipping of a coin\) could be drawn  
as a normal curve and that the average, or vertical midline, of that  
curve gave the closest representation of the true nature of that event.  
The bell- like shape of a normal curve makes it easy to recognize.  
The Bell Curve  
Figure 7.2  
Normal distribution has had many names, such as the laws of error and  
the bell curve. The word “normal” was first used to describe mathemat-  
ical elements of this curve that are perpendicular to each other. It did  
not imply “common” or “usual.” \(E. T. Jaynes, Probability Theory\: The  
Logic of Science \[Cambridge\: Cambridge University Press, 2003\], ch. 7.\)  
93 CHAPTER 7  
Quetelet gathered data on human bodies, such as height- to-  
weight ratios and rates of growth, across thousands of people in  
Belgium and surrounding areas in Europe. He plotted that data and  
was astonished to find they mapped to bell curves.  
Invigorated by his discovery, Quetelet started measuring many  
more aspects of human beings, creating physical, mental, behav-  
ioral, and moral categories of people. Everywhere he looked, he  
found bell curves. He became consumed with what he deemed  
the human ideal, the perfect average measurement across all those  
dimensions. Quetelet described the perfect face, height, intelli-  
gence, moral character, and beyond\:  
If the average man were completely determined, we might, as I have  
already observed, consider him a type of perfection; and everything dif-  
fering from his proportions or condition, would constitute deformity and  
disease.2  
When he published his Treatise on Man it was a revolutionary  
work. In its pages he held that individual people should be mea-  
sured against that perfect average. From this comparison, one could  
calculate the innate degree of “abnormality” of an individual person.  
Diversity and variations in human beings were treated as degrees of  
error from perfection.  
The idea was contagious and enduring.  
The bell curve was used to revolutionize existing fields of study  
and sparked entirely new ones, especially in the social sciences.  
Normal- based methods of diagnosing illness led to advance-  
ments in public health. Quetelet’s body mass index \(BMI\) is  
still used in many areas of the world to advise individuals on  
their degree of obesity or fitness. Eugenics, and its horrific asser-  
tions about the superiority of select abilities, races, and classes

reach the greatest number of people.  
of people, were born out of an idolization of Quetelet’s perfect  
average human.  
The conclusions that were derived from Quetelet’s approach were  
used to strengthen the power of some human beings and to dehu-  
manize others.  
The power of the bell curve still echoes through the design of  
our society, from classrooms to computers. Left- handed students  
are seated in desks made with the assumption that normal human  
beings are right- handed. Important features of smartphone applica-  
tions are placed based on where the average user, also presumably  
right- handed, is likely to reach for them.  
A common shorthand for this mindset is the “80/20 rule,” origi-  
nally created by Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who demonstrated  
95 CHAPTER 7  
that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population.  
Joseph Juran, a pioneer in the field of quality management, trans-  
lated Pareto’s insight into a rule for quality control, stating that 80%  
of problems come from 20% of causes. In essence, he was separat-  
ing the “vital few” key sources to a problem from the “useful many”  
potential sources to a problem.3  
Over time, many design teams have conflated the 80/20 rule  
with the bell curve. The common misconception is that the center  
of the curve represents an 80% majority of the population and 80% of  
the important product problems to solve. The presumption is that if  
we design a solution that fits the largest bulk of the curve, the mid-  
dle average, our solution will work well for the majority of people.  
This leads many teams to treat the remaining 20% as outliers or  
“edge cases,” a category of work that’s often deferred or neglected.  
In fact, edge cases can be a useful starting point for creating bet-  
ter solutions. Many exclusion experts use solutions in ways that  
resemble edge cases. But an edge case implies the existence of a  
normal, average human. When it comes to design, what if this aver-  
age human is simply a myth?  
EVERYONE AND NO ONE  
Rose provides a vivid example from the history of the United States  
Air Force \(USAF\).4 In the 1940s, the first fighter jets were designed  
to fit the average pilot. The USAF measured hundreds of bodily  
dimensions across thousands of pilots and used the averages of that  
data to design the instruments of the flight deck, or cockpit.  
Every feature of that flight deck was fixed in place, without adjust-  
ability. The assumption was that any individual pilot could adjust  
96 THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS NORMAL  
himself to overcome the gap in reaching any element of the flight  
deck that wasn’t a perfect fit for him.  
However, the Air Force was experiencing a high rate of crashes  
that couldn’t be attributed to mechanical failure or pilot error. A  
lieutenant and researcher, Gilbert Daniels, studied just ten of those  
human dimensions that were used in the design of the original  
flight deck. He measured four thousand pilots to confirm how  
many of them fit all ten dimensions.  
The answer was zero.  
Not a single pilot matched all ten dimensions. Everyone differed  
in at least one way. In essence the USAF had designed a flight deck  
for everyone, and no one.  
This led to the development of new design principles based on  
individual fit. Innovations like adjustable seat belts, seat heights,  
and positioning of controls. Once the instruments of a flight deck  
could be modified by an individual pilot, their safety and perfor-  
mance improved. The adjustments also drastically increased the  
number, and diversity, of people who qualified to be fighter pilots.  
These advancements have influenced the design of many more  
industrial products. Every time you ride in a car and move your seat,  
seatbelt, or mirrors into a position that works best for you, you’re  
benefitting from these original innovations in individual fit.  
The fighter jet example underscores how designing for the aver-  
age serves no one, whether the design is for the shape of a desk  
or a curriculum that emphasizes specific ways of learning. Many  
designs make people feel like those first pilots, adapting themselves  
in extreme ways in order to use a mismatched design.  
The idea of a normal human being was constructed out of the  
ambitions of a 19th- century mathematician. It was used to make  
97 CHAPTER 7  
meaningful advancements in some areas of society, and used to  
great detriment in other areas. Most importantly, what if the idea  
simply wasn’t true?  
All people are variable over the course of their lives. What if our  
minds and bodies are simply unpredictable? Which human, exactly,  
should be at the center of human- centered design?  
HUMAN- LED, BEYOND HUMAN- CENTERED DESIGN  
Personas are a common tool that designers and marketers employ  
when thinking about who will use their product. A persona is  
a description of a mythical person, backed by large amounts of  
research data. The persona might join a name like “Janet” with an  
image of a woman on a poster next to a description that states, “I’m  
a soccer mom and freelance consultant who coordinates my fami-  
ly’s calendar and has limited time to learn about new technology.”  
Or the smiling face of a man sitting at a computer next to the words  
“I’m Jim. I’m the lone information technology professional at a  
startup and I always want to keep up with the latest gadgets.”  
Like bell curves, personas aim to minimize the uncertainty that’s  
inherent in trying to understand a large group of people. Perso-  
nas were created to remind designers and engineers that they’re  
building solutions for someone other than themselves. While well-  
intentioned, personas oversimplify people, without clear direction  
on how or when to add human diversity back into the design process.  
Designers are also taught that the long tails of a bell curve are  
the edge cases of how people will use their solutions. The excep-  
tional uses. Issues related to accessibility, in particular, are treated  
as part of that long tail. The bell- curved mindset mistakenly leads us  
98 THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS NORMAL  
to believe that the market opportunity for accessibility is minimal.  
Accessibility is treated as an extreme of otherwise “normal” design.  
In chapter 8 we will review examples that disprove this assumption.  
If there is no normal user, there is also no extreme user. There  
is no such thing as people on the far reaches of the curve. There is  
no abnormal scenario. There is no edge case. Rather, we need new  
tools to represent human diversity and challenge entrenched habits  
of designing for the average.  
When personal computers first rose to popularity, it made sense  
to design graphic interfaces for those computers based on wide-  
sweeping generalizations about people. Typically, they imagined  
one person, using one computer, in one environment, completing  
one or two tasks at a time.  
In these early days of digital technology, the variability from one  
user to the next was also relatively low. Most people were novices at  
using computers to write an essay or create a spreadsheet. There-  
fore, it was somewhat easy to make general assumptions about  
who was using the computer, how they would be interacting with  
it, and their level of skill. Likely they would be seated in front of a  
screen and typing on a keyboard in a relatively quiet environment.  
Using these assumptions, it made sense for computers to be visu-  
ally and cognitively demanding, with arrays of icons on a desktop  
requiring people to hunt for tiny controls hidden in obscure locations.  
Today, however, unpredictability in how people use technology is  
higher than ever. Interactions with technology have undergone an  
explosion of diversity. Nearly every industry is rethinking their busi-  
ness, products, and services through the lens of digital transforma-  
tion. It’s a necessary consideration for many businesses that hope  
to remain competitive in the 21st century.  
99 CHAPTER 7  
Figure 7.4  
Early generations of personal computer interface design were based  
on a low degree of variability in how people used computers.  
One person might have dozens of interactions with digital inter-  
faces in the course of one day, and not just in using a smartphone.  
People interact with digital interfaces when they buy groceries,

They use computers in movie theaters, sun- filled parks, noisy

There is a dynamic diversity of interactions between people and  
society, especially as digital experiences facilitate our interac-  
tions with more aspects of society.  
they want to be interrupted with an urgent notification from a  
loved one.  
This means technology needs to be more than smart. It has to be  
appropriate to a given person for a specific time, place, and purpose.  
It can be overwhelming to even think about such diversity. How  
can we design for so much uncertainty as people move between  
environments and devices?  
We won’t get there on math alone. It’s indisputable that mathemat-  
ical models are a cornerstone of technology design. It’s incredibly  
101 CHAPTER 7  
useful to determine patterns across large groups of people. But  
when is it appropriate to apply these models to individual human  
beings? Math has its limits. Describing human individuality is one  
of those limits. If our aim is to create solutions that are beneficial in  
people’s lives, there are potentially harmful consequences to trying  
to understand humans solely through math.  
Technology has a lot to learn from humans. In particular, from  
humans who have a deep understanding of mismatched interactions.  
Their expertise guides better questions, as well as better solutions.  
LEARNING FROM HUMAN EXPERTISE  
Dr. Margaret Mead is often credited with transforming how we  
study human cultures. She brought attention to the role that culture  
plays in shaping individual personality. She helped popularize cul-  
tural anthropology and at the time of her death was one of the most  
famous anthropologists in the world. She called out inherent biases  
in intelligence tests at a time when many sociologists were churn-  
ing out studies in attempts to prove racial and gender superiority.  
While Quetelet- like methods inspired many academics to pursue  
bell- curved conclusions about humans, Mead conducted deep stud-  
ies of cultures that were vastly different from her own. She spent  
extensive periods of time living with and observing the native cul-  
tures of Oceania, especially in Papua New Guinea.  
An excerpt from the New York Times 1978 obituary of Dr. Mead  
reads\:  
Her conclusions were based on detailed observation, and if she did not con-  
duct anthropometric tests or produce statistical surveys she did convey her  
subjects graphically.  
102 THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS NORMAL  
Dr. Mead settled down with the people she was studying. She ate their wild  
boar, wild pigeon and dried fish; helped to care for ill children, and gained  
the confidence of her informants. At one time she built a wall- less house so  
she could observe everything around her. She possessed a trait unusual in  
anthropologists of her time, an ability to shed her Western preconceptions.5  
Dr. Mead focused on participation as a way to reveal patterns and  
conclusions. As she learned, the people she studied were in the  
lead. They were the experts in being human.  
When Quetelet gathered data on humans, he was consumed  
with quantifying the face, body, and full character of a singular  
ideal average man. His motivation was to fit all aspects of society to  
this average while dismissing any human who deviated from that  
norm as abnormal. This motivation has endured, whether implicit  
or explicit, through generations of his intellectual descendants,  
including many current designers, engineers, and marketers.  
This matters more than ever as data science grows in promi-  
nence. All of us are feeding that growth by interacting with com-  
puters that record more information about our behaviors than ever  
before. But data is just data. It doesn’t provide answers. The art of  
drawing conclusions from data is knowing how to collect, organize,  
and make sense of it.  
Taking time to qualify human depth and complexity, even with  
a relatively small number of people, can help balance the short-  
comings of “big data.” “Thick data” is gathered information that  
explains human behavior and the context of that behavior. It was  
first described as “thick description” by anthropologist Clifford  
Geertz in his book The Interpretation of Cultures. Thick data is a way  
of understanding how people feel, think, and react and their under-  
lying motivations.  
103 CHAPTER 7  
Together, “big data” and “thick data” can give specific and mea-  
surable practices for reintroducing human diversity into the design  
process. For design, big data is like a heat map that can point out  
interesting areas to investigate. It sheds light on where patterns  
exist, especially when people use a solution in ways that don’t match  
a designer’s expectations.  
In complementary ways, thick data can help us zoom in and under-  
stand what’s really going on. It helps reveal the underlying reasons  
why big data patterns exist. It helps us identify the human behaviors  
that contribute to large trends. Big and thick data can work together to  
help us understand areas of exclusion in products and environments.  
It’s challenging, if harmful, to pursue one universal model to guide  
how we think about all humans. But it is possible to understand in  
great depth a particular problem worth solving for one person.  
THE PERSONA SPECTRUM  
Earlier we examined the distinction between inclusive and universal  
design. The former emphasizes one- size- fits- one solutions, the latter  
emphasizes one- size- fits- all. The persona spectrum is an inclusive  
design method that solves for one person and then extends to many.  
Consider the rise of television, a visual and audio medium.  
Captioning was initially created in the early 1970s by the National  
Bureau of Standards and ABC to make television content accessible  
to Deaf and hard- of- hearing communities. In 1972, Julia Child’s The  
French Chef aired on PBS as the first television episode with captioning.  
Today, roughly 360 million people in the world are deaf or have pro-  
found hearing loss. Thirty- two million of them are children.6 Nearly  
everyone, given a long enough life span, loses their hearing as they age.  
104 THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS NORMAL  
Captioning and subtitles are essential tools for making informa-  
tion accessible to millions of people. And many more people benefit  
from these solutions. In noisy airports or crowded pubs, patrons  
rely on captioning to access sports and news. Captions are increas-  
ingly common in social media when we can’t turn up the volume  
on our smartphones. They also assist new readers or people who are  
learning a new language.

Figure 7.6  
Closed captioning, originally designed for Deaf communities, is beneficial  
to many more people across a variety of environments and circumstances.  
This solution initially addressed a mismatch between television  
audio and the Deaf community. It went on to benefit many more  
people with hearing loss because of age, injury, or environment.  
105 CHAPTER 7  
The persona spectrum can help us create inclusive designs in  
repeatable ways. Here are four examples of persona spectra based  
on some physical human abilities. Similar spectra could be drawn  
for any dimension of human physical, cognitive, emotional, and  
societal abilities. It all depends on the problem you’re trying to solve  
and the ways that people might interact with that solution.

Figure 7.7  
There’s a spectrum of permanent, temporary, and situational mis-  
matches that people experience based on their abilities and disabilities.  
The persona spectrum starts on the left, with the person who  
experiences the most mismatched interaction. For example, if you  
were designing a charging station for an electric vehicle, you would  
certainly need to consider how it would work for any driver who was  
born with one arm. There would be a lot to learn from talking with  
people about how well existing gasoline fuel pumps work.  
106 THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS NORMAL  
But you could also learn a lot by spending time with someone  
who’s blind to understand how they navigate existing payment  
kiosks for buying groceries or bus tickets. This perspective is also  
important for a time when self- driving electric cars become main-  
stream and will need to work well for people who are blind.  
A persona spectrum is more than just a continuum of ability.  
It’s about understanding why people across that spectrum want to  
access that solution.  
An example of this important nuance is Hearing AI, a project ini-  
tiated by a Microsoft developer, Swetha Machanavajhala. One day,  
her neighbor showed up at her front door, angry about the loud  
sound coming from Machanavajhala’s apartment. It was her carbon  
monoxide detector. Machanavajhala, who has profound hearing  
loss, hadn’t heard it.  
The experience inspired her to build an application that could  
alert the user to sounds in their environment. Taking an inclusive  
design process, her team learned from a range of people who were  
deaf and hard of hearing. They learned about the importance of  
Deaf culture and participated in American Sign Language classes  
and events.7  
An important theme emerged\: no one was interested in a solu-  
tion that attempted to “fix” or “replace” an ability to hear. The func-  
tionality of telling people what a sound was, like a crying baby or a  
honking horn, felt like an inappropriate attempt to fix a person’s  
deafness.  
Rather, people were interested in the emotional information that  
would guide them to make their own conclusions about the nature  
of a sound. For example, knowing whether the inflection in a per-  
son’s voice meant that they were being sarcastic or being angry. As a  
result, Swetha and team built a solution that visualized the intensity  
107 CHAPTER 7  
of a sound and the direction it was coming from, so that a user could  
turn in that direction and determine what it was for themselves.  
Tying back to the persona spectrum, it’s important to understand  
what motivates a person to use a solution. Rarely is it a purely func-  
tional reason, like knowing the identity of a sound. More often they  
are motivated by some universal human need, like an increased  
sense of independence or creating an emotional connection.  
Human Motivations  
independence, connect, create

permanent temporary situational  
Figure 7.8  
A shared human motivation guides how to extend the benefits of a  
design across a spectrum of people who are excluded on a temporary  
or situational basis.  
These motivations are the glue that connects people across a per-  
sona spectrum. When we design for one person who experiences  
mismatches in using a solution, we can then extend the benefits of  
that design to more people by asking who else might want to partic-  
ipate but is excluded on a temporary or situational basis.  
108 THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS NORMAL  
A persona spectrum can improve the inclusion of existing solu-  
tions, extend seemingly niche solutions to broader populations of  
people, and futureproof your design.  
COGNITIVE, SENSORY, AND SOCIETAL MISMATCHES  
These introductory persona spectra focus heavily on physical mis-  
matches. Exclusive designs are equally prevalent in cognitive, sen-  
sory, and societal areas. Sometimes they can be more challenging  
to recognize\: while a physical barrier often literally stands in your  
way, these other types of mismatches might be subtler. Here are a  
few thoughts on how we can extend the fundamentals of inclusive  
design beyond physical abilities.  
With digital experiences, cognitive mismatches are especially  
important to understand. The human mind is being influenced  
in so many new ways by applications that constantly compete for  
our attention. Or augmented reality products that change how peo-  
ple perceive a combination of physical and virtual environments.  
Building a solution to fit how a person learns, remembers, focuses,  
uses language, or experiences sensations can be a complex design  
challenge.  
The diversity of the human brain and body is far from being fully  
understood. Yet there are a growing number of examples of cogni-  
tively inclusive products, many of them focused on education and  
learning environments. Some of these are built with the participa-  
tion of people with cognitive and sensory disabilities. Others are  
focused on types of cognitive diversity that aren’t disabilities.  
Societally, technology is a gateway to accessing economic and  
social opportunities, especially as people around the world join the  
109 CHAPTER 7  
Internet for the first time. There are over 730 million people on  
the Internet in China, roughly twice the population of the United  
States.8 Ninety- five percent of Internet users in China access it  
using mobile devices.9  
Many people are joining the Internet through voice- based com-  
puters, by talking to their devices as a primary mode of interaction.  
Augmented and virtual reality are quickly becoming primary ways  
to access the Internet for millions of people in China.  
Global shifts in digital participation lead to interesting design  
challenges. In areas of the world where touchscreens dominate,  
most designers are focused on creating graphic user interfaces.  
These can be seen and touched. In areas of the world where voice-  
activated interfaces will dominate, designers are focused on speech  
commanding and conversational design.  
Design for societal inclusion needs to consider the greater cul-  
tural context that surrounds a design. Complex challenges like lan-  
guage, politics, currency, Internet bandwidth, and social nuances  
are important factors in designing inclusive solutions.  
At minimum, inclusion will depend on how well designers can  
work beyond the types of abilities and technologies that dominate  
their immediate environment.  
DESIGN FOR ONE, DESIGN FOR 7 BILLION  
The more I learn about inclusive design, the more I’m convinced  
that there are 7.4 billion different types of people on the planet.  
“Empathy” is a word that is often used in design. What does it  
mean to design with empathy for billions of people? As technolo-  
gists grow more aware of the exclusion that their products might  
110 THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS NORMAL  
create, there’s a renewed focus on increasing empathy. This word,  
like the word “inclusion,” has many different interpretations.  
Some design methods for empathy focus on simply talking to  
people. For example, introducing yourself to people on the street  
and asking them for feedback on an idea. Other approaches empha-  
size ways to question your own assumptions and abstractly consider  
how other people might feel about a problem. Some teams have  
extensive research departments where sociologists, anthropolo-  
gists, and psychologists conduct studies with people. Most of these  
approaches don’t scale to the level of billions of people.  
Various cultures describe the concept of empathy in different  
ways. In the context of designing technology, there are two Man-  
darin Chinese descriptions of empathy that are particularly use-  
ful, shown here next to an English translation of each individual  
character.  
with | reason | heart  
total | situation  
Figure 7.9  
Two Mandarin descriptions of  
empathy.  
111 CHAPTER 7  
Empathy, “to reason with the heart.” Empathy, to sense “the total  
situation.” Building solutions on a global scale requires designers  
to do both, equally well. It’s making sense through the greater con-  
text and the relationships that lie therein, incorporating both the  
breadth and depth of humanity. This is how empathy will evolve to  
meet the challenges of designing for 7.4 billion people.  
Inclusion requires us to shift our assumptions about who receives  
the things we design. It starts with curiosity and observation. Ana-  
lyzing massive amounts of data can amplify new categories of prob-  
lems to solve. It can help us iterate through ideas and optimize our  
solutions more quickly. And when we craft those solutions we have  
a responsibility to make sure they work well for people, function-  
ally and emotionally. These are nuances that come from real- life,  
human- to- human conversations.  
Not everyone is an anthropologist. We aren’t all mathematicians.  
Not everyone is great at putting aside their cultural preconceptions.  
But we can all learn how to seek out excluded perspectives and let  
them supersede our own.

112 THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS NORMAL  
How to shift toward inclusion  
■ Create a baseline assessment of how well your solution works for  
excluded communities, especially people with disabilities.  
■ Create a persona spectrum that is specific to the problem you’re  
trying to solve.  
■ Build thick data with the people who face the greatest mismatches  
in using your solutions. Learn from their expertise with thoughtful  
observation and inquiry.  
■ Balance big data with thick data. Use big data as a heat map to  
reveal key mismatches between people and your solution. Use thick  
data to investigate the reasons behind these mismatches and gain  
insight into better solutions.  
■ Build one- size- fits- one solutions to fit people who likely face the  
greatest mismatches when using your solutions. Extend the solu-  
tion to people who face similar mismatches on a temporary and  
situational basis. Focus on the shared reasons why each of these  
groups wants to participate in your solution.  
113 8 LOVE STORIES  
How inclusion drives innovative outcomes.  
How many objects in your home are the result of inclusive design?  
Maybe it’s the adjustable chair at your desk. The keyboard to your  
computer. Your smartphone touchscreen. Your reading glasses.  
These, and many more objects, are the descendants of a long his-  
tory of innovations that were made to remedy exclusion.  
Many assistive solutions that were originally marketed to people  
with disabilities eventually found mainstream potential. As tech-  
nology improves, functionality gets better and market opportunities  
expand. In turn, businesses that recognize these opportunities are  
more likely to invest in making the design of that product highly  
usable and beautiful.  
This remains true for a number of rising technologies. Speech  
recognition and voice commanding were, in part, initially designed  
for people with disabilities as a way to interact with computers with-  
out using a keyboard, mouse, or screen. Today, millions of people are CHAPTER 8

jumping to solutions. This makes it a powerful way to make the busi-  
ness case for shifting toward inclusion.  
talking to their cars and household devices to get directions, check  
the weather, and order pizzas using the same core technologies.  
The deep exclusion habit in what we make is the fixed meaning we  
assign to objects. A classic creative thinking exercise is to imagine  
multiple ways of using a typical brick. A brick could be used to build  
a wall. This fits the expected context and application of a brick.  
A brick can also be utilized to hold a door open in the summer.  
It can be heated and used to cook a meal. Or ground into dust and  
116 LOVE STORIES  
used as sand. When we change the shape, context, or purpose of an  
object, it can take on a new meaning.  
By stretching our assumptions about the purpose of an object or  
environment, we can explore how that solution flexes to be what-  
ever a person needs it to be. The signature trait of an inclusive solu-  
tion is how it adapts to fit each unique person.  
This stretch of creativity can be particularly challenging for  
problem solvers who think about excluded communities and  
accessibility in fixed ways. A brick is a tool for building walls. A  
screen reader is a tool for someone who’s blind. Video caption-  
ing is a tool for people who are deaf. Accessibility products are  
often thought of as fixed and specialized solutions for people with  
disabilities.  
As a result, accessible solutions often lack thoughtful design.  
Physically assistive objects like canes, wheelchairs, prosthetic  
limbs, or support braces can resemble the cold, medical objects  
of a surgeon’s operating room\: steel metal bars, rough materials,  
industrial- grade plastics, and lifeless colors. Everything about the  
design can feel like a cue to the user, and to others around them,  
that they are a patient in need of help.  
The same is often true in the creation of digital products. When  
a solution is treated as “for disability” or “for accessibility,” there’s  
often little or no attention paid to the design. A solution might meet  
all of its functional requirements but still lead to emotional or aes-  
thetic mismatches that can be equally alienating.  
Assistive devices, in particular, often play an intimate role in a  
person’s life. They become much more than just objects. They can  
be an extension of a person’s independence, beauty, strength, and  
connection with the world.  
117 CHAPTER 8  
The fixed way of thinking about assistive objects often triggers  
a few common questions before leaders are willing to invest in  
inclusion\:  
■ What is the business case for it?  
■ What is the return on investment?  
■ How can you prove that it works?  
Before we dive into business justifications, it’s helpful to study  
tangible examples of innovations that grew out of mismatched  
designs. A person who has experienced a great mismatch is likely to  
take an object that was intended for one purpose and use it in new  
ways. A desire to participate demands that they work creatively with  
what’s available to resolve the mismatches for themselves.  
Here are some of my favorite examples of inclusive design and  
the stories behind them.  
THE FLEXIBLE STRAW  
Joseph Friedman was at an ice cream shop with his young daugh-  
ter. Sitting at the counter, she was having a hard time drinking her  
milkshake through the straight paper straw without spilling the  
drink. Friedman inserted a screw into the straw and tightly wrapped  
a wire around it to make a flexible joint.  
That bend in the straw made it possible for his daughter to com-  
fortably enjoy her beverage. But it also works well for anyone who’s  
unable to hold a glass to their mouth, or reclined in bed from illness  
or injury. It also benefits anyone who’s reclined on a beach, enjoy-  
ing their favorite vacation beverage.  
118 LOVE STORIES  
TYPEWRITERS AND KEYBOARDS  
One of the first typing machines was invented with a woman named  
Countess Carolina Fantoni da Fivizzano, in the early 1800s. She was  
the friend and lover, according to some sources, of Italian inven-  
tor Pellegrino Turri. The countess slowly lost her vision at a time  
when the only way for someone who was blind to send letters was  
by dictating their note to another person, who would transcribe the  
message to paper.  
In order to keep their communications private, the Countess and  
Turri invented a machine that could be used to write notes by pressing  
a key for a single letter, raising a metal arm to press each letter into car-  
bon paper. This invention made writing accessible to people who are  
blind, but many derivatives have evolved over the past two centuries  
into the modern- day keyboards for computing and mobile devices.  
FINGERWORKS  
Wayne Westerman wanted to create a method of interacting with a  
computer that required no force in the hand. He was motivated, in  
part, by his own severe case of carpal tunnel syndrome. His com-  
pany, FingerWorks, developed a way to replace a keyboard with a  
touchpad for each hand.  
They initially marketed their invention to people with hand disabil-  
ities and repetitive- strain injuries to their arms. The company had a  
base of passionate customers who came to depend on FingerWorks  
products in their daily computer usage. There was also an increase  
in customers who were interested in the design as an easier way to  
navigate their computer, regardless of their abilities or limitations.  
119 CHAPTER 8  
FingerWorks sold their technology to Apple in 2005, enabling the  
tech giant to build their first gesture- controlled multitouch inter-  
face, the iPhone. Westerman is listed on a 2007 iPhone patent.1  
However, in the process, the original FingerWorks product was  
discontinued.  
PILLPACK  
The childproof cap on prescription bottles was invented in the  
1960s, about the same time that manufacturers started to apply  
candy coating to pills of aspirin. They needed a way to ensure that  
children couldn’t access the bottles.  
However, childproof caps are hard for everyone to use, not just  
children. People with limited dexterity of their hands, many of  
them due to age or injury, have a particularly difficult time opening  
a childproof bottle. Further, for people who take multiple medica-  
tions, the risk of mistaking medication can be serious, even deadly,  
and a curved surface of a pill bottle increases this risk by making it  
difficult to read instructions on the label.  
PillPack founder and second- generation pharmacist T. J. Parker  
and his team partnered with IDEO to design a better way to  
deliver prescriptions. They focused on people who faced the great-  
est mismatches in using medication. Some of them were long-  
term cancer patients who took over a dozen different medications  
in one week.  
Their final solution wasn’t simply a more accessible pill bottle.  
They reimagined the prescription delivery service. A patient can  
order their prescriptions through PillPack and their medication  
arrives in presorted packages. So rather than the patient needing to  
120 LOVE STORIES  
organize their medications manually, they simply remove one small  
pouch that contains the right medication for the right time of day.  
For the 30 million people who needed to take more than five pre-  
scription medications in one day, this solution drastically improves  
safety and convenience. PillPack is now working to improve the  
system of interactions between patients, pharmacies, doctors, and  
insurance companies, with the launch of their comprehensive ser-  
vice Pharmacy OS.  
SONIFICATION OF THE STARS  
Wanda Díaz- Merced is an astronomer, born and raised in Gurabo,  
Puerto Rico. A passionate math and science student, she and her  
sister dreamed of riding in a space shuttle. While studying astron-  
omy, she started to lose her eyesight. For an astronomer, one of  
the key ways to study data from astronomical events is through  
visual illustrations. As her eyesight changed, Díaz- Merced worried  
that she wouldn’t be able to continue to practice and grow in her  
profession.2  
She started using a technique called sonification, which makes  
it possible to “listen” to the stars by turning the data from stellar  
radiation into audio files. She matches the patterns of the data to  
pitches of sound. During her PhD research she explored new and  
better techniques for sonification of astronomical data. She wrote\:  
Sound offers a way to increase sensitivity to visually ambiguous events  
embedded in the kinds of data space scientists and astronomers analyze.  
Radio waves are conveyed by drums, x- rays by the harpsichord, and so on.3  
Díaz- Merced continues to practice astronomy at a world- class  
level. Sonification also improves access to astronomical data for a  
121 CHAPTER 8  
much broader group of people. In particular, for any astronomer  
who is unable to distinguish the colors used in a data visualiza-  
tion or anyone who’s losing their vision due to age or injury. And  
for practitioners in any data- oriented field, using the combination  
of audio and visual information gives them greater access to the  
nuances of their data.  
EMAIL  
Vint Cerf is best known as a father of the Internet. He’s considered  
one of the primary architects of its early development. In 2002,  
Cerf authored “The Internet Is for Everyone,” a summary of what  
makes Internet access a human right, key threats to that access, and  
a plea for the Internet to be engineered in ways that make it usable  
by anyone in the world. To this day, Cerf asserts the importance of  
accessibility\: “It’s almost criminal that programmers have not had  
their feet held to the fire to build interfaces that are accommodating  
for people \[with disabilities\].”4  
He also created some of the earliest protocols for email. Cerf is  
hard of hearing and his wife is deaf. At the time, they couldn’t use  
a telephone to communicate. His work on email started, in part, as  
a way for him and his wife to stay connected when they weren’t  
together in the same room.  
Email, of course, is today nearly as ubiquitous as the Internet.  
Along with closed captioning and subtitles, it has become a key  
technology for people who are deaf, have hearing loss, or are simply  
separated by time and space.  
122 LOVE STORIES  
MORGAN’S INSPIRATION ISLAND  
In the blazing summer heat of San Antonio, waterparks are an  
important place for children and their families to cool down and  
play. One waterpark is named after Morgan Hartman, who, with  
her parents Gordon and Maggie, built this “park of inclusion.” They  
were inspired to do so after years of being unable to find great play  
spaces for Morgan, who has cognitive and physical disabilities.  
They set out to create a place where children with and without dis-  
abilities could play together in a barrier- free environment.  
There are a few things that make Morgan’s Inspiration Island  
extraordinary, beyond its colorful water features and accessible  
design.  
First, the Hartmans included a wide range of people with disabil-  
ities and specialists in creating the park. Second, they developed  
ways to adjust water temperature in real time so it can be personal-  
ized to a child’s sensory needs. Third, they worked with engineers  
at the University of Pittsburgh and the U.S. Department of Veterans  
Affairs to stock the park with motorized wheelchairs that are pow-  
ered by compressed air, a design called the PneuChair.5 The chairs  
are safe for water play and only take 10 minutes to recharge.6 And  
lastly, the park is free of charge to anyone with a disability.  
Many of these examples are love stories. In fact, love is a common  
trait in the creation of inclusive solutions. Some stories center around  
a person who was personally affected by a mismatched design. Their  
love for a profession or lifelong passion for an activity put a sharp  
focus on how it could be improved. Then they worked directly on  
building a better solution.  
123 CHAPTER 8  
Other stories come from a mismatch that loved ones faced when  
something interrupted their connection to each other.  
In all cases, people worked with their intimate understanding of  
exclusion, and with the participation of excluded communities, to  
design a solution that went on to benefit a wider group of people.  
There are many more stories of inclusive design, some that reach  
massive commercial success and others that are working quietly in  
the background of everyday life. Drawing from these examples, here  
are four ways to start building a business justification for inclusion\:  
1\. Customer Engagement and Contribution  
Engagement with a product increases when it’s easier to use. The  
key to this business justification is to demonstrate exactly how mis-  
matched designs are affecting real customers. Work with excluded  
communities to record the challenges they face when using your  
product. Detail the kinds of hacks that they use to make the prod-  
uct work. Make it crystal- clear and tangible. Present these stories to  
leadership teams as obstacles to customer engagement and explain  
how removing those specific mismatches can reduce the friction for  
many more customers.  
Another type of engagement happens when customers contrib-  
ute to the development of your product. Most types of technology  
and how they’re made are largely mysteries to the general public.  
Yet these solutions play a primary role in people’s daily lives. Their  
inclusion can mean more to them than you realize. Meeting in  
person and incorporating their input can increase their sense of  
belonging with your brand and product. Listen carefully to people  
and pay attention to the emotional connections. Share the stories of  
how they influenced your design decisions.  
124 LOVE STORIES  
2\. Growing a Larger Customer Base  
It can seem counterintuitive to start with a sharp focus on excluded  
communities. The strength of this approach is that it outlines clear  
constraints, helping teams build a deep understanding of how to con-  
nect with a wider target audience.  
In a similar way, aspirational brands commonly focus on an elite  
community to build mass- market products. For example, working  
with world- class athletes to build a new footwear line. Or partnering with  
blockbuster filmmakers to explore augmented reality experiences.  
Stronger constraints can push designers and engineers to innovate.  
The key is to do so in a way that translates to a broader market by find-  
ing ways to make the solution relevant to a general audience.  
Another way to build a business case for inclusion based on market  
size is through the persona spectrum. Quantify the number of people  
whose abilities lie within the permanent, temporary, and situational  
categories of a spectrum of exclusion. If more is better, this argument is  
one way to present inclusive design as a significant market opportunity.  
3\. Innovation and Differentiation  
Leaders are often surprised by how inclusion can fuel innovation.  
Accessible solutions, in particular, have a history of seeding innova-  
tions that benefit a broader audience. This is for two reasons.  
First, many companies have decades’ worth of ideas and proto-  
types that they’ve developed but never released into the world. These  
solutions often sit unused, like a pantry of ingredients in a kitchen.  
Then, with a shift in perspective or context, an ingredient that was  
originally intended for one purpose becomes useful in a new way.  
When teams shift toward inclusion they discover new solutions, but  
also new ways to make use of existing but unused solutions.  
125 CHAPTER 8  
For example, screen contrast. Computer displays can be adjusted  
to increase the contrast in colors between different elements, like  
text and the background it sits against. This feature was vitally  
important to people with types of low vision that make it difficult to  
distinguish between objects on a screen if their colors are similar.  
Screen contrast became relevant to a much wider group of peo-  
ple once mobile phones arrived. Suddenly, anyone who was using a  
phone in bright sunlight had a hard time reading the information on  
the screen. As smartphones evolved, they used existing screen con-  
trast technologies to automatically adjust a screen and make it read-  
able outdoors. A new problem created new relevance for an existing  
technology, improving the product for a wider group of customers.  
Second, innovation is amplified by new perspectives. Through  
inclusive design methods, a team learns how to open their pro-  
cess to include people with complementary ability biases and new  
kinds of expertise. Sometimes the person who can have the greatest  
impact on a solution is someone who has relevant expertise but isn’t  
deeply involved in the technical intricacies.  
Many inclusive innovations don’t require a dramatic reinvention  
of technology. They don’t require tearing down existing solutions to  
create new ones. Often, it’s just applying a new lens to the resources  
that already exist, and forming new combinations of existing solu-  
tions. It starts by employing new perspectives to reframe the prob-  
lems we aim to solve.  
4\. Avoiding the High Cost of Retrofitting Inclusion  
Many teams and companies treat accessibility and inclusion as an  
add- on, something to consider only in the final stages of complet-  
ing a product. It’s the unfortunate result of the bell- curved belief in  
126 LOVE STORIES  
an average human. A team that treats inclusion as an afterthought  
focuses first on people they imagine are most like themselves, espe-  
cially in ability and in cognitive and societal preferences. They com-  
monly believe that this group of people represents the majority of  
their audience.  
Conversely, they will assume that demographically underrep-  
resented groups of people, like people with disabilities, are edge  
cases, a small percentage of the population that doesn’t represent  
large opportunities for revenue. This is simply a myth. The myth of  
the minority user.  
After decades of building products with an average- human  
mindset, there is a lot of neglected accessibility work that needs  
to be addressed. While it’s hard to gauge exactly what percentage  
of all websites are inaccessible, a growing number of accessibility  
audit firms will tell you that their clients are often surprised at  
how many of their websites and digital products don’t meet legal  
standards for accessibility. It can take huge resource investments  
to fix these basic issues. This is the high cost of treating accessibil-  
ity as an afterthought.  
Another way to quantify the cost of retrofitting inclusion is the  
number of lawsuits and public relations missteps companies face  
when they release discriminatory solutions. From aggressive start-  
ups to careful tech incumbents, there are plenty of examples of how  
costly it can be to neglect issues of inclusion during the product  
development process.  
Cathy O’Neil, author of Weapons of Math Destruction, does an  
excellent job of detailing the potential dark depths of human  
biases that are baked into technology.7 Beyond the accidental  
chat bot that’s trained to spew hate speech, or a selfie filter that  
127 CHAPTER 8  
resembles insensitive racial caricatures, O’Neil provides examples  
of how machine learning is amplifying the cycle of exclusion on  
a massive scale, from predictive policing to the algorithms that  
determine what advertisements show up in your phone. The  
cycle of exclusion is amplified when machines are coded through  
human bias.  
Ideally, every new product or project would consider inclusive  
design from the beginning, as a way to proactively save time and  
resources. There would be no retrofitting required. More feasibly,  
inclusive design needs to happen when and where it can, while  
always pushing to happen earlier in the development process.  
The best way to do this is to weave inclusive design methods  
throughout the entire process of developing a solution. There is no  
one- size- fits- all approach to practicing inclusive design. Each com-  
pany needs to employ a combination of methods that complements  
their existing processes.  
BEAUTIFUL OBJECTS, HUMAN EMOTIONS  
The cycle of exclusion culminates with the solutions that we intro-  
duce into the world. What we make is a powerful starting point in  
the cycle of exclusion. It can spark the imagination. It’s the point  
in the cycle that embodies our excitement for innovation.  
Introducing a new technology into society can have a profound  
impact on how people feel and behave. Sometimes it’s an intense  
obsession, like Pokémon Go. At other times, it’s a lukewarm affec-  
tion that grows into a deep dependency, such as touchscreen smart-  
phones. The relationships between humans and objects are filled  
with emotions.  
128 LOVE STORIES  
Being rejected by exclusionary designs can lead to negative emo-  
tions. In contrast, a design that fits a person’s unique body and  
mind can have a positive emotional impact. Whether it’s the beauty  
of listening to the sounds of a distant star or the sense of adventure  
that comes from making new friends in a water park, the mark of  
a successful inclusive solution is that it’s both a functional and an  
emotional fit.  
In many ways, people are slower to change than technology.  
Building inclusive solutions doesn’t mean that everyone has to per-  
sonally embrace the values of inclusion. As we discussed at the  
opening of this book, inclusion can easily be mistaken for being  
a nice person. What if, instead, the skills of creating inclusive  
solutions were the measure of a successful engineer, teacher, civic  
leader, or designer?  
What if, rather than trying to change how problem solvers feel  
about inclusion, we could build inclusivity by changing how we  
create solutions? Could that be a faster path to a more inclusive  
society?  
What we choose to make shapes the future of who can partici-  
pate in and contribute to society. Mismatches can help us stretch  
our thinking far beyond technology for the sake of technology. A  
brick is more than a brick. The objects that assist us are more than  
accessories. Inclusive methods can help ensure that in our pur-  
suit of innovative solutions we are also making solutions that are  
humane.

130 9 INCLUSION IS DESIGNING THE FUTURE  
Why inclusion matters.  
We’ve taken a closer look at each element of the cycle and how we  
might shift exclusion habits toward a more inclusive path. Now, can  
we again ask ourselves, why do we make?  
Why would we sign up for the hard work of building inclusion  
without the guarantee of success? Why would we fight the inertia of  
a cycle of exclusion that’s been spinning for generations?  
Certainly, there are business justifications like gaining new mar-  
ket share, creating better customer experiences, and operating in  
more efficient ways. There are opportunities to connect teams to a  
meaningful purpose for their work and a new way of thinking about  
the people who interact with their solutions.  
There are professional reasons why inclusion matters. It  
expands our own thinking about problems that are worth solving.  
It sparks our creativity to think in new ways, in partnership with  
new people. CHAPTER 9  
And there’s our collective future. A future that is built on the  
choices that we make today, to create great solutions that connect  
people to each other and to opportunities in the places where they  
live. Some designers will make choices that reach millions of people  
and will endure for many years. If nothing else, I hope this book  
illustrates the weight of that privilege and opportunity.  
But there is one reason for inclusion that transcends all other  
justifications\: uncertainty.  
So many of the strategies that have led us to exclusion were about  
avoiding uncertainty. As children, we protect our games from dis-  
ruption and uninvited intrusions. As designers and engineers, we  
we make makes it  
we make  
uses it it’s made  
Figure 9.1  
We can shift toward inclusion when we apply inclusive design principles  
to any element of the cycle of exclusion. This includes reframing why it  
matters to our own lives, our solutions, and our society.  
132 INCLUSION IS DESIGNING THE FUTURE  
use mathematical models to homogenize the people we design for.  
As architects, we wipe away existing patterns of familiarity with a  
mandate to create order out of perceived chaos.  
Yet we now face greater uncertainty than ever before. Not just  
in the ways digital technologies permeate our societies, but in our  
connections with each other.  
OUR FUTURE SELVES  
My preteen daughter had this to say when I asked her to describe  
design.  
It’s a series of movements, powered by the human body, hand, or foot, or  
any part of the body. It’s also a thought in your mind that can be written,  
said, or drawn out. Everything that you make, from a knot in your hair to a  
satellite, is designed. There’s a lot of really good ideas out there.  
She tells me that in eight years there will be true hoverboards and  
medicines that prevent people from dying at a young age. If there  
was one problem that she could solve today, it would be making  
sure that everyone has a home to keep them safe and healthy.  
I can’t help but consider her answers in the context of my father’s  
life. When he was a child, his family was detained at Angel Island  
as part of the Chinese Exclusion Act, passed by the U.S. Congress of  
1882\. The Act initially prohibited all Chinese laborers from entering  
the U.S. for 10 years, and was extended in 1924 to all Chinese immi-  
grants. It wasn’t fully repealed until 1943.  
Shortly after they were released from Angel Island, his father and  
toddler- aged sister died of respiratory illnesses. My grandmother had to  
make a life for herself and my father in a new country. It’s an incredibly  
difficult time for him to recount. Too many sad memories, he says.  
133 CHAPTER 9  
As kids, my sister and I would follow him through the streets  
of San Francisco. We’d explore the hills of Chinatown, where our  
grandmother ran her business trading Tahitian imports and exports.  
In particular, we loved the YMCA yard where he played with friends  
and the basement after- school center where he stayed extra hours to  
study Cantonese. They lived in the back of their shop for years, until  
my grandmother saved enough money to buy a home in Oakland,  
across San Francisco Bay.  
On our final trip together to the city we walked the path along  
Stockton Street looking for the old shop and found, in its place,  
a fifteen- foot wall that spanned the entire block. Signs across the  
wall announced the upcoming construction of a new transit sta-  
tion on the site. After that, he never wanted to go back to the city  
again.  
Exclusion and inclusion shaped our family in deep ways. Gain-  
ing access to American society was one level of inclusion. Grad-  
ually being able to participate in that society was another level.  
Perhaps, also, being able to bring his own kids back to that first  
home was another kind of inclusion. One that represented a sense  
of belonging.  
The same things that motivate my daughter also motivated my  
family over ninety years ago\: health, safety, a home, and the desire to  
create. Making something that contributes to society in positive ways.  
I hope she’s right. I hope the near future holds the promise that she  
imagines. And that she sees herself as an important contributor to  
that future.  
With my father, I recognize how my future body will change. My  
hearing will fade by the time I’m seventy. My eyesight will cloud  
over and grow noticeably worse at night. My memory will remain  
sharp on some details, and I’ll start to forget others. My arms and  
134 INCLUSION IS DESIGNING THE FUTURE  
legs will lose their strength. How will the design of my environ-  
ment ensure that I can participate in society, rather than becoming  
socially isolated with age?  
This might be the most immediate kind of uncertainty that we  
each face. Our ever- changing abilities. Many of us are temporarily  
able- bodied and will face new kinds of exclusion as we age. When  
we design for inclusion we are designing for our future selves. Not  
just for the changes in our bodies but also our ability to contrib-  
ute to society. It’s designing how the next generation will treat and  
care for us. It’s making solutions to uphold the human connections  
that are most important in our lives. Our dignity, health, safety, and  
sense of being at home.  
FUTURE OF TECHNOLOGY  
Another area of uncertainty is how the next generation of technol-  
ogy will unfold.  
The evolution of technological ages can be framed in multi-  
ple ways. I like to think about them in terms of the relationship  
between humans and machines. The industrial age was initially  
fueled by the mechanization of production that replaced some types  
of human labor. People consumed the products of industrializa-  
tion, from mass- manufactured clothing to food to cars. Each object  
played one or two specific roles in a person’s life.  
The information age gave rise to human- computer interactions,  
where people met machines through a digital interface. Although  
these interfaces have grown complex and play many roles in our  
lives, they are still largely the product of a fixed set of choices deter-  
mined by an engineer or designer. They are hard- coded to perform  
certain tasks and follow certain rules. Their behavior is planned, to  
135 CHAPTER 9  
a large degree. And the people who interact with these interfaces  
have to adapt themselves to consume information in the predeter-  
mined ways that a program can deliver it.  
We are now feeling the pressure of transition to a new age of  
technology. Most companies are scrambling to make use of the  
overwhelming amounts of data being collected from people using  
digital interfaces, nearly 1.7 megabytes of new data per human per  
second.1 Today, about 90% of that data is unstructured, meaning  
it doesn’t follow a predefined data model and takes a lot of human  
manipulation to turn it into useful information. The small group of  
people with the elite skills to craft this data, and the machine learn-  
ing models that consume it, are more like specialized artisans than  
traditional software engineers.  
How people interact with these new systems is also changing.  
In the face of this change there’s a lot of experimentation hap-  
pening. There’s great enthusiasm for the ways that machine learn-  
ing models can generate, refine, and optimize better designs.  
Data from these models can persuade individual leaders to make  
decisions using more than their personal biases and preferences.  
Many pioneers in data- driven product development will tell you  
that the customer, through data, is always right and that it’s best to  
move fast and adapt through real- time customer feedback.  
Yet how do we avoid overdependence on mathematical models  
to reduce uncertainty, an overdependence that will lead us to cycles  
of exclusion similar to Quetelet’s normal curve? Can big data and  
machine learning algorithms respect human individuality, or will  
they just move all of us toward the center of the curve? Our enthusi-  
asm for data analysis could easily override our willingness to under-  
stand its limits. Most designers and engineers are just starting to  
136 INCLUSION IS DESIGNING THE FUTURE  
explore what these models are great at, and when their results are  
deceptively wrong.  
Questions like these are important because the rise in machine  
learning will form the backbone of new human- computer interac-  
tions. When you’re talking with an artificial intelligence to order  
a movie or send a message to a friend overseas. When you apply  
for a student loan, or a job. Or when your thermostat adjusts the  
temperature in your home. These machines are programmed to  
decide how to respond to you without human consultation. They  
are making recommendations to product teams on how to improve  
products using data amassed from millions of people.  
These technologies aren’t new. Many of them have been around for  
decades. The explosion of data and specialized hardware are fueling a  
new surge in machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions. So  
now, more than ever, the balance of thick data and big data is impor-  
tant. In particular, thick data that helps us understand the complexity  
of human behavior. The underlying cultural and personal reasons why  
people do what they do. And a great place to start understanding  
why they do is through the inclusion of excluded communities.  
For all the debate around the benefits and dangers of the various  
forms of learning machines, one trait makes this technology partic-  
ularly interesting to inclusive design\: adaptation.  
A machine that can flex itself to the unique needs of one person  
could be deeply personal to millions of people in infinite ways. It’s  
easy to understand why there’s an excited frenzy of innovation in  
these new classes of technology.  
However, there are emotional consequences. Think back to those  
kindergarten classrooms and the sting of rejection. Being per-  
sonal and adaptive cuts multiple ways. When something fits you  
137 CHAPTER 9  
beautifully, and feels like a true match to your individual needs, it  
can be a deeply positive experience. Conversely, when a solution  
excludes you, it can feel deeply personal as well. When a machine  
makes the decision on who to include or exclude, how will that feel?  
For every new area where technology is introduced as a facilita-  
tor of human interactions, what extra degree of responsibility must  
be built into that machine? How do we hold that machine and its  
creators accountable for exclusionary or harmful outcomes? Will  
we even recognize how those consequences are shaping the world  
around us if the general public doesn’t have a basic understanding  
of how these solutions work? Will already marginalized communi-  
ties become even more invisible?  
These are not assertions. They are genuine questions. These are  
the choices that every problem solver, engineer, architect, designer,  
lawmaker, entrepreneur, leader, and more should be asking as digi-  
tal technologies permeate every area of society.  
These moments of technological transition are the ideal time  
to introduce inclusive design. We can engineer these new models to  
ensure that they don’t lead to exclusionary design for the nonexis-  
tent average human. Without inclusion at the heart of the AI age,  
we risk amplifying the cycle of exclusion on a massive scale. It  
won’t just be perpetuated by human beings. It will be accelerated by  
self- directed machines that are simply reproducing the intentions,  
biases, and preferences of their human creators.  
INCLUSIVE GROWTH AND HUMAN POTENTIAL  
Perhaps the greatest uncertainty is how global economies, govern-  
ments, and businesses will respond to the changes being driven by  
the next generation of technologies, and how their reactions will  
138 INCLUSION IS DESIGNING THE FUTURE  
shape design decisions. The approach to inclusion in this book is  
heavily based in U.S.-centric definitions of inclusion, accessibility,  
and disability. Globally, there are varied approaches to inclusion that  
are rooted in cultural factors, such as language or the categories that  
are used to differentiate between groups of people. For many coun-  
tries, shifting cycles of exclusion toward inclusion is, ultimately, an  
economic shift. A profound one.  
Why does growth matter? Who will lead it? Who will it benefit,  
and how will we get there? On a global scale, there’s a rising con-  
versation about inclusive growth. Inclusive growth is defined as  
“economic growth that creates opportunity for all segments of the  
population and distributes the dividends of increased prosperity,  
both in monetary and non- monetary terms, fairly across society.”2  
The World Economic Forum \(WEF\) further describes inclusive  
growth as a positive or negative feedback loop between economic  
growth and social inequality.  
There is mounting evidence that inequality has a statistically significant  
negative impact on growth, and that reducing inequality can enhance and  
strengthen the resilience of growth. For example, if the income share of the  
top 20% increases, GDP growth tends to decline.3  
The WEF predicts that at least 5 million jobs in the world’s leading  
economies will be lost to tech by 2020.4 It’s easy to imagine how  
such large-scale changes in the global workforce could lead to greater  
social inequality. Instead, how might these changes become opportu-  
nities to reduce inequalities and support inclusive growth? Inclusive  
design could be one way to start. Not just for the products and envi-  
ronments of our world, but also for the systems that connect them.  
The landscape of employable skills and talents is also shifting. In  
their “Future of Jobs” report, the WEF lists its prediction for the top  
ten skills for future jobs\:5  
139 CHAPTER 9

5\. Coordinating with others,  
6\. Emotional intelligence,  
7\. Judgment and decision making,  
8\. Service orientation,  
9\. Negotiation,  
10\. Cognitive flexibility.  
These skills are focused on making sense of uncertainty; on tak-  
ing multiple approaches to framing a problem worth solving and  
finding solutions that adapt to fit unique situations. These are the  
talents of building connections with human beings.  
We have a lot of work to do to meet these talent demands, includ-  
ing new ways to recognize and remedy exclusion. If we simply carry  
forward today’s solutions for creating designs, writing code, or  
communicating with people, we risk making these roles even more  
exclusive than they are today.  
Inclusive design is simply good design for the digital age. Shifting  
who can contribute their talents to creating solutions will, in turn,  
shift what we make, how it’s made, and who benefits from those  
designs. We are all the beneficiaries of inclusive design over the  
course of our lifetimes.  
Design is essential to inclusive growth. It closes the gaps in the  
interactions between people and the world around them. We need  
solutions for human environments that adapt to fit individual  
needs, diverse bodies, and diverse minds.  
140 INCLUSION IS DESIGNING THE FUTURE  
Recognize  
exclusion.  
Learn from  
diversity.  
Figure 9.2  
The three principles of inclusive design.  
Solve for one,  
extend to many.  
Returning to the central question of this book\: If design is the  
source of exclusion, can it also be the remedy? Yes. When the princi-  
ples of inclusive design are applied to any element of the exclusion-  
ary cycle, it creates inclusion.  
We can interrupt our habits, even if just for a moment, to recog-  
nize the exclusion around us. And invite people who have comple-  
mentary ability biases to be co- designers in our solutions.  
We can learn from people whose exclusion expertise could be the  
key to unlocking some of our toughest challenges. Our one- size-  
fits- one solutions can extend to serve many more people. When we  
bring it all together, we create a diversity of ways to participate so  
that everyone has a sense of belonging.  
As a problem solver you can shift the cycle toward inclusion, one  
choice at a time. With each design, you shape who can contribute their  
talents to society. Their contributions, in turn, will shape the future  
for all of us.
