2012 This book provides architects and designers with a concise  
source of the core information needed to form a framework for the  
detailed planning of any building project. The objective is to save  
the designers of buildings time during their basic investigations.  
The information includes\: principles of the design process, basic  
information on siting, constructing and servicing buildings, as  
well as illustrations and descriptions of a wide range of building  
types. Architects need to be well informed about the requirements  
for all the constituent parts of new projects, to ensure that their  
designs satisfy their clients and the buildings conform to accepted  
standards and regulations.  
The contents list shows how the book is organised and the order  
of the subjects discussed.  
To avoid repetition and keep the book to a manageable length,  
the different subjects are covered only once in full. Readers  
should therefore refer to several sections to glean all the  
information they require. For instance, an architect wanting to  
prepare a scheme for a college will need to refer to sections  
other than that on universities and colleges, such as\: drafting  
guidelines; multi-storey buildings; various sections on services  
and environmental control; catering; residential buildings, hotels  
and flats \(for student accommodation\); office buildings \(for  
working environments\); libraries; car parks; accessible building;  
indoor and outdoor sports facilities; gardens; details on doors,  
windows, stairs and other building components; the section on  
construction, and more.  
Readers should note that most of the material is from European  
\(substantially German\) contributors. This means, for example,  
that information on climate and daylight is from the perspective  
of a temperate climate in the northern hemisphere. The actual  
conditions at the site of a proposed building will always have to be  
ascertained. Similarly, in the section on roads, illustrations show  
traffic driving on the right-hand side.  
References to standards, regulations and guidelines reflect the  
book's origins. For this translation, the publishers took the decision to  
leave the specific text references to German standards, regulations  
and guidelines in place, to indicate where similar standards,  
regulations and guidelines might exist in other jurisdictions. Users  
The publishers wish to thank the translator, Mr David Sturge. The  
publishers also wish to acknowledge and thank the copyeditor  
**Using this book**  
elsewhere must familiarise themselves separately with such national  
and local legislation and guidance. Again, local conditions must be  
taken into consideration for each individual case.  
The terminology and style of the text is UK English, which  
will need to be taken into account by readers accustomed to  
American English. These readers will need to be aware that, for  
example, 'lift' has been used instead of 'elevator' and 'ground  
floor/first floor' instead of 'first floor/second floor'.  
The data and examples included in the text are drawn from a  
wide range of sources; as a result a variety of conventions for  
dimensions is used throughout. The measurements shown are  
all metric but a mixture of metres, centimetres and millimetres is  
used \(and sometimes not identified\).  
Readers will also find some superscript numbers associated with  
measurements. When these appear by dimensions in metres with  
centimetres, for instance, they represent the additional millimetre  
component of the measure \(e.g. 1.265 denotes 1 m, 26 em,  
5 mm\). Anyone familiar with the metric system will not find this  
troublesome. Those people less comfortable with metric units can  
use the conversion tables \(to imperial measures\) at the end of the  
book.  
The plans and diagrams of buildings do not have scales as  
the purpose here is to show the general layout and express  
relationships between different spaces, making exact scaling  
unnecessary. However, all relevant dimensions are given on the  
detailed drawings and diagrams of installations, to assist in the  
design of specific spaces and constructions.  
To help readers identify relevant background information, details  
of British Standards Institute \(BSI\) and German Institute of  
Standardisation \(DIN\) building-related standards are provided in  
two types of location. At the end of the book is a selected list of  
BS and DIN standards, arranged broadly by topic. Additionally,  
the margin of many pages of the main text contains relevant BS  
and DIN codes. Please note that, if a British or Gerrnan code  
includes EN or ISO \(signifying European or international\), there is  
automatically a German dr British counterpart with the same code  
and title.

xi **Foreword**  
The 'Neufert' continues to be the most comprehensive, yet  
compact, first source of information on the design of buildings.  
Just as the daily office grind of the architect proceeds in many  
small steps and a few long strides, the sustained progress of  
the 'Neufert' is characterised not only by meticulous attention to  
standards and regulations, whose omnipresence in construction  
is undeniable, but also by reflection of the great issues of our  
time as they affect building project design. These important  
matters undoubtedly include concern for our environment and the  
absolute demand for sustainability in architecture. Sustainable  
building has many aspects, to be weighted differently according  
to the design brief.  
The team working with Professor Johannes Kister has set out,  
right through the book, to emphasise new sustainability standards  
and perspectives using the criteria 'objective information' and  
'topicality', which is presumably how Ernst Neufert would have  
approached the task. We hope that this new edition, which  
continues the redesign commenced in the previous one, will  
further consolidate the Foundation's reliable and exhaustive  
reference volume on building design.  
Neufert Foundation, March 2009  
The new German edition has once again been produced at the  
same location that was formative for Neufert's development  
as the office manager for Walter Gropius- the Bauhaus in  
Dessau. The decision to return to the roots here seems to have  
been the right one, because the previous edition was greeted  
positively by architects, students, lecturers and other interested  
parties. The concepts in this edition have been developed  
further by Nicole Delmes, nee Neufert, and lngo Neufert. My  
thanks are due to them both, for the trust and understanding  
they have shown, which made our collaboration straightforward  
and enjoyable. Also, I would especially like to thank Mathias  
Brockhaus, Matthias Lohmann and Patricia Merkel, a team that  
works in an exceptionally professional manner, the students of  
the Hochschule Anhalt- Fanjuan Kong, Tobias Schwarzwald  
and Mandy Wagenknecht- and the external consultants, whose  
valuable advice and reliable collaboration made an essential  
contribution to the success of the project.

xii This handbook developed from the notes made for my lectures at  
the Bauhochschule in Weimar. They derive from measurements,  
experience and understanding gained from practice and research  
in the human sphere, necessary for the design of buildings, but  
also keeping an eye open for new opportunities and demands.  
On the one hand we stand on the shoulders of our forebears but,  
on the other, everything is fluid and we are children of our time with  
our gaze towards the future, though the outlook of each individual  
is often different. This results from differences in education and  
training, the influence of the environment, personal predisposition  
and the relevant degree of internally driven self-development.  
Whether the 'fixed opinion' of today is absolutely correct remains  
to be seen, however, because it is only valid at the time of  
formation. Experience shows that fairer judgement develops  
with time than is possible immediately, since we do not have the  
necessary detachment for breadth of vision. This makes clear  
what reservations need to be imposed on teaching to prevent  
heresy. All teaching remains subjective and determined by its  
time and environment, despite all efforts to achieve truth and  
objectivity and all intentions to critically examine our favourite  
opinions. The danger of heresy can be avoided if the teaching  
also makes clear that it is not an end product but rather serves,  
and is subject to, all that is vital, upcoming and unfolding  
This will then provide for our students the attitude meant by  
Nietzsche when he said, 'Only those who change themselves  
remain associated with me.'  
The essential feature of such teaching of continuous progress,  
the servant of development, is that there are no ready recipes,  
no 'canned wisdom', but rather only building blocks, components  
or corners requiring the addition of combination, construction,  
composition and harmony.  
Confucius put it like this more than 2500 years ago\: 'I give my  
students a corner and they will have to find the other three  
themselves!' Born architects, or those who yearn to build, will  
keep their ears and eyes closed when a solution to a task is  
prescribed, because born architects are full of their ideas and  
ideals, and only need the elements in order to set to work and  
make something of them!  
Those who have found faith in themselves, an insight into  
connectivity, the play of forces, materials, colours, dimensions,  
who can absorb the reality and the appearance of a building,  
study its effect, investigate it critically and rebuild it in the mind,  
are on the only true path to the great satisfaction offered by  
active creation. This view of life should help them on their way. It  
# Preface  
should liberate them from all teachings, when it comes down to  
it even from this one, and lead them to their own creative work.  
It should provide initial assistance\: run- everyone must build for  
themselves.  
The architectural forms of our time are the result of the same  
process, which our predecessors underwent in order to produce  
their splendid temples, cathedrals and palaces. They had  
no models other than their own imaginations and intentions,  
ideas and ideals, with which they neared their aspirations. The  
commission formulated along these lines was enough to enliven  
concepts, which took solid form in line with the technological  
possibilities of the time and local conditions, and only bore a  
remote similarity to what had gone before. These new buildings  
could be technically much better and deliver more because of  
improvement in the state of technology. They could, however, also  
be compared artistically to similar structures from the past.  
If we compare an industrial building of today- light, roomy, with  
good dimensions and slimmer, lightweight construction -with a  
factory from the 18th century or a workshop of the 15th century,  
then the advantages of our modern buildings will be apparent  
even to the most blinkered conservationist. This means that,  
whenever construction projects serve a genuine requirement of  
our time, work can be expected from energetic contemporary  
architects that will bear comparison to, or even overshadow, the  
best of old buildings.  
A lively-minded university should offer primarily a view of our time  
and a look to the future, glancing back only to the extent that this  
is advisable or unavoidable. This was the advice of one of the  
greatest of our profession, Fritz Schumacher, when he warned  
a young student in his architecture lectures against getting too  
lost in art history issues while researching the past. Being led  
astray by a doctorate into learned byways could be at the cost of  
the energy required to meet the more varied requirements of the  
profession.  
In contrast to this, it is better just to hand students the elements  
of architecture, as is done in this *Architects' Data,* where I  
have attempted to reduce the building blocks of design to the  
essentials, to schematise and even to abstract in order to make  
imitation difficult and force students to produce form and content  
from within themselves. Their various design ideas will be  
coordinated anyway to a certain extent by current fashion, that  
idiosyncratic feeling of community which characterises mankind's  
joint efforts at a particular time and finds a durable and visible  
expression in contemporary style.

Paper Formats  
Standardised formats provide a foundation for office furniture  
design, which then determines the development of the floor plan.  
Good knowledge of paper formats is therefore important for the  
designer.  
Paper formats have generally been standardised \(apart from  
in the USA\) to conform to the internationally accepted \{ISO\)  
series of paper sheet sizes \{A,B,C,D\). These were developed  
on the basis of an area of 1 m2  
, divided according to the ratio  
of the sides\:  
x\:y=--12\~0 lengthofsidex=0.841 m  
xxy=1 length of side y = 1.189 m  
The basic format \(a rectangle with an area of 1 m2 and side  
lengths as above\) forms the basis for all the smaller sizes. The  
A format series is produced by halving or doubling the basic  
format \~ **0 + f\).** The additional series B and C are intended  
for items in dependent paper sizes, e.g. envelopes, binders and  
files\~ **0.**  
The formats in the B series are the geometric mean dimensions of  
the A series. The formats in the C series are the geometric mean  
dimensions of the A and B series \~ **0.**  
Strip \(or side margin\) formats are made by dividing the main formats  
lengthwise into halves, quarters and eighths \(for envelopes, signs,  
drawings etc.\) \~ **0 + e.**  
File cards without tabs correspond exactly to the standard  
formats. Tab cards are larger to allow for the tab, i.e. they have a  
projection at the upper edge for classification.  
Binders, files and folders are wider than the standard format  
to provide space for the fixing mechanism. Widths should if  
possible be selected from the possible dimensions from series  
A, s, c\~e.  
Pads and carbonless duplicate books have precisely the standard  
formats; if there is a standing perforated edge, then here the  
sheets are smaller than the standard format\~ **e.**  
Bound and trimmed books have precisely the standard format.  
If a further trim is necessary during binding, then the pages will  
be slightly smaller than the standard format, and the cover will  
project accordingly. The cover size must be at least the standard  
format \~ \(\). The cover width is determined by the binding  
process.

Technical Drawings  
The use of **standard drawing formats** makes it easier for  
architects to lay out drawings for discussion in the design office  
or on the building site, and also facilitates posting and filing. The  
trimmed, original drawing or print must therefore conform to the  
formats of the ISO A series--\> **0, 8-0.**  
The **title block** should be the following distance from the edge of  
the drawing\:  
for formats AO-A3 10 mm  
for formats A4-A6 5 mm  
For small drawings, a filing margin of up to 25 mm can be used,  
which reduces the usable area of the finished format. As an  
exception, **narrow formats** can be made by adding together a  
row of identical or adjacent shapes from the format range.  
From normal roll widths, the following sizes can be used to provide  
formats in the A series\:  
for drawing paper, tracing paper 1500, 1560 mm  
\(derived from these\: 250, 1250, 660, 900 mm\)  
for print paper\: 650, 900, 1200 mm.  
If all the drawing formats up to AO are to be cut from a paper web,  
a roll width of at least 900 mm will be necessary.  
Drawings which are to be stored in A4 box files should be folded  
as follows --\> **0\:**  
1. The title block must always be at the front, in the correct  
position and clearly visible.  
2. At the start of folding, a width of 21 em must always be folded  
first \(fold 1 \), ideally with the use of a 21 x 29.7 em template.  
3. A triangle is folded into the drawing starting from c \(fold 2\) so  
that on the completely folded drawing only the below left field  
marked with a cross is punched or clamped.  
4. The drawing is then folded parallel to side **a** to a width of  
18.5 em, for which a template of 18.5 x 29.8 em is useful.  
The last section is folded in half to adjust the sheet size,  
bringing the title block to the front. Long narrow formats can be  
correspondingly folded.  
5. The resulting strip is folded from side **b.**  
A piece of card of size A5 = 14.8 x 21 em can be glued to the back  
of the punched side to reinforce the edge. Any sheet size can be  
folded by following the instructions above. If the drawing length  
remaining after the folding of the first 21 em cannot be divided by  
18.5 em into an even number 2, 4, 6, etc., then the remaining width  
should be folded in the centre .

Layout of Drawings  
A strip 5 em wide should be left blank at the left-  
hand edge for binding or filing. The title block on  
the right **0** should include\:  
1. Description of the type of drawing \(sketch,  
preliminary design, for construction etc.\)  
2. Category of building shown or type of drawing  
\(layout plan, ground plan, section, elevation,  
diagram etc.\)  
3. Scale  
4. If appropriate, details of dimensions.  
Drawings for building permit applications \(to the  
building regulations authorities\) should also include\:  
1. Name \(signature\) of the client  
2. Name \(signature\) of the architect  
3. If required, \(signature\) of the site manager  
4. If required, \(signature\) of the contractor  
5. Comments by the building regulations  
authorities\:  
a\) About inspection  
b\) About approval  
If necessary, on back of sheet  
Layout plans, floor plans etc. should show the  
compass direction with a north pointer.  
Scales *--1* **f\)**  
The main scale of the drawing should be shown in large letters in the title block and  
in smaller letters for other scales; the latter should be repeated next to their respective  
diagrams. All objects should be drawn to scale; dimensions of parts which are not drawn  
to scale should be underlined. Scales should be restricted to the following if at all possible\:  
for construction drawings 1\:1, 1\:5, 1 \:10, 1 \:20, 1 \:25, 1\:50, 1\:100, 1\:200  
for site layouts 1 \:500, 1 \:1000, 1\:2000, 1\:2500, 1 \:5000, 1 \:10000, 1\:25000.  
Dimensioning  
Dimensioning is indicating dimensions on a drawing.  
Levels should be given on sections and plans or elevations. The signs+ or- before the  
number refer to the difference from level ± 0.00 \(generally the planned finished floor  
level, on the ground floor in the entrance area, related to sea level\). For parapets, the  
structural height above the structural slab level may also be given.  
If the height of wall openings, particularly for doors and windows, is to be given on  
drawings in addition to their width, then the width measurement is given above the  
dimension line and the height measurement is given below it. Rectangular cross-  
sections can, as a simplification, be dimensioned by stating their side lengths as a  
fraction, e.g. 12/16 \(in section\: width/height\).  
Round cross-sections have the diameter sign 0 before the measure\: e.g. 0 12. Radii have  
the capital letter *R* before the measure.  
Dimensions and other markings *--1* **e**  
All dimensions are given in the unfinished structural condition \(wall thicknesses\). In  
continental Europe, dimensions of less than 1 m on building drawings are generally  
given in em, dimensions over 1 mare given in m or mm. \(However, recently the trend has  
been to give all dimensions in mm, which is standard practice in the UK.\)  
Sections on plans  
On plans, vertical planes of one or more sections are shown as lines with short and long  
dashes *--1* p. 9 **0,** and the direction of viewing is also given. The entire line of the section  
does not have to be shown, but if the plane of a section breaks, this does *--1* **e.** If there is  
more than one section, then each should be clearly labelled.  
Room numbers are given in a circle.  
Room areas, in m2  
, are shown in a square or rectangle *--1* **e.**

and is to be worked on further. In this case, the text size 5.0 mm is to be selected for the drawing with line group Ill.  
Line group I does not fulfil the requirements for microfilming.  
2l Line group IV is to be used for construction drawings if a reduction from scale 1\:50 to scale 1\:100 is intended and the reduction  
has to meetthe requirements for microfilming. The reduction can then be further worked on using widths in line group II.  
If building drawings are manually or mechanically drawn with ink and standardised drawing equipment, then the line  
widths according to the above should preferably be used. These widths are suitable for the usual application of common

Revolving doors replace wind lobbies *----1* **€D - fD** and offer an  
opening without draughts. Because revolving doors can cope  
with relatively little through traffic, the door leaves can be folded at  
peak times and pushed to the side.  
The horizontal section through the stairwell on each floor's plan  
is shown at about % storey height or 1 m above floor level. The  
steps should be continuously numbered upwards and downwards  
starting from ± 0.000. The number of steps below± are preceded  
by a minus sign-. The numbers begin on the first step and exit on  
the landing. The centre-line starts at the first step with a circle and  
ends on arriving with an arrow \(also in the cellar\).

Drawing by Hand  
Designers use drawings and  
diagrams to communicate in-  
formation in a factual, un-  
ambiguous and geometric form  
that can be understood anywhere  
in the world. Unlike painting,  
construction drawing is a means  
to an end, and this differentiates  
diagrams/working drawings and  
illustrations from artistic works.  
A4 sketch pads with 0.5 em  
squared graph paper are ideal  
for freehand sketches to scale.  
For more accurate sketches,  
millimetre graph paper with thick  
centimetre, faint 0.5 em and even  
finer millimetre divisions should  
be used -7 **0.** Different paper is  
used for drawing and sketching  
according to standard modular  
coordinated construction and  
engineering grids -7 **f\).** Use trac-  
ing paper for sketching with a soft  
lead pencil. Suitable sheet sizes  
for drawings can be cut straight  
from a roll, single pages being  
torn off using a T-square -7 **8**  
or cut on its underside -7 **e.**  
Construction drawings are done  
in hard pencil or ink on clear, tear-  
resistant tracing paper, bordered  
with protected edges -7 **e** and  
stored in drawers. Ink drawings  
are made on transparent paper  
and water-resistant paper is used  
for paintings or diagrams. Fix  
the paper on a simple drawing  
board \(designed for standard  
formats\) made of limewood or  
poplar, using drawing pins with  
conical points -7 **E\).** First turn  
over 2 em of the paper's edge  
\(later to be used as a filing edge-  
see p. 4\)\: this lifts the T-square a  
little during drawing and prevents  
the T-square from smudging the  
work. \(For the same reason, draw  
from top to bottom!\) The drawing  
can be fixed with drafting tape  
rather than drawing pins -7 **e**  
\(which means that the drawing  
underlay can be made of plastic-  
Cellon or a similar smooth  
material\). Drafting machines  
are common in engineering  
disciplines -7 **0.** In addition to  
simple parallel rules, there are  
also special versions with built-  
in protractors for setting angles;  
these are ruled with centimetre  
and octametre divisions -7 **0.**  
Other drawing aids feature  
pocket scale sets, parallel scale  
for hatching, division of lengths  
-70.

Computer-Aided Drawing  
# Drawings  
Drawings are always an abstraction of reality because they are  
in two dimensions. The degree of abstraction depends on the  
content and, above all, on the intended purpose of the drawing.  
The lowest degree of abstraction is represented by perspectives,  
collages and renderings, which attempt to come quite close to  
reality. In order to produce the desired impression, it is particularly  
important to leave some free rein for the fantasy of the viewer.  
Diagrams can be used to explain functional interactions. Working  
drawings contain all the required information about dimensions,  
materials and arrangement of the object to be produced. In this  
case, all details must be unambiguous and comprehensible for the  
producer, and therefore have a high degree of abstraction.  
In the age of computer-generated images, it still remains important  
to have a command of the rules and regulations of traditional  
drawing --+ pp. 39-40.  
# Computer-aided drawings  
Drawing with a computer is very different from the classic  
methods of drawing on paper. There are two basic principles\:  
raster graphics, in which every pixel of a drawing is saved \(image  
processing\), and vector graphics, where the start, end and the  
properties of a drawing element are saved \(CAD\). Because  
the output appears on a monitor screen or plot, there are also  
problems representing bodies and rooms in two dimensions.  
Only very simple CAD programs work with two-dimensional  
data models. More common are three-dimensional data models  
\(object-oriented programs\), which produce the desired type of  
illustration on output \(monitor, plotting\). The information required  
for this is stored in a database in the computer. This enables the  
elements of a drawing \(line type, line thickness and colour\) to be  
linked to further information, which is not visible, e.g. which layer  
they belong to, dependence on other objects, material properties,  
manufacturing information, order numbers etc. These properties  
can be exploited for the structuring of content or for further use  
\(e.g. tenders or cost estimation\).  
Volume modules permit further simulations. Structural, acoustic,  
climatic or lighting investigations can make precise statements  
about a building through the use of the appropriate software. 3D  
scanners, CNC machines and 3D plotters also enable the input  
and output of three-dimensional objects.  
# Data exchange  
Because data is normally processed by a number of operators  
\(various specialist technicians and engineers\), a unified,  
understandable and clear system of organisation is important.  
When selecting a CAD system or deciding the working methods,  
it is important to know that all future processors of the data will  
work with the same software, or which interfaces can be used to  
exchange data. Exchange formats usually have a limited range  
of structuring possibilities and therefore organisation categories,  
which are not supported, will be lost or have to be recreated, with  
the associated waste of time. The naming of layers is governed  
by ISO 13567, which, however, uses cryptic abbreviations.  
It seems more practical to use the more flexible and easily  
understood naming system published by the specialist magazine

# ACCESSIBLE BUILDING  
Dimensions for Wheelchair Users  
# General design basics  
Building regulations cover the design, construction and furnishing  
of housing, of accessible public buildings or parts of buildings,  
of workplaces and their external spaces. These buildings must  
be accessible for all people free of barriers. The users must be in  
a position to be almost completely independent of outside help.  
This applies notably to wheelchair users, the blind and visually  
impaired, those with other disabilities, old people, children and  
those of exceptionally short or tall stature.  
# Movement areas  
Are those necessary for moving a wheelchair and are to be  
designed according to the minimum space requirement of a  
wheelchair user. The wheelchair --7 **0 - 8** and the movement  
area for the person --7 **0- m** provide the modules for this. The  
dimensions of the movement area are 0.90-1.80 m and may  
overlap - except in front of lift doors. A depth and width of  
at least 1.50 m should be provided in every room for turning.  
\(More information on movement areas is found on the following

# Accessibility without steps  
All levels of buildings designed in accordance with the principles  
of accessibility must be accessible without steps, i.e. using a lift  
or a ramp.  
# Lifts  
Cars of lifts must have a min. clear width of 1.10 m and a clear  
depth of 1.40 m. The movement area in front of the doors must

The ramp and the intermediate landing are both to be provided  
with 10 em high wheel kerbs and handrails \(diameter 3-4.5 em\)  
at a height of 85 em. The clear ramp width must be min. 1.20 m.  
Wheel kerbs and handrails must project 30 em horizontally into  
the platform area. There must be no stairs down in the extension  
of the ramp.  
**Stairs.** The movement area next to the stairs going up and down  
must be min. 1.50 m wide; the tread of the first step is not to be  
included in the calculation of the movement area \~ **f\).**  
# Doors  
Clear passage width of doors \~0.90 m \~ **0 +f\).** Doors to toilets,  
showers and changing rooms must open outward.  
# Sanitary facilities  
At least one toilet must be provided for wheelchair users in all  
sanitary facilities. The seat height should be 48 em \~ **8.**  
# Corridors and meeting areas  
Corridors and routes longer than 15 m must have a passing place  
for two wheelchair users of at least 1.80 m width and depth.

All rooms belonging to a dwelling and the communal facilities of a  
house must either be without steps, or have a lift ---7 p. 22 **e.** or be  
accessible with a ramp ---7 p. 22 **e.** Door stops and thresholds at  
the bottom of doors should be avoided, but if absolutely necessary  
may not be higher than 2 em.  
Wheelchair parking place  
A wheelchair parking place is to be included in the design for  
each wheelchair user, preferably located in the entrance area, for  
transferring from street to indoor wheelchair. Space requirement  
and movement area ---7 p. 22 **e.**  
Bathroom  
The bathroom is to be provided with a wheelchair-accessible  
shower. The later installation of a bath should be possible near  
the shower. The movement area to the right or left of the we must  
be at least 95 em wide and 70 em deep. From one side of the we  
towards the wall, or furniture, there must be a distance of min.  
30 em ---7 **f\) - e.** No bathroom doors may open inwards.  
Kitchen  
The main items of equipment items like the refrigerator, stove and  
sink, plus the worktop, are to be arranged as close as possible  
to each other. It must be possible for a wheelchair to pass under  
the sink and worktop without limitation. For the sink, this means  
that either a waste fitting behind the plaster or a flat fitting on  
the surface is necessary. Shelf space must be accessible for the  
wheelchair user and no tall units should be included in the design.  
The horizontal reach area is about 60 em, and the vertical activity  
range is 40-140 em. The optimum height of the worktop \(approx.  
75-90 em\) should be discussed with the disabled person and  
fixed at a height to suit the user ---7 **0 + 0.**  
Car parking place  
A weather-protected car parking place or garage is to be provided  
for each dwelling. A movement area of 1.50 m depth should be  
provided next to the long side of the car ---7 G\).

Accessible Housing  
# Housing suitable for wheelchairs  
Wheelchair users must be able to travel into all the rooms of a  
dwelling, and into all rooms available to the residents of a house in  
common, and to use all facilities. The wheelchair user must be in  
a position to be mostly independent of outside help. This applies  
notably to the blind and visually impaired, the deaf and hearing-  
impaired, the physically disabled, old people, children and people  
of exceptionally short or tall stature.  
In order to turn 180°, a wheelchair user requires at least 1.50 m2  
\~ **0 + f\).** This space requirement determines the size of, and  
movement area in, corridors, rooms, garages etc. In residential  
apartment blocks, access through corridors or hallways is the most  
frequent arrangement. In this case, angles and corners are to be  
avoided as far as possible; a straight access corridor is suitable.  
The minimum area of an entrance hall should be 1.50 x 1.50 m, and  
an entrance lobby with a single-leaf door 1.70 x 1.60 m. A window  
with a clear view from a parapet height of 60 em should be provided  
in at least one living room of a dwelling. An entry phone at the flat or  
house door is an important item of equipment for a blind resident.  
# Living area  
Adequate freedom of movement for wheelchair users is important  
in living rooms. There should also be room for at least two further  
wheelchair users as visitors. For a living room with an eating area,  
the minimum floor area should be\: in a flat for one person 22 m2  
,  
for 2-4 people 24 m2  
, for five people 26 m2 and for six people  
28m2  
; minimum room width 3.75 m \(1-2 person household\).  
# Open-air seating area  
Every dwelling should be provided with an open-air seating area  
such as a terrace, loggia or balcony with a min. size 4.5 m2• The  
movement area must be min. 1.50 m wide and 1.50 m deep\~ **0.**  
# Additional living space  
Additional living space should be provided for every wheelchair  
user if required. The floor area of a flat is normally increased by  
about 15 m2 by this requirement.

\(§50 of MBO- Model Building Regulations- applied at state level\)  
\(1\) In buildings with more than two flats, the flats on one floor  
must be accessible. In these flats, the living rooms and bedrooms,  
one toilet, one bathroom and the kitchen or kitchenette must be  
accessible with a wheelchair.  
\(2\) Buildings which are publicly accessible, must in their parts  
serving the general public be capable of being accessed and used,  
according to their purpose, by disabled people, old people and  
people with small children, without outside help. This requirement  
applies notably to cultural, educational, sport, leisure and health  
facilities, offices, administration buildings and courts, sales and  
catering establishments, parking, garages and toilets.  
\(3\) Buildings, according to \(2\), must be accessible through an  
entrance with a clear opening width of at least 0.90 m without  
steps. An adequate movement area must be available in front of  
doors. Ramps may not have a slope of more than 6%, must be at  
least 1.20 m wide and have a fixed handrail with a safe grip on both  
sides. A landing is to be provided at the start and end of the ramp  
and also an intermediate landing every 6 m. The landings must  
have a length of at least 1.50 m. Stairs must have handrails on  
both sides, which are to be continued past landings and window  
openings and past the last steps. The stairs must have solid risers.  
Corridors and entrance halls must be at least 1.50 m wide. One  
toilet must also be suitable and accessible for wheelchair users;  
this is to be indicated by a sign.  
\(4\) Sections 1-3 do not apply if the installations can only be fulfilled  
with unreasonable expense on account of difficult terrain conditions,  
the installation of an otherwise unnecessary lift, unsuitable existing  
buildings or the safety of disabled or old people.

building  
Throughout history human beings have created things to be of  
service to them, using measurements relating to their bodies.  
Until relatively recent times people's limbs were the basis for  
all the units of measurement. Even today we can still have a  
better idea of the size of an object if it is compared to humans or  
their limbs\: it was so many men high, so many ells \(arm lengths\)  
long, so many feet wider or so many heads bigger. These are  
expressions that we are born with\: it could be said that their sizes  
are in our nature. But the introduction of the metre brought all  
that to an end.  
We should therefore attempt to achieve the most precise and vivid  
possible idea of this unit. Building clients do the same when they  
measure out the rooms of their properties in order to envisage  
the dimensions shown on the drawings. Anyone who intends to  
learn how to build should start by visualising the size of rooms  
and objects as clearly as possible, and constantly practise, so  
that every line they draw and every stated dimension of yet to be  
designed furniture, rooms or buildings can appear as an image  
before their eyes.  
We do, however, immediately have an accurate idea of the scale  
of an object when we see a person beside it, whether in the  
flesh or as an illustration. It is a poor reflection on our times  
that our trade and professional journals only too often depict  
rooms or buildings without any people in them. Such pictures  
can often create a false impression of the scale of a building and  
it is often astonishing how different they look in reality - mostly  
much smaller. This contributes to the frequent lack of cohesive  
relationships between buildings, because their designers have  
worked to various arbitrary scales and not to the only proper  
scale, human beings.  
If this is to be changed, then architects and designers  
must be shown where these haphazard dimensions, mostly  
accepted without thought, originated. They must understand the  
relationships of the size of the limbs of a healthy human being and  
how much space a person occupies in various postures and in  
movement. They must also be familiar with the dimensions of the  
appliances, clothing etc. which people encounter every day, in  
order to be able to determine the appropriate sizes for containers  
and furniture. They must know how much space a person needs  
between furniture in the kitchen, dining room, libraries etc. in  
order to undertake the necessary reaching and working among  
these fittings in comfort without squandering space. They must  
know how furniture should be placed so that people can fulfil  
their tasks or relax in the home, office or workshop. And, finally,  
the architect and designer need to know the minimum practical  
dimensions of spaces in which people move around on a daily  
basis, like trains, trams, vehicles etc. These typically very  
restricted minimum spaces give the designer fixed impressions,  
which are then used, even if unintentionally, to derive dimensions  
of other spaces.  
The human being, however, is not just a living creature that needs  
space. The emotional response is no less important. The way a  
room is dimensioned, divided, painted, lit, entered and furnished  
has great significance for the impression it makes. Starting from  
all these considerations and insights, I set out in 1926 to collect,  
in an organised way, the experience gained from a wide variety of  
professional practice and teaching.  
The present data book was developed from this work, starting from  
the human being and providing the framework for assessing the 26  
# DIMENSIONAL BASICS AND RELATIONSHIPS  
Man as Measure and Purpose  
dimensions of buildings and their constituent parts. This involved,  
for the first time, the investigation, development and comparison  
of many fundamental questions.  
Current technical options have been included here to the  
greatest possible extent. Account is taken of common  
standards. Description is often reduced to the absolute  
minimum and supplemented or even replaced with illustrations  
wherever feasible. This should provide the creative architect  
or designer, in methodically ordered, brief and coherent form,  
the necessary information which would otherwise have to be  
laboriously extracted from countless books or researched  
circuitously by surveying existing buildings. Great value has  
been placed on the restriction of the content to a digest of  
the fundamental data and experience, with the inclusion of  
completed buildings only where they seemed necessary as  
general examples.  
By and large, of course, each building commission is different and  
\(apart, of course, from adherence to relevant standards\) should  
be studied, approached and designed anew by the architect.  
Completed projects can much too easily tempt us to imitate, or  
at least establish conventions, which the architect entrusted with  
a similar task can often escape only with difficulty. If, however,  
as is intended here, creative architects are given only the tools,  
then this compels independent thinking so that they weave all the  
components of the current commission into their own imaginative  
and unified construction.  
Finally, the tools presented here have not been collected more  
or less randomly from some journal or other, but systematically  
sought out in the literature as the data required for each building  
task. They have been checked against well-known examples  
of similar buildings and, where necessary, data has also been  
acquired through models and experiments. This was always  
with the intention of saving the practising architect or designer  
the effort of these basic investigations, so that sufficient time and  
leisure can be devoted to the important creative aspects of the  
commission.

Man's dimensional relationships  
The oldest known canon describing the dimensional relationships  
of the human being was discovered in a burial chamber among the  
pyramids near Memphis \(about 3000 BcE\). Certainly, since then,  
scientists and artists have been engaged in trying to decipher  
human proportional relationships. We know about the proportional  
systems of the Egyptian pharaohs, of the time of Ptolemy, of the  
ancient Greeks and Romans, and the Canon of Polykleitos, which  
was long considered the standard, plus the work of the Middle  
Ages and of Alberti, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and, above  
all, DOrer's world-famous advances.  
In all these systems, the human body was measured according to  
lengths of head, face or foot, which were than later sub-divided and  
related to each other so that they were applicable in everyday life.  
Even into our own times, the foot and the ell \(arm's length\) have  
remained common measures. In particular, the details worked out by  
DOrer became a common standard. He started from the height \(h\) of  
a human being and expressed the sub-divisions as fractions\:  
1f2 h = the entire torso from the crotch upwards  
*114* h = leg length from ankle to knee, length from chin to navel  
1fs h = foot length  
1 /s h = head length from hair parting to underside of chin, spacing  
of nipples  
1J1o h = face height and width \(including ears\), hand length to the  
wrist,  
1f12 h = face width at level of underside of nose, leg width \(above  
the ankle\) etc.  
The sub-divisions extend to 1f4o h.  
In the last century, A. Zeising achieved greater clarity than  
anyone on this subject with his investigations of the dimensional  
relationships of man's proportions. He made exact measurements  
and comparisons based on the golden section --\> p. 33.  
Unfortunately, this work did not earn appropriate recognition until  
recently, when E. Moessel, an important researcher in this area,  
endorsed Zeising's work with detailed examinations using his  
methods.  
From i 945, Le Corbusier also used, for all his projects, the sectional  
relationships of the golden ratio, which he called 'Le Modular'. His  
measures were human height = i .829 m; navel height = i .130 m  
etc. --\> p. 33.

Geometrical Relationships  
**f\)** Pythagorean triangle  
**0 Square**  
There have been agreements about the dimensioning of buildings  
since early times. The first specific statements date from the time  
of Pythagoras, who started from the basis that the numerical  
proportions found in acoustics must also be optically harmonic.  
This led to the development of the **Pythagorean rectangle --7 0,**  
which contains all the harmonic interval proportions but not the  
two disharmonic intervals -the second and seventh.  
Spatial measurements can be derived from these number  
relationships. Pythagorean or diophantic equations produce  
number groups **f\)- 0,** which should be used for the width, height  
and length of rooms\:  
a2 + b2 = c2  
a= m \(y2 -x2\)  
b=mx2xxxy  
c=m\(y2+x2 \)  
Where x, **y** are whole numbers, x is less than **y, m** is the  
magnification or reduction factor.  
The geometric shapes named by Plato and Vitruvius are also of  
critical importance\: **circle, triangle --7 e** and **square --7 0,** from  
which **polygonal traverses** can be constructed. Each halving then  
gives further polygonal traverses. Other polygonal traverses \(e.g.  
heptagon --7 **0,** nonagon --7 **Cli\)\)** can be formed only by approximation  
or by superimposition. For example, a 15-sided polygon --7 **0** can be

Geometrical Relationships  
A right-angled isosceles triangle \(two sides of equal length\),  
with a relationship of baseline to height of 2\:1, can be used for  
quadrature \(the process of constructing a square of equal area  
to a given shape\) --+ 0. An isosceles triangle with the base and  
height forming two sides of a square was used successfully by  
the master cathedral builder Knauth to determine the dimensional  
relationships of the cathedral in Strasbourg --+ 0.  
The rr/4 triangle of A. v. Drach --+ 8 is rather more pointed than  
that described above because its height is determined by the  
point of the slewed square. It was used successfully by its inventor  
for details and devices.  
The investigations of L. R. Spitzenpfeil into a number of old  
buildings have discovered octagonal relationships. These are  
based on the so-called diagonal triangle, where the height of  
the triangle is the diagonal of the square constructed over half  
of the base --+ G - C\). The sides of the rectangle formed from  
the diagonal triangle--+ 0 have a ratio of 1\:-./2, so all halving or  
doubling of the rectangle produces the same ratio of 1 \:-./2. This  
was used as the basis for the ISO A series paper formats --+ p. 4.  
Geometrical progressions in this relationship are produced by the  
hierarchies inside an octagon --+ e -e and the hierarchy of the  
square roots of numbers 1-7--+ e.  
The relationship between the square roots of whole numbers is  
shown in --+ C\). The factorisation procedure permits the application  
of square roots for the installation of non-rectangular building  
elements. Building from approximated values for square numbers,  
Mengeringhausen developed the MERO space frame. The  
principle is the so-called 'snail' --+ CD - 0. The imprecision of the  
right angle is compensated by the screw connections of the rods at  
the nodes. A different approximate calculation of the square roots of  
whole numbers *-.Jn* for non-rectangular building elements is offered  
by continued fractions \(--+ p. 33\) according to the formula\:  
G = *-.Jn* = 1 + n -1 --+ 4!\).

# DIMENSIONAL BASICS AND RELATIONSHIPS  
Geometrical Relationships  
The use of geometrical and dimensional relationships based on  
the previous information was described by Vitruvius\: according  
to his investigations, the Roman theatre, for example, is based  
on a triangle rotated four times -7 **0,** and the Greek theatre on  
a square rotated three times -7 **f\).** Both constructions result in a  
dodecagon, which is recognisable on the stairs.  
Moessel claims to have verified dimensional relationships  
according to the golden ratio, although this is unlikely -7 **0.** The  
only Greek theatre based on a pentagon is in Epidaurus -7 **0.** The  
design principle of the **golden** \(holy, divine\) **section** \(ratio, mean\)  
was applied in a Roman residential quarter excavated in Ostia  
Antica, the ancient harbour of Rome -7 **0 - 0.** This principle is  
based on the bisection of the diagonals of a square. If the points  
at which the arcs \(radius ..f2/2\) intersect the sides of the square are  
joined up, this produces a nine-part grid. Its centre is the square  
of the golden section. The arc **AB** is with up to 0.65% deviation  
the same length as the diagonal **CD** of the original halved square.  
The golden section therefore represents an approximate method  
for squaring the circle. The entire complex at Ostia, from layout to  
fitting out details, was based on this ratio.  
**Palladia,** in his four books on architecture, provides a geometrical  
key based on the work of Pythagoras. He used the same spatial  
relationships \(circle, triangle, square etc.\) and harmonies for his  
buildings -7 **0 - \(!j\).**  
Similar laws of proportion are also expressed in clear rules by the  
ancient cultures of the East. The Indians with their 'Manasara',  
the Chinese with their modulation according to the 'Toukou', and  
above all the Japanese with their 'Kiwariho' methods created  
building systems which ensure traditional development and offer  
immense economic advantages -7 \$.

The golden section  
The 'golden section' means that a length I is divided so that the  
ratio of the entire length to the larger part is the same as the ratio  
of the larger part to the smaller part. The golden section of a length  
can be determined either geometrically or by using a formula\:  
For the geometrical construction, the distance I \(to be divided\) is  
drawn as a vertical AB and the horizontal line AC \(= AB/2\) as the  
baseline of a right-angled triangle. The length of the baseline AC  
is transferred using a compass with centre C onto the hypotenuse  
BC of this triangle, thus dividing the hypotenuse into the parts  
BD and DC. The distance BD is the major part M of the vertical  
AB. This distance M is then transferred onto the vertical AB, thus  
dividing AB into a major part \(M\) and a minor part \(m\) \~ 0.  
Therefore\: major  
major minor  
The connection between the golden section and the proportions of  
square, circle and triangle is shown in \~ f\). The golden sectioning  
of the distance can also be determined with the continued fraction  
G=1 +-  
1  
G  
This is the simplest infinite regular continued fraction \~ 8.  
The Modulor  
The architect Le Corbusier developed a theory of proportion  
based on the golden section and the dimensions of the human  
body. He marked out three intervals in the human body, which  
formed what Fibonacci named a golden section series\: between  
the foot, the solar plexus, the head, the fingers of the raised  
hand. Le Corbusier first assumed 1. 75 m to be the average height  
of a European, and divided this, according to the golden section,  
into the dimensions i 08.2 - 66.8- 4 i .45 - 25.4 em \~ e.  
Because this last dimension is almost exactly i 0 in, Le Corbusier  
found a connection with the English inch, but this did not apply to  
the larger dimensions. Consequently he later altered his average  
body height to 6 English feet\(= i .828 m\) and from there developed,  
according to the golden section, the so-called red series upwards  
and downwards \~ e. Because the steps in this series were too  
large for practical use, he then developed an additional blue  
series, starting from 2.26 m \(fingertips of the raised hand\), with  
double the values in the red series \~ e. The values in the red and  
blue series were then implemented by Le Corbusier as practical  
measurements\~ 0.

**Building preferred numbers** are those for modular construction  
dimensions and the individual, structural and finished dimensions  
derived from them.  
**Modular dimensions** are only theoretical dimensions, but are  
the basis for the individual, structural and finished dimensions  
used in practice. Structural dimensions or nominal dimensions \(for  
construction types with joints and wall finishes\) are derived from  
modular dimensions by deducting or adding the component for the  
joint or the finish thickness. \(Example\: modular dimension for the  
length of a brick=25 em; thickness of the vertical joint= 1 em; nominal  
dimension for the length of the brick= 24 em; modular dimension for  
the thickness of poured concrete walls= nominal dimension= 25 em\).  
**Individual dimensions** are dimensions \(mostly small\} for  
units of structure or finishing such as joint thicknesses, plaster  
thicknesses, door rebate sizes, wall projection sizes, tolerances.  
**Structural dimensions** are of the unfinished structure, such as  
masonry dimensions \(without plaster thicknesses\), structural slab  
thicknesses, sizes of unplastered door and window openings.  
**Finished dimensions** are for the finished building, such as clear  
sizes of plastered rooms and openings, storage space dimensions,  
floor-to-floor heights.  
**Nominal dimensions** are the same as modular dimensions for  
building types without joints. For building types with joints,  
the nominal dimension is the modular dimension less the joint  
thicknesses.  
**Small dimensions** are 2.5 em and less. They can be selected from  
the sizes\: 2.5 em; 2 em; 1.6 em; 1.25 em; 1 em; 8 mm; 6.3 mm;

# Preferred numbers  
Preferred numbers have been introduced for the standardised  
sizing of machinery and technical devices. The starting point is  
the continental unit of length the metre \(-'\> 40 in\). The engineering  
requirement for geometrical graduation made the purely decimal  
division of the metre impractical. The geometrical 1 0-part preferred  
number series is therefore\: **1; 2; 4; 8; 16; 31.5; 63; 125; 250; 500;**  
**1000.** These are formed from the **halving series** \(1000, 500, 250,  
125\) and the **doubling series** \(1, 2, 4, 8, 16\); the doubling number  
32 was rounded down to 31.5 towards the exact value of the halving  
number \(31.25\), and the halving number 62.5 was rounded up to 63.  
The larger 5-part and the finer 20- and 40-part series fit in  
accordingly with their intermediate numbers.  
Preferred numbers offer many advantages for calculation\:  
products and quotients of any number of preferred numbers are  
themselves preferred numbers, whole-number percentages of  
preferred numbers are again preferred numbers, and doubled and  
halved preferred numbers also remain preferred numbers.  
Although there is scarcely a need for geometrical graduation in  
building \(considering the predominantly arithmetical addition of  
similar elements like\: blocks, joists, rafters, trusses, columns,  
windows and similar\) the so-called **building preferred numbers**  
have been defined and laid down.  
Brickwork dimensions in the UK differ\: in the past large variations  
in the size of fired clay products often led to critical problems  
with bonding clay bricks. Now, BS 3921 provides one standard  
for dimensioning *-'\>* **0\:** coordinating size \(225 x 112.5 x 75 mm,  
including 1 0 mm in each direction for joints and tolerances\), and the  
relating work size \(215 \[2 headers plus 1 joint\] x 102.5 x 65 mm\).

Dimensions in Building  
Modular coordination in building  
The modular system is a means of coordinating the dimensions  
applicable to building work. The term 'coordination' is the key\:  
a modular building standard contains details of a design and  
detailing system based on coordination as an aid in the design and  
construction of buildings. It gives geometrical and dimensional  
definitions for the spatial coordination of building components.  
It also enables technical areas, which depend on each other  
with regard to geometry and dimensions \(e.g. building, electrical  
engineering, transport\) to be connected.  
Geometrical considerations  
A coordinate system is always object-specific. It is used to  
coordinate building structures and components, and determine  
their position and size. From these are derived nominal dimensions  
of building components, plus joint and connection thicknesses  
\~ **0 - 0.** A coordinate system consists of planes arranged at  
right angles to each other, spaced according to the coordinate  
measurements. Depending on the system, these can be of  
different sizes and in all three dimensions.  
Building components are normally arranged in one dimension  
between two parallel coordinate planes so that they fill the  
coordinate dimension, including the joint component and  
also taking tolerances into account. A building component  
is therefore defined in its extent, i.e. its size and position, in  
one dimension. This is called boundary reference \~ **e.** In  
other cases, it can be advantageous not to position a building  
component between two planes but rather to have its centre-  
line coincide with a coordinate plane. The component is thus  
specified in one dimension, but only in terms of position. This  
is called centre-line reference \~ **e.** A coordinate system can  
be sub-divided into various sub-systems for different groups  
of building elements \(e.g. load-bearing structures, space-  
demarcating components etc.\) \~ \(\).  
It has become apparent that not all individual components have  
to be modular \(e.g. each step in a staircase, windows, doors,  
etc.\), but only the building elements they are combined into \(e.g.  
staircases, fagade or partition elements etc.\) \~ **0.** For non-  
modular building components which continue along or across  
the whole building, a non-modular zone can be introduced,  
which completely divides the coordinate system into two  
sub-systems. The precondition is that the size of the building  
component in the non-modular zone is already known at the  
time when the coordinate system is set out, because the non-  
modular zone can only have completely specified dimensions  
\~ **0.** Further ways of arranging non-modular building  
components are the so-called central position and edge position  
in modular zones \~ **e.**  
The units of the modular system are the basic module M =  
100 mm and the multi-modules 3 M = 300 mm, 6 M = 600 mm  
and 12 M = 1200 mm. There are also standardised non-modular  
supplementary dimensions I = 25 mm, 50 mm and 75 mm for  
fitting elements or overlapping connections \~ **G\).** Combination  
rules can be used to fit building components of various sizes into  
a modular coordinate system.  
Number groups \(e.g. Pythagoras'\) or factorisation \(e.g. continued  
fractions\) can be utilised to fit non-rectangular building  
components into a modular coordinate \~ 6\). The construction  
of polygon traverses \(e.g. triangle, square, pentagon and their  
halves\) can be used to design so-called 'round' building structures

**Building biology** is a collective term for the study of the **holistic**  
**interaction between building and resident ---7 0 - f\).** Its  
aim is to determine any **deleterious effects** for the human  
organism through the consideration of physical, chemical and  
microbiological conditions in interiors and, if appropriate, take  
measures to relieve the causes \(via 'healthy living'\). The themes  
of building biology partially overlap with other disciplines\:  
building ecology, whose main focus is the protection of nature  
and environment in the construction and operation of buildings  
and in the manufacture, processing and final disposal of building  
materials, building physics and electrical engineering as well as  
biology, chemistry and medicine.  
The principles of building biology are especially suitable for  
application in residential building but also in the construction of  
schools, hospitals, kindergartens and offices.  
The fact that the people today spend 90% of their lives inside  
buildings and are surrounded to an increasing degree by  
electromagnetic fields has increased public interest in building  
biology in recent years. Meanwhile, 2-5% of the German  
population now suffer complaints \(e.g. headaches, insomnia,  
tiredness and concentration problems\) due to the presence of  
building biological pollution of their homes and offices.  
The investigation of a building therefore normally includes the  
following areas\:  
- measurement of **electric, magnetic and electromagnetic**  
fields from technical devices in the low- and high-frequency  
ranges  
- testing of **building materials** for toxins, heavy metals and  
radiation  
- testing of **rooms' air quality** for pollutants \(toxins and gases,  
fibres, fine dust and allergens\)  
- microbiological investigations of **bacteria and mould formation,**  
and measurements of **noise, vibration and light ---7 8.**  
Measurements related to **radiaesthesia** \('radiation sensitivity'\) can  
also be carried out, in attempts to demonstrate geopathogenic  
disturbance zones \(e.g. underground watercourses and 'earth  
rays'\) can be discovered using dowsing, pendulums and other  
alternative scientific methods ----\> **e.**  
The term **'building biology'** is not yet officially regulated in  
Germany. This means that anyone can call themselves a building  
biologist independent of their level of education and practical  
experience. It is possible to discern two basic directions in the  
field of building biology. **Scientific-oriented** building biology  
attempts to use scientific methods to create healthy living and  
working conditions. Measurements must be carried out using  
scientifically recognised and reproducible methods, in order that  
harmful effects in buildings can be reliably detected and remedied.  
**Alternative-oriented** building biology assumes that the influences  
affecting people have so far been recognised scientifically only  
to a limited extent. The resulting measurements, and the theories  
and threshold values they are based on are therefore disputed,  
as there are sometimes no reliable methods for measuring such  
threshold values.

Room Climate  
Thermal comfort is experienced when the thermal circulation  
regulated by the body is in balance, i.e. the body can regulate  
warmth with as little effort as possible. This type of comfort is  
experienced when the heat produced by the body corresponds to  
the actual heat loss to the surroundings.  
**Temperature-regulating measures in the body**  
Warming\: flow of blood through the skin, increase of blood  
flow rate, vascular enlargement and muscle shivering. Cooling\:  
sweating.  
# Heat exchange between the body and the surroundings  
Inner heat flow\: heat flow from the inside of the body to the skin  
depending on blood circulation. Outer heat flow\: heat conduction  
through the feet; convection \(air speed, room air and temperature  
difference between clothed and unclothed areas of the body\);  
radiation \(temperature difference between the external area of the  
body and the surroundings\); evaporation, breathing \(body surface,

# climatic conditions and temperature of air and surrounding  
# surfaces  
In summer, 20-24°C is comfortable, in winter about 21°C \(± 1°C\).  
The temperature of the surrounding surfaces should not differ  
from the air temperature by more than 2-3°C. Alterations of the  
air temperature can be compensated for to a certain extent by  
alteration of the temperature of the surrounding surfaces \(sinking  
air temperature- rising surface temperature\). If these temperatures  
are too different, this causes excessive air movement. The critical  
locations are above all the windows. Large heat transfers to the  
floor through the feet should be avoided \(floor temperature should  
be greater than 1 ?"C\). Hot feet and cold feet are experienced by  
the sufferers and are not properties of the floor. The bare foot  
feels heat/cold through the floor covering and its thickness, the  
clothed foot through the floor covering and the temperature of  
the floor. The surface temperature of the ceiling depends on the  
room height. The temperatures perceived by people correspond  
to approximately the average of the temperature of the air and that  
of the surrounding surfaces.  
**Air and air movement.** Air movement is experienced as draughts,  
which in this case result in a local cooling of the body.  
**Air temperature and relative humidity.** Relative humidity of  
40-50% is thermally comfortable. If the humidity is less than 30%,  
dust particles can fly.  
**Fresh air and air exchange\:** The ideal is controlled ventilation  
rather than incidental or permanent ventilation. The C02 content  
of the air must be replaced by oxygen. A C02 content of 0.10% by  
volume should not be exceeded, which requires 2-3 air changes  
per hour in living rooms and bedrooms. The fresh air required by a  
person is about 32.0 m3/h. Air changes in living rooms\: 0.4-0.8 x  
room volume per person/h.

# BUILDING BIOLOGY  
Electromagnetic Fields  
The use of technologies like power supply networks and  
mobile telephones creates various **electrical, magnetic and**  
**electromagnetic fields** in the human environment. These can  
be described through their field strength, given in volt/metre  
\(V/m\), their magnetic flux density, in tesla \(T\), their wavelength,  
measured in metres \(m\) and their frequency, in hertz \(Hz\). This last  
unit describes the number of cycles per second of the change  
of polarity of the electrical current. There is a difference between  
high- and low-frequency fields.  
In contrast to ionising radiation \(e.g. X-rays\), the energy of these  
fields is not sufficient to electrically charge- to ionise- atoms and  
molecules. Nonetheless, these fields, above a certain strength,  
have certain effects on health, and are sometimes described  
as **'electrosmog'.** The nature and extent of the harmfulness of  
electrical, magnetic and electromagnetic stimulation for people  
and environment implied by this term has been the central theme  
of many building biology investigations.  
# Building biology effects  
In everyday life, exposure is mostly from low-frequency electrical  
and magnetic fields **between 1 Hz and 100 kilohertz \(kHz\),**  
which are emitted from the power supply \(50 Hz\) and electrified  
transport systems like railways \(16 2/3 Hz\). In the course of the  
rapid development of mobile telephones, the population is also  
increasingly subjected to high-frequency electromagnetic fields of  
up to **300 gigahertz \(gHz\).**  
If an external **electrical field** acts on a person, then forces  
act on charges in the body and result in **'body currents'.** This  
process is called **influence.** In the case of alternating fields, the  
charge redistribution is constantly repeated at the frequency.  
Above a certain threshold value, which varies from person to  
person, electrical fields are perceived. In addition to direct  
effect, there are also indirect effects of electrical fields, like  
**discharge currents and electrification.** The causes of this are  
charge differences between variously charged objects and the  
affected person. These charge differences reach equilibrium  
as soon as an electrically conducting contact is created by  
touching \('shock'\).  
In contrast to an alternating electrical field, an **alternating**  
**magnetic field** directly causes currents inside the body as a result  
of **induction currents.** The decisive parameter for the evaluation  
of health effects is the density of these body currents, measured  
in milliampere/square metre \(mA/m2\).  
Electrical currents also occur inside the body without external  
fields. Nerves carry their signals by transporting electrical  
impulses, the heart is electrically active \(---\) electrocardiogram\)  
and almost all metabolic processes include the movement  
of charged particles \(ions\). These natural body currents have  
densities in the range of 1-10 mA/m2  
• **A threshold value of**  
**2 mA/m2 has been established for the body current density**  
# caused by fields.  
Low-frequency electrical and magnetic fields are produced  
by household appliances and electrical installations. In this  
case, as with railway traction power and high-voltage cables,  
the electrical and magnetic field strength reduces rapidly with  
distance ---\) **8.** Electrical fields present outdoors are mostly  
shielded by the external walls of buildings, but the shielding  
of magnetic fields is not possible without great expense.

# VISUAL PERCEPTION  
The Eye  
The activities of the eye can be divided into seeing and observing.  
Seeing is primarily for our physical safety, but observation starts  
where seeing stops, leading to the enjoyment of the 'pictures'  
registered through seeing.  
Images perceived by the eye differ according to whether the eye  
remains still on an object or scans around it. The **still image** is  
displayed in what approximates to a segment of a circle, whose  
diameter is the same as the distance of the eye from the object  
--\> **0.** Inside this 'field of view', the objects appear to the eye 'at a  
glance'. The ideal still image appears balanced. Balance is the first  
characteristic of architectural beauty. \(Physiologists are working  
on a theory of the sixth sense, the balance or static sense, which  
is also supposed to explain the beauty we see in symmetrical,  
harmonious objects and proportions --\> pp. 30-33 or in elements  
which are in balance.\)  
Outside this framework, the eye receives its impressions from  
the **scanned image.** The scanning eye progresses along lines of  
resistance, which it discovers going away from us in width or depth.  
If these lines of resistance are found at even or repeating  
distances, the eye perceives this as beat or rhythm, which results  
in a stimulus similar to the ear receiving music \('Architecture,  
frozen music', Neufert --\> refs\).  
This effect also occurs in a closed room, via the still or scanned  
image --\> **0 - f\).** A room whose upper boundary \(the ceiling\) is  
perceived by us in our still image provides a sense of security,  
but on the other hand in long rooms also a depressed feeling.  
If the ceiling is higher and the eye only sees it while scanning  
upwards, then the room is perceived as free, exalted even, always  
supposing that the wall spacing, and thus the overall proportions,  
are in harmony.  
It should not be forgotten here that the eye is subject to optical  
illusions. It estimates the width more accurately than depths or  
heights, which always seem larger. As is well known, a tower  
seen from above seems much higher than from below --\> p. 39 **CE\).**  
Vertical edges appear to overhang upwards and horizontal edges  
appear curved in the middle; see also--\> p. 39 **0- \(D.**  
When considering these matters, one should not fall into the  
opposite way of thinking \(exemplified by the Baroque\) and, for  
example, emphasise the perspective effect via inclined windows  
and cornices \(e.g. St Peter's, Rome\) or even through cornices,  
vaulting or similar painted in perspective.  
The decisive factors for the measurement of dimensions are the  
size of the field of view ...... **0,** or the field of vision ...... **e** and,  
for the exact distinction of details, the size of the field of detailed  
vision \(readability\)--\> **9-6.** The distance of the latter determines  
the size of the details to be distinguished. The Greeks worked to  
precisely these principles and determined the size of the smallest  
bead moulding under the cornice's corona, a different dimension  
in each temple, so that, at an angular distance of 27°, it always  
filled the field of detailed vision of 0°1' ...... **o.**  
From this also arise the reading distances for books \(which vary  
according to the size of the letters\), of audience seats from the  
performance etc. \(Maertens --\> refs; see here the illustrations

# VISUAL PERCEPTION  
Perception of Colour  
Colours have a power over people. They can create feelings of  
well-being, unease, activity or passivity. Paint schemes in factories,  
offices or schools can improve or dull performance, in hospitals  
can improve the health of the patients. The influence of colour on  
people can take place indirectly through physiological effect, for  
example making rooms appear wider or narrower, leading to an  
oppressive or liberating feeling \~ **9** - \(!!\). Colour's influence is  
also exercised directly through impulses produced by each colour  
\~ **f\) - 0.** Orange has the strongest impulse power, followed by  
yellow, red, green and purple. Blue, turquoise and violet \(cold and  
passive colours\) have the lowest power.  
Strongly impulsive colours are suitable only for small areas within  
rooms, but non-impulsive colours can be used across extensive  
stretches. Warm colours have an active effect, stimulating or even  
exciting. Cold colours are passive, calming or spiritual. Green is  
relaxing for the nerves.  
The effect produced by colours also depends on their brightness  
and location. Warm and light shades viewed overhead have a  
mentally stimulating effect; at the side, warming and coming close;  
below, relaxing and lifting. Warm and dark colours overhead exert  
an enclosing and dignified influence; at the side, surrounding;  
below, they offer secure grip and footing.  
Cold and light colours viewed overhead are brightening and,  
relaxing; at the side, they seem to lead away; below, they are  
smooth and encourage walking. Cold and dark colours viewed  
overhead are threatening; at the side, cold and sad; below,  
burdensome and dragging down.  
White is the colour of absolute purity, cleanliness and order. White  
plays a major role in interior design, to separate and neutralise  
other colour groups, then to structure them with light and vitality.  
As the colour of order, white is used to denote areas in warehouses  
and car parks, and for road markings.

# DESIGN  
What is Design?  
**What is design?**  
How does design work and what differentiates 'building' from  
'architecture'?  
Reading the text by Ernst Neufert from the first edition of  
'Architect's Data', opposite, it is still clear that he is talking  
about the essential stages of the design process and describing  
for the reader the human experience of the working method,  
which we can understand via his encouraging but pretention-free  
words.  
Ernst Neufert's views of the influences driving the creative process  
in architecture would certainly be different if he wrote them today.  
In what way and to what purpose, we cannot know, considering  
the developments in architectural theory in the last 20-30 years.  
So the current generation is faced with the question, what should  
be the fundamentals of design, in order to encourage an authentic  
architectural form?  
Design seems to be very easy, and at the same time very difficult,  
with many influences. But it is always about **space** and its  
construction through architectural elements\: if a single space is  
formed by its function, then a number of spaces require overall  
organisation, a **spatial theme.** The architectural elements are  
in accordance with the theme and mould the specific form and  
the authenticity of style in its time. History shows that a building  
commission is only fixed to a certain extent in its spatial style. A  
building type often changes for reasons which do not always have  
to do with function. A building can offer many uses, because it  
more than just a 'glove' for the function - which is demonstrated  
by the long lives of old buildings.  
The essential drivers of change in typological characteristics are  
more often pictorial ideas about the cultural significance of a  
building, which result in alterations to the spatial and architectural  
elements. Buildings with a great influence on architectural history  
mostly have a very precisely emphasised spatial theme, which  
determines the overall layout. Excellent and masterful can have  
two different meanings in this case\: **Reduction in the complexity**  
**of a commission to a single simple concept or a combination**  
# of themes with great variety.  
Design is never academic; works are the result of intuitive  
processes, in which the entire sensual perception of their creator  
plays a role. Nonetheless, they make use of an architectural  
grammar, which is organised thematically rather than stylistically.  
The architectural considerations determining a building  
form a complex system of themes, which arise as knowingly  
staged or work coincidentally to different extents, but at any  
rate are inseparably intertwined. The basic elements of an  
architectural language are to be displayed and implemented  
according to an architectural grammar. The reference planes are  
**typology, topography** and the **architectural elements.** Each  
building relates to a location and a topographical situation.  
These create and offer a topos. It is selected for a function and a  
spatial typology, and architectural elements provide the stylistic  
form. **0** Volumes in the structure

# DESIGN  
Planes of Reference  
# Typology  
The typological structure of  
a building grows out of the  
function and also from the  
construction and town planning  
situation. It is three-dimensional  
and therefore to be understood  
as a spatial theme.  
# Topography  
The theme of topography refers  
to the unique location of the  
building and develops from this  
a town planning or landscape-  
related statement. This statement  
has a major influence on the  
quality of the public space.  
# Architectural elements  
The structural elements com-  
posing a building are always to  
be designed in keeping with the  
overall appearance and follow  
design principles just as much  
as technical requirements and  
utility criteria.  
**Fac,;ades/openings -+ 8 - Cl\)**  
All opening elements form a  
graphical structure on the sur-  
face of the wall. A mixture and  
combination of various struc-  
tural principles can lead to an  
over-loaded fac;\:ade.  
**Plastic elements** *--1* \~  
- **0**  
Functional components like  
balconies and loggias, but also  
columns, form three-dimen-  
sional structures which model  
the wall surface. The formation  
of structuring for the entire wall  
surface should not interfere with  
these.  
**Roof** *--1* \~  
- **CD** The closure of  
the roof makes the building a  
complete sculpture. Town plan-  
ning context and architectural  
concepts are decisive for the  
selection of a type of roof.

The design process is often rushed; projects are tendered and started with insufficient documents. So it has to be understood that the  
'final' drawings and costs are available only when the building is almost complete. Explanations to clients will not help this situation; the  
only answer is faster and better organised work by the architect, with adequate preparation in the office and on the site.  
Every project demands similar information; detailed questionnaires and forms, which should already be to hand when the project is  
commissioned, can help speed up progress. Variations will of course always be necessary but a long list of decisions is so generally  
applicable that questionnaires can assist every building professional, even if only as an encouragement.  
The following questionnaire forms just a part of the work-saving forms which an efficient architect's office should have available, along  
with forms for cost estimates etc.

# Sustainability  
Since the agreement of Agenda21 at the Rio de Janeiro Conference  
for Environment and Development in 1992, sustainability has been  
a central theme of national and international environmental policy.  
Sustainable development has for years been considered the  
best model for mankind to meet the challenges of the future.  
'Sustainable development describes development in accord  
with the needs of the current generation without endangering  
opportunities for future generations to satisfy their own needs  
and choose their own lifestyle .. .' \(Brundtland Report, 1987\). The  
Federal Ministry of the Environment introduced management rules  
for sustainable development in 1998 - Regeneration\: renewable  
natural resources may only be exploited in the long term within  
their capability of regeneration; Substitution\: non-renewable  
resources may only be used to the extent that their use cannot  
be replaced by other materials or energy sources; Adaptability\:  
the release of substances or energy may not be greater than the  
adaptability of ecological systems.  
# Sustainable building  
Building and the built environment can play a key role in our  
future development. The construction and operation of buildings  
is a basic strain on the environment which should be reduced as  
far as possible. The construction and use of buildings consume  
a considerable share of natural resources, energy and water but  
construction according to sustainable principles works within an  
economic, ecological and social context.  
Sustainable building consists of a multitude of concepts and  
measures, which have to be appropriate to the particular project.  
The social and cultural effects of the project \(function, design  
and aesthetics, listed status etc.\) are to be considered with equal  
weighting.  
Buildings are normally operated over a long time period, i.e.  
savings or extra costs can be effective in the long term. The  
intention is a minimisation of the use of resources and energy and  
the least possible impairment of the natural ecological system  
for all phases of the life cycle of a building \(design, construction,  
use, refurbishment, demolition\). Instruments have been developed  
with which the various materials, construction methods etc.  
can be compared with each other and balanced according to  
differentiated criteria.  
# Sustainable architecture  
The quality of architecture, design and the planning of buildings  
play a decisive role in the sustainability of a building. The cost of  
constructing a building is always to be related to the \(forecast\)  
duration of its use, and a longer service life often justifies more  
expensive design and construction.  
The average service life of a building is 50-100 years \(2-3  
generations\), although many buildings which are still in use today  
are much older. The cycles of renewal and modernisation are  
therefore much longer term than for the building services. As a  
result, a typologically flexibly usable structure is worth much more  
for sustainability than ever could be the case with the building  
services installation. The attention of the architect should therefore  
concentrate on the design of the building as a composition of  
structure and design. Heating **Domestic hot water**  
-optimum design of control and **regulation -consideration of incoming solar** radiation through fayade-related zoning of the heating system in the control **process. -different regulation circuits for parts of** the building with different requirements **-extended regulation concepts for** flexible room layouts **-setting of the temperature per room and**

# SUSTAINABLE BUILDING  
Operation, Demolition  
Many factors are decisive for the sustainability of architecture\:  
relationship of the design to the location and the building  
purpose  
contemporary and original appearance of the design  
easily usable and effective structures  
durability of construction and materials  
suitability and ageing characteristics of the materials used  
flexibility for changes of use  
possibility of conversion if required  
The intensive use of raw materials and energy in the erection of  
buildings is normally connected with a long period of usefulness.  
This phase of the life cycle of a building is therefore very significant.  
A significant part of the use of energy and raw materials takes  
place during the use of the building through the operation of  
technical devices and installations. New buildings should always  
be designed in accordance with the current state of technology  
and existing buildings should be regularly checked to investigate  
whether any updating \(thermal insulation, building services etc.\) is  
possible or necessary in order to ensure energy-saving operation.  
In addition to the durability and long life of the services installation,  
mechanisms and methods of saving resources should be the  
highest priority. Ideally, cycles should be set up to enable the  
reuse of water and energy.  
The aims are\:  
health and thermal comfort in the use phase  
minimisation of the energy, operating and maintenance  
costs, reduction of cleaning costs \(partially self-cleaning\:  
e.g. fagades, roofs etc.\)  
minimisation of the servicing and maintenance cost

FACILITY MANAGEMENT  
Background  
Client - responsibility and duties  
The client, or commissioner, as the actual decision-maker about  
its characteristics, bears an essential part of the responsibility for  
the quality and sustain ability of a planned building.  
The architect has a central role as the consulting expert, who  
directs and coordinates all the specialists involved in the design  
and construction process in a single-minded intention to meet the  
formulated project aims. In relation to the client, the architect has  
a role which combines typical expert duties, like exercising their  
power of persuasion regarding innovative design and construction  
solutions, with the disciplines of a modern service provider, for  
example transparency and ensuring the reliability of completion  
dates and cost estimate.  
Considering the oversupply of property since the start of the 21st  
century and the resulting aggressive competition for building  
purchasers and tenants, it seems advisable to look in detail into  
the economic requirements of the typical client.  
Clients may be owner-occupiers or investors\:  
The owner-occupier or owner-operator is mainly concerned  
with a reasonable relationship between function and an  
appropriate image for their company, on the one hand, and  
cost, on the other.  
The investor is, in contrast, interested in letting or selling with  
the greatest possible success under current market conditions.  
These demand different development, design and construction  
processes, which, especially in the US and UK, have achieved a  
high degree of professionalism and success that has motivated  
investment.  
Complex requirements for buildings  
The expression 'added value' comes from the field of production and  
has increasingly been adopted in the property management field.  
It includes a complex combination of quantitative and qualitative  
parameters\:  
actually achievable rents, disregarding tax or political effects  
complete and comprehensible costs over the entire life cycle of  
the building  
practical conversion possibilities laid out in use scenarios  
planned long term, with all relevant consequences, particularly  
disturbance-free operation.  
Life-cycle assessment  
The modern approach in architectural design is typified by the  
holistic consideration of all phases of the lifetime of a building,  
called the life-cycle or whole life assessment \~ f\). This means  
that all relevant functional, aesthetic, cost, scheduling and  
organisational features are systematically categorised for each  
phase. Of particular importance is the transfer of experience  
gained during the operation phase to the start of the life cycle  
of later projects. The result is to transform the planned building  
into an asset supported by comprehensive responsibility, which  
can normally continue to be used and maintained after its original  
purpose has expired.  
Project development and programme production  
The initial work phase, in which the room and function programmes  
are developed for an owner-operator, is of course of great  
significance in the architectural life cycle. When the client is an  
investor, typical tenant scenarios will be developed \~ 0. Careful  
programming of rooms and functions can result in a considerable  
increase in the value of a building project\:  
functional improvement of typical working and communication  
processes \(the primary or core processes\) in the building  
reduction of the space consumed to fulfil functions through  
appropriate compression of use

FACILITY MANAGEMENT  
Methods  
A new professional discipline  
A facility manager is the description for the professional manager  
of an entire building operation. They undertake all the tasks of  
the client which can be delegated to specialists. This profession  
arrived from the USA at the end of the 20th century and has  
developed very positively in recent years, against the trend for most  
property-related professions. Its origins were in the planning of the  
occupation of space \(property management\). Facility management  
\(FM\) developed from related professions like those of architects,  
building services engineers or infrastructure service providers.  
The consistent implementation of FM can save up to 30% in  
comparison with traditional forms of building management for the  
same user requirements. Because the operating costs amount to  
about 80% of the total costs for the entire life-cycle, FM is qutckly  
becoming established as the key profession for the sustainable  
implementation of architecture *---7* **0.** A range of national and  
international facility management associations, such as GEFMA,  
IFMA and BIFM, produce guidelines for facility managers.  
The main principle of FM is the combination and optimisation of  
the many services concerned with a building and its users, which  
normally already exist but are scattered in their organisation. The  
architect provides the essential roots for successful FM, is thus  
the most important partner of a facility manager and also has the  
best qualifications to take over the tasks of this discipline.  
Structural and service aspects  
FM is based on a four-column model *---7* **f\).** These columns list the  
technical fields involved, ordered according to their qualification  
background. These are very heterogeneous, which means that the  
facility manager has to be a generalist, who typically comes from  
one specialisation and controls the others. Utilising the wide range  
of thinking skills included in FM, the facility manager has to be  
able to provide the users and owners of property with an all-round  
consulting interface, covering complex specialist issues in an  
understandable fashion and managing decisions under pressure.  
A further special feature of the job description is, similar to the  
architect, the varied extent of functions, from strategic and  
intellectual to operative and practical, and thus the requirement to  
be qualified to work with very diverse partners. This places above-  
average moderating, management and personal capabilities at the  
top of the requirement list. Ethical and philosophical qualities like  
authenticity and integrity are also important qualifications for the  
sustainable control of complex buildings.  
Management methods  
The working methods relevant in FM do not normally come from  
the building industry, but from technical sectors such as the car  
industry and aviation. Only the building databases that form the  
foundation of all planning and operational processes and the as-  
built building drawings, which can be activated to illustrate various  
aspects \(CAFM = computer-assisted facility management\) are  
closely derived from modern architectural, drawing, tendering and  
room schedule tools *---7* **f\).**  
For the purposes of facility management planning and decision-  
making, various management methods from the industries named  
above are used\:  
examination of alternatives and scenarios with total-cost  
assessment  
complex quality and risk management  
psychology-based moderation/mediation  
'information design', the graphically descriptive illustration of  
abstract, multi-faceted and complex information.

REFURBISHMENT  
Conservation and Alteration  
Once buildings have been built, they continue to require care  
and maintenance. Building and finishing elements have differing  
lifetime expectations according to their function, use and  
maintenance. The scale of operations from maintenance, repair,  
replacement or conversion is blurred """' 0.  
Projects involving work on existing buildings should be split into  
measures under the categories listed below. In addition to advice  
about the need for approvals, this enables the client to clearly  
divide the required investment into items which can be grant-aided  
and those which can be forwarded to tenants. It also enables the  
architect to correctly assign fee supplements """' f\).  
Many of the measures for which the term renovation is used  
stem from construction law but are relevant only in the context  
of municipal building. As the term is not differentiated regarding  
building costs and contracts, it should not be applied.  
The following measures are differentiated in HOAI, which governs  
the fees of German architects\:  
Maintenance\:  
- measures for the preservation of the required condition of a  
building.  
Repair\:  
measures to recreate the required condition of a building for  
its intended use, but not including rebuilding or modernisation.  
The definition in the standard is the "preservation or recreation  
of the functional condition".  
Modernisation\:  
building measures which lead to the sustainable improvement  
of the serviceability of a building without altering the function,  
such as the improvement of lighting, sound insulation, access  
\(lifts, disability access\) and the energy exploitation.  
Rebuilding\:  
rebuilding works are changes of the design of an existing  
property with considerable intervention in construction or  
existing structure.  
Extensions\:  
- additions to an existing building, extending it upwards or  
sideways.  
Recreation\:  
new construction of destroyed buildings on existing building or  
site elements. This counts as a new building if a new design is  
required.  
Conversion\:  
describes changes to the type of use of a building. Because  
this normally leads to different requirements under building  
regulations, conversion works require building permission  
like a new building! Conversion includes a change of trade  
\(e.g. from a shop to a restaurant\) and also the fitting out of an  
existing unoccupied attic for residential purposes.  
Project preparation  
It should be noted for all work on existing buildings that the  
HOAI is primarily intended for new building and rebuilding, where  
the requirements are clear in advance. The framework for the  
determination offees according to the HOAI is not adequate for the  
production of a resilient design with varied uses and their effects  
on cost and listed building protection. The appropriate preliminary  
investigations \(measurement and the surveying of defects\), and  
the ensuing use concepts and variants with cost breakdown,  
should therefore always be agreed as 'special services' or, better,  
as the production of an expert report before starting design work,  
in order to give the client 'design security' before the start of the  
project. The absence of such design foundations is one of the  
main reasons for exploding costs in refurbishment work. **Artistic significance**

# REFURBISHMENT  
Care of Historic Monuments  
The care of historic monuments encompasses all measures to  
preserve such cultural assets in their original substance. The  
purpose is the preservation, for the benefit of present and future  
generations, of historic structure that is considered valuable, in  
order to preserve cultural memory, which can bestow identity and  
also sustainability in the form of a cultural resource. An important  
principle was formulated in the Venice Charter of 1964\. Listed  
historic buildings can normally be preserved only in connection  
with a practical use. This makes it necessary to find a compromise  
between conservation and alteration.  
**Statutory protection of historic monuments**  
The purposes of the statutory protection of historic monuments  
include their recognition, recording \(drawing up inventories\),  
preservation and publicising. Scientific background research,  
the preservation and furthering of traditional craft skills, expert  
consulting for clients and contractors, and public relations work in  
the form of publications, exhibitions and conferences are further  
tasks of authorities responsible for the care of historic monuments.  
All historic buildings and monuments which are placed under  
protection are entered in the official lists. An individual justification  
for the listed status must be produced for every building. The  
evaluation criteria are based on the cultural, historical, town  
planning, scientific, technical or ethnological significance of a  
historic building ---\> **0.** According to locally applicable law, lists of  
historic monuments can be constitutive or declarative *---t* p. 52 **8**  
The determination as to which aspects of the value as a monument  
are most important leads to the contrasting approaches of the  
preservation of the current state or the recreation of the original  
state of a historic monument. *---t* **0**  
The **restoration approach** has the aim of the recreation of a certain  
historical condition of the building \(e.g. the Bauhausmeisterhii.user  
in Dessau\). This can, however, remove the traces of history. When  
building elements are reconstructed, there is a danger that, if the  
documentation is insufficient, the original is falsely interpreted. The  
preservation of the current state **\(conservation approach\)** leaves  
the course of history visible, but takes into account that this may  
obscure the original appearance \(e.g. the Rathaus, Esslingen\).  
Both approaches have their justification but tend to be put forward  
dogmatically. They should, however, always be discussed and  
decided for each individual case, because they have important  
consequences for the treatment of the historic building. It can be  
argued that the conservation approach will permit modern additions  
and rebuilding as the continuation of historical development, but  
this produces the dilemma that any work involves the destruction  
of historic building structure.  
# Historic monuments in the ground  
Archaeological monuments serve to protect the signs of human  
history in the ground \(archaeological sites\). In contrast to historic  
buildings, not only known but also unknown sites are placed  
under protection. They should if possible remain in the ground as  
an 'archive', because any investigation or excavation would mean  
their destruction and they would be denied improved methods  
of investigation in the future. If preservation is not possible, then  
the responsible party has to pay for recovery and documentation  
\(archaeological excavation\). This duty also covers remains  
discovered in the course of building work.

8 Legal consequences of the types of statutory lists of historic buildings  
# 52  
REFURBISHMENT  
Listed Building Protection  
The listing of buildings is the legal basis for the state to influence the  
treatment of historic structures. In Germany, the listing of buildings  
is part of the cultural sovereignty of the states and is regulated  
by state Jaws for the protection of historic buildings. These Jaws  
have equal status alongside the other Jaws governing building. If  
a conflict arises, then each individual case is balanced against  
the other\(s\). Conflicts often derive from fire safety requirements  
and between the free market exploitation of property and the duty  
of the owner to preserve a building. Because legally all interests  
have equal weight, the state requires decisions in accordance  
with the aims of historic building preservation through information,  
advice and financial support \(grants, depreciation schemes and  
tax reductions\).  
Types of listed building protection  
For a single building, the material condition and the direct  
surroundings are protected. Any alterations to the structure,  
appearance or use require approval. Because the surroundings  
are also protected, alterations to neighbouring buildings which  
impair the impression of the historic building can also require an  
approval.  
The protection of historic buildings in Germany does not  
differentiate value or categories. There is only an indirect grading  
of the character of protection through the protection applied to the  
surroundings of historic buildings and the intention of preserving  
entire areas or parts of a town in their particular character. The  
protection of buildings in this case applies only to the external  
appearance. Conservation areas, the protection of ensembles  
or local preservation orders are decided by towns and councils  
as by-laws. The procedure can be very different according to  
the origin, whether from historic building protection or planning  
laws. When work is to be undertaken in such areas, this should be  
discussed and a permit may have to be obtained before starting  
any alteration to the external appearance of a building or also to  
the landscape, even if the intended work itself does not require a  
building permit. *-1* f\)  
Because of the scope of discretion and the different attitudes of  
the various authorities, discussions should be opened with the  
people responsible as soon as possible before undertaking work  
to listed buildings, in order to work out a reasonable and tolerable  
solution.  
Protection of existing use  
The principle of existing use is intended to prevent new  
regulations or Jaws making existing uses impermissible. This  
applies to buildings, or their use, which would not obtain  
approval under current regulations, but formerly would have  
been approved or suitable for approval. Buildings which were  
never in need of approval are not protected under this principle!  
The age of a building in this case is immaterial. Buildings with  
protected existing use may be maintained and also modernised,  
but the work must preserve their identity. In the case of a change  
of use, replacement of building structure or other alterations in  
need of approval, this protection no longer applies, in which  
case the building must be adapted to modern standards. If  
this is not done, the authorities can order its demolition. It is  
important to open discussions at the earliest feasible stage with  
the responsible authority for historic buildings or the building  
controller in order to clarify whether and to what extent the  
protection of existing use applies. Exemptions can be applied for  
as part of the approval process under listed building legislation,  
but in order to provide certainty for design work this should be  
applied for and agreed in advance. External sources

REFURBISHMENT  
Recording of Old Buildings  
Surveying an existing building  
With the implementation of rebuilding works, documentation  
of the existing building in the form of drawings and text is an  
important base for planning. The surveying and investigation of  
an existing building should ideally be undertaken before decisions  
are made about construction measures and future use, because  
only substantiated knowledge about the building structure and  
potential costs can lead to a sensible solution.  
Drawings of the existing building and a room schedule should  
be produced by the architect on site even if old drawings  
are available, because this enables an understanding of the  
defects and the condition of the building at an early stage. The  
investigations should be carried out with as little damage as  
possible, but if intrusions into the structure are required, they  
should be agreed with the client and the historic buildings  
authority and be performed by experts \(restorers, building  
research consultants\).  
Drawings of the existing building  
The depiction and the precision of the drawings showing the  
existing building and its condition depend on the aims of the  
intended work. \~ 0 There is a difference between the precision  
of measurement and the precision of the drawings. The precision  
of measurement does not depend only on the measuring  
instruments used but on the system of measurement and any  
resulting imprecision \(out-of-parallel, adding errors\). In precision  
stages I and II \~ 0, the measured dimensions are normally more  
precise than can be shown on the drawing.  
The drawings produced in this way serve as the basis for defect  
mapping, plans of building age and documentation of finds  
and are then processed further for design, listing of works and  
construction drawings.  
Text description of the existing building  
A general building description should contain all the significant  
information about the building. This includes details abollt the  
plot, property relationships, planning conditions, building use,  
data for financing, tenants and rent income, age of the building,  
historical building phases, historical design elements, building  
materials, standards of equipment, building services, structure,  
constructional properties and other features.  
A room schedule should record each room in text and graphics  
\(sketches, drawings and photos\), describing necessary measures  
and work that has already been carried out. The rooms should  
be numbered on each floor, starting from the entrance hall and  
proceeding clockwise. The floor number should be legible from  
the key \(e.g. G05 for a room on the ground floor or 1.08 for a room  
on the first floor\).  
Building research  
Information about each phase of building development, the  
methods used and later interference with the structure are not  
only useful for the evaluation of historic quality \~ p. 51 0, but  
also for sound preliminary design and cost estimation. Some  
investigations can be undertaken by the architect, e.g. research in  
the appropriate archives \(building authority, town archive etc.\), but  
other tasks will require the appointment of specialists \(restorers,  
conservators, scientific investigations of building materials, colour  
research, dendrochronology, C14 method, analyses of paint,  
plaster and mortar\). The results can not only give pointers to the  
age and possible problems arising from earlier rebuilding, but  
also enable the selection of compatible building materials and  
enable a precise description of items in the bill of quantities and  
specification. \~ 0

The preservation of historically  
valuable building structure is  
only one aspect of work with old  
buildings. The conversion and  
further use of existing buildings  
is also a contribution to sustain-  
ability. A large proportion of the  
office and industrial buildings of  
the last hundred years no longer  
meet current requirements. The  
most important foundation for  
the decision as to whether these  
buildings, mostly constructed  
in reinforced concrete, are suit-  
able for use is the analysis and  
checking of the structural sys-  
tem. This should ideally be un-  
dertaken by an experienced  
engineer before the design work  
starts, because it is an important  
factor in determining whether  
the building structure is appro-  
priate for further use.  
Building archives and knowl-  
edge of historic building regu-  
lations are helpful in addition to  
investigation on site, because  
non-destructive testing of con-  
crete construction is hardly  
possible.  
Together with the structural  
requirements, building phys-  
ics stipulations also have to be  
complied with. Updating work  
is made necessary by the in-  
creased concrete covering re-  
quired for fire protection and  
the more stringent regulations  
about thermal insulation \(EnEV\).  
The necessary cost of this can  
be more easily estimated.

Conversions count as new  
building and require building  
permission. The floor slabs  
cannot normally comply with  
the requirements for sound,  
thermal and fire insulation and  
thus have to be upgraded.  
Impact sound insulation, fire  
protection construction and  
the structural strengthening  
required for additional loading  
reduce the clear ceiling  
height considerably. In an  
example of the conversion  
of an office building to high-  
quality apartments, the slabs  
were designed as continuous  
beams over the internal walls.  
The only solution in this case  
was the complete exchange of  
the internal slabs. The use of  
thermally separated bearings  
enables internal thermal  
insulation without cold bridges  
and does not impair the  
external elevation -7 **0 - 0.**  
Conversions require com-  
promise. For a listed factory  
hall with a large building depth  
and a 5 m ceiling height,  
the insertion of an internal  
courtyard and reduction of the  
height of the less important  
rooms of the maisonettes was  
approved -7 **e.**

# DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT  
Public Planning and Building Law  
# Building law code  
This federal law contains the most important regulations about  
**public building law** and **planning law.** It provides local councils  
in particular with the instruments and procedure for controlling  
land use in their areas by applying their statutory planning  
authority. The most important instrument is **town planning.** It  
regulates the permissibility of new building in unzoned urban  
areas and outside built-up areas and the organisation of land use  
\(reallocation\). The 'special town planning law' includes mainly  
provisions concerning refurbishment and development projects  
and town remodelling.  
# Land use regulation  
This controls the land use to be laid down in **zoning plans.** It  
is divided into the sections **nature** of building use \(e.g. general  
residential area, industrial area\), **measures** of building use \(e.g.  
floor area ratio, plot coverage ratio, full storeys -\> p. 63\), **type**  
of building \(e.g. open, closed\) and **buildable plot area** \(e.g.  
boundaries, building lines\).  
# Planning drawings regulation  
This Jays down the uniform illustration of decisions on zoning  
plans.  
# Regional planning law  
This federal law contains provisions about the basics and  
problems of regional planning and the regional planning  
responsibilities of the federal states. The basics of the law are put  
into practice through the state development plans, development  
programmes and regional plans. Aims laid down at this level have  
to be complied with at all lower levels. The Jaw prescribes regional  
planning procedures.  
# State building regulations  
This legislation, passed by the states, controls building regulations.  
These cover requirements for building and properties, and serve  
to reduce risk. They include, for example, provisions about  
setback areas, fire protection, rescue routes and building approval  
procedures.  
# Land-use planning  
The building law code differentiates between preparatory land-use  
planning **\(land use plan\)** and binding zoning plans **\(development**  
**plan** and **project development plan\).** All zoning plans are  
produced under a fixed procedure, including the participation  
of the public, and public agencies and authorities. With the  
**land use plan,** the intended land use is displayed for an entire  
council area. The plan is binding on authorities, which means  
that it has to be complied with at lower levels. The **development**  
**plan** is then produced from the land use plan and regulates as an  
ordinance the control of building for an entire council area, with  
a catalogue of possible provisions. The **project development**  
**plan** is a special form for a defined project. The promoter of the  
project undertakes in an implementation contract to complete the  
building commission within a certain time frame and, partially or  
completely, to bear the design and development costs. DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT

f\) Comparison of BGB works contract law and the corresponding provisions in  
the VOB \(according to\: Boisseree, Mantscheff, Baubetriebslehre 1, p. 53 --\> refs\)  
Legal relationships  
The legal relationships between parties involved in a building  
project are normally classified as works contracts under the  
German civil code \(BGB\), or as building contracts under the  
contract award procedure and contract regulations for building  
works \(VOB\) \~ 0.  
The essence of a building contract is to produce a contractually  
determined result, in this case the construction of a building.  
In contrast to this, the subject of a service contract \(BGB\) is  
the work as such or working.  
HOAI  
HOAI \(Fee Regulations for Architects and Engineers - Germany\)  
controls the invoicing of fees for the services of architects and  
engineers. The fee is based on the fee zone to which a building  
project has been assigned, the chargeable costs \(according to  
the fee table\) and the work phases undertaken by the architect  
or engineer, to each of which a percentage of the total fee is  
assigned \(services performed in each phase\~ f\)\). In each of the  
work phases, there is a differentiation between basic services,  
which are always performed as part of the proper performance  
of the service, and special services, which are separately  
ordered and invoiced to fulfil particular requirements \(e.g. building  
remeasurement\) \~ p. 58 ff.  
HOAI is undergoing revision at the moment. Its scope of  
application is to be restricted to smaller projects through the  
lowering of the final values in the fee table, and the removal  
of work phases 6-9 and the consulting services. Furthermore,  
the fees should in the future be determined on the basis of  
building costs agreed in advance.  
VOB  
The VOB \(contract award procedure and contract regulations for  
building works\) is neither law nor legal regulation but represents  
freely agreed contract rights, which amend or add to the  
provisions of the BGB, from whose provisions it varies in essential  
areas \(practical completion, defect claims, payment\)\~ e. Federal  
authorities and many public clients are obliged to apply the VOB  
in the tendering and contract award procedure of building works.  
The VOB is laid out as follows\:  
Part A contains guidelines for the layout and composition of tender  
documents, contract award procedures and building contracts.  
Part B contains the general conditions of contract for the  
construction of building works, as laid out \~ e.  
Part C contains, categorised according to trades, general  
technical contract conditions, according to the following uniform  
system\:  
0. Notes for the production of bills of quantities and  
specifications  
\(an aid for clear and exhaustive tendering\)  
1\. Scope of application \(terms, definition of trades,  
differentiation from other trades\)  
2. Materials *I* building elements \(definition of the quality  
conditions for the materials and building elements to be used  
according to DIN standards  
3. Construction \(definition of the standards for construction with  
reference to current DIN standards\)  
4. Ancillary work *I* extra work \(differentiation of ancillary work  
\(without extra payment\) and extra work\)  
5. Invoicing \(invoicing regulations, units, remeasurement,  
deductions etc.\)

Building permission \(MBO\)  
The construction, alteration or change of use of buildings always  
requires approval from the building supervision authorities.  
There are, however, exemptions for certain buildings. These are  
essentially\:  
Approval-free building projects \(e.g. single-storey building  
with a gross floor area up to 1 0 m2 and garages up to 30 m2  
with average wall heights of up to 3 m \(except outside built-up  
areas \~ p. 55\); retaining walls and fencing up to 2 m high,  
the alteration of load-bearing and bracing building elements in  
buildings of classes 1 and 2; cladding of external walls \(except  
to high-rise buildings\); pergolas, entrance porches and facilities  
which require approval under other regulations, such as power  
stations and traffic-related buildings, in which case the authority  
responsible for the appropriate legal regulations undertakes the  
role of building control.  
In connection with a building notification procedure, approval is  
also not required for the construction and alteration of buildings  
of low height which fully correspond to the decisions of a legally  
binding building development plan, whose utility supply and  
access is ensured. This applies unless the council demands an  
application under the simplified building permission procedure  
within a certain deadline or applies for an interim prohibition.  
The simplified building approval process is applicable for the  
construction and alteration of buildings of classes 1-3 within the  
scope of validity of a legally binding building development plan,  
if the proposed building corresponds to the decisions in the  
building development plan to the full extent and the utility supply  
and access are ensured. In this case, the building control authority  
only checks the compliance with the regulations of the German  
building law code concerning general permissibility.  
Outline building permission  
In advance of the building approval application, a preliminary  
decision can be obtained from the building control authority about  
individual \(critical\) questions concerning the building approval  
appiication by making a preliminary enquiry, in order to simplify  
further processing of the building approval application. Outline  
building permission is legally binding and valid for one year; the  
period can be prolonged on application.

Basic services\:  
1. Production of the application documents required for  
permission or approval in accordance with official regulations,  
including any application for exceptions and exemptions,  
making use of the contributions of other specialists involved in  
the design and including any negotiations necessary with the  
authorities.  
2. Handing in these documents.  
3. Completion and adaptation of design documents, descriptions  
and calculations making use of the contributions of other  
specialists involved in the design.  
4. \(For external works and extensions forming rooms\) checking  
whether permits are necessary, obtaining of permissions and  
approvals.  
*Special services\:*  
• *Collaboration in the obtaining of approval from neighbours,*  
*production of documents for special testing procedures, expert*  
*and organisational support of the client in protest procedures,*  
*legal actions etc.*  
• *Alteration of the application documents resulting from*  
*circumstances for which the appointed party* is *not responsible.*  
Building permit application and application documents  
The building approval application contains the following details\:  
1. Name and address of the client  
2. Name and address of the architect  
3. Description of the proposed building measure  
4. Description of the plot \(street, house number, plot number etc.\)  
5. Utility supply and access  
6. Details of already granted permits  
7. All documents required for evaluation  
\(layout plan, building drawings, building description, verification of  
structural safety and other technical verifications\)  
All appended documents must be signed by the client, the  
architect and other specialist parties.  
The building approval application is to be handed in to the  
responsible council in writing, which will then forward it with  
their comments to the responsible building control authority.  
This authority will request comments from all further responsible  
authorities \(fire service, care of historic buildings, etc.\) and the  
owners of neighbouring properties.  
Building permit issue  
After the completion of checking, the applicant receives the written  
building permit together with copies of the approved documents  
\(possibly with conditions\).  
A partial building permit can be issued for single building elements  
or stages \(e.g. excavation\) before the issue of the final building  
permit.  
The building permit and partial building permit lapse if building  
work is not started within one year of their issue or the works are  
interrupted for more than one year. This period can be prolonged  
on application.  
Building supervision by the authorities  
The MBO provides for supervision during the building phase.  
This can be limited to spot checks and essentially consists of  
the acceptance of the structure \(testing of the construction for  
structural safety, sound and thermal insulation, fire safety\) and  
final acceptance. After the final acceptance certificate has been  
issued, the building can be used.

Tender and contract  
The contract award procedure aims to create a contract structure  
which will guarantee that the plans of a project are carried out  
within the framework of civil law with its accompanying regulations  
\(---7 p. 57\). The contract can be awarded when tenders have been  
received for defined tender documents \(specifications, contract  
conditions and letter stating the possibilities of seeing the tender  
documents, location and date of the opening deadline, additional  
costs deadline, binding deadline etc.\).  
The priced tender documents and signature of the bidder or their  
authorised representative constitute an offer, and if these are  
accepted and the contract awarded, they become, unaltered, the  
building contract ---7 0.  
Building contracts \(and thus also tender documents\) should  
comprehensively and completely remove any differences of  
opinion between the contract parties in advance and clearly  
regulate the duties on each side.  
The specification of the works is therefore the basis for the  
later building contract. This consists either of bill of quantities or  
performance specification and building specification\:  
Bills of quantities ---7 f\) are listings of the individual items  
\(description of a part of the works according to type, quality,  
quantity, dimensions with an item number\) and can be structured  
by batch \(building stage, building phase/production phase\) or title  
\(trade-related\).  
Performance specifications are functional descriptions of the  
essential design, technical and economic requirements of the  
completed work. In contrast to bills of quantities, they do not have  
a detailed listing of individual items.  
The bills of quantities are normally supplemented by preliminaries  
in the form of general and general technical contract  
conditions \(= VOB/B or VOB/C\), additional and additional  
technical contract conditions from clients who regularly  
award building works \(e.g. German Railways, State of Berlin\)  
and special contract conditions, which regulate conditions for  
special cases.  
Software is almost always used for the production of bills of  
quantities today, because this field is ideal for computerisation  
due to the linking of tender data with detailed design. The  
Standard Book of Bill Items \(StLB\} for the building industry helps  
with the production of bills of quantities with standard text building  
blocks for individual items, which are assigned to the appropriate  
areas of work \(these approximate to trades according to VOB/C\).  
Model bills of quantities for the production of bills are similar to  
standard books. They include possible text blocks \(texts are created  
by deleting\) and are generally very extensive. Manufacturer's  
model bills of quantities for the production of bills offer additional  
information and are useful for particular constructional solutions.

# Techniques of work scheduling  
**Bar charts ---7 0** show the work activities vertically and the  
relevant construction time horizontally in a coordinate system. The  
duration of each activity is shown by the length of the relevant bar.  
Following activities are shown below each other. Bar charts are  
widely used in construction because they are simple and easy to  
understand. However, the interdependencies of activities \(critical  
paths\) and working directions can scarcely be shown.  
**Line diagrams** \(time-distance diagrams\) show a linear graph of  
the relationship between work time and distance \(or work quantity\)  
in a coordinate system. The speed of work \(the slope of the line\)  
and the critical spacings of individual work activities \(mutual  
hindrance\) can be made clear. Line diagrams are mainly used  
for construction processes with a pronounced direction of work  
\(roads, tunnels etc.\).  
**Network diagrams ---7 f\)** are used for the analysis, planning and  
control of complex construction sequences with consideration of  
as many parameters as possible. The sequence of work is divided  
into part activities or events, which are shown as **nodes** \(Metra  
Potential Method \(MPM\), event node method/ Program Evaluation  
and Review Technique \(PERT\)\) or **arrows** \(Critical Path Method  
\(CPM\)\), with nodes shown as starting and finishing events. Nodes  
thus indicates important process or event parameters.

Housing area regulations\_\_\_\_. p. 136  
Housing area regulations apply to calculations of residential  
area according to the law to promote living space \(includes  
housing subsidies\)\: the living area of a dwelling covers all rooms  
which belong exclusively to the relevant dwelling, including  
conservatories, swimming pools \(if enclosed on all sides\),  
balconies, loggias, terraces, but not subsidiary rooms \(cellars,  
garages etc\:\), offices and rooms which do not comply with the  
building regulations.  
The floor area of a room is determined from the clear dimensions  
between the building elements, from the outer face of the element's  
cladding \(which includes window and door claddings, skirting  
boards, stoves, ovens, baths, built-in furniture, free-standing  
installations, movable partitions\). The floor area is measured in  
completed rooms or from a suitable building drawing.  
Floor areas are included in the calculation either completely \(for  
rooms and parts of rooms with a clear ceiling height of at least  
2 m\), or a half \(for rooms and parts of rooms with a clear ceiling  
height of at least 1 m and less than 2 m\) or a quarter \(balconies,  
loggias, terraces etc.\).  
Calculation of commercial letting areas  
The guidelines for the calculation of commercial letting areas,  
issued by the Property Industry Research Company \(GIF\) creates  
a uniform standard for the determination of leased commercial  
and office space. The leased space is calculated from two types  
of area\:  
1\. Areas with exclusive right of use, individually listed in types  
of area according to DIN 277\: basement garage with number of  
places \(see above\), indirectly usable areas \(loggias, balconies,  
atriums, areas with room heights between 1.50 m and 2.30 m.  
2\. Areas with communal right of use, individually listed as\:  
rooms for communal use \(WCs/bathrooms, staff rooms, etc.\) and  
communal traffic areas \(entrance halls, corridors, etc.\).  
The following do not belong to the letting area\: stairs, lifts,  
emergency exits, escape balconies, services rooms, shafts,  
protection rooms, areas of columns, pillars and separate walls,  
areas with a clear ceiling height of 1.50 m or less.  
The relevant areas are measured at floor level between solid walls  
\(including skirtings and fittings built in on site \(radiators etc.\), and  
room heights are measured between top of finished floor level and  
underside of the \(suspended\) ceiling.

Measures of Building Use  
Measures of building use \_\_\_\_. 0  
The land use regulation specifies parameters for the measurement  
of building use in planning law\: the plot coverage ratio determines  
the permissible ratio of built area on the plot *\(plan* area *of building*  
*including garages, parking* places *and their* access, *subsidiary*  
areas. . . *and underground facilities beneath the plot\)* and the  
floor-area ratio \(determines the permissible ratio of storey area  
*\(external dimensions of all full floors, without subsidiary* areas ... ,  
*balconies, loggias,* terraces *and structures which are permissible*  
*inside setback* areas\) to the plot area.  
The building mass number represents how many cubic metres  
of building mass \(external dimensions of the building facilities  
from floor level of the lowest to the ceiling of the highest full  
storey, including occupied rooms in the intermediate floors  
with their stairwells, surrounding walls and slabs but without

f\) Breal\<down of floor areas \(according to DIN 277-1\)  
Floor areas and volumes  
DIN 277 contains parameters for the calculation of floor areas and  
room volumes of buildings \_\_\_\_. f\). All parameters are calculated  
separately according to whether they belong to the following  
categories\:  
a\) roofed over and enclosed on all sides  
b\) roofed over but not enclosed on all sides  
c\) not roofed over  
The gross floor area is the sum of the plan area of all levels  
\(without usable roof areas\), measured between the external  
dimensions of the surrounding building elements at floor height.  
The constructional floor area is the sum of the plan area of all  
surrounding building elements \(walls, columns, pillars, chimneys,  
non-accessible shafts, door openings, niches, apertures\)  
measured between the external dimensions at floor height. The  
net floor area is the usable floor area between the building  
elements \(without door and window openings, cut-outs and  
niches\) measured at floor level. The net floor area is the sum of the  
usable area \(area which serves the building's intended purpose\),  
the technical function area \(rooms for building services, such  
as utility connection room, accessible shafts, etc.\) and the traffic  
area \(e.g. stairwells, corridors, lift shafts, escape balconies etc.\).  
The gross built volume is the sum of the floor areas of all levels  
multiplied by the relevant height \(measured between top of floor  
covering and top of floor covering of the next level, in the basement  
from the underside of the constructional structural invert in the  
roof to the top of the roof covering, without external stairs, light  
wells, roof overhangs, dormer windows, chimneys, etc.\). The net  
built volume is the net floor area multiplied by the relevant clear

Setback Areas  
Setback areas are the spaces between buildings and their plot  
boundaries.  
1\. Setback areas next to above-ground buildings have to be kept  
free in front of the external walls of buildings\_\_\_. **0- f\).** This  
also applies to other facilities with effects similar to buildings,  
which are opposite buildings and plot boundaries. Setback  
areas are not required in front of external walls which are built  
on plot boundaries, if they may be or must be built on the  
boundary according to planning regulations \_\_\_. **f\).**  
2. Setback areas must be on the plot itself\_\_\_. **0- f\).** They may  
also lie on public traffic, green and water areas, but only to  
their centre. Setback areas and spaces may wholly or partly  
extend onto other plots, if it is certain according to public law  
that they cannot be built on, though they may not be deducted  
from the other plot's setback areas.  
3. Setback areas may not overlap unless\:  
- the external walls are at an angle of more than 75° to each  
other\_. **e**  
- they are external walls facing a garden courtyard in  
dwellings of building classes 1 and 2 \_\_\_. **e**  
- buildings and other built facilities are permissible in the  
setback areas.  
4. The depth of the setback area is measured according to wall  
height\_\_\_. **8-** 0.This is measured at right angles to the wall.  
Wall height means the dimension from ground level to upper  
extent of the wall or to the intersection of the wall with the  
roof covering **\_\_\_.G.** The height of roofs with a pitch of \~70° is  
included to one third, \~70° fully with the wall height\_\_\_. 0.The  
same applies to roof projections\_\_\_. **0.**  
5. The depth of setback areas differs in the various state building  
regulations \(LBO\)\). According to the model building regulations  
\(MBO\), it is 0.4 x H, but at least 3 m \(0.2 x H, min. 3 m for  
commercial and industrial areas\). In front of the outside walls of  
building classes 1 and 2 with not more than three overground  
storeys, 3 m depth is also sufficient. In some LBOs, there are  
further exceptions \(e.g. narrow side privilege\).  
6. Building elements projecting from the outside wall \(cornices,  
roof overhang\) are not considered in the measurement of  
setback areas **\_\_\_.e.** Projections remain unconsidered if they\:  
- take up altogether less than one third of the width of the  
outside wall  
- project by a max. 1.50 m in front of the outside wall  
-stay at least 2 m distant from the opposing plot boundary  
7. The following are permissible inside the setback area of a  
building and do not have their own setback areas \(even if they  
are built on the plot boundary or on the building\) \_\_\_. **0 - 4Ji\)\:**  
- garages and buildings without occupied rooms or fireplaces  
with an average wall height of up to 3 m and a total length  
per plot boundary of 9 m \_\_\_. **0**

to 2 m \_\_\_. **4Ji\).** The depth of setback areas opposite plot

DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT  
Construction Costs  
······  
Influence over the building costs reduces very rapidly during  
the course of design and construction. The parties involved in  
the preparation of the project have the greatest influence over  
the building costs, because decisions are made at this time  
about the size, volume etc. of the project. In the further course  
of construction, costs can be influenced only to a decreasing  
degree. The flow of money behaves the other way around; it is still  
very small in the preparation phase and increases in steps --\:\> **0.**  
Efficient cost control should therefore always attempt to apply  
the brakes during the work phases of a project; control as part of  
works planning \(material selection, etc.\) normally has, by way of

determinations are basic services --\:\> pp. 58-62. They are regarded  
as basic services with a special weighting, i.e. neglecting a cost  
determination can have dire legal consequences in the case of a  
dispute.  
# \~  
Basic rules of cost determination  
The basic rules of cost determination are laid down in DIN 276.  
This classifies the building costs into seven cost groups and three  
\(cost\) levels--\:\> **f\).** Each cost determination must be structured in  
the same way and consist of defined building blocks\:  
1. Statements about the cost in all cost groups  
2\. Building description  
3. Cost situation at the time of the determination  
4. Details of VAT  
5\. Date of the cost determination  
6. Reference to the relevant design work  
Cost forecast  
The cost forecast is the most precise determination of the building  
costs, taking place in work phase 7 \(collaboration in tendering\).  
The cost forecast is based on\:  
1. complete construction drawings, details, etc.  
2. structural verifications, thermal insulation calculations etc.  
3. calculations of quantities of reference units in the cost groups  
or bill items  
4. building description with explanations of construction  
5. listing of tenders, awards and already accrued costs  
As the last cost determination before the start of construction,  
this has particular significance. The cost forecast should include  
the total cost according to cost groups down to the 3rd level  
of cost breakdown and contain 218 individual cost data. The  
building description belonging to the cost forecast corresponds  
to the state of design and has the highest degree of detail in the  
course of the design work. The purpose of the cost forecast is to  
produce a document before the start of construction based on  
tenders, awards, already accrued costs and, if necessary, extra  
calculations, because this is the only possibility of cost control  
and correction.  
Final cost statement  
The final cost statement serves to record the actual costs accrued  
for purposes of comparison and documentation. The final .c.ost  
is based on\: 1. checked invoices, 2. remeasurement quantities,  
3. explanations. In the final cost statement, the total costs should  
be classified down to the 2nd level of cost breakdown.

Cost estimate  
The cost estimate is for the approximate determination of  
construction costs. It is included in work phase 2 \(preliminary  
design\). It is based on\:  
1. results of the preliminary design \(if necessary as a sketch\),  
2. calculation of the quantities of reference units in the cost  
groups  
3. explanations and building description  
4. details of plot, utility supply and access.  
The cost estimate should contain the total costs according to  
cost groups at the 1st level of cost breakdown and thus has at  
least seven items of cost data. The required description should  
correspond to the state of information of the preliminary design  
Cost calculation  
The cost calculation is defined as 'approximate determination'  
of the construction costs. It is part of work phase 3 \(preliminary  
design\). The basis for the cost calculation are\:  
1. complete design drawings and, if appropriate, details  
2. calculation of the quantities of reference units in the cost  
groups  
3. descriptions relevant for the calculation.  
The cost calculation should determine the total costs according to  
cost groups down to the 2nd level of cost breakdown and contain  
40 individual items of cost data.  
The building description should correspond to the differentiated  
state of information of the preliminary design.

# FOUNDATIONS  
Building Excavations  
# Setting out  
Before the start of groundworks, the planned building is set out  
on the plot by a publicly appointed surveyor working from the  
official site plan in the building permit documents. The intended  
excavation for the building \(basement\) is marked out with pegs  
\~ **0 - 0.** To secure the points that have been set out, **profile**  
**boards** \~ **e** are set up, set back from the planned top of the  
excavation's batter \(sloped bank\). After the excavation, **string**  
**lines** are stretched between the profiles to mark the corners of  
the building again. The intersections of the string lines are then  
plumbed down to mark the external corners of the building.  
The levels also have to be set out. These are based on benchmarks  
in the surroundings. **Geometric surveying** measures the difference  
in height of a horizontally set up **level** from a benchmark with a  
**levelling staff** held vertically \~ **0.** Intermediate levels can be  
obtained with a **long spirit level,** normally a 3 m long light metal  
rail with built-in bubble, and a **measuring** stick\~ **0. Hydrostatic**  
**levelling** uses a **water level,** a flexible hose filled with water. This  
has glass cylinders at each end calibrated in mm, and can be used  
to transfer levels between points without visual contact because  
the water in the tube finds the same level at each end.

# FOUNDATIONS  
Building Excavations  
Incorrect interpretation of the subsoil and groundwater conditions,  
and the behaviour of the planned foundations, often lead to  
technically and economically irreparable damage. This applies  
particularly to lateral displacement of the soil under foundation  
loading **\(load-bearing failure of the ground, slope failure\),**  
where the foundations sink into the soil or are laterally displaced,  
or **settlement,** through compression of the subsoil under the  
foundations due to ground pressure and/or loads applied next to  
the foundations. The results can be deformation or cracking in  
masonry.  
# Soil investigation  
If there is insufficient local experience about the properties,  
extent, bedding and thickness of the soil strata on the site, a **soil**  
**investigation** performed as early as possible by a geotechnical  
specialist is essential. The specialist can obtain information  
through **trial pits** \(excavator or hand excavation\), drilling  
**boreholes** \(auger/rotary/core drilling\), with extraction of samples,  
and **probing** \(number and depth depending on the topography,  
structure and particular investigation\). The **groundwater table** is  
measured with gauges in boreholes and regular measurement of  
variations in level.  
Soil investigations should provide data for the design and  
construction of the building without technical or economic  
problems\:  
**-Soil samples** are tested for grading, water content, consistency,  
density, compressibility, shear strength and permeability. -  
Probing provides continuous information about strength and  
density for the investigated depth. - **Groundwater samples**  
can be investigated for aggressiveness towards concrete.- The  
results of the investigations are provided to the client as a **site**  
# investigation report.  
# Building excavations  
Basement excavations are normally battered \(with sloped banks\)  
*--7* **0.** The following **slope angle** \~ can normally be assumed  
without verification of the structural safety by calculation\:

# Underpinning  
If a new building is to be erected directly next to an existing  
building with the underside of its foundations at a higher level,  
then the existing foundations have to be underpinned to prevent  
damage to the existing building through settlement or ground  
failure.  
Excavations, foundations and underpinning work next to existing  
buildings should therefore be thoroughly and carefully designed,  
prepared, planned and constructed in accordance with DIN 4123  
--7 **0- f\).**  
**A competent site manager must be present on the site during**  
# the underpinning work.  
Even work undertaken with careful planning and construction in  
accordance with this standard cannot rule out **slight deformation**  
of the existing building, according to condition and type of  
construction .  
Fine cracking and settlement of the underpinned building by  
up to 5 mm is generally considered unavoidable. It is therefore  
recommended to perform a survey of the existing building before  
starting work, with the participation of all involved parties, to  
determine its condition and survey reference levels and possibly  
also deflection points.  
# Groundwater  
If the bottom of the excavation is below the water table, then  
special measures will be required\:  
This can be **open dewatering,** with the water being continuously  
pumped out of sumps in the bottom, trenches and drains --7 **e.**  
If the quantity of water is higher, then **closed dewatering** is  
necessary --7 **0\:** the groundwater is lowered using underwater  
pumps \(with a safety distance of about 50 em\) under the base of  
the excavation.  
If the excavation is larger or deeper, however, there is a risk that  
this lowering of the water table could impair the soil conditions  
near the site \(settlement of neighbouring buildings!\) or the use  
of public surface water drains could be forbidden. In this case,  
the entire area of the bottom of the excavation will have to be  
# waterproofed.  
To achieve this, the excavation is normally supported with a  
continuous back-anchored sheet pile or diaphragm wall. Then  
the excavation is dug down to floor level 'under water' and an  
**underwater concrete base** designed to be safe from floating  
is laid \(if necessary, from a pontoon\). After the concrete has  
hardened, the water can be pumped out and any leaks grouted.  
Alternatively, a **soft gel base** can be constructed by grouting the  
subsoil with sodium silicate plus a chemical hardener additive to  
produce a nearly waterproof layer.  
The actual structure with external walls of **watertight concrete**  
can be built in the basin produced in this way.

Foundations  
Foundations can be constructed as spread or shallow foundations  
**\(pad foundations ---+ 0, strip footing ---+ f\), ground-bearing**  
**slab or raft ---+ 9\)** or deep foundations **\(piled foundations ---+ 0**  
---+ p. 70\).  
# Spread foundations  
**Masonry foundations** are technically feasible but seldom used  
today on account of the high cost.  
**Unreinforced concrete foundations** are used for smaller widths  
and relatively small buildings.  
**Reinforced concrete foundations** are used where the ground  
pressure is higher or the projection outside the wall is wider---+ **0-0**  
\(reinforcement to resist the tension forces ---+ **0\).** Reinforced  
concrete requires less thickness, weight and excavation depth than  
unreinforced concrete. The detailing of foundations at expansion  
joints and next to existing buildings or boundaries is shown in ---+ **Ci\).**  
**Raft foundations** ---+ \~ are used where the load-bearing capacity  
of the subsoil is low or where pad foundations or strip footings are  
insufficient to bear the load.  
The foundation level must be at a frost-free depth, so that the  
subsoil under it cannot move due to freezing and thawing.  
According to DIN 1054, a depth of 0.80 m \(for engineered  
structures 1.0-1.5 m\) counts as frost-free.  
**Improvement in the load-bearing capacity of the subsoil**  
a\) **Vibroflotation compaction\:** uses vibration to compact a  
radius of 2.3-3 m; spacing of the vibration cores approx.  
1.5 m. Settlement is topped up. The improvement depends on  
the grading of the soil and its original bedding density.  
b\) **Vibro stone columns\:** columns are formed by vibration of  
aggregate of various grading without binder.  
c\) **Stabilisation and compaction of the soil\:** Cement grouting  
cannot be used for soils which are cohesive or aggressive to  
cement. Grouting with chemicals \(silica solution, potassium  
chloride\) produces immediate and permanent petrifaction, but  
can be used only with soils containing quartz \(gravel, loose  
rock\).

# FOUNDATIONS  
Foundations  
# Deep foundations  
Deep foundations are used where sufficiently load-bearing strata  
only occur at a great depth under the planned building and thus  
cannot be reached by shallow foundations.  
They are normally constructed of reinforced concrete piles, which  
transfer the loading from the building through the weak ground to  
the load-bearing ground below. The design of piled foundations  
is based on the permissible loading on the ground and the type,  
properties, extent, density and thickness of the subsoil layers,  
which have to be established by investigation boreholes and  
probing if local experience cannot deliver sufficient certainty.  
# Basic terms  
The force in the pile can be transferred to the stable ground by  
**skin friction, end-bearing** or a combination of both \(the type of  
load transfer depends on the ground conditions and type of pile\).  
**Standing pile foundations\:** load transfer is through the end of the  
pile into load-bearing ground, additionally through skin friction.  
**Hanging pile foundations\:** the pile ends do not reach load-  
bearing ground. Weakly load-bearing layers are compacted by the  
driving of the pile.  
Piles are categorised according to the method of load transfer  
into\: **friction piles,** which essentially transfer load into load-  
bearing layers by skin friction between the pile surface and the  
ground. **End-bearing piles** mainly transfer load into the ground  
through pressure under the end, with skin friction being irrelevant.  
The permissible force on the can be increased considerably by  
making the end larger \(under-reaming\).  
According to the location of the piles in the ground, they can be  
**ground piles,** which are underground for their entire length, while  
**long piles** \(free-standing piles\) are in the ground only for part of  
their length and the upper part is free-standing, and therefore at  
risk of buckling.  
According to the method of installation, there are piles which  
compact, displace or loosen the ground. **Driven piles** \(driven with  
a pile hammer\), **pressed piles** \(pressed in\), **bored piles** \(installed  
in a bored hole\), **screwed piles** \(turned into the ground\) and **jetted**  
**piles** Qetted into the ground\).  
According to the type of loading, they can be\: axially loaded  
piles, **tension piles** \(which are loaded in tension and transfer  
the force in the pile into the ground through skin friction\),  
**compression piles** \(which are loaded in compression and  
transfer load through end pressure and skin friction\) and **piles**  
**subject to bending** \(for example horizontally loaded large-  
diameter bored piles\).  
According to the method of production and installation, piles  
can be\:  
- **precast piles,** in prefabricated lengths or complete, which are  
delivered to the site and driven into the ground, jetted, vibrated,  
pressed, screwed or inserted into prepared holes.  
- **in-situ piles,** which are concreted in a hole prepared in the  
ground by boring, driving, pressing or vibrating.  
- **mixed foundation piles,** which consist of a combination of  
locally produced and prefabricated components.  
In-situ piles have the advantage that their length can be determined  
during construction, from the data recorded during driving or from  
the inspection of the spoil from boring. -------- Vertical timber boarding \(2.5 em\)

# Waterproofing  
External walls and slabs in contact with the ground must be  
waterproofed against **damp under external pressure.** External  
and internal walls in cellars and ground floors without cellars also  
have to be protected with horizontal waterproofing against **rising**  
# damp.  
This occurs as **ground moisture** \(capillary, suction and residual  
water in the ground, which can be carried against gravity by  
capillary action\) or **seepage water,** from precipitation and non-  
standing, which is not under pressure \(e.g. earth-covered cellar  
roofs under courtyards\), as well as **water under pressure** from  
the outside or occasionally **standing water** \(groundwater and  
floodwater\).  
Waterproofing **materials** can be sheet material from the roll based  
on bitumen, plastic or elastomer, metal bands, mastic asphalt or  
thick plastic-modified bitumen coatings.  
Vertical and horizontal waterproofing layers are to be brought  
together and sealed so that no moisture bridges remain. They  
must generally be continued 30 em above ground level. Protective  
layers should also be provided in order to protect the waterproofing  
until the assignment of the various types of waterproofing to the  
various actions of water is shown in -+ **0.**

# Basement drainage  
The ground can be drained through a **drainage layer** and  
**drainage pipes** in order to prevent the occurrence of water  
under pressure against an external wall. The entire procedure  
consists of drainage, inspection and flushing shaft and drainage  
pipes -7 **e.**  
Drainage pipe, ON 1 00, fall 0.5. Flushing and control pipe,  
ON 300\. Flushing, control and collector shaft, ON 1000\. The  
required nominal diameter for round drainage pipes and operating  
roughness kb = 2 mm can be determined from -7 **e.** The flow  
speed in the drainage pipe when full should not be less than  
v = 0.25 m/s. For areas over 2000 m2  
, full-area drainage should  
be provided, through drainage pipes. The spacing of the individual  
drainage pipes should be calculated, and if necessary inspection  
shafts should also be provided -7 **f\).**  
The precondition for effective drainage is that the water runs away  
into a sewer or stream even at the highest water level in the main  
drainage channel. The best arrangement is a connection with free  
fall into an open stream or rainwater sewer, to avoid the need for  
pumping. If a pump is necessary, it must be protected against  
water coming back from the sewer or stream by a suitable device  
like a backflow preventer valve. This device must be accessible  
and must be maintained. Water from drainage can also be  
percolated into permeable subsoil, for example in a soakaway.

If there is water under pressure or it is not possible to divert  
standing water through the provision of drainage, then the  
building elements must be constructed of **watertight concrete,**  
or a **continuous waterproofing layer** capable of resisting water  
pressure must be applied to the invert and side walls. This can  
consist of bituminous sheeting, metal waterproofing or plastic  
foil. It must be resistant to aggressive water and must maintain its  
effectiveness despite shrinkage, settlement and temperature-related  
deformation -7 p. 71. Bentonite waterproofing is also possible.  
Watertight concrete is today the generally preferred method of  
resisting water under pressure. If the cellar floor and walls are  
separated by a construction joint, this must be waterproofed with  
a suitable waterstop or raised edge. The external surface of the  
walls is also provided with a protective coating based on bitumen  
or artificial resin as additional protection -7 **e -f\).**

Repair  
Most building defects are caused by damp. Rising damp from the  
ground can be caused by missing or defective damp proofing over  
the foundations or cellar, missing or silted drainage or defective  
rainwater goods, resulting in surface water at the transition area  
between ground and wall.  
When a repair is undertaken, it also necessary to investigate  
and remedy the cause of the moisture penetration. Missing or  
damaged horizontal damp courses are laborious to replace,  
and the work needs to be carried out very carefully because  
the capillary transport of moisture must be interrupted. Building  
elements, which are impossible to waterproof, or only at excessive  
expense, can be coated using special plaster systems, which  
enable the damp to evaporate. The efflorescence of mineral salts  
resulting from evaporation can be absorbed for a long time, but  
the durability of such remedial plasters is still considerably shorter  
than plaster on a dry substrate.

# WALLS  
Natural Stone Masonry  
Natural stone walling can be categorised into **rubble, cyclopean,**  
# coursed, ashlar and composite.  
Stone, which has a natural plane of cleavage, should be split and  
laid according to the cleavage, e.g. \~ **0. e. 0.** which looks  
better and is also structurally sounder because the loading is then  
mostly at right angles to the natural bedding. ·  
The size of the individual blocks is of great importance. The block  
length should not be more than four to five times the block height  
and should not be less than the height \(the stones should be  
bonded well on all sides\). Pure natural stone masonry must be  
bonded in the entire cross-section in accordance with good trade  
practice.  
There should never be more than three joints meeting at the  
front or rear surfaces of a block and no vertical joint should pass  
through more than two courses. For structural reasons, a course  
should be brought flat and level every \~1.5 m \(spacing of scaffold  
platforms\).  
**Header and stretcher courses** must alternate, or there must be  
at least one header for every two stretchers in each course. The  
depth \(into the wall\) of the headers must be at least 1% times the  
course height but at least 30 em.  
The depth \(into the wall\) of the stretchers must be about  
equal to the course height. The vertical joints must be covered  
by ;;\:\:;10 em in coursed masonry and ;;\:\:;15 em in ashlar  
masonry \~ **0 + 0,** and the largest blocks should be laid at the  
**corners** \~ **0 - 0. Face surfaces** should subsequently be fully  
pointed, first scratching out a depth equal to the joint width. The  
joints should be about 3 em thick according to roughness and  
method of working. Lime or lime-cement mortar should be used,  
as cement can discolour certain types of stone. In **composite**  
**masonry,** the worked stone facing can be integrated into the load-  
bearing cross-section \~ **0.** Non-load-bearing **stone cladding** of  
2.5-5 em thickness is fixed to the backing wall with anchors \~ **Cli\).**

# External wall construction  
**Single-leaf external walls** \~ **0-f\)** are unproblematic regarding  
building physics, but on account of the high thermal insulation  
requirements can only be built with materials with high thermal  
insulation value \(e.g. aerated blocks\) and special thermally  
insulated mortars and plasters. If the blocks used are susceptible  
to frost damage, they have to be rendered or protected in other  
ways. If the masonry is externally visible, then each course must  
consist of at least two rows of blocks of the same height with a  
continuous 20 mm thick longitudinal joint between them, and each  
course staggered and mortared without voids.  
**Single-leaf walls with additional insulation layers** \~ **8 - 0**

therefore a common alternative.  
**Cavity walls** consist of an inner load-bearing wall and an outer  
non-load-bearing weather protection facing **\(minimum thickness**  
**90 mm\).** They can be built with an air gap, with air gap and thermal  
insulation, with cavity-filling insulation and with intermediate  
plaster layer \~ **0 - CD\).** The masonry leaves are connected with  
**ties** of non-rusting steel. The width of the air gap should be min. 40  
mm \(max. 150 mm\). Vertical expansion joints should be provided  
in the external leaf and there should also be. ventilation openings

Brick and Block Masonry  
# Bonding of masonry  
In order to evenly transfer the loads acting on masonry and  
ensure crack-free wall surfaces, bricks and blocks are normally  
laid in regular courses and bonded. Masonry courses are named,  
according to their method of integration into the bond, **stretcher,**  
# header or soldier courses\:  
Stretcher courses lie with their length along the face of the wall.  
Header courses lie with their end in the face of the wall and are  
bonded into the masonry by their length.  
Masonry courses should continue horizontally through all walls  
in a building. **Vertical joints** in adjacent courses must always  
be overlapped, i.e. displaced relative to the adjacent course  
by a certain dimension \(at least 1,4 brick\). In order to reduce the  
proportion of joints, as many whole bricks as possible should be  
used \(in the currently prevalent single-leaf wall made of large-  
format blocks, the joints are the thermal weak point and have to be  
carried out in lightweight or thin mortar, or with the vertical joints  
toothed ---\) **0\).** The type and dimension of the displacement of the  
vertical joints in adjacent courses leads to the basic pattern of the  
various masonry bonds, in addition to the sequence of stretchers  
and headers.

**Reinforced concrete walls --\> 0 - f\)**  
Reinforced concrete walls can be concreted on site or pre-cast.  
**Solid concrete walls** can be used as external walls only with  
an additional thermal insulation layer. This can be as an external  
thermal insulation system --\> **0** or as a multi-leaf construction  
\(analogous to p. 75\) with core insulation and possibly back-  
ventilation. **Two-layer reinforced concrete walls --\> 0** with  
core insulation are used particularly as large-format external wall  
elements.  
**Timber-framed walls --\> 0 - 41!\)**  
The oldest form of timber walling is **log cabin construction**  
with the round logs or beams laid on top of one another and  
cogged at the corners --\> **41!\).** Timber-framed walling \(with the  
panels filled in with various materials\) is economical and the  
most common method, with vertical loads being transferred  
through the studs. A variant of timber framing is the erection of  
framed panels, which are prefabricated with thermal insulation.  
When timber-framed walls are to be used, provide sufficient  
roof overhang and design cladding in the splash area to be  
easily replaced.

Repair  
# External walls  
Defects to external walls are caused by natural weathering, poor  
maintenance and often also incorrectly carried out repairs and  
modernisation attempts. When modernisation or conversion work  
is undertaken, walls have to be upgraded to meet current energy  
and structural requirements.  
# Timber framing  
A main characteristic of timber-framed houses is the separation of  
the load-bearing timber construction from the non-load-bearing  
panels between \(the panels should always be fitted so they  
receive no loading\). Timber construction was originally carried  
out without metal fixings and can normally be repaired without  
the use of steel or iron parts \(water condensation on metal parts  
can damage the timber, which in Germany is often softwood\). The  
original infilling of the panels is usually facing brick or a clay daub  
*--7* **0 - f\).** The timber functions and the appearance of joints at  
the contact between timber and panel is unavoidable. Triangular  
strips or grooves in the timber are used to fix the panel infilling  
and prevent draughts. Constructional timber protection \(wide roof  
overhang, full-surface render or ventilated cladding\) can avoid  
damage due to water penetrating from outside. Waterproof paints  
and permanently elastic mastic also stop water from infiltrating  
but are one of the main causes of damage to timber framing!  
Loam panels should always be preserved and damaged ones  
repaired. There is still no other panel infilling material available that  
is as good as loam *--7* **0 + 0** in terms of good trade practice,  
building physics and building biology. It also counters fungal and  
insect attack. Brick infilling has a stiffening effect, which acts  
against the structural principles of timber framing, and lightweight  
infilling has no thermal storage capacity.  
# Natural stone and stucco fagades  
The energy performance of solid walls with structured fac;\:ades of  
natural stone or stucco is often improved by internal insulation *--7*  
p. 55 **0.** When natural stone cladding is replaced, insulation can  
be installed behind the stone fac;\:ade. The stone facing panels must  
be fixed to an independent support structure while maintaining the  
outline and proportions of the fac;\:ade. If the expense of insulation  
to EnEV standards is too high \(i.e. economically unreasonable\),  
an exemption from certain requirements can be agreed with the  
responsible authority. When installing external insulation, attention  
should be paid to whether the extra projection infringes any  
boundary or building line *--7* **0 +e.**

Slab Construction  
Floor slabs separate storeys and have to fulfil sound insulation and  
fire protection requirements in addition to their structural function.  
In addition to the main building materials \(natural/artificial stone,  
concrete, steel, timber and lightweight concrete\), slabs can  
be divided by their structural system into **vaulted** \(subject to  
compression\) and **flat** \(subject to bending\).  
They can be built as **slab or joist/beam** constructions\:  
Slabs are flat structures loaded at right angles to their plane and  
spanning in one or two directions with linear or point loading.  
Common forms are solid reinforced concrete slabs --7 **0 - CD,** as  
in-situ, pre-cast or partially prefabricated elements; hollow pot  
slabs --7 **0** with structurally connected clay pots forming cavities;  
pre-stressed concrete cored planks --7 **0,** made out of welded  
single elements; and composite slabs --7 **m.**  
Joist constructions consist of single beams, mostly loaded in  
bending.  
In addition to timber joist floors --7 **0 - G,** solid beam slabs --7  
**0- e, tD,** and steel joist slabs --7 **0** can also be used.  
For large spans and loads, there are double-T slabs --7 **0** and  
ribbed slabs, structurally optimised mixed constructions.

Refurbishment  
Floor slabs  
Load-bearing floor joists in old buildings used to be designed  
empirically by the carpenter. The loads were mostly carried  
on transverse joists spanning one or more longitudinal support  
beams. In an old building book from 1900, a ratio of joist height  
to width of 5\:7 is given as a guideline for the determination of joist  
size. The rule\: half the room depth in decimetres =the joist height  
in em. Because of this sizing, old timber joist floors often sag  
considerably, though this does not compromise structural safety  
as long as the permissible stresses are not exceeded.  
Refurbishment possibilities ---\> **0.** Strengthen the timber joist  
by adding a second. Improve the load distribution by inserting  
additional floor joists or a steel beam ---\> **0.** Shorten the span by  
inserting one or more additional support beams or a load-bearing  
cross wall. Alterations to the load-bearing structure should always  
be preceded by a precise survey of load-transferring and bracing  
functions. In order to guarantee the load transfers, all connections  
must be in firm contact.  
Improvement in sound insulation can normally be achieved only  
through an increase in the weight of the floor, so the floor will  
probably have to be strengthened as well. Impact sound can be  
reduced by separating the walking surface from the structure and  
by using soft floor coverings---\> **0.**  
If new building standards are to be achieved, it will normally  
be necessary to change the entire floor structure ---\> p. 55.  
The installation of wet rooms above timber joist floors requires  
particular attention because it will scarcely be possible to  
check for penetration of water and damp damaging the  
structure---\> **0-0.**

Concrete Repair  
# Requirements  
The existing condition must be  
surveyed and damage analysed  
before starting the repair of  
concrete buildings. The following  
points are particularly important\:  
**Surfaces\:** damage through  
insufficient *cover* to the rein-  
forcement. The cause may be  
the low requirements of earlier  
guidelines and, often, inappro-  
priate construction. Carboni-  
sation \(conversion of alkaline  
concrete into acid through en-  
vironmental effects\) can lead to  
corrosion of the reinforcement,  
which results in spalling of the  
concrete surface.  
**Joints\:** elastic joints should be  
replaced after max. 1 0 years.  
If this is not done, damage can  
be caused to the structure by  
penetrating water \(e.g. frost  
damage\).  
**Building elements\:** if the walls  
or slabs are too thin for the fire  
protection and sound insulation  
requirements, then additional  
measures are necessary.  
# Building materials for concrete  
# replacement\:  
cement concrete and cement  
mortar \(CC\)  
plastic-modified cement con-  
crete and cement mortar  
\(PC C\)  
reaction resin concrete and re-  
action resin mortar \(PC\). Mor-  
tar and concrete with artificial  
resin additives are not suitable  
for the improvement of fire  
protection requirements!  
The surfaces must be cleaned  
and have the surface strength  
specified for the relevant treat-  
ment. Large areas of concrete  
surface can be *removed* and the  
reinforcement derusted by using  
high-pressure water jetting. If it  
is possible to provide sufficient  
thickness of concrete *cover,*  
then no further rust protection is  
necessary for the reinforcement.  
If only a thinner cover is possible,  
then the reinforcement must  
be protected against rust. In  
this case, the requirements for  
derusting are higher.

# Floor construction  
Floors are normally built up in many layers, consisting  
of covering, screed \(if necessary, with substructure\),  
separation, waterproofing and insulation layers. The nature,  
arrangement and thickness of these layers is determined  
by the requirements for thermal insulation, sound insulation  
and waterproofing \(against water penetrating from above\).  
Screeds can be constructed as **bonded screed --7 0,**  
**unbonded screed --7 f\) or floating screed --7 f\).** Screed  
can be based on cement, anhydrite or flowing anhydrite, or  
poured asphalt. The load-bearing capacity of screed depends  
on the thickness and quality of the material as well as the  
load-bearing capacity of other layers \(e.g. insulation\). The  
requirements for expansion joints also have to be observed.

# ROOFS  
Pitched Roofs  
The roof forms the upper edge of a building and protects it  
from rain and atmospheric influences \(wind, cold, heat\). A roof  
consists of a supporting structure **\(roof frame, roof truss\)** and  
**roof covering.** The design of the roof truss depends on material  
\(timber, steel, reinforced concrete\), roof pitch, loading \(self-  
weight, traffic load, wind and snow load\), etc. Roof trusses for  
pitched roofs are traditionally divided into **purlin roofs** and **couple**  
**roofs.** These vary according to the structural function of the  
members --7 **0-0.**  
# Purlin roof  
The purlin roof is the simplest form of roof construction. The  
rafters are supported by cross-beams called **purlins,** which are  
either mounted directly onto the masonry \(monopitch principle\)  
or form load-bundling support beams as part of a roof truss,  
supported by various arrangements of **posts.** Purlin trusses in  
relatively narrow houses mostly have a single row of posts in the  
centre of the roof, but wider roofs have two rows of posts or more  
--7 **f\).**  
There are various further forms of construction for wider span  
roofs, like 'strutted purlin' --7 **e** and 'centre hanger' ---7 **0.**

The weight of the roof is transferred to the external walls without  
loading the ceiling. This makes possible large roof spaces without  
posts. The necessary joint to transfer tension at the junction of  
rafter and ceiling joist traditionally leads to the characteristic  
change of roof pitch in couple roofs, which is constructed with  
a sprocket fixed at the top to the rafter and at the bottom to the  
projecting end of the ceiling joist ---\> p. 86 **0** \(modern couple roofs

# Roof spaces  
Spaces under pitched roofs were formerly used as naturally  
ventilated 'hay lofts' for the storage of the harvest. The rooms  
below were protected from cold by the stored produce -7 **0.**  
Today, roof spaces are converted into habitable rooms. The  
roof construction must comply with additional building physics  
requirements.  
# Building methods  
Thermally insulated roofs can be divided into **ventilated** and  
**non-ventilated** construction. In addition to the ventilation space  
between roof covering and underlay \(or lower layer of roof\),  
which is required in both cases, ventilated roof construction  
has an additional ventilation gap between underlay and thermal  
insulation, to *remove* spray and condensate.  
**Ventilated roofs** require additional rafter depth and work properly  
only with a correctly installed vapour barrier and functioning roof  
ventilation. Therefore the building industry commonly prefers  
# unventilated roof construction.  
# Standard build-up of layers  
**Roof coverings, battens** -7 pp. 88-89  
**Underlay** of plastic mesh-reinforced foil or vapour-permeable  
plastic sheeting serves to carry away any spray water or snow  
penetrating under the roof covering.  
**Roof boarding** of tongue and groove boards with applied  
waterproofing \(e.g. welded bitumen sheeting\) is installed instead  
of underlay in conditions of severe exposure.  
The **air gap** in ventilated roof construction serves as an additional  
ventilation layer \(e.g. to remove condensation\). The necessary  
ventilation cross-sections depend on the roof pitch.  
**Thermal insulation** is generally in the form of mineral wool roll  
material and is installed between and under the rafters or as  
prefabricated insulation elements, sometimes with interlocking,  
vapour barrier on the room side and battens fixed to the  
rafters -7 **Cli\).**  
The **vapour barrier** is under the thermal insulation to prevent  
condensation inside the roof construction. When the vapour  
barrier is installed, it is important that all air flow between interior  
and roof construction is prevented. Any penetration points, laps  
and junctions with building elements must be carefully sealed.

# ROOFS  
Flat Roofs  
Flat roofs are defined as roofs with a slope of up to 5%. Flat roofs  
without slope are possible as a special construction in exceptional  
cases. Flat roofs should generally have a minimum slope of 2%.  
On account of unavoidable flatness tolerances and deflection of  
the construction, however, it is recommended to construct flat  
roofs with a minimum slope of 5% \(3°\).  
# Construction  
There are many different structural types for flat roofs. The basic  
difference is between **planar** and **linear** structural systems\:  
**Planar structures** are based on flat elements spanning one or  
two axes, with point or linear supports and loaded at right angles  
to their plane \(e.g. floor slabs, roof slabs, beam grillages, space  
frames\).  
**Linear structures** are systems compns1ng parallel-laid beam  
elements \(e.g. full-web steel beams, trussed beams, cable-trussed  
beams\) and intermediate components not laid in the direction of  
the beam \(e.g. cross-beams with boarding\) to transfer the roof  
loading.  
Both structural types are differentiated into various degrees of  
resolution of the structural elements, in addition to the material\:  
ROOFS  
Roof shapes  
Pitched roofs  
Flat roofs  
Slabs\~o  
Flat roofs are mostly constructed as flat solid reinforced concrete  
slabs. These are fire-resistant, not susceptible to damp and form  
a stable structural system in combination with solid walls.Their  
disadvantage lies in their high dead weight, wet installation and  
poor thermal and sound insulation. Movement resulting from  
thermal expansion, creep or shrinkage must be compensated with  
additional insulation layers and appropriately detailed bearings  
and joints.  
**Truss structures** \~ **0-8**  
Trusses are linear structures. Commercially available truss beams  
can be made of timber, steel or pre-cast reinforced concrete  
with intermediate elements of various materials. Longer spans  
may involve\: truss beams of squared timber or with steel struts,  
laminated timber beams, box beams of plywood or laminated  
timber, specially produced full-web girders with high web plates  
and bracing against buckling, and castellated or lattice beams.  
Additional guying and cable trussing can reduce the cross-section  
of the beams, effecting light and delicate structures.  
**Beam grillages** \~ **0 - 8**  
Beam grillages are planar structures made of wide-span beams  
laid in both directions and crossing in a plane. They are normally  
composed of prefabricated components \(e.g. of laminated timber  
beams with node plates or steel trusses\) and are particularly  
suitable for roofing over industrial sheds etc. If there are fire  
protection requirements, then additional measures must be  
undertaken to protect the structure.  
**Space** frames\~ **0 - 8**  
The space frame is a further development of the beam grillage.  
Steel rods are connected with spherical nodes to form stiff three-  
dimensional structures which require no additional stiffening.

# ROOFS  
Flat Roofs  
There are two methods of building a flat roof from the building  
physics perspective\:  
**Non-ventilated, single-layer construction** \('warm roof'\), in which  
the load-bearing structure, vapour barrier, thermal insulation and  
waterproofing \(including intermediate layers\) form a composite  
element.  
This can either be the conventional construction --\> **Cli\),** or an  
**'upside-down roof' --\> e** \(waterproofing and vapour barrier are  
applied as one layer directly onto the load-bearing construction  
and the closed-cell insulation is loosely laid on top and secured  
with a gravel layer\), or a combination of both construction types  
\(e.g. a **'plus roof'\),** or with **internal insulation--\> 0.**  
**Ventilated two-layer construction** \('cold roof'\), where there is a  
ventilation layer between the waterproofing \(and its sub-structure\)  
and the thermal insulation --\> \(\) - **f\).** The advantage of this  
arrangement \(evaporation of condensation\) is, however, effective

# Roof planting  
The Babylonians were constructing roof gardens and green  
roofs as long ago as the 6th century sc. In Berlin around 1890,  
farmhouses were covered with a layer of soil for fire protection  
purposes, causing plants to grow. In the 20th century, during the  
classic modernist period and with the introduction of flat roofs, the  
almost forgotten green roof was rediscovered.  
# Properties of planted roofs  
1. Insulation, due to the air layer within the plants and the  
growing layer \(corresponding to soil\) with its roots, and also  
through warmth from microbial processes  
2. Sound insulation and thermal storage capacity  
3. Improvement of the air in built-up areas  
4. Improvement of the microclimate  
5. Positive effect on urban rainwater drainage and landscape  
water cycle  
6. Building physics advantages\: UV radiation and severe  
temperature variations are prevented by the protective growing  
and plant layer.  
7. Dust retention  
8. Design element/improved quality of life  
9. Reclamation of green areas

# Slopes for roof planting  
The pitch of gabled roofs should not exceed 25° and flat roofs  
should have a maximum slope of 2-3%.  
# Types of roof planting  
**Intensive\:** The roof becomes a residential garden with features  
like pergolas and loggias. Constant care and maintenance are  
required. Plants\: lawn, shrubs, bushes, trees  
**Extensive\:** The planting is onto thin soil and requires the minimum  
of care. Plants\: moss, grass, herbs, shrubs, bushes  
**Mobile greening\:** Plants in containers can be used for the  
greening of roof terraces, parapets and balconies.  
# Watering  
**Natural watering with rainwater\:** Water is backed up in the  
drainage and growing layers.  
**Dammed watering\:** Rainwater is backed up in the drainage layer  
and mechanically refilled when required.  
**Drip irrigation\:** Drip irrigation hoses in the drainage or growing  
layers keep the plants watered through dry periods.  
**Sprinkler\:** Sprinkler equipment above the growing layer.  
# Plant feeding  
Fertiliser can be applied to the growing layer or as an additive to  
artificial watering.

**Growing layer\:** expanded clay and expanded slate are used.  
These offer structural stability, soil ventilation, water storage and

**Filter layer\:** consisting of filter material, it hinders silting in the

**Drainage layer\:** prevents the plants from becoming waterlogged.  
Material\: woven mats, plastic boards, protective building materials.  
**Protection layer\:** protects during the building phase and against  
point loading.  
**Root protection layer\:** the roots are retained in PVC/ECB and  
EPDM sheeting.  
**Separation layer\:** separates the load-bearing construction from  
the roof greening.  
Examples **-70 - Ci\)** show common layer structures for roof  
greening. Before planting, check that the roof is in perfect  
condition and that each layer can fulfil its function. Carefully  
inspect the technical condition of the roof surface. Pitched roofs  
can also be greened -7 **0** - @, but this demands yet more

# WINDOWS  
Requirements  
The window, as an element built into the wall, has essential  
functions apart from just closing the opening. It controls the level  
of natural lighting, the supply and extraction of air to and from  
the room, and the view out for connection with the world. These  
functions can also be fulfilled by separate elements\: overhead  
lights, ventilation flaps and shop windows, respectively.  
The size and location of windows in rooms, in addition to the  
requirements under building regulations and the rules for daylight  
in interiors \(see Daylight *--t* pp. 488 ff.\), are determined above  
all by architectural considerations. Their external impact has a  
decisive influence on the appearance of the fagade. Important  
factors are\: the location in the wall, with internal windows  
emphasising the wall depth and external windows allowing the  
wall to present as a surface; the proportions of width to height;  
the ratio of construction thickness to glass area \(visible frame,  
casements and possibly glazing bar widths\); and the relationship  
to other fagade elements \(which is often neglected when  
replacing windows\).  
In the interior, windows are responsible for light direction, which  
is essential for the architectural effect of a room. Most decisive  
is the location on plan, which may have to be supplemented  
by sun shading equipment or light directing glass. The type of  
opening determines the functional quality as a ventilation element.  
How far do the casements open into the room? Is the window  
sill still usable when the window is open? \(Tilted windows are  
not sufficient for through ventilation! They ensure only the slow  
cooling of a room.\) There may also be specific requirements for fire  
protection or for resistance against break-in or damage. Resistance  
classes *--t* pp. 107, 118. If the window serves as an escape route,  
it must have a clear opening of at least 0.9 x 1.2 m and a sill height  
of max. 1.2 m above floor level.  
In the Netherlands, regulations stipulate the sizes of windows in  
relation to the angle of incidence of the light.  
# Refurbishment  
If windows are replaced by those with better thermal insulation,  
then the installation demands particular attention. There is a  
danger with improved windows that condensation may occur  
at other less well-insulated locations \(window reveals, outside  
corners of rooms\), which can lead to mould formation! In order not  
to impair the appearance of the fagade and the entrance of light,  
the dimensions of the panes should not be altered \(pay attention  
to frames, casements and glazing bar width *--t* **0\).**  
# Residential construction  
The minimum requirement for structural window apertures in  
occupied rooms is specified in the state building regulations and is  
1/8 or 1/10 ofthe plan area of the room. Further design constraints  
are the distance from buildings opposite \(shadow formation\) and  
the requirements of the energy saving regulation EnEV. In order  
to optimise the energy balance, the criteria for workrooms can be  
applied.  
# Workrooms  
The required window area can be roughly worked out using  
the following rules. The total width of all visual connections  
to the outside must be at least 1/1 0 of the total width of all  
walls, according to workplace guidelines *--t* **0.** Possible visual  
connection to the outside should be at eye level \(window sill  
heights of 0.85 -1.25 m\) *--t* p. 96 **0 - 0.** For workrooms more  
than 3.5 m high, the glass area of the window must be at least  
30% of the outside wall area *--t* **e.** For rooms with dimensions  
corresponding to those of residential rooms, the minimum height  
of the glass area is 1.3 m.  
With the increasing use of existing sources of energy, the  
optimisation of thermal losses and gains and the control of light  
through windows merit a separate design prepared by experts.

Various forms of window according to type of casement --7  
0 and type of frame --7 0 are shown opposite. The stringent  
Double window as  
requirements for windows \(thermal and sound insulation\) result in  
box window  
a multitude of window types and constructions. The location of  
the window in the wall is a significant design feature of the fa9ade.  
The arrangement of the insulation and any sun protection are also  
important --7 0. An impact pane \(external, no closing function\)  
serves, like double fa9ade systems, as wind protection for the  
sun protection system and enables natural ventilation in strong  
wind and rain. A staggered layout of window and insulation planes  
should be avoided if possible, because it leads to expensive and  
defect-prone insulation and weatherproofing construction. The  
permissible dimensional tolerances for window and door openings  
up to 3m long are max. 12 mm and, for elements up to 6 m, max.  
16mm.  
External windows and French windows of heated rooms must  
be constructed with at least insulating or double glazing. The  
thermal transmittance \(U-value\) of windows in new buildings  
must, according to EnEV 2009, be determined together with  
a survey of the whole building. Solar gains are included in the  
calculation --7 p. 474 ff. For new installations, replacement and  
renewal in existing buildings, the values according to --7 9 are  
to be observed. In addition, windows, French windows and roof  
windows have to comply with requirements for airtightness and  
minimum air change --7 0.

# WINDOWS  
Sound Insulation  
In order to improve the sound insulation of windows, a number of  
glass layers are installed behind each other. To reduce the reciprocal  
effect of resonance, different glass thicknesses are combined \(e.g.  
4/8 mm; 6/12 mm\). The greater the distance between the panes,  
the better is the sound insulation. Further improvements can be  
gained from the separation of the frame and the sound-absorbing  
construction of the resulting wrap-around window surround. Box-  
type windows, even with only single glazing, have better sound  
insulation values than double-glazed windows.  
If the requirements for sound insulation are *very* high, then suitably  
sound-insulated ventilation equipment must also be provided,  
because the sound insulation is only effective with the windows  
closed.

Loft Windows  
The required quality of living is decisive for the determination of  
window size in inhabited loft spaces. Building regulations require  
a minimum window area of *Va* of the floor area for living rooms  
--7 \(\(\). Large windows make these rooms more comfortable. The  
window widths in secondary rooms can be chosen according to  
the distance between the rafters.  
Generously wide windows in living rooms can be achieved  
through the installation of rafter trimmers and additional rafters.  
Steeper roofs need shorter windows, while flatter roofs require  
longer windows.  
Loft windows can be joined using flashing --7 **G** and can be  
arranged horizontally or vertically in rows or window groups.

Skylights and Dome Rooflights  
Domes, skylights, coffers, smoke vents and louvres, as fixed or  
movable units, can be used for lighting and ventilation, and for  
clearing smoke from rooms, halls, stair wells etc.  
By positioning dome rooflights facing north sunshine and glare are  
avoided -7 **0.** Glare from low sun can be avoided by the use of a  
high curb -7 **0** Dome rooflights used for ventilation should face  
into the prevailing wind in order to utilise the extraction capacity of  
the wind. The inlet aperture should be 20% smaller than the outlet  
aperture. Forced ventilation, with an air flow of 150-1000 m3/h, can  
be achieved by fitting a fan into the curb of a skylight -7 **f\).** Dome  
rooflights can also be used for access to the roof.  
Attention should be given to the aerodynamic extraction surfaces  
of smoke exhaust systems. Orientating each extraction unit at an  
angle of 90° from the adjacent one will allow for wind coming from  
all directions. Position to leeward/windward if pairs of extraction  
fans are to be mounted in line with or against the direction of the  
prevailing wind.  
Smoke extraction vents are required for stairwells more than four  
complete storeys high. Variable skylight aperture widths up to  
5.50 m are available, as is a special version up to 7.50 m wide  
which does not need extra support,  
Skylight systems offer diffused room lighting which is free from  
glare -7 **G\).** North-facing saw-tooth skylights with spun glass fibre  
inlays guarantee all the climatically important advantages of a full  
workshop space -7 @\).

Basics  
# Transparent, translucent building materials  
For the determination of size, colour, window dimensions  
and lighting of rooms, knowledge of the visual transmittance,  
dispersion and reflection characteristics of glass materials are  
important for their artistic and economic effect.  
**Light-reflecting materials** are able to demonstrate directional,  
completely dispersed or incompletely dispersed reflection and  
transparent materials directional -+ **0,** dispersed -+ **f\)** and mixed  
transmittance -+ **e.**  
Note that frosted glasses, which are internally opaque \(which is  
preferable because they become less dirty\), absorb less light than  
externally opaque glasses.  
# Manufacture  
Glass is drawn in a mechanical process and leaves the drawing  
machine in a condition ready for use without further processing.  
The glass is clear and translucent, colourless and of uniform  
thickness. The surface is flat on both sides and fire-polished. The  
basic composition of float glasses varies slightly due to the origin  
of the raw materials used. This has practically no effect on the  
physical properties. Colour values and visual and energy \(heat\)  
transmittance can be exceptions. Tinted glasses are made with  
the addition of various metallic oxides. The possible spectrum of  
colours is very limited. A greater variety of colours and patterns  
can be produced by enamel, which is applied to the surface  
using a screen-printing process. These can only be applied to  
toughened safety glass.  
Glass panes which are inclined at more than 1 oo from the vertical  
are considered as roofing glass on account of the additional  
loadings \(self-weight, snow, wind and climatic loads\) and are  
subject to the 'Technical regulations for the use of glazing  
with linear support' \(TRLV\) of the DIBt \(German Institute for  
Construction Technology\).  
# Properties  
Glass is physically a super-cooled liquid. It is a brittle material,  
which can bear high compression stresses, but the tension  
strength is only about 1/10 of the compressive strength. If the  
limits of elasticity are exceeded by mechanical or thermal stresses,  
it breaks. Normal glass then breaks into jagged pieces of various  
sizes, which can be dangerous.  
Different processes can be used to adapt the properties of glass  
for the most varied requirements.  
Tempering of the sheets produces a basic stress in the glass,  
which increases its tension and bending strength -+ **0.** If the glass  
breaks, this pre-stress causes it to shatter into blunt fragments  
**\(toughened safety glass\).** Coatings can be applied to change  
the transmittance or the reflection of defined wavelengths \(e.g.  
thermally insulated glazing\).  
Two or more panes can be combined with an intermediate layer  
to fulfil the most varied functions. Tear-resistant foils can prevent  
glass splinters falling out **\(laminated glass-+** p. 1 06 **0\),** and many  
layers make glazing resistant to breaking. Printed intermediate  
layers offer a range of colourful and graphic design possibilities.  
Special fillings can hinder the transmittance of unwanted thermal  
radiation \(fire protection glazing-+ p. 111\). *ItA*

# GLASS  
Insulated Glazing  
# Simple double glazing  
Double-glazed units normally consist of two panes. These are  
connected at the edge with an air-tight and gas-tight spacer.  
A considerable improvement in the coefficient of thermal  
conductivity \(U-value\) has been achieved through special  
coating of the panes. Such thermally insulating and solar control  
glazing has, since the introduction in Germany of the Insulation  
Regulations in 1995 and the Energy Saving Regulations \(EnEV\)  
in 2002, replaced uncoated glazing on account of its improved  
coefficients of thermal conductivity. Only in isolated cases does  
the calculation according to EnEV permit the use of normal  
double-glazed units.  
Current types of glass with their optical features and the current  
construction physics properties and maximum sizes can be  
taken from the information provided by the glass industry. The  
combination with any kind of wire glass or tinted cast glass causes  
stress in the glass in direct sunshine and can lead to breakages,  
and so should be avoided. In addition, the glass dimensions and  
the selection of the construction of the double glazing should take  
into account all current standards, the technical regulations for the  
use of glazing with linear support and secured against falling out,  
glazing guidelines and workplace regulations. Only products with  
general technical approval should be used.  
# Thermally insulating double-glazed units  
Thermally insulating double-glazed units are neutral in appear-  
ance and transparency, so that they look similar to simple dou-  
ble-glazed units. The low coefficients of thermal conductivity  
\(U9-value\) are achieved through a coating of precious metal in  
position 3. Because the coatings applied to thermal insulation  
glass show low emissivity, this is often described as low-E glaz-  
ing. Filling with inert gas can produce a further improvement of  
the coefficient of thermal conductivity. These units have high  
visual and overall energy \(heat\) transmittance in order to make  
the greatest possible part of the solar radiation available for pas-  
sive energy gain. If the thermal insulation coating is applied to  
position 2, then the overall energy passing through is reduced.  
The visual impression can show slight differences, particularly if  
units are directly next to each other.

fulfils all current requirements for high-quality insulated glazing.  
Solar control units are normally labelled with a pair of values,  
which show firstly the visual transmittance and secondly the  
overall energy transmittance as percentages. Solar control units  
can be delivered with various grades of colour and reflection as  
seen from outside.  
\~  
In order to select the optimal coloration of glass, sample panes  
should be requested from the manufacturer of the solar control  
glass. Absolute conformity of colour in the external elevation is not  
practically possible to produce, particularly when replacements  
are ordered. The mirror image of highly reflecting glazing can be  
distorted by imperfections in flatness.  
The view of colour from inside to outside is insignificantly falsified.  
If the view is compared directly with the view through an open  
window, a slight toning will be recognised. This toning can be  
more apparent for some types of solar control glass.

It can be clearly seen that the isotherms  
with the improved spacers lie closer to the  
bottom of the glass, which shows that the  
glass is warmer on the room side so that  
less condensation will be created at the  
edge of the double-glazed unit, or none  
at all.

# \\

# \\  
Model panes are described with sketches and dimensioned  
according to the system in -7 **0.** For acute angles of less than  
30°, at the top a blunt edge of at least 10 mm is required. Smaller  
panes \(\:;;;60 em edge length\) should be avoided because these  
have a higher risk of breakage and the edge seal can tend to leak  
due to the reduced elasticity of the panes.  
Thermally improved spacers  
The Energy Saving Regulations \(EnEV\) and more stringent  
standards and guidelines have resulted in the increased  
significance of thermally improved spacers. The thermal properties  
of the spacers may be taken into account in the new verification  
process under EnEV. This improvement is, however, not reflected  
in the U9-value, but 1Jf is additionally applied as lengthwise heat  
transmittance and is thus reflected in the official verification.  
This improved thermal insulation in the critical transition from  
glass to window frame results in higher surface temperatures  
on the room side than with the use of conventional aluminium  
spacers. This results in less or even no condensation, which  
always forms at the coldest point under unfavourable conditions,  
like for example high air humidity -7 **f\).** For windows with wooden  
frames, the harmful effects of damp and the danger of mould are  
reduced.  
Light deflection and solar control in the space between the  
panes  
Various light deflection systems can be installed in the space  
between the panes of insulated glazing -7 **0.** Rigid light control  
elements use reflection and dispersion to allow diffused light into  
the room and shield direct sunlight according to the position of the  
sun, or direct it deep into the room. Sunshading blinds, which can  
either be rotated or completely raised, are protected from dirt by  
the location between the panes. They can be operated manually or  
electrically. The panes of glass at each side must be of toughened  
glass, because increased stresses could be caused by the heat.  
The width of the space between the panes varies from 20 to  
27 mm according to construction.  
Thermal insulation between the panes  
Transparent thermal insulation -7 **0** enables high thermal  
insulation values at the same time as high heat transmission  
\(heat trap\). These systems diffuse the light passing through to  
varying extents. Glass or plastic tubes can be used, installed at  
right angles to the glass surface. They reflect the light further into  
the inside of the room and hinder air movement when the gap  
between the panes is large. Units with more panes, or filled with  
foam particles, reflect more light externally. Transparent thermal  
insulation elements need effective shading in summer. They are  
mostly used for heat-storage walls.  
Self-cleaning coating on the weather side  
Various glass manufacturers offer self-cleaning coatings in position  
1 \(-7 p. 1 05\) of insulated glazing. This coating results in a slight  
alteration of the colour and also a slight influence on the visual and  
energy values compared to standard. The coatings can be applied  
to thermal insulation and solar control glazing and also on fagade  
panels; it will be necessary to request further information from the  
manufacturer. The manufacturer's cleaning instructions are to be  
observed absolutely.

Switching units are conditioned during production so that they

These composite units react with alterations of temperature  
by changing from clear \(transparent\) to opaque \(diffuse\). This  
is achieved with a mixture of two components with different  
refraction properties, which align their structures differently  
according to temperature, altering the refraction of the layer. The  
alteration is reversible.  
# Electrochromatic units  
The transmittance of these units can be altered by applying a  
voltage to the reactive layer. For internal use, this can be achieved  
with the use of liquid crystals in the space between the panes  
\(LC foils function reliably only between -40°C and +40°C\). Other  
systems make use of the property of some materials to alter their  
visual transmittance and coloration with the absorption or release  
of ions \(by applying a voltage\). These units are suitable for external  
glazing.  
**CAST GLASS**  
# Properties  
Cast glass is produced mechanically by rolling certain surface  
structures. It is not clear to look through. Cast glass is used for  
applications where obscure glass is required \(bathroom, WC\) and  
as a design element. Ornamental glass is available as white and  
tinted, raw white glass, and white and tinted ornamental wired  
glass. Wired glasses are no longer classified as safety glass, with  
exceptions when used in overhead glazing.  
Most cast glasses can be further processed to make toughened  
glass, laminated safety glass and thermally insulated glazing  
units. The structure is normally faced to the outside in order to  
ensure a proper edge joint. If the glass is only lightly structured,  
the structured side can be faced inwards in order to simplify  
cleaning. Tinted cast glass cannot be used in combination with  
tinted classes like float glass, toughened glass or laminated safety  
glass, nor with coated glass with thermal insulation or solar control  
functions.  
# GLASS DOORS  
# Whole glass doors  
The dimensions of doors correspond to the dimensions of metal  
door linings \~ **0.** They can be installed in all the metal door  
linings produced to DIN 18111 standard. The doors are made of  
toughened glass panes. If violently smashed, the glass crumbles  
into a network of small fragments, which more or less stay  
loosely together. The normal glass thicknesses of 10 or 12 mm  
comply with the structural requirements. Structured cast glass  
and printable toughened float glass panes are available. Printable  
laminated safety glass panes can also be supplied \(the composite  
glass foil is printed\).  
**Whole glass door elements** consist of one or more glass doors,  
the side elements and the fanlight. Further possibilities are sliding,  
folding, segmented arch, and round arch door elements. Various  
tints and glass structures are available, and standard or special  
sizes. 250 lsr2 I I6o K22/60/7

# GLASS  
Profiled Glass  
Profiled glass is a cast glass produced with a U-shaped profile.  
It is translucent with an ornamentation on the outside surface of  
the profile, and conforms to the properties of cast glass. It has  
low maintenance requirements. It is suitable for lift shafts and  
roof glazing. Rooms using this glass for fenestration are rendered  
glare free. Heat-absorbing glasses Reglit and Profilit 'Plus 1.7' are  
coated with metallic oxides and attain aUg-value of 1.8 W/m2K.  
Solar control glass \(Type R, "Bernstein'; Type P, 'Antisol'\), which  
reflects and/or absorbs ultra-violet and infra-red radiation, can be  
used to protect delicate goods from UV radiation. The transmission  
of radiant energy into the room is reduced, as is the convection  
from the glazing, whilst the light transmission is maintained.  
For glazing subject to impacts, e.g. in of sports halls \(ball throwing  
safety\), Reglit SP2 or Profilit K22/60/7 without wire reinforcement  
should be used.  
Regulit and Profilit are allowed as fire-glass with a fire resistance  
class of G30. Normal and special profiles are also available with  
longitudinal wires.

Glass Blocks  
Glass blocks are hollow units which consist of two sections  
melted and pressed together, thereby creating a sealed air cavity.  
Both surfaces can be made smooth and transparent, or very  
ornamental and almost opaque. Glass blocks can be obtained in  
different sizes, coated on the inside or outside, uncoated, or made  
of coloured glass. They can be used internally and externally, e.g.  
transparent screen walls and room dividers \(also in gymnastic or  
sports halls\), windows, lighting strips, balcony parapets and terrace  
walls. Glass blocks are fire-resistant up to G60, G120 or F60 when  
used as a cavity wall with a maximum uninterrupted area of 3.5 m2  
,  
and can be built either vertically or horizontally. They are used as  
building elements, but cannot be load-bearing. Their properties\:  
good sound and thermal insulation; high light transmittance \(up to  
82%\); transparent, translucent, diffusing and low-glare according  
to decor; increased impact resistance. The thermal insulation  
of a glass block wall\: with cement mortar U9 -value = 3.2 W/m2K,  
with lightweight mortar U9 = 2.9 W/m2 K, with special bricks up to  
U9 = 1.5 W/m2 K.

# Sound reduction  
Because of its weight, a glass block wall has particularly good  
sound insulation properties\:  
1.00 kN/m2 for 80 mm glass blocks  
1.25 kN/m2 for 100 mm glass blocks  
1.42 kN/m2 for special BSH glass blocks.  
To be effective, the surrounding building elements must have  
at least the same sound reduction characteristics. Glass block  
construction is the ideal solution in all cases where good reduction  
is required. In areas where a high level of sound reduction is  
necessary, economical solutions can be achieved by using glass  
block walls to provide the daylight, while keeping ventilation  
openings and windows. These can serve as secondary escape  
routes if they conform to the minimum allowable size.  
DIN 4109 should be complied with. The weighted sound reduction  
measurement R'w is determined according to DIN 52210--+ **0\:**  
Rw = airborne sound insulation margin +52 dB  
Single-skin glass block construction fulfils the requirements of  
sound insulation class 5--+ **0.**  
# Glass blocks with steel reinforcement  
The fire-resistant glazing of glass blocks can, like all other glass  
block walls, be built with and without U-profiles, and all the  
possible connections are in principle identical. Because of the  
strong linear expansion in case of fire and the release of smoke,  
glass block walls are bedded all round with mineral fibre. --+ **0.**  
Fire resistance classes up to G 120 or F 60 can be achieved,  
depending on the construction and the manufacturer.  
# FIRE PROTECTION GLASS  
Normal glass is of limited suitability for fire protection. In case of  
fire, the action of heat on one side can cause float glass panes to  
burst very quickly and large broken pieces to fall out, which can  
result in the fire spreading. The required fire resistance classes for  
exposed glazing will be laid down in the building permission. The  
following fire resistance classes are defined\:  
G30,G60,G90,G120,G180  
F30, F60, F90, F120, F180  
T30,T60, T90, T120, T180  
# Fire resistance classes 'G' and 'F'  
'G glasses' must prevent flames or combustion gases passing  
through for a certain duration of fire \(e.g. G30 = 30 minutes\). There  
must be an official technical approval for all 'G glazing', including  
the installation details. Heat radiation may, however, be transmitted  
by this glazing, which restricts the possible applications. Such  
glazing is not permissible for emergency exits.  
There are three possibilities for construction of G glazing\:  
Wired glass with spot-welded mesh  
Elaborate special toughened glass combinations in composite  
isolated glazing  
Pre-stressed borosilicate glass, like Pyran.  
F glazing has to prevent the transmission of heat radiation, in  
addition to stopping smoke and fire. This is achieved by using  
special composite glass panes with a gel layer, which foam or can  
absorb energy through evaporation effects and can thus prevent  
radiated heat passing through the pane. The pane and also its  
connection to the framed construction and adjacent construction  
elements all have to possess technical approval valid under  
building regulations.  
Construction fire protection can be evaluated only in combination  
with the adjacent building elements \(Fire Protection chapter --+

# Radar damping  
Radar reflection damping is a requirement of German Air Traffic  
Control \(DFS\), applying to the fa\<;\:ades of all larger buildings in  
the vicinity of airports. The purpose is to suppress the reflection  
of radar signals, which can occur from large fa\<;\:ade surfaces,  
because these reflected signals can lead to false information on  
the radar screens of air traffic controllers and thus endanger air  
traffic.  
Special coatings can be used to achieve high damping through  
absorption and phase-delayed overlaying \(interference\) of the  
radar signal hitting and being reflected from the insulated glazing.  
Because of the particular requirements for insulated glazing,  
the glass structure must be specifically calculated for every  
application. Light and energy values are determined in each  
case by the glass structure. The level of radar damping required  
depends on many factors, including the size of the building and its  
distance from and orientation to the radar equipment.  
A radar report is generally to be commissioned for each building  
from an accredited institute in order to determine the required radar  
damping. The glass manufacturers develop a glass structure and  
this is then discussed with the institute. All other fa\<;\:ade surfaces  
have to be investigated for this report as well, in order to take the  
necessary measures into account for construction.

Curtain Walling  
# Cold fa9ades  
A cold fagade is a single skin curtain walling construction with a  
ventilated cavity at the rear, width approx. 40 em, and single- or  
double-glazed external cladding panels. Sufficient and controlled  
heat dissipation must be guaranteed. The fagade panels can be  
fixed all round, on two sides or at points according to official  
standards and guidelines. Technical approval is required for panels  
fixed at points, or a special-case approval has to be applied for.  
The fa\<;\:ade panels can be fully colour-coated on the back or  
partially printed by the screen-printing process. Special coatings  
are available from the various manufacturers in order to achieve  
colour matching with solar control glass. Samples are necessary  
to ensure a correct colour match. All visible edges must be finely  
ground and polished and non-visible edges must be ground.  
# Warm fa9ade without ventilation at rear  
The warm fa\<;\:ade can consist of post and rail curtain walling or  
storey-height curtain walling elements. In both cases, the non-  
transparent parts or parapets have a glass panel. The construction  
of the external panel can be, for example, an external fagade  
panel with the necessary thermal insulation behind it, thickness  
in accordance with EnEV, and an internal layer, which is sealed  
against diffusion of water vapour, e.g. aluminium sheet.  
Mixed forms can be constructed, if an additional glass layer is  
set in front of the warm curtain wall in order to create a two-  
dimensional appearance \(see below\). If the panel remains the layer  
that drains water, then this is still a warm fagade.  
# Flush glass curtain wall  
This structural glazing fagade is characterised by a uniform flat  
appearance. A full-surface glass appearance is possible only if the  
panes are glued to metal frames. The system used must possess  
technical approval or special case approval. The structural sealing  
must be carried out with a material \(e.g. Dow Corning GmbH  
Technical Approval No. Z-70. '1-75\) that possesses general  
technical approval valid under building regulations.  
In Germany, all fagades over 8 min height must have an additional  
mechanical fixing of the panes. All insulated glazing must have a  
UV-resistant edge seal.  
# Curtain walling with fire-resistant glass  
F fire-resistant glazing has only limited practicality for external  
use, because the foaming fire-protection layer cannot be heated  
over 50-60°C. This is only possible to guarantee for fagades  
subject to direct sunshine if effective sun shading is provided and  
guaranteed.  
# Sun screens  
Sun screens are normally used as additional external transparent  
sun shading layers. They consist of metallic oxide-coated  
toughened glass panes. When installing sun screens, the coating  
should always be on the weather side. Sun screens can, according  
to official standards and guidelines, be fixed all round, on two  
sides or at points. Technical approval is required for panels fixed  
at points, or a special-case approval must be applied for. **0** Generally appropriate arrangement

# Standard dimensions  
Dimensions of wall openings for doors\~ **0** are **standard modular**  
**dimensions.** If, in exceptional cases, different dimensions  
are required then their modular dimensions should be whole  
multiples of 125 mm \(1 00 mm according to British Standards\). A  
wall opening with 875 mm width and 2000 mm height \(modular  
dimensions\) can be described as\: wall opening DIN 18100- 875 x  
2000. In order to determine the door width, the frame detail has to  
be taken into account in the calculation of the structural opening,  
because some variants offer interesting creative possibilities of  
reducing the clear opening width by more than standard cased  
doors on account of the thickness of their construction \~ \(\) - **G.**  
**Frame construction**  
In the specification of a classic frame construction, in addition to the  
consideration of the differing constructional thicknesses \(difference  
between structural opening and clear pass-through dimension\), the  
different variants of **rebated frame \(UK\) or rebated door and frame**  
**\(German\)** have to be taken into account, together with the location of  
the door in the wall. For plain doors in rebated frames \~ €!\), the quality  
of construction is important, because inaccuracies in the frame or in  
hanging the door will immediately be clearly visible. The joint between  
frame and wall surface can only remain in order in the long term if a  
shadow joint is specified, because otherwise the transition from wall to  
door frame will become disarranged with the first redecoration at the  
**Lining dimensions**  
latest. Architraves can only solve this problem until the first redecoration.

Locking Systems  
# Mechanical locking systems  
Cylinder locks offer great security, because unlocking using tools  
is almost impossible. Cylinders can be supplied as required with  
extensions by multiples of 5 mm on either side to match the  
particular door thickness.  
# Locking systems  
When a locking system is designed and ordered, a diagram is  
produced with the associated security certificate. Replacement  
keys can be delivered only on production of this certificate.  
# Central locking systems  
One key locks the entrance door to a flat and all general and also  
central doors, e.g. yard, cellar, or front door. Suitable for blocks of  
flats or houses on estates.  
# Hierarchical master key locking system  
Master keys can lock many cylinders across the entire system.  
The system can reflect the structure of access rights in a company.  
Each cylinder has its own key pattern and can be locked only by  
its own key and by any master keys also intended to open it. For  
sensitive locations which should be considered in the building  
design see ---7 **e**  
# Electronic access control systems  
The main disadvantages of mechanical locking systems are the  
impossibility of altering the lock hierarchy and the inconvenience  
which results if a master key is lost \(replacement of cylinders  
is expensive\). With electronic access systems, right of access  
can be assigned or deleted at short notice without having  
to replace building components. Mechatronic cylinders also  
permit the upgrading of an existing locking systems without  
wiring it. Elaborate electronic access control systems can  
make possible the networking of personal identification, access  
rights according to area and time, and also the recording of  
working time ---7 **0 + 0.**  
Code locks are also used in private buildings to permit access  
to anyone who knows the number combination. ·Entitled people  
like postmen, tradesmen, suppliers etc. can obtain access without  
problems.  
# Emergency exits and panic doors  
Since 2004, there have been various requirements for the  
construction of ironmongery for emergency exits and panic  
doors. These doors must be tested, approved and labelled as a  
complete system.  
**Emergency exits** are provided in buildings and areas which are  
not open to the public and where people familiar with the location  
understand the function of the escape doors.  
**Panic doors** are used in buildings and areas which are open to  
the public and in which people familiar with the location do not  
understand the function of the escape doors.

Security of Buildings and Grounds  
The term 'security technology' covers all devices used for defence  
against criminal danger to the body, life, or valuables. In reality, all  
parts of a building can be penetrated, even those made of steel  
and reinforced concrete. The need for security should be identified  
by an in-depth study of vulnerable areas, with an estimate of costs  
and benefits.  
The police will advise on on the choice of security and monitoring  
system equipment.  
**Mechanical protection devices** are construction measures  
which provide mechanical resistance to an intruder. These can  
only be overcome by the use of force, which will leave physical  
traces behind.  
An important consideration is the effectiveness of this resistance.  
Such measurements are necessary in blocks of flats at the  
entrance doors, windows and cellar entrances; and in business  
premises the display windows, entrances, other windows and  
skylights. Mechanical protection devices include steel grilles,  
either fixed or as roller grilles over the building's apertures and  
ventilation openings, secure roller shutters, secure locks, chains  
and light shafts. Wire and steel thread inserts in glass can retard  
breaking in and acrylic and polycarbonate window panes offer  
enhanced protection.  
**Electrical security devices will** automatically set off an alarm if  
any unauthorised entry to the protected premises or access to  
monitored rooms is attempted. An important consideration is the  
time taken from when the alarm is triggered until the arrival of  
security staff or the police.  
**1\. Burglar and attack alarm systems** help to monitor and protect  
people and property.  
They cannot prevent intruders entering premises, but should  
give the earliest possible warning of such an attempt. Optimum  
security can therefore only be achieved by mechanical protection  
and the sensible installation of burglar alarm systems. Surveillance  
measures include surveillance of external envelope, of each  
room, and of individual objects, plus case by case security and  
emergency calls.  
**Fire alarm systems** give an early warning of danger, and enable  
direct calls for help in case of fire and/or recognise and report fire  
at an early stage. Fire alarms serve to protect life and property.  
**2. Open-air surveillance systems** monitor areas outside enclosed  
rooms. They serve to protect a building against events in the  
vicinity or in the surrounding open area, which normally extends  
to cover the property boundary. They consist of mechanical and  
construction, electronic detection and/or organisational/personnel  
measures. Their purpose is legal definition, deterrence, prevention,  
delay, early warning, detection of persons, vehicles, observation,  
identification, sabotage attempts, spying.  
Construction measures may feature building work, fences, ditches,  
walls, barriers, gates, access control, lighting. Electrical work  
may includes control centre, detectors, sensors, video/television,  
access control systems, alarming of next level PO/telemetry  
exchange/telephone dialler/radio. Organisational measures may  
concern personnel, observation, supervision, security, security

3\. Goods security  
systems, also called shop-  
lifting prevention systems,  
are electronic systems that  
serve to prevent theft and  
the unauthorised and illegal  
removal of goods from a  
controlled room or area in  
normal daily use.  
\~  
4. Access control systems\:  
electronic access control  
works together with mech-  
anical elements to permit  
or refuse access to a  
building, room or zone  
through an identity check .  
This is done by electroni-  
cally testing the personal  
identity or by checking  
the authorisation on site.  
Combination of an access  
control with a time recor-  
ding system is technically  
possible. \~ p. 117  
5. Remote control systems  
enable data transmission/  
exchange between two  
remote locations over  
public telephone, mobile  
phone or Internet. They are  
used for remote monito-  
ring, measurement, control,  
diagnosis, regulation and  
remote querying of infor-  
mation, data and condition  
of one object in relation to  
another.  
6\. Surveillance systems\:  
observation, control, recor-  
ding of occurrences and  
events using camera and  
monitor, manually and/or  
automatically, inside and  
outside buildings, any time  
of day or night and 365  
days of the year.  
7. Lift emergency system  
can be used in passenger  
lifts and goods lifts. Lift  
emergency systems ensure  
the safety of the users of  
lifts and are mainly intended  
to enable the rescue of  
trapped people, who have  
direct voice communication  
with a constantly manned  
emergency centre, respon-  
sible for rescue.

# STAIRS  
Principles  
Various calculations and dimen-  
sional requirements for the con-  
struction of stairs appear in national  
building regulations and stan-  
dards. In the UK, British Stand-  
ards and the building regulations  
should be consulted \(see Approved  
Document K\). For workplaces, the  
regulations of the relevant health  
and safety body are to be observed.  
According to German standards,  
residential buildings with no more  
than two flats must have a usable  
stair width min. 0.80 m, 17/28 riser  
to tread ratio, stairs not deemed by  
building regulations to be legally  
essential \(as fire escape routes\)  
0.50 m, 21/21 but legally essential  
stairs 1.00 m, 17/28, high-rise flats  
1.25 m width. Stair width in public  
buildings is calculated according  
to the required evacuation time ---7  
p. 318 \(Stadiums\).  
Length of runs on legally essential  
stairs is \~3 steps up to \~18  
steps ---7 **0,** landing length = *n*  
times length of stride + 1 depth of  
tread \(e.g. riser to tread 17/29 =  
1 x 63 + 29 = 92 em or 2 x 63 +  
29 = 1.55 m\). Doors opening into  
the stairwell must not obstruct  
the stair width. The 18-step rule  
is a 'should' regulation. For stairs  
intended to be prestigious the  
requirement to provide landings is  
mitigated.

All stairs without landings, whatever the type, cover practically the same surface area; curving of the steps only varies the  
distance between the bottom and top of the stairs. From the architectural point of view, therefore, only straight or curving stairs  
should be used. The latter have the advantage that the bottom and top stairs at storey levels lie above one another

Regulations  
The experience of using  
stairs and access routes is  
very varied\: from the creative  
possibilities of the most  
diverse residential stairs to an  
elaborate outside staircase,  
which one can stride up and  
down. Climbing stairs takes  
on average seven times the  
energy input as walking on the  
flat. From the physiological  
point of view, the best use  
of 'climbing effort' is at a  
stair pitch of 30° and a ratio  
of riser \(r\) to tread \(t\) of 17 *I*  
29. The pitch is determined  
by the stride length of an  
adult \(approx. 59-65 em\). In  
order to determine a suitable  
pitch with the lowest energy  
requirement, this formula  
applies\: 2 *r* + *t* = 59-65 em.  
For determining the dimen-  
sions and form of stairs,  
their overall functional and  
design purpose is just as  
important as the relation-  
ships described above. Not  
just changing level is impor-  
tant, but how the level is  
changed. For outside stairs,  
low steps are preferable, with  
dimensions of 12 x 41 to 16  
x 30 em. Stairs in offices or  
emergency stairs should, in  
contrast, make it possible to  
change level quickly. All main  
staircases must be enclosed  
in a continuous stairwell,  
which is designed and ar-  
ranged so that, including its  
access routes and exit to the  
open air, it can safely be used  
for escape. Exit width should  
be \~ stair width.  
Every location in inhabited  
rooms and basements must  
be \~35 m from the stairwell of  
at least one legally essential  
stairway or exit. If a number  
of stairways are necessary,  
then they should be arranged  
so that the escape route is  
as short as possible. Any  
openings from stairwells  
into cellars, uninhabited roof  
spaces, workshops, shops,  
storerooms, and similar must  
be fitted with self-closing  
doors with a fire resistance  
rating of 30 minutes.

Construction  
# Step profile  
For stairs in buildings subject to  
disability-friendly building rules,  
steps may have no nosing! In  
order to avoid ugly streaks of  
rubbed-off shoe polish on the  
risers of vertical stairs --7 **0,**  
profiles with an undercut riser  
are better, and this produces  
more tread surface. For a  
tread width \<260 mm --7 **0**  
\(b\), the step is to be undercut  
\~30 mm; this also applies to  
open stairs without risers. A  
human being requires the most  
space at handrail height, and  
considerably less at foot height.  
The stair width here can be  
made narrower in favour of a  
larger stairwell.  
Galleries, mezzanines, balco-  
nies and circle seating in  
theatres must have a protective  
guard rail \(height h\), compulsory  
from 1 m height difference\:  
drop \<12m, *h* = 0.90 m  
drop \<12 m, *h* = 1.00 m for  
workplaces and if the stairwell  
is at least 20 em wide, also for  
over 12m *h.*  
drop \>12m, *h* = 1.10 m  
Loft ladders have a pitch of 45-  
750. If, however, stairs of such a  
pitch are required for operational  
purposes, for example because  
there is not enough space for a  
normal flight, then alternating  
tread \(staggered or samba\)  
stairs may be chosen --7 **e** + \~.  
The risers in an alternating tread  
staircase should be a few as  
possible, the riser height anyway  
\:\:;;20 em. The treads in this case  
are measured \(staggered\) for the  
tread axes a + b --7 \~ of the left  
and right feet.

an approx. 210 em diameter  
aperture in the floor \(min. 80 em  
flight width\); for other buildings  
from approx. 260 em \(min. i .00 m  
flight width\). Spiral staircases  
with less then 80 em of usable  
flight width are permitted only  
as 'legally non-essential stairs'.  
They are suitable for cellars, lofts,  
subsidiary rooms or if a primary  
escape route is already provided.  
Spiral staircases save space  
and can be constructed with  
adequate strength with a newel  
post in the central axis 4 **0-0 .**  
The central axis can also be  
cleared, which leads to an open  
spiral staircase with a stairwell  
4 **4Ji\) - 40-** For spiral staircases,  
the curve can be chosen freely  
within the range laid down  
by regulations. The tread is  
measured at the walking line. In  
the curved part of the walking  
line, the tread is equal to the chord  
resulting from the intersection of  
the curved walking line with the  
leading edge of the step\_

In the UK, construction and operation of escalators is regulated by BS  
EN 115\: 'Safety rules for the construction and installation of escalators  
and passenger conveyors'. In Germany, construction and operation  
of escalators follow the 'Guidelines for escalators and moving  
walkways', ZHI/484, issued by the Association of Commercial  
Accident Insurers. \(The German situation is described below.\)  
Escalators are utilised for the continuous transport of large  
numbers of people \(they do not count as stairs for the purposes of  
building regulations\) and, for example in department stores, have  
a pitch of 30 or 35°. The 35° escalator is more economical because  
it requires less space. For travel heights E\:;6 m, the 30° escalator is  
required . The transportation capacity is about the same for both  
pitches. When installed as part of transport facilities, a pitch of  
27-28° should be used if possible. The pitch is derived from a  
gradient relationship of 16 x 30 em, a comfortable size for a step.  
For the width of steps, there is a worldwide standard of 60 em  
\(I person without hand luggage, no longer permissible in Europe\),  
80 em \(1-2 people\) and 100 em \(2 people\) \~ **8 - 0.** With a  
I 00 em step width, people carrying loads have sufficient room for  
movement. Provide sufficient queuing room at the bottom and top  
of the escalator, E\:;2.50 m deep.  
In department stores, offices and administration buildings, trade  
fair halls and airports, escalator speed is normally no higher than  
0.5 m/s. In underground railway stations and public transport  
facilities, 0.65 m/s is preferred.  
The average distribution of upward traffic in department stores is\:  
fixed stairs 2%, passenger lifts 8%, escalators 90%. Approx. three  
quarters of downward traffic uses the escalators. Although the  
average shopping area for each escalator is 1500 m2 at present,  
this should be lowered to an optimum of 500-700 m2•  
**Escalators in transport facilities.** According to Bostrab  
\('Regulations on the construction and operation of trams'\), there  
are stringent requirements \(function, construction, safety\) for  
pitches 27, 18 and 30°. Dimensions and capacities\~ **0- f\), 0**  
**Length on plan** \~ **0**  
For 30° pitch= 1.732 x storey height  
For 35° pitch = 1.428 x storey height  
Example\: storey height 4.50 m and 30° pitch \(35° is sometimes not  
permissible abroad\), length on plan\: 1.732 x 4.5 = 7.794. With the level  
access and exit areas, this gives a length of approx. 9 m, therefore  
about 20 people can stand on the escalator at the same time. **MOVING WALKWAYS**

Moving walkways, also called conveyors or travelators, are a  
means of transporting pedestrians on the level or at a slight  
gradient. The advantage of a moving walkway is that it can also  
carry prams, wheelchairs, shopping trolleys, bicycles and bulky  
luggage with little danger. At the design stage, the expected traffic  
must be established carefully, so that the equipment can provide  
optimal capacity. The transport capacity depends on the clear  
width, travel speed and occupation density.  
Capacities of 6000-12000 pers/h are possible. Maximum gradient  
of moving walkways is 12o = 21%. Normal travel speeds are 0.5-  
0.6 m/s horizontal; installations with gradients up to 4° are slightly  
faster at 0.75 m/s. Short moving walkways are about 30 m long.  
Long moving walkways can be built up to a length of 250 m. To  
enable entry and access at the right time, it is good to design a  
number of short moving walkways.  
The advantage of two-directional moving walkways is that the  
horizontal return route of the walking surface, -" **0-4I!\),** requires a lower  
construction height of 180 mm, in contrast to *-'t* **0 - 0.** This makes  
two-way walkways more suitable for installation in existing buildings.

# LIFTS  
Principles  
For all buildings, lifts should  
normally be positioned at the  
source of traffic flow. Provide  
sufficient space for waiting and  
queuing --+ p. 130 which must  
not infringe on stairs. Carefully  
plan the connection to the traffic  
routes. There are two different  
drive systems for lifts\:  
I. Traction sheave drive \(for  
cable lifts\)--+ **0**  
2. Hydraulic lifts --+ **f\) - 0**  
**Traction lifts\:** ideally have their  
drives above the shaft. The  
empty weight of the car and half  
the live load are balanced by the  
counterweight. Placing the drive  
at the top or at the bottom next  
to the shaft makes necessary  
additional pulleys, resulting in  
higher operating costs. The  
machinery and control system  
can be accommodated in a  
separate machine room or, in the  
case of lifts without a machine  
room, placed in the shaft --+  
p. 134.  
With **hydraulic lifts,** a push  
cylinder is mostly used --+ **f\)** -  
**0.** The lifting cylinder can be  
arranged directly or indirectly.  
The arrangement of a direct  
cylinder inside a protective  
tube under the ground is no  
longer suitable because of the  
requirements for the protection  
of groundwater. The use of a  
pull cylinder --+ **0** B-D can be  
appropriate in some cases. A  
pull cylinder in its basic form  
balances a part of the weight  
of the car. This has even more  
effect with additional weights --+  
**0** D, because the pump motor  
runs only when the load is lifted  
by the cylinder, while downward  
travel is enabled simply by  
opening the valve, which requires  
no energy and almost halves the  
consumption.

# LIFTS  
Control Equipment  
# Single-button collective control  
This control system saves calls and destination  
instructions, but travels according to a car call to the  
highest or lowest destination. Landing calls, however,  
are taken into account only during downward travel, in  
order to transport users to the main stop. This simple  
form of control is mainly suitable for buildings with low lift  
frequency and one main stop, like residential buildings or  
multi-storey car parks.  
# Two-button collective control  
This control system, dependent on direction and landing  
calls, can also give the intended direction. The lift primarily  
serves car calls, but stops in order to collect further  
passengers in the travel direction. Two-button collective  
control systems are particularly suitable where there is  
frequent traffic at intermediate storeys, as in department  
stores and office buildings. When there is a group of lifts,  
the calls and destination instructions of all lifts can be  
taken into account.  
# Destination floor control system  
With a destination floor control system, the user has  
to indicate the intended destination at a terminal, and  
is then allotted a lift by the control system. The car will  
normally have no selection buttons. For groups of lifts,  
a destination floor control system enables significant  
optimisation of the transport capacity. The user does not  
have to differentiate between express and local lifts, and  
not all lift access points have to be visible from the waiting  
area. Special lifts, like double-decker and multi-car lifts,  
can be integrated into groups of lifts. This control system  
is suitable above all for high-rise buildings and those  
where there are different security levels and passenger  
selection is required, because the control system can  
also provide access control through identification \(card  
reader, PIN code, etc.\), for example among hotel guests,  
personal areas and areas let to third parties -7 **e.**  
# Double-decker lifts  
Two cars are fixed one above the other and thus always  
serve different floors. This increases the transport capacity,  
particularly of express lifts, for the same shaft size. The  
access level and the sky lobby have to be constructed  
at two levels. If individual floors are to be visited, then  
escalators can be provided at the access level to separate  
the flow of users into odd and even numbered storey  
destinations. Double-decker lifts are suitable for transport  
to panorama and restaurant levels, or as express lifts to a  
sky lobby in very high buildings -7 **e.**  
# Multi-car lifts  
Two or more lifts travel - each equipped with their  
own traction sheave drive and counterweight - above  
and below each other in the same guide rails -7 **f\).** A  
destination selection control system records the intended  
direction and destination of the user before they enter the  
lift, and it then assigns the call to one of the cars and  
ensures that the two cars do not obstruct each other --\>  
**e.** This system can achieve 30% more transport capacity  
for the same number of shafts. Because the cars cannot  
overtake in one shaft, travel from the lowest to the highest  
stop is not possible without changing cars. Therefore,  
multi-car systems should have at least one conventional  
express lift -7 **e- 0.**

LIFTS  
Passenger Lifts for Residential Buildings  
Vertical transport in newbuild multi-storey buildings is mostly provided  
by lifts. The guidelines given here are based on German standards.  
In the UK, lift installation is covered by BS 5655, which includes  
recommendations from CEN and ISO.  
The architect normally appoints a specialist engineer for the design of  
lifts. In larger multi-storey buildings, it is usual to locate the lifts at a  
central pedestrian circulation point. Goods lifts should be arranged with  
visible separation from passenger lifts, though their design should take  
into account that they can also be used by passengers at peak times.  
The following load capacities are laid down for passenger lifts in  
residential buildings\:  
400 kg \(small lift\)  
630 kg \(medium lift\)  
1 000 kg \(large lift\)  
for passengers, who may be carrying loads  
for passengers with prams or wheelchairs  
suitable for the transport of stretchers,  
coffins, furniture and wheelchairs \~ 0  
The waiting area \(lobby\) in front of the lift shaft must be laid out and  
designed so that\:  
- lift users entering and leaving the lift do not obstruct each other more  
than necessary, even if carrying luggage  
- the largest items to be transported by the lift \(e.g. prams, wheelchairs,  
stretchers, coffins, furniture\) can be loaded and unloaded without risk  
of injury to people or damage to the building or the lift, and causing  
the least possible obstruction to other users.  
Waiting area in front of a single lift\:  
- minimum usable depth between shaft door wall and opposing wall,  
measured in the direction of the depth of the car, should equal the  
car depth \~ f\).  
- minimum usable area should equal the product of lift car depth and  
shaft width.  
Waiting area in front of adjacent lifts\:  
- minimum usable depth between shaft door wall and opposing wall,  
measured in the direction of the depth of the car, should equal the  
depth of the deepest car.

# LIFTS  
Passenger Lifts for Offices, Banks,  
Hotels, Hospitals  
The building and its function dictate the basic type of lifts which  
need to be provided. They serve as a means of vertical transport  
for passengers and patients. Lifts are mechanical installations  
which are required to have a long service life \(anything from 25  
to 40 years\). They should therefore be planned in such a way that  
*even* after 10 years they are still capable of meeting increased  
demand. Alterations to installations that have been badly or too  
cheaply planned can be expensive or *even* completely impossible.  
During the planning stage the likely usage should be closely  
examined. Lift sets normally form part of the main stairwell.  
# Analysis of use\: types and definitions  
*Turnaround time* is a calculated value indicating the time which a  
lift requires to complete a cycle with a given type of traffic.  
*Average waiting time* is the time between the button being pressed  
and the arrival of the lift car\:  
cycle time \(s\)

shaft pit or on the floor, and clad on  
all sides by non-flammable building  
materials. \~ **0 - Q.** Calculation of  
the transport capacity of goods lifts

Hydraulic Lifts  
Hydraulic lifts meet the demand  
for transporting heavy loads  
economically up and down shorter  
lift heights and are best used for  
up to 12 m lift height. The machine  
room can be located remotely  
from the shaft itself.  
Standardised direct-acting push  
piston lifts can be used to lift  
payloads of as much as 20 t up  
to a max. height of 17 m -\> **0**

load, must be kept within ± 3 mm.  
Vertical section of shaft  
Height clearance of the lift doors is  
min. 50-100 mm greater than for  
other doors, so that a completely  
level entry into the lift car is obtained.  
Double swing doors, or hinged  
sliding doors, can be fitted - either  
hand-operated or fully automatic,  
with a central or side opening.

Special Lifts  
# Glazed lifts  
Glazed lifts offer a view and improve the users' feeling of safety.  
They can be constructed either with glazed shafts \(observing  
fire resistance requirements\) or as shaftless lifts \(panoramic  
lifts\) --7 **0.** These can only be installed near buildings in which,  
to prevent the spread of fire, no lift shafts are permitted. This  
makes the inclusion of panoramic lifts into traffic calculations  
difficult. The glazing must prevent the users touching moving  
parts with the hand or with objects held in the hand. Glazed lifts  
are non-standard constructions and require a special prototype  
approval.  
# Goods and underfloor lifts \(without passenger transport\)  
Lifts only intended for loads like rubbish bins or goods deliveries  
can be installed inside a building or in front of it --7 **f\).** Passenger  
transport is not permissible with this type of lift. A machine room  
is not normally necessary.  
Underfloor lifts are controlled from the uppermost station. The  
cover of the lift must be in the field of view of the operator.  
# Lifts with reduced shaft dimensions  
In refurbishment projects, it is often a major inconvenience to  
construct the parts of the shaft above and below the working  
range. For such projects, there are special lifts, which require  
less pit depth \(min. approx. 80 mm\) and shaft head heights \(min.  
approx. 2500 mm above the highest stop\) --7 **8 - 0.** When lifts  
are installed without machine rooms, special requirements have  
to be considered for the shaft \(ventilation, possible condensation  
on the ceiling and fire protection measures\). These requirements  
can be taken from the information provided by the particular  
manufacturer, because such lifts have to undergo a special  
prototype approval.  
Such special constructions also include **lifts for disabled**  
**people --7 0,** which may be used only by the specified group.  
Dead man's controls and similar measures make simple, space-  
saving installations without pit and car doors permissible. Home  
stairlifts enable those with impaired mobility to move easily  
between floors \(on straight or curved stairways\) and across  
landings. The requirements for such installations are provided  
in BS 5776.

subsidy ideas and their consequences for town planning and  
also \(underlying ideological\) architectural predispositions about  
location, type of building, development and ground plan.  
# Historical development  
In the course of industrialisation and the movement of  
population to urban areas, residential building developed into  
a central task of the construction industry in the 19th century,  
and on account of the world wars this was still the case during  
the last century.  
The planning preoccupations with privacy and prestige, which  
originated in the feudal system and still apply as models and  
cliches, have entered the awareness of a wide public. Prosperous  
urban society expressed this by building villas and impressive  
mansions. In parallel, much Victorian accommodation was built as  
dense blocks in rental districts as a result of the massive \(working  
class\) housing shortage and with the aim of maximising land use  
and profit. ·  
The architects of the modernist movement \(and their successors\)  
developed opposing concepts to those of the 'stone' city. They  
investigated the individual home, its **lighting** and **orientation** --+  
**e,** the optimal \(minimum\) **room size** and **functional layout--+ f\)**  
and also rational and standardised methods of construction. The  
results ranged from ambitious private houses to new 'fresh from  
the drawing board' housing developments.  
# The present day\: community and individual  
Modern housing requires the separation in space and time of  
individual and community interests within the house as well as  
meeting the demand for privacy and publicity \(or anonymity\) in the  
urban context--+ **0.**  
The increasing relaxation of traditional family lifestyles and, as a  
result of the information age, the approaching end of the separation  
of housing and workplace mean that the classic functional and  
utilitarian procedures inside houses --+ **f\)** have to be re-examined.  
The established terms like living room or children's room often  
have little validity.  
The place of residence is understood to be a private space with  
controlled and graduated access from the outside world. The  
classic common and individual areas within a house are becoming  
less significant in terms of area, and the 'multi-purpose room'  
\(living-working room, shared living space as in a flat etc.\), which  
occurs in both private and public housing, is developing into a  
significant room type.  
# Room division and functional neutrality  
The consequence of the individualisation of lifestyles could be  
customised layouts with differentiated and often luxurious room  
division, but it could also be a functionally neutral division of  
space with qualitatively similar rooms suitable for flexible use by  
families, flat sharers, 'multi-generation living' groups or living-and-  
working models.  
These considerations result in increased significance for the  
neutrality of the developing decor. BASICS

House-building  
policy  
# The task of a century  
Among the changes in society caused by industrialisation,  
since the middle of the 19th century house building has  
developed into a central activity of the construction industry.  
Housing shortage and mass poverty became a decisive political  
dimension, which still continued into the 20th century due to  
the World Wars.  
The regulation and encouragement of house building is  
therefore an essential aspect of national construction policy.  
Political instruments have been developed in the form of  
planning laws and building regulations *--1* p. 56, intended to  
set **minimum standards** to protect privacy, avoid danger and  
protect health.  
**Laws to subsidise housing construction** and a repeatedly  
modified system of financial grants and tax exemptions have  
been set up to support private investment in rented and owner-  
occupied housing **\(property incentives\).** In consideration of the  
current over-supply of housing and increasing demands in the  
market regarding area and quality, the subsidy laws have been  
amended in recent years.  
The essential subsidy instruments in Germany are\: the **Law**  
**to Subsidise House Building;** the **state subsidy for house**  
**building,** laid down in the Law to Subsidise Social Housing  
of 13/09/2001\. The subsidising of house building includes  
the new construction of flats with subsidised rents, the new  
construction of owner-occupied housing, the purchase and  
refurbishment of existing houses and the purchase of rights  
of occupancy.  
Housing subsidy is carried out at the **state level\:** the extent of  
grants, the size details of subsidised houses and application  
conditions can therefore differ from state to state and are laid  
down in the relevant **housing subsidy regulations *--1* 0.** The  
target housing subsidy group are households whose income  
does not exceed the level stipulated in the laws and regulations,  
and also households with two or more children and households  
with disabled members. The subsidy is in the form of loans at  
preferential rates, grants, guarantees, housing entitlement  
certificates and the provision of cheap building land.  
**Household size Maximum living area**  
1 person 50m2 **2 persons** 60m2 **3 persons** 75m2 for each further person

**0** Limits on the living area in subsidised housing \(example\)  
# Owner-occupied House Allowance Law  
This legislation provides for a limited period a subsidy from  
taxation via a fixed annual allowance for the purchase of  
owner-occupied flats and houses. The target group for this  
allowance is households whose income does not exceed the  
limits laid down in the law. On account of the current over-  
supply of housing, the political justification for this law is often  
questioned.

# Housing area regulation  
The 'Regulation for the calculation of the housing area' of  
25/11/2003 is used to work out the area of houses and flats for  
the purpose of the Law to Subsidise House Building. The area of  
a house or flat includes the floor area of all rooms which belong  
exclusively to the house or, in the case of a residential home the  
areas intended for the sole use of the owner *--1* **f\).**  
The floor area of a room is determined from the clearance space  
between building components and starts from the face of the cladding  
of the building component *--1* **0.** The floor area is measured in the  
completed room, or can be calculated from a suitable construction  
drawing. Floor areas are calculated according to *--1* **0.**  
**Living area includes\: Living area does not include\:**

The KfW Subsidy Bank is a public body with its capital provided  
by the Federal Republic of Germany and the states. The main  
emphasis of its activity is the provision of favourable loans for the  
encouragement of house building. The subsidies are in the form of  
a subsidy programme with fixed aims. Currently \(autumn 2008\) the  
following programmes are active\:  
# KfW property programme

# HOUSING DENSITY  
Parameters  
The extent of residential development \(urban housing density\)  
is an important measure in public land-use planning. The urban  
housing density is laid down in the development \(zoning\) plans  
of cities and councils and is the indirect result of the provisions  
of planning law regarding the permissibility of building projects in  
unplanned inner areas and in outer areas --7 p. 56\. The essential  
statutory parameters describing urban housing density are the  
plot coverage ratio \(the built area related to the plot area\), and the  
floor-area ratio \(the total area of all floors related to the plot area\),  
as well as provisions regarding the number of full storeys and the  
height of buildings --7 p. 63.  
# Urban housing density and house type  
The urban housing density has a considerable influence on  
the selection of house type, determines the type and extent of  
development and specifies the land use of a housing development.  
The urban housing densities of various types of housing \(housing  
density\) are shown in --7 **0,** as described by the statutory  
parameters. The average population density \(inhabitants/m2\) is  
also shown for clarification. The density increases in a range from  
free-standing detached houses, semi-detached houses, linked  
and terraced houses to multi-storey residential buildings, block  
developments and stand-alone blocks. Based on the required  
plot area, dense terraced and block development achieves similar  
densities to multi-storey stand-alone blocks.  
# HOUSING  
# DENSITY  
# Parameters  
# Housing density and housing quality  
The qualitative evaluation of housing density is complex and  
depends on a multitude of factors. It cannot be estimated solely  
from a plot or group of houses, but is also influenced by the  
larger scale urban development conditions. The term quarter has  
become established to describe an urban planning unit with its  
own infrastructure \(shopping, recreational provision, schools,  
kindergartens and connections to local transport\).  
Further points of interest are the number of inhabitants for whom  
the infrastructure is adequate and the accessibility \(transport  
provision and times\). These parameters interact with the  
requirement for housing space per inhabitant and other spatial  
aspects concerning privacy and individuality as well as the long-  
distance connections, distance from and relation to city centres,  
plot prices, accessibility of workplaces etc.  
Model calculations demonstrate that with a floor-area ratio of 0.8  
\(related to net building land\) and development with, for example,  
multi-storey blocks in rows, the result is quarters where 6500  
inhabitants can live on a gross area of 75 ha \(900 x 900 m\). This  
results in distances from supply facilities of not more than 500 m,  
which can be reached on foot or by bicycle.  
In contrast, with a floor-area ratio of 0.4 and development of  
detached houses, 6500 inhabitants will live in a quarter with an  
area of 235 ha \(1500 x 1500 m\), which is too far on foot \(particularly  
for elderly people\) and too small for public transport, so that a car  
has to be used for daily shopping. In terms of the supply of energy  
in pipes or cables, it can be stated as a simplification that the cost  
for a floor-area ratio of 0.4 is nearly double that for 0.8.  
These considerations should make clear that the apparent  
advantages of living in a green belt mean that large parts of our  
country are scarcely habitable without using a car, which offers no  
perspective for a sustainable use of land and energy \(Bott, Haas

The plots are mostly narrow and long, in order to reduce the road  
frontage as much as possible. In this case, plots to the south  
of the road are more favourable. This enables a north-facing  
arrangement of the rooms next to the entrance to the road and  
the arrangement of the living rooms and bedrooms away from the  
road, with tranquillity and sunshine \(east - south - west\) and an  
exit to and view of the garden.  
If the plot is north of the road, then the house should be sited at  
the back of the plot, despite the extra expense of a driveway, in  
order to exploit the sunny front garden. Plots to the west and east  
of a \(north-south\) road should place garden and living rooms on  
the wind-protected east side \(arrangement of the house to the  
north of the plot\), so that no neighbouring buildings shadow the  
low east sun, as with an east-west road.

For housing in blocks---\> 0 \(built in blocks and rows\), most of the  
houses or flats will be orientated in two opposing directions with  
different qualities \(view, lighting, noise\).  
Traditional block development, with varied layouts and  
orientations of the flats, the planning of the layout of each  
flat should attempt to compensate for unfavourable lighting  
conditions. In addition to the traditional functionally neutral  
corridor floor plans, open, flowing and flexible floor plans can also  
be used for such situations. The quality of life in block structures  
results from the multitude of views out and through the street and  
the inner courtyard, which can be emphasised in the design.  
Compass direction is a central consideration of modern town  
planning. An east-west orientated arrangement of rows with  
green areas in between can achieve \(at the cost of public space  
and the risk of a certain monotony of appearance\) uniform lighting  
and orientation of as many flats as possible ---\> e.

ACCESS  
Detached and Terraced Development  
The selection of a house type includes decisions about  
development, access and utilities. This has an important effect  
on the proportions and organisation of the plan and is also an  
important cost factor.  
Access is also the subject of a multitude of building regulations  
because of its function as escape route \~ p. 511\. The route to  
the house or flat and the connection of the houses to each other  
represent an important location for social interaction as an  
immediate part of the surroundings of the inhabitants.  
Access principles  
The following forms of access can be differentiated according to  
the principle of adding houses\:

Detached house and row access  
The individually accessed, detached house standing on its own  
plot is the prototype for the 'owner-occupied' house. It has a  
prestigious level access from the road, which is reached through  
an area at the front \('front garden'\). It has direct access from each  
storey to further private or semi-public open spaces \(e.g. garden.  
terrace, inner courtyard or roof garden\) \~ f\).  
With row access, as with individual access, each residential unit,  
as its 'own' terraced, linked or courtyard-garden house, is  
accessed on the level from the road and has a direct exit into the  
open air\~ f\)- 8. There is a direct relation between private and  
public space. A sensible height is 2-3 storeys.  
Town houses\~ 0 also use this access principle for an upper floor  
flat, which in this case has its own front door and stairs. Terraced  
houses with good residential value offer the most economic form  
of house with garden \~ p. 144.

ACCESS  
Passage Access  
Deck access means that the individual storeys of a block of flats  
are accessed along horizontal passages, which are connected to  
each other and to the entrance by one or more internal, projecting  
or free-standing fixed vertical structures \(stair shafts, lifts\). The  
flats are organised along the passages singly, on two sides or on  
three sides \(with an internal function zone\). The passages can be  
arranged internally \(internal passage *---1* **0\)** or along an external  
surface \(external deck ---7 **f\)\).**  
They have \(with corresponding detailing\) the appearance of a  
semi-public street *---1* p. 139\. The route of this 'street' directly in  
front of a \(for internal passages unlit\) wall of the flat produces a  
tendency to a one-sided orientation of the flat.  
The variety of possibilities with this access type therefore results  
from the layering of multi-storey and mezzanine residential units,  
which offer the possibility, by building over the access passages,  
of double-aspect living on two sides of the flat.

Internal passage  
If the access passage is inside the building, this is called an  
internal passage block *---1* **0.** With this solution, living on one level  
leads to single-sided orientation. It is therefore better to divide  
residential units over two or more storeys ---7 **0** \(b+c\)  
External passage  
In an external passage building, the horizontal access is along one  
long side of the structure *---1* **f\).** The open passage is not without  
problems under the climatic conditions in Central Europe, and in  
addition it is normally practical to place only subsidiary rooms next  
to the external passage *---1* **0** \(a\).  
Living spaces on only one level are therefore particularly  
suitable for flats and studios *--1* **G.** It is better if the residential  
unit extends over two or more storeys ---7 **8.** If the floor levels  
are staggered by just half a storey in height, this produces  
favourable preconditions for the overlapping of functionality  
and stratification *---1* **0** \(c\). The range of possible variations is  
therefore considerably extended if the residential units are not  
the same width for the entire depth of the building, but rather  
overlapped with the neighbouring unit.  
Horizontal access to every second storey ---7 **0** \(b\) permits  
desirable arrangements of larger residential units on different  
levels, combined with small units at the entrance level. Good  
solutions also result from the alternating arrangement of the  
external passage zones. Symmetrical stacking of maisonettes or  
a corresponding arrangement of split-level flats makes it possible  
to limit the number of horizontal access points. b

# ACCESS  
Stepped Houses  
Steeply sloping sites encourage the construction of stepped  
buildings. These can be **stepped on one or two sides ---7 0 + 0.**  
The terracing can be produced by setting back residential units of  
similar depth or through the arrangement of varying depths of unit,  
decreasing towards the top. The stacking angle \(storey height to  
terrace depth\) mostly corresponds to an average slope of 8-40°.  
This results in **generous terraces** as space for relaxing, working  
or for children to play, like a ground-floor flat with garden, usually  
facing south, protected from the inward look of strangers but with  
an unobstructed view out. **Planting the parapets** enhances the  
residential quality.  
The advantages of large open-air terraces has and does also lead  
to the construction of stepped houses on level sites, sometimes  
built over large spaces. The resulting unlit rooms on the lower  
floors are not, however, without problems.  
# Trough depths  
If an open view of the downhill terrace is to be prevented, then  
the necessary trough depth depends on the storey height and the  
horizontal repeating dimension ---7 **0.** More favourable conditions  
regarding the possible view are produced if the terrace is recessed  
into the body of the building ---7 **0.**

Identical and similar flats are 'stacked' one above the other over  
a number of storeys and accessed via a common stairway. One  
or more flats can be connected at each floor. According to the  
number of flats, this is called **one, two, up to four \(or multiple\)**  
**flats per floor** access. The stairway in this case becomes a semi-  
public part of the building ---+ p. 139.  
**One flat per floor ---+ 0**  
There is access to only one flat on each floor. This is relatively  
uneconomic due to the high proportion of the total floor area taken  
up for access, but can often give the feeling of living in a 'stacked  
terrace'. The flats are also marketed as town villas. There is a  
general limitation to four floors without a lift.  
**Two to four flats per floor ---+ f\) - 0**  
**Two flats per floor** is the most common access method, with  
balanced advantages of residential quality and value for money.  
The arrangement allows various \(and flexible\) floor plan solutions  
---7 **e** and offers good possibilities for adaptation in every compass  
direction.  
**Three flats per floor** offers a favourable combination of residential  
quality and value for money. This layout is also suitable for corner

arranged on each floor \(e.g. 2-, 3- and 4-room flats\). **Four flats**

# FLOOR PLANS  
Houses  
The plan of a house is the result of a multitude of influential factors.  
In addition to the local conditions like plot layout and orientation,  
the current building regulations and decisions made about access,  
the design of many plans is determined by spatial ideas \(in their  
combined effects\)\:  
-the prestigious, extroverted idea of publicity\~ **e**  
- and the introverted idea of privacy\~ **0**

**The '18th-century** house'\~ **0**  
The house was formerly developed as an axially laid out one- or  
two-storey plan based on feudal precedents. The free-standing  
building is lit on all sides and has an architecturally prestigious  
entrance and garden side; the living rooms and bedrooms \(and  
to some extent service areas\) have mostly similar floor areas and  
are distributed around and connected to a hallway arranged along  
the building axis.  
**The atrium house** \~ **f\)**  
The atrium house is one of the classic urban house types. All the  
rooms of the one- or partially two-storey building are arranged  
round a private atrium, which also provides access and light.  
Contact with the outside world is entirely on the street side. The  
atrium plan is not fully practical for houses in Northern Europe  
\(access from the open air or many entrances\) but is an extremely  
popular model concept \~ **f\).**  
**The open plan** \~ **0**  
The open plan attempts to meld together the inside and outside  
spaces as far as possible through an almost complete lack of solid  
\(unglazed\) external walls. The aspects of privacy and publicity are  
\(supposedly\) neutralised. Minimalist and often subtly adapted  
fittings increase the contrast to a total view.  
**The flowing floor plan** \~ **0**  
The flowing \(also\: organic\) floor plan is developed from an analysis  
of the functional relationships between the individual areas of the  
plan and is often customised for a particular user group. This leads  
to differentiated zones running into each other, with interesting  
views without obstruction by neutral intermediate zones.

**Detached, one-family house** \~ **0**  
The detached, one-family house is the adaptation of the 'middle  
class house' \~ p. 143 for private house building on new estates.  
Plot sizes, infrastructure and setback rules are often intended for  
this type.  
Because of the limited road frontage of the plot, the original plan  
is mostly rotated so that the entrance is at the side. The driveway  
becomes a \(garage\) access. The building has light on all sides, and  
the architectural pretensions of the original are often preserved  
only as cliches. The division of the floor plan is simple and rational.  
The common area with kitchen can extend over the entire depth of  
the building and receive light on three sides. The central hallway  
arrangement leads to an economic division of the first floor with  
little area wasted for access.  
The lack of semi-public external areas due to the proximity of  
neighbouring houses is often seen as a fault with this house type  
and is remedied by the users with improvised offsetting measures  
\(fences, pergolas, awnings, carports etc.\).

**Terraced house and gallery access** \~ **0**  
Terraced houses often give the feeling of living in one's own  
house. Attempts are therefore often made to produce the spatial  
repertoire of a detached house \~ **0.**  
Building in a row restricts the possibilities for direct lighting to  
two fagades so that, with economic building depths of up to  
12 m and widths between 4 and 8 m, the existence of a badly  
lit or dark middle zone containing the stairs, subsidiary rooms  
and often also the dining area becomes unavoidable. This can  
be countered with intruding communal areas receiving daylight  
from both fagades, which enables the different qualities of the  
two sides of the house \(environment, compass point etc.\) to be  
experienced together.

The access gallery, if it is appropriately generous, produces  
# 8\[\]  
a transfer of the terraced house idea into blocks of flats. The  
**...J** BW Rr  
passage projecting on one side results in reduced lighting  
there and makes less depth possible for the flats. It is therefore  
common to provide transverse stairs when two-storey plans are  
used.  
**Half-open external area** \~ **8 - G**  
When angled and staggered terraces are built on rather more  
generous plots, simple alterations of the floor plan geometry  
can result in various protected private and semi-public external  
areas for the same or similar plan area \(and room layout\).  
This is often achieved by moving floor plan areas together\~ **8**  
or by moving them apart and creating external areas \~ \(\).

**Central corridor plan ---7 0**  
The central corridor plan is the classic floor plan of late 19th-  
century urban apartment blocks. The rooms are arranged along  
the two fac;\:ades and are separated by the \(load-bearing\) middle  
wall and the central corridor parallel to it. All rooms can be  
accessed and used separately. Common and individual areas can  
be arranged on opposing sides of the fac;\:ade and related to the  
particular qualities of the specific side of the building.  
There is natural lighting to all living areas and, when the building is  
deeper, the unlit central corridor can be widened into a central hall.  
The central corridor style flat is accessed either axially or sideways  
through a front zone. In the age of functionally neutral flats, the  
central corridor plan is still a popular and functional type.

**9** Typological development from central corridor to all-purpose room  
**Grouped room floor plan ---7 0**  
The idea of the grouped room floor plan developed at the start of  
the 20th century and is based on the separation of areas inside  
the apartment into two 'room groups'\: the living areas \(living room,  
kitchen and dining area\) and the sleeping area \(bedrooms and  
bathrooms\).  
The characteristic feature of this type of grouped room layout  
is the so-called 'slipper corridor', a minimised corridor which  
combines the two bedrooms and the bathroom into one spatial  
unit and is separated from the living areas by a door. The spatial  
separation of the two room groups is intended to produce less  
disturbance within the flat with its small floor area and minimal use  
of space for access.  
**Central function zone ---7 f\)**  
In buildings of greater depth, the central area of the flat can be  
widened to form a zone of subsidiary space and the fac;\:ades can be  
completely used for living areas. Bathrooms with artificial lighting  
\(or lit indirectly from other areas of the flat\), kitchens, cupboard  
and storage areas can be placed here, and appropriate passages  
and spaces provide the connection to the outside rooms.  
**Widened central corridor ---7 8**  
As an alternative to ---7 **f\)** in free-standing point houses ---7 p. 142  
**G.** the central area of the flat can be usefully widened to form an  
\(all-purpose\) living room as the centre of the flat. The resulting  
space serves both as living room and access and is lit indirectly  
through the other rooms or directly through appropriate recesses  
in the fac;\:ade \(e.g. recessed balconies\).  
The all-purpose room is typologically comparable to the atrium,  
and ideally forms a functionally neutral communication \(and play\)  
area. A definite functional \(use\) description is, however, often  
difficult.

into the open air, it should be protected from the prevailing wind  
direction if possible. If weather conditions are unfavourable, a

p. i 36 \(if the entrance is into a stair shaft, then this can provide  
wind protection\).  
According to the MBO, front doors of flats which are accessed  
by lifts must have a clear opening width of **90 em** \(for wheelchair  
access\). The door height in this case should be at least 2. i 0 m.  
Door thresholds are to be avoided. The entrance door must also  
comply with acoustic and fire protection requirements.  
Entrance recesses should be at least **1.25 m** \(better 1.50 m\) wide

they should be laid out generously and be as spatially varied as

The kitchen is a workplace inside the home and at the same time  
an important living room and meeting point for the occupants and  
their guests, with various relationships to other areas of the house.  
According to the building regulations, every house or flat must  
have at least one kitchen or kitchenette for cooking.  
Kitchens and kitchenettes without windows are generally  
undesirable and only permissible if effective ventilation is  
guaranteed. As a habitable room, the kitchen must have a clear  
ceiling height of at least 2.40 m and a window area \(structural  
dimensions\) of at least 1/s of the net floor area.  
Location  
The location of the kitchen is ideally on the northeast or northwest,  
in the immediate vicinity of the entrance area \(short distances for  
shopping, rubbish etc.\), to the \(vegetable\) garden and the cellar.  
There should be sensible internal room relationships with the  
dining room, utility room and larder. It should ideally be possible  
to see the front door, children's play area and terrace from the  
kitchen\~ e.

movement areas of the elderly or disabled so are to be considered  
absolute minimum values. In general, the design of kitchens  
should be based on movement areas for accessible housing  
\~ p. 21 ff.  
The· planning of a kitchen should make possible a flowing work  
sequence with sufficient space for movement, while avoiding  
unnecessarily long distances. A movement area of 1.50 m \(min.  
1.20 m\) is therefore required between the stretches of worktop.  
With most kitchen units having a depth of 60 em on each side  
of the movement area, this results in a minimum kitchen width  
of 2.70 m \(min 2.40 m\) \(plus approx. 6 em spacing up to the  
wall\).  
The height of the worktops should if possible be adapted to suit  
the height of the user and can vary between 85 and 95 em \~ 0.  
Working while standing should be minimised through the provision  
of \(slide-out\) worktops.  
Good posture while working in the kitchen and good lighting in the  
work area are general requirements \~ p. 154. In order to make  
the work in the kitchen easier, a practical arrangement of work  
areas is desirable \~ f\).

# Kitchen types  
The kitchen types shown here are produced from the requisite  
kitchen arrangements and their floor areas. The basic types are\:  
**Compact kitchens or kitchenettes\:** These are only adequate for  
housekeeping requirements to a limited extent \(scarcely any shelf  
or cupboard space\) and are really only suitable for holiday flats  
and \(student\) apartments. Kitchenettes do not normally require  
their own room and can be sited in passages or corridors --+  
# 0-0.  
**Kitchen as working room\:** The kitchen equipment is functionally  
arranged in the smallest possible area as a **one-row, two-**  
**row or U-shaped** configuration, normally as a fitted kitchen.  
The location of the appliances and worktops are optimised for  
rational working --+ **f\).** This results in practical working spaces  
on a floor area of between 5.5 m2 and 9.5 m2 \(though not suitable  
for purposes other than kitchen work\)--+ **0- f\).** The connection  
to the dining area is via the corridor or hall and can be supported  
with hatches etc.

**4Ii\)** Practical arrangement of working space in the kitchen  
# Kitchen with dining area  
The kitchen with dining area offers, in addition to the actual  
kitchen fittings, space for a table with chairs or benches, to  
be used as an additional dining area \(breakfast area\). The  
kitchen thus becomes a lived-in room, providing improved  
opportunities for conversation. Kitchens with dining areas can  
be planned from approx. 10 m2  
• A good arrangement is an L  
shape with doors connecting to the living room and corridor\:  
area approx. 14 m2 --+ **e.**  
A parallel development to the kitchen with dining area is the  
**'open' kitchen,** where the kitchen area is open to the living  
room and dining area. This can be designed as an 'American  
fitted kitchen', a functional area connected to the living room,  
with for example a kitchen breakfast/snack bar as divider --+  
p. 154 **e.**  
Modem kitchen designs are moving away from the fitted  
kitchen. The kitchen area is seen as an ensemble of  
independent objects developed in each case from formal and  
functional conditions, which are grouped like pieces of furniture  
in an \(ideally generous\) residential room. Open kitchens require  
good ventilation and extraction in order not to impair the living  
and dining room areas with cooking smalls. In many cases,  
a mobile divider is to be recommended, for example using a  
curtain --+ **f\).** H\(cm\) x W\(cm\) x D\(cm\) 85 20-60 60 H\(cm\) x W\(cm\) *x* D\(cm\)

Kitchen fittings  
Numerous modular systems with fixed functions and dimensions  
are available for fitting kitchens, mostly arranged along continuous  
worktops. Types of kitchen unit and appliances\:  
- base unit with large drawers or cupboards for provisions, large  
pots and pans and as shell for built-in appliances -7 **0- f\).**  
- wall cupboards for provisions and equipment or for lightweight  
appliances \(e.g. microwave\) -7 **e-o.**  
- tall cupboards with a height of approx. 2 m, to store provisions, as  
a broom cupboard or as a shell for the installation of fridge, oven etc.  
- cooker with extractor hood with 2-4 rings, electric or gas,  
often split into an oven built into a tall unit and a hob built into  
the worktop -7 **0-0.**  
- sinks, normally built into the worktop with 1-2 sinks and an  
integrated draining board -7 **CD - Cf\)**  
- the base unit under the sink generally houses a dishwasher  
-7 **0** and also a waste bin  
- the refrigerator is housed under the worktop \(in smaller  
kitchens\) or integrated into a tall cupboard at standing height,  
with freezer compartment, separate freezer or in combination  
with a chest freezer -7 **0 - e.**

# Working processes  
The layout of a kitchen should enable rational and time-saving  
working. In addition to a suitable arrangement of appliances, shelves  
and worktops ---7 p. 149, working processes can also be optimised  
and accelerated with opposing worktops ---7 **0.** The kitchen can  
also be used by two people at the same time in the same area if the  
worktops and appliances are appropriately arranged ---7 **f\).**  
High cupboards and shelves should be suitably positioned relative  
to the working areas and should be comfortable to reach ---7 **0** -  
**0.** Worktops placed at the correct height for the relevant activity  
can make kitchen work considerably easier ---7 **0.**  
Kitchens are frequently used areas of the house and should be  
comfortable and easy to clean ---7 **\(D.** It is a good idea to set window  
sills at a suitable height above the worktop so that windows can  
be opened without having to clear the worktop ---7 **e.**  
The lighting should include lights fixed under the wall cupboards  
---7 **f\).** The arrangement of switches and sockets and the additional  
space required for installations built into cladding, radiators and  
their pipework should be taken into account in the planning and  
spacing of the worktops.

# ROOMS  
Living Areas  
# Dining rooms  
Dining rooms fulfil communication, social and prestige functions.  
They form a central part of the \(communal\) life within a home.  
The spectrum ranges from a breakfast/snack bar in the kitchen  
to the occupants of the house taking meals together to dining  
with guests \(in a separate dining room\). The requirements for the  
design and spatial layout of the dining areas are correspondingly  
varied. The dining table may well be considered the central point  
of organisation in the home --7 p. 150 **e.**  
# Minimum requirements  
The dining area should be laid out to accommodate the anticipated  
size of the household. It should always offer space for at least  
4 people.  
# Spatial layout  
Dining areas are normally oriented to the south or west. A direct  
connection to the kitchen \(or pantry\) is practical. It is good to  
provide for extension \(with sliding partitions etc.\) for special  
events. Dining areas should have access to the balcony or terrace  
if possible.  
If a separate breakfast area is desired, this is best placed to the  
south or east of the house. If it is sited in the kitchen, it will require  
additional storage and movement areas.  
**Equipment and** space **requirements**  
In order to be able to eat comfortably, a person needs a table area  
of approx. 60 x 40 em --7 **0.** This results in sufficient distance  
from a neighbour and room for a complete place setting. The  
centre of the table should have a 20 em strip for plates, pots  
and bowls.  
A snack area can be formed from a pull-out table with a height  
of 70-75 em --7 **0.** If there is room, a folding table fixed to a free-  
standing cupboard is a good solution. A movement area of 80 em  
is required to the left and right of the table.  
A space-saving kitchen bar also has a depth of 40 em, but needs  
less space because of the projection of 15 em. Special bar stools  
or chairs are needed in this case --7 **0 + 0.** A dining area in the  
kitchen needs an amount of space according to the layout, but  
can often replace a dining room.  
A comfortable round dining table has a diameter of min. 0.90 m,  
though 1.10-1.25 m would be preferable.  
A corner bench with table takes up less space than any other dining  
area layout. If more than three people are to be accommodated,  
the movement area increases by 80 em per seating place. Dining  
table lighting should avoid glare.

# ROOMS  
Living Areas  
Open-air areas  
The attractiveness of housing can be considerably enhanced  
through open-air areas \(balconies, loggias and terraces\) adjoining  
the rooms. In the summer these offer a desirable extension of living  
space for relaxing, lounging, sleeping, reading and eating, and can  
also offer an extended working area or an easily supervised open-  
air play area for children. Balconies, loggias and terraces are a  
part of the living areas, for which they are normally calculated as  
25-50% \~housing area regulation, p. 136.  
They generally have a spatial relationship to living and working  
areas and dining rooms \(with more than one open area, this can  
also include bedrooms, kitchens etc.\). Good orientation \(compass  
direction, view\), sufficient size and protection from overlooking,  
noise and weather \(wind, rain, strong sunshine\) are decisive for  
the quality of open areas.  
The space required for the parapet \(and its planting\) has to be  
included in the functionally required depth.  
Corner balconies \~ **8** offer privacy and wind protection, and  
are more comfortable than open balconies \~ **0.** Open balconies  
should therefore be protected on the weather side. Recessed  
balconies \(loggias\) \~ **0** enlarge the external wall area of the  
adjoining rooms \(causing heat loss\) but offer the nearest to an  
'open-air room'. From plan stage, offset balconies provide  
excellent protection against overlooking and wind\~ **0- f\) .**

# Conservatories  
Conservatories project from living rooms with their large glazing  
areas. Originally they were heated by sunshine, naturally ventilated  
---\> **'ii\) - G\)** and served as climatic buffer zones and to preserve  
plants in the cold part of the year.  
Nowadays conservatories are mostly seen as an extension of living  
space, and used particularly in the spring and autumn. If equipped  
with appropriate additional heating and automatic ventilation, they  
can accommodate sub-tropical plants. In many cases they are part  
of the heated building volume with corresponding requirements  
for their outer envelope.

Living areas are categorised into those with shared rooms \(living  
and dining rooms, kitchens\) and individual \(private\) rooms for one  
or two people \(parents' \(bed\)room, children's room, guest room\).  
This differentiation leads to the conventional room layouts,  
particularly in commercial house building.  
But the way living areas are actually used is much more complex  
and varied. Bedrooms today are often used for **work, play and**  
**relaxation** and thus have some of the functions of shared rooms.  
This makes the fitting out of an individual room within a house as  
a small **apartment** worth considering.  
---7 **0\:** an individual room which can be used for a flexible range  
of functions. It has an area of approx. 13m2  
, including movement  
areas suitable for a wheelchair and possible extension onto an

---7 **f\) - 8\:** bedrooms with **minimal** space of approx. 13 m2 \(as  
parents' room or twin bedroom\) and approx. 8 m2 \(single room\).  
These would normally be aligned to east or southeast \(parents\)  
or south to west \(children\) and separated from the living room in  
another part of the home.  
---7 **0\:** the options for a generous twin bedroom of 16.5 m2  
, which

---7 **0\:** a small, independent individual area with shower room and  
separate cupboard zone.  
The conventional **living room** as a shared residential room and  
prestigious face of the house for visitors is increasingly developing  
into a multi-functional **communications zone,** which has to serve  
the needs of residents, but also guests and visitors ---7 **e-o.**

# Details and fitting out  
Wardrobes and linen cupboards are an essential part of fitting out  
a home. They serve to store \(larger\) items of clothing, linen, shoes  
and suitcases, and are normally situated in the bedroom.  
The essential elements of a wardrobe are a **drawer unit,** a  
**hanging rail** and additional **shelves.** It can be a **free-standing**  
**wardrobe -7 0. a built-in wardrobe** \(wall cupboard, single or  
double wardrobe constructions\) -7 **f\)- 0** or in the form of a walk-  
in wardrobe or dressing room -7 **0 -e.**  
Built-in wardrobe wall units -7 **0** are useful as partitions between  
bedrooms. In small rooms space can be optimally used with  
cupboards built into wall niches -7 **0** with continuous flooring  
\(and sliding doors\).  
When determining a house's layout, appropriate space should be  
planned for. Free-standing \(movable\) wardrobes are suitable for  
fitting out rented flats, and built-in wardrobes are often desired in  
owner-occupied houses and flats.  
When wardrobes are sited along external walls, care should be  
taken that the thermal insulation is adequate and that ventilation  
is provided. Walk-in wardrobes also require appropriate  
ventilation -7 **0.**

Bathrooms  
A bathroom is defined as an independent room with **bath/shower**  
and **toilet** and, according to building regulations, belongs to the  
**minimum equipment** of a flat or house. In larger houses, bath  
and we should be in separate rooms, or an additional we \(guest  
We\) should be provided. The bathroom should be oriented to  
the **north,** and if possible have natural ventilation and lighting  
\(otherwise provide effective mechanical ventilation according to  
DIN 18017-3\). The bathroom is normally next to the bedroom --7  
**e - 0. e** - \(\[!\), although it is also often convenient for technical  
reasons to place bath and kitchen \(or we and kitchen\) on a

# Details and fitting out  
The former standard valid for movement areas in bathrooms was  
withdrawn without replacement in 2007, because it inadequately  
considered the requirements of disabled people. The dimensions  
given here should therefore be considered as absolute minimums.  
# The movement areas in bathrooms should generally be based  
**on the 'Accessible building' standard --\> 4D** --\> p. 21 ff.  
The basic bathroom categories are\: \(guest\) **WCs** with we and  
washbasin --\> **0 - 0, shower rooms** with shower and basin --\>  
**0-0, bathrooms** with bath, washbasin and we *--j* **0-e. full**  
**bathrooms** with bath, shower, washbasin and we *--j* \(!!\).  
Because of the high humidity and resulting **condensation,** the  
surfaces must be **easy to clean.** Wall and ceiling plaster sh.ould  
be able to absorb and release enough moisture. Floor coverings  
should be sufficiently **slip-resistant.** If there is no laundry room,  
the bathroom must be designed with space and connections for a  
**washing machine,** washer/dryer and laundry basket.  
One **earthed socket** is to be provided \(next to the mirror\).  
In addition, the following should be included in the design of  
bathrooms and wes\: cupboards for towels and cleaning materials,  
lockable medicine cabinet, towel rail \(perhaps with additional  
heating\), hand grips above the bath.

# Storerooms  
Storerooms are used for keeping and storing cleaning equipment,  
tools, cleaning agents, shopping baskets, and bulky items like  
bags, suitcases, washing baskets and stepladders. Sufficiently  
large storerooms, particularly in flats, make a considerable  
contribution to comfort. **The building regulations require that**  
# every flat or house be provided with a sufficiently large  
# storeroom.  
In addition to cellar and attic areas in a property, storage space  
should therefore be provided within a flat of E;;1 **m2** with a clear  
width of 75 em. In larger flats, **2% of the floor area** should be  
provided as storage space \(split into many small areas is also  
acceptable\). It is practical to locate a part of this storage area near  
the kitchen.  
Storage rooms can be in the form of niches \(for built-in cupboards\)  
or box rooms \~ **0** - \(\). Doors to storerooms should open  
outward for reasons of space. The light inside the room should be  
operated by a contact switch by the door. Good ventilation should  
be provided.  
# Larder, pantry  
When designing a flat or house, a larder \(or pantry\) should be  
installed in addition to the general provision of storage space,  
despite the additional space required, with shelves to the ceiling.  
This is for the storage of supplies of food and drink, as well as  
fresh foodstuffs which keep relatively well; space can thus be  
saved space in the refrigerator. Basic layouts of larders\~ **8.** It  
is most practical when the larder is next to the kitchen. It should  
be cool, ventilated and protected from direct sunlight\~\(\)- **G\).** If  
required, a socket for a freezer should be provided, and possibly  
also a wine cooler.

# Laundry/utility rooms  
Laundry/utility rooms are used to carry out domestic work like  
washing and drying clothes, ironing and sewing. They can also be  
storage rooms for small items of equipment, detergents, cleaning  
agents and polishes, buckets and vacuum cleaners, tools and  
ladders. The provision of a laundry/utility room is particularly  
useful in flats, despite the additional space required.  
These rooms are best placed to the northeast, next to or easily  
accessible from the kitchen \~ **8 - 61.** In this way, tasks can be  
combined and carried out by one person. In detached houses,  
direct access should be provided to the garden \(for drying laundry\).  
In the design of utility rooms, a comfortable and healthy  
arrangement of appliances is important\: An ironing board used  
in the standing position requires a different height to one that is  
used seated \~ **0 - 0.** A fully adjustable ironing board is ideal.  
A worktop of 1.20 m width should be provided to deal with the  
washing. Good uniform lighting is required in the working area of  
the laundry/utility room \(average light intensity\~ 350 lx\).

# Wine cellars  
Wine cellars should if possible be below ground on all sides. The  
location should be next to the house; the north side is recommended.  
Ideal conditions are 70% humidity, 1 0-12 ac. Wines age quicker  
with every degree above 12 °C. \(Temperatures of 1-1 0 oc do not  
damage wine.\) Such requirements can be met through the use  
of air conditioning, or an air-conditioned cupboard or door *---1* \$.  
When air conditioning is used, the ceiling and walls should be  
insulated. A sealed door \(2.01 x 0.63 m\) of coated and insulated  
steel plate should be installed. A porous, breathing floor, like sand  
or unglazed bricks, and brick walls provide natural humidity.  
The room ventilation has to be regulated flexibly according to  
climate and time of year.  
Lighting in a wine cellar should be as low as possible and only  
switched on when required. Storage shelves should be of porous,  
breathing materials, e.g. breeze block, quarried natural stone,  
sand-lime blocks or Hydroton expanded clay elements. This  
regulates the humidity and stabilises the temperature. A natural  
microclimate is created in the room *---j* **e- f\).**  
On account of the temperature graduation, sparkling wines should  
be stored near the floor, white wines in the middle and red wines

# ROOMS  
Subsidiary Rooms  
# Communal storerooms  
In addition to the storerooms or storage spaces in each flat,  
for residential buildings in building classes 3-5, the building  
regulations require an easily accessible \(communal\) storeroom  
for prams, pushchairs and bicycles. Corresponding areas should  
also be provided in other residential buildings and detached  
houses.  
For the design of these rooms, it can be assumed that at  
least one vehicle per occupant \(including children\) has to be  
accommodated. In addition to bicycles, prams and pushchairs,  
it is also necessary to consider mopeds, tricycles, trailers etc.  
# --\>0.  
The rooms should if possible be located at street level, be lockable  
and equipped with hooks and bicycle stands to secure the stored  
vehicles. They can be laid out as storerooms inside the building \(with  
access to the entrance\) or as separate bicycle sheds --\> **f\) - 8.**  
A sufficient number of additional bicycle stands should be provided  
in the open air, particularly if the storeroom has been situated in the  
cellar.  
# Cellar  
The storage space provided for each flat normally consists of  
a storeroom inside the flat --\> p. 162, and an additional space  
outside the flat. This is normally provided as a cellar compartment  
--\> **0-e,** but can also be provided inexpensively as a parking shed  
in the grounds. Cellar storerooms should be dry and well ventilated.  
Natural lighting is to be recommended. Appropriate detailing of the

Garages and Carports  
According to the building regulations, the necessary parking spaces  
must be provided **in the grounds** of the residential building itself or  
in other suitable grounds at a reasonable distance where it is legal  
to park. The parking spaces are often provided as **single or double**  
**garages or car parks,** free-standing or attached to the building.  
Space requirement \~ **0 - 0.** A reduction in the parking area is  
possible for private houses. The tendency of modern cars to get  
larger \(including in height\} should be taken into account.  
In addition to garages, roofed-over parking places **\(carports\)**  
represent a cheaper, more beneficial in terms of building physics  
\(no condensation in cold cars in the winter!\) and space-saving  
possibility for protecting cars adequately from the weather \(a close  
wall on the weather side is a good idea\). A combination with enclosed  
storerooms \(for bicycles etc.\) is to be recommended \~ @. Carports  
are particularly suitable for communal parking places \~ **0.**

Halls of residence are normally provided near colleges and  
universities for students and are normally built and operated in  
various architectural forms \(20-30 units in courtyard layout or  
groups of open structures, large buildings with 80 or more units\).  
They are used for the accommodation of students for the duration  
of their course. The size and equipping of the rooms is often  
very limited. Options such as single rooms, \(double\) flats and flat  
sharing groups have proved successful. The arrangement and  
design of the communal areas within and around the residences  
are decisive for their acceptance.  
# Requirements  
Student flats are **'living places'** and not considered as residential  
homes in the sense of the building regulations. The general  
requirements of the building regulations essentially concern  
residential rooms with minimum requirements for floor area \(8 m2\),  
ceiling height \(2.40 m\), orientation, ventilation and lighting \(window  
area Ys of the room area\), accessibility requirements \(i.e. for disabled  
people\) and escape routes \(two independent escape routes from  
each floor, one of which is a legally essential stairway\). The **state**  
**guidelines for student residences** set recommended dimensions  
for living places \(approx. 12 m2 for single rooms and approx. 16  
m2 for flats\). In addition to this, a certain area will be required for  
communal use.  
# Forms of living  
These can be categorised into **flat sharing -\> f\) - 0** and  
**individual rooms-\> e-0.**  
When flats are shared, the communal area is of more importance,  
similar to a home. A group of rooms \(4-8\) with some functions  
transferred to the communal area \(kitchen, bathroom\) has a  
**linear -\> f\) or central -\> 8** type of layout. Single rooms located  
along a corridor with communal bathroom and kitchen form the  
classic \(but anonymous\) form of student residence. What has  
proved successful is the further development of the single room  
as flat-\> **e** \(room with shower room and perhaps kitchenette\) and  
the double flat -\> **0 - 0** \(two rooms with communal kitchen and  
bath\). This latter form of residence can be used very flexibly by  
singles and also by couples \(with child\).

# Accommodation for elderly people  
A **retirement flat 4 8 - 0** is a self-contained flat which takes  
the needs of elderly people into account, so that they can live  
as independently as possible and not in an old people's home.  
Such housing is usually scattered around residential areas, with  
a density of 2-10%. One-person flat 25-35 m2  
, two-person  
flat 45-55 m2 with weather-protected balconies \~3m2  
, min. depth  
1.40 m, balcony door without threshold.  
**Assisted flats for the elderly** \(\~20 m2 per flat\) are in a building,  
supplemented by communal rooms with tea kitchen. Convenient  
if sited in the vicinity of a care home for the elderly with facilities  
for dining, recreation, relaxation and therapy. Features a nursing  
support point with ward bath, therapeutic work room, central  
washing-up kitchen and cleaning room. One car parking space per  
5-8 occupants. Heating 2% above normal. Support of outpatient  
services for the elderly.  
**Home for the elderly** with residential living and care facilities.  
According to the law concerning such homes, there are stringent  
regulations on planning, licensing and operation. The large  
ancillary areas mean that an economic size is about 120 places  
with the provision of care, function and therapy rooms. There is  
an integrated care department for short-term care. General fitting  
out\: stair steps 16/30 em without underlay, colour-highlighted  
step edges and handrails on both sides, also in the corridors. Lifts  
for moving patients on stretchers or in folding chairs. Accessible  
building standard applies. Location\: as near as possible to town or  
village infrastructure and public transport.  
**Day centres for the elderly\:** function as meeting points and for  
outpatient care for independently living elderly people. Approx.  
1600 elderly citizens per day centre. With meeting room \(can be  
divided\) up to 120m2  
, service and consulting room 20m2

These provide nursing, support and care for chronically ill and  
other vulnerable elderly people. Activating therapy is intended to  
exercise, maintain and rehabilitate failing powers via medical and  
care-related assistance. There is a clear separation of residential  
and operational areas --'; **e.**

separate= 7m2 single, 12m2 double room. The entrance should  
if possible have a minimum size of 1.25 m x 1.25 m \(suitable for  
wheelchairs\) and the wet cell should be fitted with WC, washbasin  
and shower.  
A residential group consists of approx. 8--1 0 elderly people with  
communal living room and tea kitchen, in which meals are also  
taken. One adapted bath is required for every two residential  
groups. Corridor zones and niches can be used for communication  
and group building.  
# Room requirements\:  
-- nurses' sitting and handover rooms \(support points\)  
-- we and cloakroom  
-- care department incl. bathroom with acid-resistant bath \(also  
suitable for medical baths\), washbasins, WC, bidet and shower  
-- cleaning room with bucket sink and sluice for human waste  
--washroom  
-- subsidiary room for equipment and wheelchairs  
-- centralised facilities can be situated in the ground floor and  
basement or distributed in the individual departments.  
The short-term care department takes in those temporarily in  
need of care while their relatives are on holiday, and also provides  
hospital aftercare, rehabilitation etc.  
Space should be provided for administration, consulting rooms,  
function and common rooms, cafeteria, occupational therapy,  
gymnastics, chiropody and hairdresser.

Basics  
The hotel, formerly a business offering accommodation and  
catering, often with exclusive flair, has today become a complex  
and efficient \(mass\) service provider business with a wide  
spectrum of possibilities \(conferences, wellness, holidays\).  
There are hotels in various price and comfort classes, which are  
classified according to five categories ---7 p. 172\. A scheme of the  
basic room and route relationships within a hotel is shown in ---7 e.  
The essential areas are\: hotel lobby and reception as the central,  
well-arranged and prestigious nerve centre between the various  
parts of the operation, catering area in connection with the  
hotel lobby \(extent of the services depend on the hotel category\),  
administration, a staff area, which is separately accessed and  
partly in direct connection with other areas of the hotel, guest  
room area with differentiated rooms and individual access areas  
arranged under the aspects of category, orientation and noise  
screening, service area with kitchens, store and associated  
rooms. The percentages of hotels' surface areas required for the  
various functions are shown in ---7 0.

Rooms  
Hotel rooms account for the largest share of a hotel by area. The  
quality of hotel rooms is an essential criterion for the evaluation of  
a hotel by a guest. Traditionally, the trend has been to standardise  
and schematise floor plans and arrangements \~ **0.**  
In light of the extended significance of the hotel room \(living,  
relaxation,work and sleeping room\), architects normally attempt  
to answer the economic and technical requirements by reflecting  
the demand for comfort through spatial division, while still meeting  
concerns for individuality and identity **0- m.**

Guest house in a village environment  
The 'Hof der Stille' guest house -7 **0** is located in the buildings  
of a converted courtyard in an agricultural village in the Havelland  
near Berlin.  
The individual buildings of the former farm are arranged around  
an internal yard, which, in the place's new identity, serves the  
role of central access and orientation in the conversion. This also  
forms a spatial and visual focus point with the ambience of a  
cloister. The simple guest rooms fitted out in the former stables,  
the main house with dining room, lounge and seminar rooms, the  
flat belonging to the owner and the former barn containing sauna,  
fitness and relaxation area are all directed toward this centre.  
The individual guest rooms have the character of apartments.  
They are equipped within the least possible area with a wet  
cell and mini-kitchen arranged in the back of the apartment as  
an 'installation rail' along the boundary wall to the neighbouring  
property.  
Luxury hotel in an urban context  
The SIDE Hotel in Hamburg -7 **f\) - 8** is part of an urban block  
and has an \(obtuse\) corner -7 p. 171. Its shape results from an  
external angle \(which fits the block structure\) and a rearward  
block, which is four storeys higher than the angle and surmounts  
it. Between these, a 'Sky Lounge' on the eighth floor, a naturally  
lit 30 m high hotel lobby, forms the central architectural element.  
This mediates between the angles of the street alignments and is  
also the integrating and orienting core of the ensemble.  
On the standard floors -7 **f\),** the hotel rooms \(all of 5-star grade\)  
are mostly arranged around the open space of the lobby, with  
bathrooms parallel to the corridor as a one-sided access gallery  
system, In the corners and also on the first and twelfth floors are the  
suites \(partially built over the lobby\). Restaurant and conference  
rooms are situated in the corner on the ground and first floors. The  
kitchens and administration are in the rear part of the ground floor  
and the large conference rooms \(with daylight entering through  
a light well\), spa, swimming pool and underground car park and  
services areas are in the four basements.

CATERING  
Restaurants  
To be able to eat in comfort, one person requires a table area  
around 60 em wide and 30-40 em deep -7 **f\) - 0.** This provides  
sufficient distance between adjacent diners. Although an additional  
20 em space in the centre for dishes and large bowls is sometimes  
desirable, an overall width of 80-85 em is suitable for a dining  
table. If the food is served on plates, then 70 em is sufficient, and  
for fast food 60 em table depth.  
Distance between table and wall ;;;;75 em -7 **0,** because the chair  
alone requires a space of 50 em. If the space between table and  
wall is also used for access, the distance should be ;;;;1 00 em.  
Round tables need a little more space, a difference of up to 50 em.

CATERING  
Restaurants  
Before any restaurant or other catering establishment is built, the  
organisational processes must be determined with the operator.  
The following have to be decided\: what food will be on the menu,  
what quality and quantity will be on offer? Which service system  
will be used, whether a Ia carte with fixed or changing daily menus,  
plate or table service, self-service or mixed? For design purposes,  
it is important to know which target clientele is aimed for. The site  
itself will help to determine the most suitable type of restaurant.  
Appoint specialists in\: kitchen equipment, electrical, heating,  
ventilation and sanitary design.  
The main room in a restaurant is the dining room. Its furniture  
and fittings should be appropriate for the business. A number  
of additional tables or chairs should be available, so that table  
groupings are flexible. Provide special tables for regulars. Side  
rooms and conference rooms should always be flexibly furnished  
in order to permit variations. A food bar with fixed stools can be  
arranged for customers in a hurry. Larger dining rooms should  
be split into zones. Kitchen, side rooms, toilets and sanitary  
installations should be grouped around the dining room, also in  
the basement-\) e.  
Columns in a dining room are best located in the centre of a group  
of tables or at the corners of the tables-\) 8. The ceiling heights of  
dining areas with a floor area \~50 m2 = 2.50 m, \> 50 m2 = 2.75 m  
and \>100m2  
\~3.00 m; above or below galleries \~2.50 m.  
Emergency exits 1.0 m wide per 150 people using them. Minimum  
clear width of aisles in restaurants 0.80 m, doors 0.90 m -\) e.  
Toilets in public houses, bars or restaurants\: Stairs to toilets,  
wash, staff and storage rooms, usable width \~1.1 0 m. Clear walk-  
through height \~2.10 m measured vertically. Window area \~1/10  
of the floor area of a restaurant.

# CATERING  
Dining Rooms, Service  
The space required varies very widely  
according to the character of a restaurant.  
Apart from fast food outlets, the least space  
required is in cafes. The most is needed in  
restaurants and diners. Diagonal arrangement  
of the tables generally takes up less space than  
an aligned pattern, with a space saving of up  
to 35%. Alcoves are beneficial for use of space  
because the distance between seats and wall  
is no longer required. In larger restaurants,  
many groups of tables \(a waiter's 'territory'\) are  
collected together to form units.  
Basically, the design of dining rooms based  
on 'number of heads = m2  
, formulas is to be  
avoided, as they are not applicable to rooms  
under **1** 00 m2 and can lead to false results.  
Fixing the dimensions of rooms should in any  
case be done from concrete furniture layout  
plans. The functional design of dining rooms  
involves determining the following\:  
1. Entrances and traffic axes, which limit the  
usable area, according to number and  
required width.  
2. Service points \(with the exception of variable  
forms of furniture\)\: stations for 40 places  
each with at least one service point as  
centrally placed as possible.  
3. Table sizes and shapes according  
to the character of the business and  
the expected guest structure. A good  
procedure is to design a percentage  
structure of desirable table sizes with  
various combinations, starting from the  
intended total capacity. Table sizes and  
shapes result from the intended use. Areas  
of about 20 \(12-24\) places are designed  
according to the character, type of  
business and intended visual organisation,  
to avoid the impression of a waiting roorn.

# CATERING  
Restaurant Kitchens  
The trend away from conventional restaurants to those offering  
a wide range of food not only affects the planning and design  
of dining rooms, but also of kitchens. Small and medium-sized  
restaurant kitchens play a particular role here, and the following  
details are primarily based on this type of business.  
# Gastronorm system  
The dimensions of containers, tables, shelves, devices, crockery  
and built-in units are all based on a 530 x 325 mm module -7  
p. 181 **o.**  
**Function and organisation of the restaurant kitchen -7 0 - 0**  
The capacity of the kitchen is primarily dependent on the number  
of customer seats, customer expectations \(type, extent and quality  
of the meals offered\), the proportion of products freshly prepared  
from raw \(in contrast to ready-prepared food\) and the rate of  
customer turnover all day or at mealtimes \(consumer frequency\).  
In fast food restaurants the rule of thumb for seat changes is  
about 1-3 times per hour, in conventional restaurants about 2.  
In speciality and evening-based restaurants, the guests stay on  
average for 1.3-2 hours.  
**Percentage of total kitchen space requirement -7 0**  
Differentiated according to small, medium and large kitchens, floor  
area values for individual functions are be based on -7 **0.**  
Aisle widths in storage, preparation and production areas differ  
according to whether they are purely traffic routes or also overlap  
the service area. Working aisle widths should be 0.90-1.20 m,  
side traffic routes with \(temporary\) overlapping use 1.50-1.80 m  
and main traffic routes \(transport and two-way through traffic\)  
2.10-3.30 m wide. For kitchen areas in small to medium  
restaurants, aisle widths of 1.00-1.50 m should be sufficient.

# CATERING  
Restaurant Kitchens  
**Hot kitchens,** corresponding to their main functions - cooking and  
roasting - contain finishing zones and some or all of the following  
equipment\: cooker \(two to eight rings\), increasingly mobile  
hotplates, extractor hood, water boiler, fast-cooking equipment,  
automatic cooker, steamer, automatic steamer and pressure cooker,  
combination device, water bath \(bain-marie\), baking and roasting  
oven, roast and grill plates, frying pans, staged roasting oven, chip  
pan, salamander, circulation machine \(for frozen goods\), microwave  
oven, continuous process automatic roaster and baker. Large  
automatic appliances are used only in very large kitchens. Storage  
and working surfaces should be located between appliances and at  
the end of the block. In addition to the fixed arrangement in the block,  
mobile appliances are increasingly being used, which can be adapted  
better to production changes and are easier to clean. -7 **0-e.**  
**Cold kitchens** should have a layout logically planned in parallel to  
the hot kitchen and be convenient for the \(common\) servery and  
bread area. The regular equipment is a day refrigerator under/over  
the cold table, various cutting and slicing machines \(bread, cold  
cuts, meat, cheese\), mixing machine, scales, cutting boards, salad  
table with lower cold cabinet, toaster or salamander, microwave  
oven and sufficient working and storage space -7 **0.**  
**Servery** for restaurant kitchens with counter or self-service, ideally  
situated between the preparation area and the dining room. There  
should be sufficient shelf space, a hot cabinet with heated plates  
and a cool zone for cold foods. Crockery shelves or upper fixings,  
cutlery container. In large businesses, also basket, plate and soup  
bowl dispensers.  
**Crockery return\:** the difference between washing crockery and  
pots is considerable. With waiter service, the plates are brought  
back to their own area of the servery -7 **0 - 0.** In addition to  
one or two sinks with drainers, storage space and shelves for  
pot washing, small kitchens naturally also require dishwashers  
in various sizes, feed types and operational types. Dishwashers  
under the worktop are usual, but also tunnel and rotary batch  
washers. Provide surfaces for the return \(temporary storage,  
worktops, sorting, soaking\) and space for the crockery -7 **0- tD.**  
**Staff area\:** about 10-15% of the total space required in a kitchen  
facility should be allocated for offices and staff rooms. The kitchen  
staff will need changing rooms, washing facilities and toilets.  
For more than 1 0 employees, a rest/break room is necessary  
\(workplace regulations\). It is important that changing and social  
rooms are near the kitchen, to avoid staff having to cross unclean  
room areas or corridors. For changing rooms, \> 6 m2 floor area,  
4-6 air changes per hour and privacy. Provide each employee with  
a well-ventilated, lockable cupboard. In large operations, even  
differentiate street and working clothes. Guidelines for the toilets\:  
per unit *ryvc* and washbasin\) 5-6 m2 and for the shower areas  
\(for more than five male or female employees\) a washbasin and  
shower, approx. 5.5 m2 per unit.  
**Ventilation and extraction\:** according to VDI guideline 2052,  
large kitchens should be equipped with mechanical air supply  
and extraction. Extract the air at each cooker and run it through  
ductwork into the open air. Supply fresh air \(no recirculation\). Take  
the heat production from the appliances into account \(e.g. induction  
ovens can reduce the unused heating of the surroundings\).

# CATERING  
Large Kitchens  
With communal catering for many people in offices, hospitals and  
factories, a large number of meals have to be supplied in a short  
period of time. Under the conventional system, 'cook and serve',  
the kitchen has to be designed to cope with this peak demand,  
and the working times of the staff are also directly linked to the  
serving cycle. In order to employ staff and kitchens more regularly  
and effectively, **'cook and chill'** has been developed \~ **8 - e.**  
Under this system, the meals are prepared conventionally or  
purchased as convenience products, cooked in advance, quickly  
cooled and stored cool. The dishes are then completely cooked  
\(finished\) just before serving. This results in a separation of the  
production time and the serving time. The possibility of storing  
the prepared dishes enables the capacity of the kitchen to be  
increased considerably, with up to three times as many meals  
being produced as in a conventional large kitchen. The extra  
work involved in the production phase in cooking, cooling and  
rewarming has to be balanced against the advantages of better  
utilisation of the kitchen and service.  
The meals are prepared in a kitchen, which has a shock cooler  
in addition to the conventional cooking equipment. One of the  
most important factors involved with this system is the hygienic  
requirements in production \(similar to industrial food production\).  
The design must therefore implement an absolute separation of  
clean and unclean areas\~ p. 179 **0.**  
# Unclean areas  
These are the goods reception, storerooms, preparation rooms,  
washing up area, waste disposal and cleaning agent store.  
# Clean areas  
These are those for storage and preparation of pre-prepared  
products, food production, shock cooling, portioning and packaging,  
plus finishing cold rooms for ready-to-serve meals and the service  
counters .  
When preparing the food, it is important to make sure that the  
core temperature is at least 70°C during cooking and that the  
subsequent cooling to +3°C takes place within 90 minutes.  
The food is also to be stored at +3°C. The **cold portioning** should  
take place at a temperature of + 12°C and the transport to the  
consumer locations at max. +3°C. The cool chain from goods  
delivery to eating must never be interrupted. The statutory hygiene  
regulations are to be observed absolutely.  
A recent innovation is the introduction of cook chill assembly  
kitchens. These are only portioning kitchens, which put together  
individual parts of meals. All food is produced by an external  
supplier as cook chill products. This results in the saving of a  
large part of the storage rooms and the whole of the cooking and  
roasting kitchens.  
The planning should always be left to experienced designers,  
because additional details are important concerning hygiene for  
the kitchen employees.

Mainly used in industrial food production.  
**Combi steamer ovens** enable the most varied modes of cooking  
in one appliance \(hot air steaming, roasting and reheating. The  
core temperature of the food can be used for computer control of  
the cooking process\). Heated by electricity or gas. Water supply  
needed. When cook and chill production takes place in the  
immediate vicinity of the cold portioning room or shock cooler, the  
cooler motor for the shock cooler should if possible be located in  
a side room \(to prevent noise nuisance and heat production\). The  
cold portioning is arranged between the shock cooling room and  
the cook chill storeroom. This is useful for the checking, portioning  
and assembly of the cooled foods.  
In addition to the serving system with hot and cold counters---\> **0,**  
**0-0,** cook and chill production is also well suited for serving in  
front cooking systems.  
In hospitals and residential/nursing homes, the serving is done on  
a portioning conveyor. The finishing of cook chill foods can then  
be carried out on special tray trolleys by induction, conduction  
or convection. According to the system used, special crockery  
may be required and/or space for the docking station in the ward.  
With all systems, it is possible to equip the trolley with cooling  
to ensure the unbroken cool chain for the cook chill system and  
also to keep cold foods like salads and desserts cool. Especially  
in large kitchens with long traffic routes, these systems can keep  
the food warm for a long time and avoid the core temperature  
dropping under the specified value.

**f\)** Youth hostel\: functional scheme  
Traditionally, youth hostels have offered reasonably priced  
accommodation for young people, youth groups and school  
classes, but the range of services of a modern youth hostel also  
includes meetings, courses, seminars, education of young people  
and adults, leisure facilities, school trips, and walking for singles  
and families. In rural areas, there are children's hostels \(up to age  
13\) and youth hostels \(13-17\), and in towns there are youth guest  
houses offering tourist and cultural services. The tendency among  
youth hostels is towards the 3-star hotel standard --7 p. 172, with  
sizes of 120-160 beds.  
# Functional areas  
**Bedrooms** in hostels consist of 4-6 \(maximum 8\) rooms in groups  
with a leader room \(one bed, one folding bed as day couch\), and  
in guest houses 2-4 bedrooms, leader/teacher accommodation  
1-2 rooms with work area, family rooms with 4-6 beds; the trend  
is to separate rooms for parents and children. Boys and girls are  
separated, mostly allocated rooms starting from the head of a  
corridor with a number of dividing doors, which can be locked  
if required \(for flexibility\). Showers and washbasins connected to  
the rooms, separate WC \(accessible for disabled people\), lockable  
luggage store. Cleaning rooms on each floor and shoe store/  
cleaning room.  
**Lounge and meeting rooms\:** One room per 20-25 beds. Multiple  
dining rooms, multi-purpose areas with individual corners,  
cafeteria, lecture room, dining room also suitable for events, same  
number of places as beds, entrance hall/reception and office for  
the warden. Outdoor camping area \(door to sanitary facilities\),  
sports and games, parking for buses and cars, garden for the  
warden. Inside, separated noise zones for table tennis, hobbies  
and workrooms.  
**Utility area\:** kitchen serving individual portions or group meals,  
serving trolleys, no self-service counter, utility room, staff lounge.  
**Living areas\:** flat for the warden, bedrooms for staff, 12-15 m2•  
**UK issues\:** Youth hostels, for financial reasons and because  
they are frequently located in sensitive surroundings, are often  
conversions of existing buildings. Consequently the UK Youth  
Hostels Association \(YHA\) is reluctant to impose definitive  
architectural guidelines. However, some are applied, especially  
regarding fire safety and space per bed.

**Holiday homes** are for temporary holiday accommodation, either  
for the user or for \(paying\) guests. They can be single buildings  
on their own plot or grouped in a holiday park and are subject to  
the LBO.  
**Weekend homes,** which make use of appropriate waivers under  
the LBO concerning the quality of residential rooms, thermal  
insulation, sound insulation and fire protection, may be erected  
only on suitable sites and are restricted to certain sizes laid down  
in the States' Camping and Weekend Home Regulations \(e.g.  
floor area max. 40 m2 \(+ 10 m2 veranda\), height max. 3.50 m\).  
The features of rented holiday homes are often controlled by  
the **German Tourism Association,** which issues classifications.  
In general, weekend homes should have a living area, a proper  
kitchen \(partitioned\), an enclosed shower, with WC and washbasin,  
and at least one enclosed sleeping area.

General Design Notes  
Motels offer reasonably priced accommodation for travellers.  
They are located at the edge of towns in places easily reachable  
by motorway or arterial roads, near tourist attractions and holiday  
regions. It is beneficial to have restaurants, petrol stations and  
services for motorists in the immediate vicinity. In contrast to city  
hotels, motels are mostly single-storey, widely spread facilities  
\~ **0.** The access road normally leads to the registration \(short-  
term parking\), then to a car park or carport as near to the room  
as possible. \(Departure also via registration with check-out and  
return of key.\)  
Room sizes 4 x 4 m - 5 x 5 m, with bathroom and sometimes  
kitchenette \~ **0 - 0.** Furnishing is cost-saving and simple \(most  
of the guests stay only one night\). Community rooms for guests,  
with desks and reading tables, radio, television; play area should be  
situated away from the guest rooms so as not to disturb sleepers.

The requirements for camping sites are laid down in the states'  
**Camping and Weekend Parks Regulations.** Camping sites  
generally need to have an access road from a public road, with  
access control \(barrier\), reception and assignment of places,  
T an area for waiting vehicles, visitor's car parks and internal  
access with roads adequate for fire service vehicles \(width  
0  
\~ **min. 3.0 m\).**  
1 Camping sites and motorhome parks should be separated. A  
place should be provided for each caravan or motorhome. These  
places are min. 75 m2 \(65 m2 if car parking spaces are provided  
separately\) and are grouped into sections of 20 places by fire  
roads \(5 m wide\). It may be necessary to provide firebreak strips  
next to the boundaries.

# CHILDREN'S DAYCARE  
Access and Building Forms  
The design of facilities for children should consider their needs  
and size. There are no regulations or guidelines for the construc-  
tion of children's daycare buildings. The regulations of the relevant  
state and the LBO are used as guidelines. Accessibility building  
design standards are recommended.  
# Children's daycare centre  
This term includes creches, kindergartens, after-school care etc.  
The daycare centre is organised so that a mixture of children with  
ali-day and part-time arrangements can be looked after.  
# Creche, nursery  
Cares for small children from babies to three years old. The group  
size is generally approx. 10 children.  
# Kindergarten  
Looks after children from min. three years old until they go to  
school. It may be possible for them to eat lunch and sleep. The  
group size is generally 20 children.  
# Children's after-school care  
For the care of school-age children until 14 years old. Lunch after  
school and assistance with homework are offered. These estab-  
lishments are often combined with kindergartens and the group  
size is generally 20 children.

Rooms, Outdoor Areas  
Group room  
Most time in the children's daycare centre is spent here. Required  
floor area approx. 2.5 m2 per child. Create zones as varied as  
possible and design a second floor level and a stage \(play-stage  
half-open, with a snug cave\). Play decks up to a height of 1.50 m  
must have a handrail at least 70 em high; play decks more than  
1.50 m high must have handrails min. 1.00 m high. The group  
room should have as short a distance as possible to the WC  
area. Ideally, provide direct access to the open air and align to  
the south.  
Rest or sleeping rooms  
These are not always considered necessary, as mattresses are of-  
ten laid out in the group room for the midday sleep \(cupboard to  
store the mattresses -7 p. 188 **0\).**  
Kitchen  
The status of the kitchen in the children's centre can vary accord-  
ing to the paedagogical concept, for example a central kitchen for  
all groups or as a series of kitchens, one in each group room. Dif-  
ferent floor heights are recommended so that adults and children  
can cook together.  
Dining room  
The group room is normally used for eating. An extended corridor  
or the entrance hall are also suitable as communicative places to  
eat.  
Stairs  
The risers of stairs in children's centres should not be more than  
16 em, and the treads between 30 and 32 em.  
Outdoor areas  
Outside playgrounds should be designed to be as varied as poss-  
ible. The design of external works for children's centres is regu-  
lated by several standards. The stipulated minimum area outside  
per child is variable between the German states.  
Hilly landscape Modelling the terrain by heaping and excavating  
the ground surface. The coarse shape is produced by a hydraulic  
excavator, and the fine modelling by hand. The hills can incorpor-  
ate plants, shrubs, hedges, flowers and clover of various heights.  
Compost heap as the core of an organic garden. Semi-shaded  
location for organic waste from the centre.  
Trees for climbing, to provide shade, deliver fruit and be edu-  
cational. Also worth considering are vegetable/herb gardens,  
sandpits, bird tables, dry stone walls, meadows etc.  
Pond should have min. 6 m2 water surface and a depth of 80 em  
to avoid oxygen deficiency. For safety reasons, either a coarse net  
should be spread over the water or builder's steel mesh installed  
1 0 em under the water surface.

Playground Equipment  
Playgrounds must be varied in ·design, changing and changeable.  
They must meet the needs of children. Some of the requirements  
for children's playgrounds are\: traffic safety, no pollution by emis-  
sions, sufficient sunshine, groundwater level not too high,  
Play equipment in playgrounds is often made of timber \(e.g. larch,  
robinia\) and the surface of the wood can be additionally protected  
with beeswax treatment. Standing water and damp should be  
avoided on all wooden surfaces, so galvanised steel is often set  
into the ground at the base of verticals.  
Playgrounds should be orientation points within residential dis-  
tricts and connected to housing with simple networks of paths.  
Do not banish playgrounds *to* the periphery, but design in combi-  
nation with other communication systems.  
Guideline values for the design of playgrounds are built up from  
individual data\: age group, usable area per resident, play area  
size, distance from home\:  
Age \(years\) **m2/resident Accessibility, max. distance** from home \(m\)  
\(min.\)  
0-6 0.6 up to 200 and in sight 2  
6-12 0.5 up to 400 5  
12-18 0.9 up to 1000 15  
Playgrounds for children are to be provided, as private facilities  
within the building plot, with the construction of houses or flats\: for  
small children up to 6, for children from 6 to 12, plus leisure areas  
for adults. This is a requirement for three flats or more. The uniform  
basis for the provision of all public playgrounds is\: 5 m2 playing  
area per residential unit, minimum area of playground\: 40m2  
• Out-  
door play areas must be fenced at least 1 m high \(thick hedges,  
fence or similar\) to prevent access to roads, car parking, railway  
lines, deep watercourses, cliffs and similar dangers.

Design parameters  
The basis for the planned development of schools are the school  
building guidelines of each German state \(including model room  
layouts\), in conjunction with relevant national building standards  
and health and safety regulations.  
General classroom area  
This includes standard and replacement classrooms, course rooms,  
rooms for languages and social studies, language laboratories,  
The subjects taught in the general classroom area are\: languages,  
0 0 0 as well as optional subjects and remedial teaching.

This should lie between three and four. Schools for pupils who  
are physically disabled or have learning difficulties should have  
1-2 storeys.  
Max. depth of classrooms with  
Room dimensions  
one-sided daylight  
The maximum number of pupils in a class is 32.  
According to the school building guidelines, the design of classrooms  
should normally be based on tables with two workplaces --7 0. If  
the windows are all on one side, the max. room depth is 7.20 m. If  
possible, have windows on both sides to permit furniture to be free-  
ly positioned. The distance between the blackboard and the pupil  
workplaces at the back should not exceed 9.00 m -0 G. Guideline  
values\: area\: 21.8G--2.00 m2/pupil. Air volume\: 25.00-6.00 m3/pupil.  
The ceiling height of classrooms \(min. 3 m\) may not be reduced by  
more than 0.30 m by individual construction elements --7 f\).  
Language laboratory --7 0 - 0  
Located within the general classroom area or near the media  
centre/library. Guideline\: approx. 30 language laboratory places  
per 1000 pupils. Size\: LT \(listen and talk\) and LTR \(listen, talk,  
record\) laboratory size, total approx. 80 m2  
, language laboratory  
cabins approx. 1 x 2 m, number of places per laboratory 24-30 m2

prox. 2.0 m2/place\) including subsidiary rooms approx. 95 m2  
•  
Side rooms\: studio, recording room, archive for teacher and pupil  
tapes. Language laboratories are also possible in inner areas of  
the building with artificial light and air conditioning.  
Computer room  
Should if possible face north and not be on the ground floor \(Saxony  
-0 refs\). The IT workplaces are designed according to the guidelines  
for computer workplaces. The upper edge of the monitor should  
be below eye level so that the pupil's head is tilted at 15-20° --7 e.

from the north. Music rooms should have an appropriate layout  
and sound insulation to avoid disturbing other facilities.  
Technical teaching  
Workrooms should be arranged so that teaching in other rooms  
is not disturbed by the noise. The working area should be sub-  
divided into the various media \(wood, paper, metal, plastic\) and  
ideally be located on the ground floor.  
Photo laboratory  
The photo laboratory is a dark room for positive work \(one enlarge-  
ment table for 2-3 pupils, combined with wet working areas\), for  
negative work \(film development\) and a film storage room. If possible

Sanitary Facilities *I* Break and Circulation Areas  
Circulation and escape routes  
Horizontal and vertical access routes are normally also emergency  
escape routes. Escape routes must have a clear width of min.  
1.00 m/150 people but min. width of corridors in classroom areas  
is 2.00 m, or 1.25 m with up to 180 people. Stairs in classroom ar-  
eas must be 1 .25 m wide, other escape routes 1 .00 m wide. Max.  
length of escape routes\: 25 m measured in a straight line from the  
stairwell door to the farthest work place, or 30 m in an indirect line  
to the centre of the room. Capacity of stairs dependent on number  
of users and average occupancy, e.g. stair width\: 0.80 m for each  
100 people \(min. 1.25 m, but not wider than 2.50 m\).  
Doors -7 0  
These may open inward or outward. Outward opening doors  
should not endanger pupils and project max. 20 em into the es-  
cape route. -7 e.  
Doors from rooms with more than 40 pupils or increased fire risk  
\(chemistry, work rooms\) must open in the direction of the escape  
route.  
Stairs, ramps -7 0 - G  
The pitch of stairs is to be based on length of pace\: 2 riser +  
tread= 59-65 em. Ramps ;\:;;;6% gradient.  
Cloakrooms  
Cloakrooms are to be provided outside classrooms.  
Break areas  
The space guideline for enclosed break areas is 0.4-0.5 m2/pupil.  
They are to be designed so that they can be used for school  
events. Dining and multi-purpose rooms may be used as break  
areas. If the connection between school building and sports hall  
is roofed over, this can be designed as a break area or covered  
sports area \(Saxony -7 refs\).  
Communal area  
A communal area should be provided in each larger school for  
events and celebrations. This can be achieved through the tem-  
porary connection of several rooms and circulation areas. Wheth-  
er the building of a school hall is necessary is regulated by the  
relevant state school building guidelines.  
Sanitary facilities -7 0 - 0  
The necessary WCs, urinals and washbasins are provided accord-  
ing to the total number of pupils \(divided between boys and girls\)  
according to the school building guidelines -7 \$. One washbasin  
is provided for every boys' WC or for every two girls' WCs. Toilets  
should be as directly lit and ventilated as possible. The accesses  
for girls and boys are to be separate.  
Use Notes

Lecture Theatres  
Larger lecture theatres for central lectures are preferably accom-  
modated in auditorium buildings, and smaller lecture theatres for  
specialist lectures in institute or seminar buildings. Access to the  
lecture theatre is best separated from the research facilities, with  
the shortest possible route from outside to the back of the lecture  
theatre \(in the case of raked seating, entrances behind the up-  
permost row, or in larger lecture theatres also at the side at middle  
height -\> **8\).** Lecturers enter the lecture theatre at the front, from  
the preparation room, and experimental apparatus can be rolled  
into the theatre. Common lecture theatre sizes are 100, 150, 200,  
300, 400, 600, 800 seats. Lecture theatres with up to 200 seats,  
ceiling height approx. 3.5 m can be integrated into an institute  
building; larger theatres should ideally have their own building.  
Experiment benches should be easily changeable, on wheels and  
suitable for laboratory work. Media connections are required.

Combined units with tip-up or slewing seat, backrest and desk \(with  
shelf or hook for case or bag\), mostly fixed mounting \~ **0 - 0.**  
Arrangement is according to subject, number of students and type  
of tuition\: from light \(slide shows, electro-acoustic facilities\) to heavy.  
Some lecture theatres \(surgery, internal medicine, physics\) have  
raked \(rising\) rows of seating \~ **0.** The space requirement per  
student depends on type of seating, desk depth and floor pitch.  
Per student \(including all walking areas in larger lecture theatres **in**  
a cramped situation\), the space requirement is 1.10 m2  
, in smaller  
lecture theatres and **in** a normal situation 0.80-0.95 m2  
•  
# Projection, boards, acoustics, lighting\:  
Projection screens and black-/whiteboards can be designed as  
segmented surfaces, or fixed to a straight back wall. Wall boards  
in many sections, mostly vertically sliding, manual or mechanical,  
can be dropped down below the projection area. Wheeled boards  
or screens are also possible.  
Speech should reach the listener as uniformly as possible, with no  
disturbing echo. Suspended ceilings will aid reflection and absorp-  
tion. Rear walls should be clad with sound-absorbing material, oth-  
er walls flat. Light intensity in windowless lecture theatres\: 600 lx.

The design of lecture theatres and seminar rooms has to comply  
with the places of assembly regulations. It should also be ensured  
that wheelchair users have sufficient space in lecture theatres in  
line with standards.  
Service rooms for lecture theatres  
Every lecture theatre should have a directly accessible side room.  
This has no fixed function and can be used as a storage room.  
Sufficient preparation area should be provided next to all lecture  
theatres featuring experiments, positioned at the same level and  
with a short route to the podium. Guideline for the min. size\: for  
rectangular plan lecture theatre, approx. 0.2-0.25 m2/seat; trap-  
ezoidal plan 0.15-0.18 m2/seat; natural science and pre-clinical  
subjects 0.2-0.3 m2/seat.  
Areas for storage and staff rooms are necessary for the proper  
operation of a lecture theatre building\: a room for technical staff  
to maintain the facilities; for cleaning staff; storeroom for replace-  
ment parts, light bulbs, fluorescent tubes, black-/whiteboard,  
clothing etc. Min. size per room 15 m2; space required for all side  
rooms min. 50-60 m2  
.  
Computer room  
The size of the computer room is related to the number and size  
of the computer desks, which depends on the size of the displays.  
General tuition rooms  
Seminar rooms, usual sizes\: 20, 40, 50, 60 seats; mobile double  
tables, width 1.20 m, depth 0.60 m, space required per student  
1.90-2.00 m.  
Variable arrangement of the tables for tutorial and group work. If  
there is free ventilation from only one external wall, the depth of  
the room should not exceed 2.5 x clear ceiling height.  
Offices for scientific personnel -7 0  
professor 20-24 m2  
scientific assistant 15 m2

Laboratories  
Laboratories differ according to use and subject. According to  
use\:  
Tuition-related practical laboratories with a large number of  
workstations collected together and mostly with simple basic  
equipment *-7* e.  
Research-related laboratories, mostly in smaller rooms with  
special equipment and additional practical spaces like weighing  
and measurement rooms, centrifuge and autoclave rooms, rinsing  
kitchens, air-conditioned and cold storage rooms with constant  
temperature, photographic/dark rooms etc. *-7* e.  
According to subject\:  
Chemistry and biology laboratories have permanently installed  
laboratory benches. Rooms have a high rate of air exchange and  
frequently additional fume cupboards with air extraction *-7* p. 204  
*-7* 0 for work producing gas and smoke. Fume cupboards are  
often installed in their own rooms \('stink rooms'\).  
Physics laboratories mostly have mobile benches and sophisti-  
cated electrical equipment in cable ducts in the wall or suspended  
from the ceiling. Low rate of air exchange *-7* p. 204. There are  
special laboratories for specific requirements, e.g. isotope lab-  
oratories for work on radioactive substances in various safety  
classes.  
Clean room laboratories are used for work requiring especially  
dust-free filtered air, e.g. in microelectronics or for particularly  
dangerous substances, whose release into the surrounding rooms  
should be prevented by special air circulation and filtering \(micro-  
biology, gene technology\) *-7* 0.

Laboratories  
Cold laboratories are used for tasks requiring extreme tempera-  
ture conditions, photographic work and as darkrooms. Work-  
rooms without equipment installed also belong in the close lab-  
oratory area\:  
Study cubicles; social/rest rooms for laboratory staff; central  
rooms for general storage, chemical stores and issue, with par-  
ticular safety measures; isotope stores with decay containers etc.  
Animal laboratories are a special case, with rooms for keeping the  
animals, which have special equipment appropriate to the species  
and require their own air circulation.  
# Laboratory workstations  
The determining design unit for the laboratory workstation is the  
laboratory bench, permanently installed or mobile, whose dimen-  
sions together with the associated work and passage areas de-  
fine the laboratory axis, which forms the basic spatial unit \~ **0**  
# -e.  
Standard dimensions for the normal working bench\:  
120 em width in practical laboratories, several times that in re-  
search laboratories, 80 em depth work surface including socket  
strip\~ **9-** \(\).  
Benches and fume cupboards are mostly in the form of a building  
block system\: element widths 120 em, fume cupboards 120 and  
180cm\~o.  
The socket strip is an independent element with all electricity sup-  
ply systems. Benches and low-level cupboards are placed in front  
ofit\~e-o.  
Steel tubing supports the construction of laboratory benches,  
whose work surfaces are of artificial stone panels without joints,  
seldom tiled, and chemically resistant plastic panels. Low-level  
cupboards are of wood or plastic-coated chipboard. Supply ser-  
vices are fed from above out of the ceiling cavity or from below  
through the floor structure.  
# Ventilation  
Of low- or high-pressure systems, the latter are particularly rec-  
ommended for multi-storied institute buildings with large-scale air  
requirements, in order to reduce the ducts' cross-section. Cool-  
ing and humidification as required. Ventilation equipment has the  
highest demand for space of all services installations.  
All laboratories in which work with chemicals takes place must  
have artificial ventilation and extraction.  
Air changes per hour\: chemistry laboratories 8 times  
biology laboratories 4 times  
physics laboratories 3-4 times  
\(in the extraction area\)  
# Electrical installation  
Each building will need its own transformer station if the numbers  
of connections are high or if special electricity supplies are speci-  
fied. Electrical service rooms must be enclosed in fire-resistant  
walls and may not be crossed by other pipework or cables.

Many vertical supply lines, internally or on the fac;\:ade, run the  
media in individual shafts to the laboratories. Decentrally routed  
air supply and extraction ducts to the fume cupboards, separate  
ventilators on the roof.  
Advantage\: maximum individual supply; short horizontal connec-  
tions to laboratory bench.  
Disadvantage\: limited floor layout flexibility; greater space require-  
ment on working and services floors.  
Horizontal services system *--7* Cl!\>\:  
Vertical main services for all media concentrated in joint shafts  
and distributed horizontally from there into the services floors with  
upper or lower connection to laboratory benches.  
Advantages\: less space required in the services shafts, greater  
flexibility of floor layout, simpler maintenance, central ventilation  
equipment, better adaptability. High density of installation requires  
large amount of space. Vertical joint shafts are simpler, more  
accessible and allow revisions.  
Conduits should be insulated against condensation, heat, cold  
and noise transmission *--7* 0- e.

# Structure and fittings grid  
Good structural grids to achieve mostly column-free rooms have  
the following dimensions\:  
7.20 x 7.20 m, 7.20 x 8.40 m, 8.40 x 8.40 m, normal storey height  
4.0 m, clear room height \~3.0 m.  
The structural grid is a multiple of the typical planning grid of  
120 x 120 em \(decimetric system\). Reinforced concrete frame  
construction, as pre-cast elements or cast in situ, is preferred on  
account of the flexibility of plan.  
Following programme and layout requirements, with installation at  
high and low level, plus natural and artificial lighting and ventilation  
rooms, results in areas with different potential uses and techni-  
cal qualities. Laboratories therefore have large internal zones and  
are arranged as three-block facilities ---7 **0 - 0.** The length of the  
building is influenced by the maximum reasonable length of the  
horizontal runs of wet services .  
Columns are placed on a grid offset from the structural grid to  
increase the flexibility of servicing. Separation of areas is via a  
room-enclosing system consisting of partitions and suspended  
ceilings. Movable partitions should be easily operated and have  
chemical-resistant surfaces. Ceilings should permit disassembly  
and have sound insulation. Floor coverings should be resistant to  
water and chemicals, without joints and with low electrical con-  
ductivity. Normally, plastic roll flooring material or tiles with welded  
joints should be used.  
Windows in the doors or next to them are important to provide a  
view into laboratories.  
Isotope laboratories should have flat, non-porous ceiling and  
wall surfaces, rounded corners, be surrounded by lead and  
concrete, monitored waste water, and shower cubicles be-  
tween laboratory and exit. Concrete containers for active resi-  
dues or waste and concrete safes with lead doors etc. must be  
provided.  
Weighing tables are part of every laboratory, and are normally in-  
stalled in their own weighing room. The tables should be at the  
wall side of vibration-free walls.  
Services floors for plant are normally placed in the basement or  
on the top storey.

# MUSEUMS AND ART GALLERIES  
General  
A museum is a public collection of objects testifying to human  
cultural development. It collects, documents, receives, researches,  
interprets and communicates these through display.  
The following museum types can be categorised according to the  
origin and nature of the items in the collection\:  
**Art gallery\:** Collection of works of fine art \(including craftworks  
and graphics\).  
**Cultural history museum\:** Collection of devices, weapons, clothing,  
written documents etc. which show the cultural development of a  
geographically restricted area \(ethnological museum, open-air  
museum, local history museum\).  
**Ethnology museum\:** Works from the cultural heritage of traditional  
peoples and lost cultures.  
**Science museum\:** Collection of educational and display material  
connected with scientific and technical themes.  
# Lighting  
There should be no direct daylight falling on museum objects as  
this could cause damage. Therefore display rooms should be  
provided with flexible lighting systems\: no permanently built-in  
lights, no fixed wall and ceiling lights.  
Guidelines for lighting\:  
Very sensitive display objects  
Sensitive display objects\:  
Less sensitive display objects\:  
UV radiation must not be exceed 25 W/m2  
•  
50-80 lx  
100-150ix  
150-300 lx  
It must be possible to completely darken all display rooms. In  
public rooms where no items are displayed, e.g. entrance area,  
cafe, library, a greater amount of daylight is desirable.  
The lighting calculations for museums are highly theoretical\:  
the quality of lighting is decisive. American tests can be more  
informative.  
**Room climate in the store and the display areas**  
The ideal temperatures in the store and the display areas are  
15-18°C in the winter and 20-22°C in the summer. Except as  
short peaks, in the summer 26°C should not be exceeded. Stores  
should not therefore be located in uninsulated attics, for example.  
Because the reproduction of insects is very limited under 15°C,  
above all for science and ethnography collections a temperature  
of 12-13°C is optimal.  
Photo and film material is relatively chemically unstable and the  
material should therefore be stored cool and dry at temperatures  
under 16°C \(ideally at approx. 5°C\).  
The relative humidity in the store and the display areas depends  
on the displayed and stored materials\: the optimal values are  
for wood 55-60%, canvas 50-55%, paper 45-50% and metals,  
max. 40%. It is important to avoid short-term variations in relative  
humidity\: the variation within one hour should not exceed 2.5%,  
or not more than 5% in one day. Seasonal variations should not  
be more than +5% in summer or -5% in winter. The changing flow  
of visitors in museums leads to continuous variation in the climatic  
parameters.

Display Rooms  
The decisive factor in the layout of display rooms is the  
relationship between the collection and the way it is to be  
displayed \(display concept\). There are the following basic types  
of layout --7 **0 - 0\:**  
**Open plan --7 0\:** large and visually autonomous items on display,  
free circulation, function rooms in basement.  
**Core and satellite rooms --7 f\)\:** main room for orientation in the  
museum or the exhibition, side rooms for autonomous displays  
\(themes/collections\)  
**Linear chaining --7 0\:** linear sequences of rooms, controlled  
circulation, clear orientation, separate entrance and exit.  
**Labyrinth --7 0\:** free circulation, guided route and direction are  
variable, entrance and exit can be separate.  
**Complex --7 0\:** combined groups of rooms with typical features  
of --7 **0 - 0,** complex organisation of collection and display

# THEATRES  
Historical Review  
The design of theatres requires an understanding of complex  
functional interactions, of which much is explained by the history  
of theatres. This is an architectural challenge, which has been  
interpreted by various societies for more than 2500 years. Each  
theatre building today stands in a great tradition, even if it is  
marked by efforts to escape from this. A few examples should  
throw light on the historical development of this type of building *-'\>*

The theatre with boxes and a 'peephole' single-room stage steadily  
became more prevalent. Teatro 'San Carlo', Naples, p. 209 ---7 **0,**  
and Teatro alia Scala, Milan ---7 **0 + 8** are considered the models  
for the building of opera theatres in the 18th and 19th centuries,  
but also the new 'Met', in New York 1966.  
# 19th and 20th centuries  
Festival Opera House, Bayreuth ---7 **8 - 0.** Richard Wagner  
introduced this form of theatre \(auditorium in a classical semi-  
circle and rising\) and set a counterpoint to the Grand Opera in  
Paris. Totaltheater Project \(Gropius/Piscator\), cf. 'The Stage in the  
Bauhaus', Dessau 1924\. Note\: audience space can be rotated,  
stage with paternoster system, surrounding projection on walls and  
ceilings ---7 **9 - 0.** Playhouse on Lehniner Platz, Berlin, first large  
new building of a flexible theatre space \(rebuilding of the Mendelsohn  
building, 'Universurn', of 1928\) ---7 p. 213 ---7 **f!\)- f\).** Opera Bastille,  
Paris, the largest theatre yet, with 1 0 side stages on two levels.  
**Tendencies in current theatre building**  
There are two tendencies today\:  
1. Preservation, restoration and modernisation of existing theatres  
from the 19th to mid-20th century ---7 p. 218  
2. New buildings with 'experimental' open-space character, e.g.  
Playhouse on Lehniner Platz ---7 p. 213\. A similar direction is  
demonstrated by the many projects to rebuild existing spaces  
into workshop theatres with a size of 80-160 seats.  
# Different types of theatre building  
**1. Opera house\:**  
This belongs to the tradition of 18-19th century Italian opera  
buildings ---7 **0 - f\).** It is characterised by a clear spatial and  
architectural separation between auditorium and stage, by high  
numbers of seats **\(1** 000 to nearly 4000\) and the corresponding  
system of boxes or tiers, which is necessary for so many theatre-  
goers, e.g. Scala, Milan, 3600 seats; Deutsche Oper, Berlin,  
1986 seats; Metropolitan Opera, New York, 3788 seats; Opera  
Bastille, Paris, 2700 seats. The counterpoint to the form of opera  
house as tiered/box theatre is the Festival Opera House, Bayreuth  
---7 **8-0.** This is designed as a theatre with stalls according to the  
Greek and Roman pattern, but has only 1645 seats.  
**2. Playhouse\:**  
This is in the tradition of the German reform theatre of the 19th  
century. It is characterised by the stalls layout \(that is, the audience sit  
on a large, rising and curved floor\) and by a pronounced apron stage  
\(area in front of the proscenium\), which can be used for the play as  
well. The playhouse also, however, follows the tradition of the English  
theatre ---7 p. 209 **0.** i.e. theatre in the round. The open and variable  
layout became more intensive with the spatial experimentation of  
theatres in the 1970s. Variations in layout are shown, for example, by  
the Playhouse on Lehniner Platz, Berlin ---7 p. 213.  
# 3\. Multi-purpose theatre\:  
This mixed form of opera, theatre and ballet is a speciality in  
German-speaking regions. The space is mostly characterised by  
the predominant influence of the opera. The frequent changes of  
scenery are enabled by the appropriate subsidiary rooms \(store,  
scenery store, workshops\). Example\: Heilbronn City Theatre,  
Arch.\: Biste u. Gerling 1982 ---7 p. 217 **0.**  
# 4\. Musical theatre\:  
Actually no separate type of building, but rather a theatre built,  
usually, for a particular musical by an impresario. A specific  
challenge for the designer is the adaptation of the building to the  
concept of the musical without neglecting the needs of later uses  
for other productions. f--;;; 90 ----1 better 96--1 00

Auditorium  
In addition to the local building regulations, decisive for the design of  
theatres are the Places of Assembly Regulations of the relevant state.  
This is based on the Model Places of Assembly Regulations, which  
can vary in detail from those of a particular state! This legislation  
applies from 200 spectators. It should be noted that it is not the actual  
number of seating or standing places that counts\: it is assumed that  
there are two spectators per m2 in the place of assembly \(for rows of  
seats; two spectators per running m for standing places\).  
# Auditorium and stage/acting area  
Size of auditorium\: the number of people in the audience gives  
the required floor area. For seated spectators, assume E"\:0.5 m2/  
spectator. This number results from\:  
seat width x row spacing  
E"\:0.45 m2  
add E"\:0.5 x E"\:0.9

25 places per aisle if an exit door of 1.2 m width is available at the  
side per 3 or 4 rows -7 **0**  
Exits, escape routes 1.2 m wide per 200 people -7 **0-e.**  
1% of the seats \(at least two\) must be accessible for wheelchair users,  
if possible in connection with a seat for an accompanying person.  
# Auditorium volume  
This is determined by acoustic requirements \(reverberation\) -7  
p. 221 as follows\: playhouse approx. 4-5 m3/spectator; opera house  
approx. 6-8 m3/spectator. Air volumes must not be less for technical  
ventilation reasons, in order to avoid too rapid air changes \(draughts\).  
# Proportions of the auditorium  
These are derived from the psychological awareness and angle of  
view of the spectator, or the requirement for a good view from all  
seats. Options are\:  
1\. Good view, without moving head, but light eye movements of  
approx. 30°.  
2\. Good view with slight head movements and light eye  
movements of approx. 60° **0.**  
3. Max. awareness angle without head movement approx. 110°,  
i.e. all actions in the field are 'in view'. Outside this field, there  
is uncertainty, because 'something' is out of view.  
4. Full head and shoulder movement allows an angle of view of360°.

# THEATRES  
Seating  
The elevation \(gradient\) of the seating in the auditorium is  
derived from the sight lines. The sight line construction applies  
for all places in the auditorium \(stalls, but also tiers\) --7 **0.** It can  
be assumed that the spectators sit sensibly and so only every  
second row requires full sight super-elevation \(12 em\). Specialised  
mathematical literature addresses problems of view in the theatre,  
including, for example, the distribution of people's heights.  
Rows of spectators should be positioned in arcs, not only for  
better alignment toward the stage, but also to achieve a better  
perception of each other \(security effect\) --7 **8.** The stepped side  
aisle must rise 10-19 em and the tread must not be less than  
26 em. The floor between the seats must be on the same level as  
the adjacent aisle at the side.  
**Overall layout of the auditorium**  
Firstly, determine the height of the proscenium. In stalls theatres,  
the relationship should be\:  
proscenium height 1  
proscenium width 1.6  
This derives from the golden section and the physiological field of  
awareness, respectively --7 **0.** After determining the proscenium  
height, the ramp height, the pitch of the stalls and the volume of  
the room, this gives the room height. The ceiling is to be adapted  
for acoustic requirements. It should be the case that the noise  
reflected from the stage and apron is distributed evenly over the  
room --7 **0.**  
For tiers, it is important that there is also a sufficiently deep view  
of the stage from the uppermost level --7 **8-** This may render it  
necessary to make the proscenium higher.  
**Proportions of an experimental space --7 p. 213**  
These are neutral or open theatre spaces, which permit different  
arrangements of spectators and stage areas. This variable  
arrangement is achieved through\:  
A. Mobile stage platforms and mobile stands for the audience on  
a fixed floor.  
B. Mobile sections of floor, which consist of moveable podiums .  
This solution is technically more elaborate and is therefore  
used only in larger spaces for min. 150-450 or more people.  
The simpler option A is particularly suitable for smaller theatres  
and for unused spaces, which normally do not have extensive  
space underneath. Size\: up to max. 199 places, because the  
regulations apply from 200.  
199 seats x 0.5 m2 = 1 00 m2 \(2/3\) + 30 m2 \(1 /3\) stage area = 130 m2

# THEATRES  
Stage  
# Size of stage  
The Places of Assembly Regulations, which apply to all venues  
with audiences of more than 200, differentiate two types of stage\:  
large stage and open stage \(single-room theatre\).  
# Large stage  
Large stages are defined as having a stage area of more than  
200 m2 behind the stage opening and with an upper stage of  
2.5 m height above the stage opening or an apron. The essential  
requirement is the fire-resistant separation of stage and auditorium.  
This necessitates an iron protection curtain between the stage and  
the auditorium in case of danger.  
# Open stage  
Open stages are divided into those with more or less than 200 m2  
and those with or without sprinkler systems. The special feature of  
open stages is the regulations about curtains and scenery. These  
affect above all the operation and not the design of the open stage.  
Spaces for experimental forms of theatre \(black box theatres\)  
can abolish the separation of stage and audience in various ways  
through differentiated design of the floor topography \(mobile  
sections of floor or podiums\) and the free distribution of audience  
area and stage. Example\: Playhouse on the Lehniner Platz, Berlin

# Scenery stage  
The classical stage system of the 18th and 19th centuries had only  
the main stage; the scenes were changed, in little space and with  
uncanny speed, using sliding painted scenery. A small rear stage  
had the function of providing room for deeper stage perspectives  
\~o.  
# Full stage  
In order to be able to quickly change more elaborate and  
sculptural scenery structures, stages were supplemented by  
wings and under-stages of about the same size. Complete  
sets of scenery were mounted on wagons, lifting platforms or  
turntables and could be prepared with little effort during the  
performance\~ **e.**  
For design purposes, the technical constraints must be established  
early, e.g. whether a turntable on a wagon is sufficient or whether a  
turntable with single lifting elements or even a two-level turntable  
should be used.  
**Proportions of the stage**  
The proportions of the stage are developed from the sight lines in  
the auditorium. The stage is the area for acting and also a handling  
and working area. The conventional layout of a traditional full  
stage\~ **e-e.**  
The mobile scenery surface is formed by platforms of adjustable  
height or through lifting platforms. The variability of form is  
achieved by splitting the surface into separate flats. Basic  
module 1 x 2 m.  
**Section of stage**  
The size of the stage space is determined by the number of  
scenery sets to be kept ready, which can be moved into the  
stage quickly by lifting or pushing. At least one rear space and  
one wing are usual. The height of the stage space is determined  
by the \(iron\) safety curtain, which must be able to close the fire  
compartment between auditorium and stage within 30 s in case  
of fire. It is a complete closure joined at the ends to a fire wall  
\(F90\) and no cables or scenery are permitted in the space for the  
safety curtain.

Open stages require subsidiary areas for scenery and storage  
places for platforms and stands. The subsidiary areas should be of  
the same size as the stage. The space required for storage can be  
calculated from the folded platforms and stands. Subsidiary areas  
plus storage area amount to about 30% of the total area--\> **0.**  
Considerably less scenery is used with open stages than with  
normal stages, the reasons for which are\:

T  
A rough estimate for the size of the scenery and costume store  
can be made from the number of productions in the repertoire and  
the frequency with which they are played. For theatres the number  
of productions might be 15-20 and for multi-purpose theatres and  
opera up to 50 per season. About 20-25% of the stage area is  
required for storage per production, i.e. for theatres about 3 times  
the stage area, for the opera at least 10 times. Practice shows  
that, as time passes, the store always turns out to be too small,  
and theatres, and particularly operas, have to make arrangements  
outside the building.  
The high cost of transport has forced the introduction of the  
most modern transportation and storage technology\: container  
systems with computer-controlled warehouse technology \(per  
performance about 2-4 containers - in special cases for operas  
about 12 containers\).

the stage --\> **0**  
Nationaltheater Mannheim\: storage outside the building in

Workshops and Staff Rooms  
**Workshops for production of scenery**  
The area required for scenery workshops is 4-5 times the main  
stage area for medium-sized theatres \(theatres and multi-purpose  
theatres\); in large opera houses or double theatres \(opera  
and theatre\), **1** 0 times. Workshops, in or outside the building,  
should always be accommodated on one level. The Workplace  
Regulations and their technical rules and the work protection  
and accident prevention rules of insurers have to be taken into  
account in the design. In some cases, the company and collective  
agreements with the employees can also have an effect.  
Scenery workshops are categorised as follows\:  
a\) Painting room\:  
The floor area must be designed to accommodate two large  
backdrops or 'cycloramas' \(Rundhorizonte - curved backdrops\)  
rolled out on the floor for painting. The average size of a cyclorama  
is 10 x36 m.lt must be possible to sub-divide the room with a thick  
curtain for spraying work. Also required are underfloor heating to  
dry the painted backdrops; wooden floors for spreading out the  
canvases; a gallery from which to check the work lying on the  
floor. The painting room is located next to the sewing room \(with  
a size about 14 of the painting room\) joining the pieces of material.  
b\) Carpenter's shop\:  
Divided into bench and machine rooms, it has wooden floors and  
an adjoining timber store for 3-10 productions.  
c\) Upholstery\: approx. 1/10 area of painting room.  
d\) Metalwork\: as carpenter's shop, screeded floor.  
e\) Sculpture workshop.  
f\) Workshops should be grouped round an assembly room, which  
serves to test-assemble the scenery and has the same floor area  
as the stage. The height should be proscenium plus 2 m, diameter  
9-10m.  
g\) Changing, washing, and rest \(canteen\) rooms are to be provided  
for technical staff, and offices for the technical management.  
Further workshops for sound, lighting, props and costumes, size  
as required \(production intensity, personal equipment\).  
# Personnel rooms  
Artistic staff, stage manager, administration. Historically, personnel  
rooms were situated on both sides of the stage\: left, ladies, right,  
gentlemen, although this was operationally impractical. Today,  
these rooms are located on one side, opposite the technical side  
on several floors. This includes make-up, frequently also the  
costume workshop, administration and stage manager.

Rehearsal rooms  
Every theatre needs at least one rehearsal stage to back up the main  
stage. For example, a small theatre\: the main stage has the scenery  
of the current play and the rehearsals take place on the rehearsal  
stage. The dimensions should correspond to the main stage. Typical  
floor plan of the rehearsal stage of a traditional theatre -7 0. Multi-  
purpose theatres and opera houses also require\: orchestra rehearsal  
room -7 e, chorus rehearsal room -7 e, soloist rehearsal room and  
ballet room.  
Experimental theatres  
These also require, in reduced form, staff and rehearsal rooms,  
workshops and stores, if in continual operation.  
Technical rooms  
Rooms for transformer, medium- and low-voltage switchgear,  
emergency power supply batteries, air conditioning and ventilation  
plant, water supply \(rainwater system\), according to local conditions  
and specialist design work.  
Public rooms  
The classical Italian opera had only narrow entrances and stairs,  
with no actual foyer. This makes the generous public rooms at the  
Grand Opera in Paris particularly impressive. The Vienna theatre  
fire in 1881 led to extensive changes\: the audience is now required  
to have enclosed emergency stairs for each tier. This requirement  
continues in principle today \(Public Assembly Regulations\).  
In the traditional theatre, the foyers are split into\: actual foyer  
\(lobby\), restaurant \(buffet\), smoker's foyer. Area of the foyers  
0.8-2.0 m2/spectator \(more realistic is 0.6-0.8 m2/spectator\). The  
function of the foyer has changed today\: it must include provision  
for exhibitions, performances and regular plays there.  
Cloakrooms  
Per 1 00 visitors\: 4 running m of rail. Sometimes lockers are also  
provided\: one locker for every four visitors. The foyer is also a  
waiting and queuing room, and has the usual extent of associated  
WCs\: one WC/1 00 people. 1fa gents, *2fa* ladies; min. one gents' and  
one ladies' WC. Total number of sanitary facilities\: -7 p. 216 G\).

Modernisation and Extension  
**Saxony State Theatre, Radebeul**  
The home base of a renowned travelling theatre that covers  
the entire spectrum of a multi-purpose stage company \(music,  
dance, theatre\) consisted before rebuilding of a conglomeration  
of extensions and reconstructions at various times of a former  
hotel hall. The intention was to relieve the resulting functional  
and organisational problems and improve the external  
appearance.  
The entrance for the audience was extended with a new two-  
storey foyer area of steel and glass, in which the cloakrooms,  
lobby and a snack bar could be integrated.  
An extension of the storeroom and wings was possible only on  
one side because of the plot boundaries and the topographical  
situation, but the mostfunctional possible connection of workshops,  
rehearsal rooms and props was still the intention. Another feature  
was the improvement of fire protection and workplace safety.  
The existing stage equipment was only renewed and slightly  
extended. No elaborate solutions like lifting platforms or turntables  
were planned, in order that plays developed here can also be  
presented on simple stages on tour.  
The extension of the existing building with new elements will still  
be possible after completion.

# Concert houses  
Intended for musical performances, but other uses are also possible \(congresses, lectures etc.\),  
can also if required be supplemented by chamber music hall, rehearsal hall, tuning and warming up  
rooms and stores. Hall sizes of 1500 and 2000 \(in isolated cases 2800\) seats in the audience have  
become usual, for chamber music 400 to 700 seats.  
# Acoustic multi-purpose rooms  
Churches were the first form of  
concert hall, with strong rever-  
beration. The echo increases the  
holiness of the place, but domes  
and vaults are problematic for  
sermons and orchestral music.  
The first theatres and opera hous-  
es were stages and auditoriums  
installed into existing halls.  
There was good understanding  
of speech due to the open view  
and short distance to the stage,  
but insufficient reverberation due  
to decoration with soft materials  
and surfaces with little reflection  
of sound.  
In a tiered theatre, the stalls are  
surrounded on three sides by  
tiers, generally leading to short  
reverberation times, as empty  
wall surfaces are obstructed by  
boxes and galleries and are full  
of people. This is advantageous  
for the understanding of speech  
but music sounds rather dull and  
toneless.  
# Concert halls  
Today four types of concert hall  
are common \(possibly modified\)\:  
block, arena, fan and horseshoe  
-\> **0 - 0.** The selection of hall  
type depends on the urban plan-  
ning situation, intended space and  
acoustic requirements. uo

# CONCERT HALLS  
Technical Requirements, Organ, Orchestra  
There is little stage equipment\: elements of floor structure in  
the area for the orchestra, adjustable wall and ceiling fixtures,  
transport aids, loudspeakers and lighting equipment.  
# Lifts to extend/reduce the stage  
Large concert halls have special compartmentalised systems  
in the orchestra area to make various orchestra configurations  
possible, enlarge the stage area or maximise the number of seats  
in the hall by placing seating units on lifts. There is also transport  
of items between basement and stage, electrical spindle drive  
with limited lift and low raising speed.  
# Mobile seating units  
The lifting platforms can be lowered to allow a smaller stage and  
the positioning of additional seating, which can be in the form of  
mobile units.  
# Orchestra stage  
Modular system with flexible stage options for music groups.  
Transport and storage is on storage wagons in the store room.  
The floor covering matches the concert platform.  
# Choir platforms  
Additional to the choir seats, when extra space is required, large  
seating platforms are rolled onto the stage and mounted in front  
of the fixed choir seating; the seating in both types is identical.  
Access is via detachable balcony elements in the choir seating  
area or up temporary stairs on the choir platform.  
**Mixing desk**  
Area consisting of three rows in the auditorium stalls; can be  
quickly adapted for the most varied performance and conference  
conditions.  
A motorised platform under the stalls can be occupied in various  
ways\: mobile seating unit, mobile mixing desk, or empty \(e.g. if  
guest musicians bring their own mixing desk\).  
# Cyclorama scaffold  
Motorised tubular scaffold, used to fix curtains and banners,  
portable stage lighting and other production elements at the  
rear of the stage, and can if required be partially or completely  
dismantled.  
# Organ built into the concert hall  
There is no fixed standard for the layout, with organs being  
designed musically and architecturally for each individual space;  
it is an important visual eye-catcher. The location of the organ  
should be at the back of the stage, with a location in front of the  
back wall being ideal, free-standing and not in a niche.  
The size depends on the volume of the hall, acoustics, position in the  
room, number of seats, musical requirements \(solo or accompanist  
instrument\). The better the acoustics and the location of the organ,  
the smaller can it be -+ **0-0.**  
To the depth of the organ housing should be added\: 1-2 m for  
the organist and min. 0.5 m for tuning access behind the organ,  
min. 1.5 m free space necessary above the organ *-t* **0 - 0.**  
In concert halls, a second organ platform is necessary \(electric,  
mobile\); this is placed near the orchestra, so the organist becomes  
part of the orchestra. The dimensions depend on the size of the  
organ-+ **0 + 4!\).** Necessary cable connections should be provided.  
# Orchestra sizes and layouts  
The various orchestra seating layouts, formerly German and today  
mostly American, are important for the sound in the hall *-t* **0-f\).**  
The following sizes of orchestra are usual today in Europe and  
North America\: large symphony orchestra with 60-150 musicians  
and chamber orchestra with 25-40 musicians; this determines  
the additional space requirement on the stage \(e.g. Gewandhaus  
Leipzig, approx. 180m2\). AP.

# CONCERT HALLS  
Acoustics  
The most important objective in designing a concert hall is a  
superb sound. Acoustics result from the interaction of various  
elements\: size, volume and proportions of the concert space,  
number and arrangement of the seats, materials used, surfaces  
and finishes.  
The sound properties of various instruments and the human  
\(singing\) voice have to be taken into account, alone and together,  
and also differences in pitch range and character \(volume,  
frequency distribution and time structure of a sound\). The various  
layouts of the orchestra are of significance for the sound in the  
hall\: the positioning of various groups of instruments \(particularly  
the string section\).  
For the effect of the instruments in the hall, the relationship of the  
sound travelling directly to the listener to the early reflection from  
the sides plays a decisive role ---\> **0.**  
Optimal reverberation is important for the quality of hearing\:  
excessive reverberation reduces clarity, and too little reverberation  
makes music sound dull. It is dependent on air changes/person  
\(older concert halls 4-5m3/seat, newer over 6-15m3/seat\).  
The acoustics are influenced by hall size, shape and \(surface\) material  
used; these can be adapted for different acoustic requirements  
through the selection of various materials. The following variants are  
possible and usual\:  
# Acoustic reflector  
Installed over the stage, this is an adjustable, wide, heavy, sound-  
reflecting surface consisting of two or three independent sections;  
each section must be 2-3 m above the stage and adjustable up  
to 2 m under the ceiling. The height and position of reflectors is  
determined by the type of concert\: smaller concerts, light chamber  
music and concerts with string instruments require a lower height  
for the reflectors.  
# Sound-absorbing curtains and banners  
These influence the length and strength of the reverberation  
\(lowered by widening the curtains\). If not required, the curtains  
are retracted into curtain niches \(and must then be without effect\).  
# Acoustic regulation spaces \(promenades\)  
Additional volume can be gained for works with long reverberation  
\(those for organ, large orchestras and large choirs, as well as with  
acoustic amplification\) through the extension of the auditorium.  
Access passages and foyer areas can be used for this. They can  
be opened into the hall with movable panels using central control.

Projection  
Before embarking on the design of a cinema, ask the advice of a  
cinema equipment company.  
**Picture projection\:** Fire-separation materials are no longer  
required in the projection room due to the use of safety film. One  
projectionist operates a number of projectors, so the projection  
room is no longer considered as continuously occupied by staff.  
It has 1 m spacing from the projector at the back and on the  
operator side, 2.80 m height, ventilation and extraction, and sound  
insulation to the auditorium. The projection rooms of several  
auditoriums can be combined together.  
Film widths are 16 mm, 35 mm and 70 mm. The centre of the  
projection beam should not deviate more than so horizontally and  
vertically from the centre of the screen or it should be redirected  
by a deflection mirror *-'\>* **0.**  
Conventionally, two projectors are operated with cross-blending.  
Automated operation with one projector plus horizontal film tray  
showing 4000 m reels without pause has become established  
worldwide, in many projection rooms remotely run from projection  
and control points. The film gives automatic signals for all  
projection functions like lens changing, hall lighting, stage lighting,  
curtain and picture covering.  
**Picture sizes\:** These depend on the distance of the projector  
from the screen and having a height-side relationship of 1 \:2.34  
\(Cinemascope\) or 1 \:1.66 \(wide screen\) with a narrow auditorium  
width. The angle from the centre of the back row of seating to the  
outer edge of the picture should not exceed, for Cinemascope,  
38° = distance of the back row \: screen = 3\:2 *-7* **f\) - e.**

is min. 120 em; according to cinema size and system this can be  
reduced to 50 em on the setting up of the sound system.

**Auditorium\:** This should receive no incoming light except for  
emergency lighting. The walls and ceilings should be of non-

Up to a 10% floor gradient is permissible, or else steps with max.

be arranged on each side of each aisle \~ **e.**  
# Acoustics  
Adjacent auditoriums should be separated by walls of approx.  
85 dB 18-20 000 Hz \~ p. 222 **0.** The ceiling should feature  
sound-directing surfaces with low acoustic delay difference  
time.  
The reverberation time can increase with growing auditorium  
volume and reduces from 0.8 to 0.2 s from low to high frequencies.  
\~ p. 222. The rear wall behind the last row of seats should have  
an insulated surface to prevent echo .  
Loudspeakers are distributed in the auditorium so that the  
difference in volume between the front and back rows does not  
exceed 4 dB.  
**Sound reproduction**  
In addition to mono optical sound reproduction, the Dolby  
stereo optical system with four channels will be required in the  
future, using three loudspeaker combinations behind the screen  
and additional speakers at the sides and back. For 70 mm  
film, 6 channel magnetic sound, there are additional speaker  
combinations behind the screen. With BTX, behind the screen  
there is a sound-absorbing wall \(following the Lucas film system\),  
in which the loudspeaker combinations are installed.  
**Cash desks**

**Types of cinema**  
**'Programme cinemas'\:** As a counter-trend to multiplex  
cinemas \~ p. 224, city centres have seen the establishment of  
'programme cinemas', which mostly show specialist films. Sizes  
of 50-200 seats are usual, normally in combination with eating/  
drinking facilities\~ **0.**  
**Circarama/Panorama cinemas\:** Round or spherical screens  
increase the impression of being directly involved in the action.  
Because special film techniques are required for these \(a  
number of cameras have to film the same view simultaneously\),  
there are only a few films available, and this type of cinema  
is therefore restricted to adventure parks and planetariums \~

# Projector  
With a number of screens of various sizes in one building, multiplex  
cinemas are often combined with shopping centres, car parks etc,  
which require extensive parking space \~ p. 225. The auditoriums  
are reached via a common entrance and sometimes stacked. On  
account of the large numbers of visitors, good orientation and  
clear signing to the individual screens is important. The location of  
the screens in relation to the entrance foyer should be according  
to their size \(large screens nearest to the foyer\), or the largest  
screen in a central location/on the direct route from the foyer. The  
sizes of the single auditoriums depend on the requirements of the  
operator, as also the spacing of the rows, foyer design etc.  
The cash desk zone should be near the entrance, the number of  
desks dependent on the number of seats\: approx. 5 m2 floor areal  
cash desk; for 2500 seats, approx. 6-8 cash desks.  
The entrance foyer should be of generous proportions, clearly laid  
out and at a prominent location in the building; it includes the main  
entrance, food/drink counters and access to the screens. Before  
the access points to the individual screens on different floors,  
there are normally additional foyers with bar counters, WCs etc.  
The main foyer should be of adequate size for events \(premieres,  
presentations etc.\).  
Because eating and drinking are normally a significant part of the  
cinema concept, counters should be provided in central locations  
with the necessary storage and service facilities.  
# Cinema auditorium  
The screen should fill the entire wall; there should be no exits in  
this wall or the side walls near to it. Cross-passages should be  
provided as a connection between the doors or at a side entrance  
to reach the side aisles \~ p. 235.  
# Projection room  
Minimum room size\: 6.50 x 2.80 x 2.80 m 0/IJ x D x H\). Projection  
window size approx. 150/250 x 50 em \(one or two projectors\) Film  
can be supplemented by video projectors, and space should also  
be provided for horizontal film tray equipment and control desk.  
The platform under the projectors should be vibration-free. A  
noise level of approx. 75 dB must be damped to 30 dB by the  
projection window. The working temperature should not exceed  
22oc in order to protect film copies and equipment.  
# Subsidiary rooms  
These are to be provided as required\: offices for the manager,  
secretary and employees, archive, IT room, staff rooms \(changing  
rooms, ladies' and gents' WCs, staff rest room\).  
For the foyer and food/drink area\: catering stores, counter stores,

# Zoo  
The modern zoo attempts to balance the interests of research, animal protection and  
**the experience of nature.**  
On one side stand the requirements for keeping the animals, feeding, cage design  
and veterinary care in line with the needs of the species, research activities for the  
conservation of species, participation In international breeding programmes and zoo  
educational publicity work.  
**On the other hand, the zoo is also a business, whose success mainly depends on**  
visitor numbers and is in competition with other leisure providers.  
**The basis of any zoo design is therefore the orientation on the state of research Into**  
the keeping of animals In a way suitable for the species, and also the consideration of  
the demands of the potential visitors. The staging of exotic \("near to nature"\) animal  
worlds and spectacular visitor facilities should therefore be evaluated against this  
background.

Keeping Animals  
**'Hands-on',** the traditional principle of keeping zoo animals\: it  
denotes direct contact between the \(tame\) animals, the keepers  
\(feeding, care\) and the zoo visitors \(petting zoo\) ---7 **e.**  
Functional aspects include separation into public and private or  
invisible areas, assignment of visitor areas, enclosures, keeper  
access and subsidiary rooms. The most important aspects are  
hygienic considerations and the presentation of the animals.  
**Hands-off'** \(protected contact\) was originally developed as a  
safe method of handling dangerous animals \(indirect, technically  
supported contact between animal and keeper\), and today often  
corresponds to the expectations of zoo visitors for species-  
appropriate keeping of animals in zoos ---7 **0\:** The large area  
and natural character of the reproduced original habitat, with  
appropriate fixed points \(drinking trough, climbing rocks, etc.\) and  
the possibility of observing from selected and protected \(secretive\)  
positions are also seen as desirable regarding lack of disturbance  
and encouraging reproduction in human care. "Hands-off"  
facilities have excellent potential for research and breeding.

partially roofed area can be divided into various sections from a control  
centre by means of mechanical gates. The visitor areas are separated  
from the enclosures by water-filled ditches or differences in level  
The great ape house at Wuppertal Zoo ---7 **8** is an **animal house**

Enclosures  
# Design aspects  
**Near to nature\:** The enclosure should correspond to the ideas of  
the visitors regarding the appropriate habitat for the animals, be  
aesthetically pleasing and give a generous impression.  
**Physical nearness\:** The nearer people can come to the animals,  
the greater the interest and the longer they stay.  
**Emotional nearness\:** Enclosure boundaries should scarcely be  
noticed.  
**Observation\:** Animal enclosures should work secretively and be  
an invitation to exploration \(e.g. view into the enclosure through  
a cave or a waterfall\). Routes should invite lingering, not passing  
an enclosure but rather leading to it. It should be possible to see  
only one enclosure from each location; distracting views, and also  
masses of people in front of the enclosure, should be avoided.  
Enable comfortable observation in a relaxed position, not into  
the sun or through a reflecting pane of glass; the visitor should  
look into a bright, lit enclosure from shadow \(this also has the  
advantage that the animals do not immediately notice the visitors\).  
Areas where the animals like to pass the time and are active should  
be clearly visible.  
**Withdrawal\:** It is, however, also important that the animal can  
withdraw from view and be unobserved.  
**Information\:** Signage; sufficient information should be available  
**Accessibility\:** Access to the enclosures \(only for the zoo keepers\)  
is provided by dedicated roads and care areas; the appropriate  
animal catching and transport facilities are here.  
# Barriers  
**Ditches** were originally developed as dry ditches, but are today  
generally constructed as **water barriers \(moats\)-+ 8.** A natural  
appearance is advantageous, but the water becomes dirty quickly  
and the animals can leave the enclosure over the ice if it freezes  
over, so the water level therefore has to be lowered in winter. There  
are normally fences or walls to provide additional protection.  
**Glass** is becoming accepted by most zoos -+ **8 + 0,** because it  
gives the impression of direct contact with the animals and also  
prevents the infection of animals by humans.  
**Iron bars** disturb the visitor and the animal. The classic method  
of keeping animals in cages is therefore avoided in modern zoos.

Office work  
Administrative work is the pro-  
cessing of information. The empha-  
sis of office work is changing from  
routine processing of data \(tradi-  
tional card systems\) to more creative  
information processing and evalua-  
tion on account of changes in stor-  
age and improved ways of access-  
ing information.  
Employees are becoming ever  
more important in the organ-  
isation of office work. Factors  
like the image of the company  
\(corporate identity\), design of ar-  
eas for breaks and relaxation and  
the individual configuration of  
workplaces are all intended to in-  
crease employees' performance.  
Global networking means that  
routine work can be carried out  
on a decentralised basis \(home  
working, neighbourhood and  
rented offices\).  
The company headquarters is  
becoming an information market  
place, which is made use of by  
many employees either tempor-  
arily or in changing groups to  
achieve their tasks. These chang-  
es result in the very variable dem-  
ands made on the workplace in an  
office building.  
The range of options runs from  
the single workplace in a cubicle  
office through group rooms to  
workstations which are only used  
at specific times \('hot desking'\).  
The more flexible the rooms in  
a building are, the easier it is for  
the company to adapt to ever-  
changing requirements.  
Design  
Detailed recording of the business  
and organisational structure, and  
thus the specific functions and  
working relationships in the com-  
pany, enable the determination of  
a schedule of requirements \(needs  
assessment\).  
In rented buildings, flexible room  
layout is of great importance, to  
achieve the most variable sizes of  
office unit possible.

# OFFICE BUILDINGS  
Tendencies/Criteria  
# Influence of information technology and office automation  
The developments in information and communication technologies  
are leading to changed working conditions in offices.  
Multifunctional terminals are replacing single components in data,  
text and image processing. Individual systems are being networked  
into integrated office communication systems. The ever-improving  
public data networks \(ISDN, DSL, 3G\) make it possible to exchange  
great quantities of data over long distances. Flat screens, laptops  
and mobile telephones reduce the amount of space required at  
each workstation. The effect of office technology on the office  
layout and workstations is creating evaluation criteria like\: more  
emphasis on immediate workplace quality; ensuring company-  
wide flexibility; ecologically sound working environment, to whose  
spatial configuration older office buildings no longer measure up.  
New Workplace Regulations stipulate working areas according to  
demand \(no more minimum areas\).  
The rationalisation potential of administrative activities \(filing,  
sorting, copying, searching, acquisition of material\) and  
communication activities \(conferences, meetings\) is about 25%  
of weekly working time. Routine tasks acting as active relaxation  
breaks would be reduced by about 50%. Increasing telecommuting  
leads to a reduction in office space, because only some activities  
\(meetings etc.\) then take place in the office building at specific  
workstations, which are no longer personalised and can be  
used by various employees as required \('hot-desking'\). Personal  
areas are reduced to office containers, which contain a post  
box and files. Mobile telephone and computer WLAN networks  
make a change of location simple. The potential independence  
of location \(decentralisation\) is countered by other possible  
losses \(concentration of staff at central locations, headquarters  
in prestigious situation, urban location as sign of continuity,  
ambience, work and leisure activities in one place\), which can play  
important roles.  
**Changes at the workplace**  
The rationalisation effect of information technology and altering  
workplace requirements \(procedures and organisational pattern\)  
are changing the structure of offices. Staff levels are falling and  
work groups are getting smaller. The former hierarchical division of  
labour among staff, like manager, secretary, specialist employee  
etc., is changing to integrated work groups and thus altering the  
assignment of office space.  
A more sensitive relationship to the direct working environment  
is closely linked to the predominant value orientation in  
the company. This is reflected in the attitude to the quality  
of the workplace \(daylight, environmental context, energy  
consumption\), and the activity \(ecological viewpoints, material  
use, waste disposal\). The workplace is an important place  
for social interaction among the users, which is increasing  
in relevance due to formalised work structures \(IT, work  
organisation etc.\). Increased mental and physical stress leads  
to a greater awareness of the working environment \(sufficient  
space, some personal choice in furnishings, ventilation, lighting,  
sufficient protection from disruptions\). 75% of daily work takes  
place at the 'close and extended workplace' *--1* **f\).** Necessary  
work contacts and collectively used facilities are significant, thus  
the requirement for a mixed provision of single and group rooms,  
'personal' and 'collective' workplaces *--1* **0 - 0.** In addition to  
the refurbishment of existing office space, new spatial concepts  
involving single and group rooms are starting to appear \(Fuchs,

OFFICE BUILDINGS  
Typology Until 1980  
Forms of office organisation  
Open-plan offices \(Mies van der Rohe\: ' ... clearly laid-out, undivided,  
only structured .. .' --\> refs\) are suitable for large groups of employees  
who are predominantly engaged in shared work and for routine  
activities with a low concentration threshold. This is increasingly  
the exception rather than the rule today. The concept appeared in  
the 1960s with arguments like transparency and manageability of  
work processes, development of community feeling, and a rationally  
organised multifunctional area. IT machines were in separate rooms  
and not available in offices. The extensive room depths of 20-30 m  
resulted in high costs for building services, which is of limited suitability  
for the conversion of buildings, and the potential flexibility has its limits  
in the light of today's demands \(opening windows, control of lighting,  
air conditioning and electricity supply\) \(Henkel --\> refs\). The open-  
plan office is attested by sociologists to be afflicted with a character  
of compulsion \(social controls, dependence on technical equipment,  
optical and acoustic disturbance\), and therefore led to a negative  
reaction among its occupants.

Single-room offices are suitable for independent or concentrated  
work, as a single-person room or for a few people in very small  
groups who need to exchange information constantly. This  
arrangement has been common in Germany since World  
War II and still has its justification when the requirements of the  
workplace correspond \(--\> Gruner, Jahr; Steidle, Kissler; or --\> new  
offices for the Federal Environment Office, Dessau, Sauerbruch,  
Hutton\) or in newbuild high-rise offices, where the structure of the  
building can be so decisive that it leads to the very standardised  
character of spatial and organisational working practices.  
Reversible offices constituted an attempt to improve the working  
conditions in open-plan offices, which are often found to be  
inadequate on many grounds \(no differentiated air conditioning,  
daylight, optical and acoustic disturbance\). The possibility  
of partitioning producing a more effective single-room office  
structure \(i.e. cubicles\) when required for more concentrated work  
considerably increased technical input to enable flexibility. However,  
not only the dissatisfaction of the users but also the increasing lack  
of cost-effectiveness with increasing energy prices led to this form of  
office being questioned. The working structure as changed by new  
technologies \(e.g. the use of PCs\) enabled organisation into small  
groups. First example\: the building of the OVA, Mannheim.  
Group rooms \(smaller open-plan\) are suitable for work groups  
with constant information exchange. This form of office was an  
attempt to install room layouts with more scope for individual  
decisions \(--\> Changes at the workplace, p. 232 \), via the  
size of the workplace surroundings \(max. 7.5 m to a window\),  
and thus improve the working conditions of an open-plan  
arrangement \(light, air, individuality\), which were found to be  
inadequate with the increasing demands on office work. It is  
possible to do without full air conditioning in favour of back-up  
ventilation services, in addition to opening windows and using  
radiators.

# OFFICE BUILDINGS  
Typology Since 1980  
The continuing progress of information technology is resulting in  
new job descriptions for employees. The requirements for office  
space are also changing and often require the **refurbishment** of  
existing office buildings. An additional factor of equal importance is  
that the open-plan configuration has been found to be inadequate  
\(-'\> **Changes at the workplace,** p. 232\).  
The means used for this reorganisation are rebuilding, provision  
of daylight from inner courtyards, straightforward plan layouts,  
creation of workplaces of equal rank with regard to light, air and  
sound reduction, or the use of office furnishing systems, which  
can increasingly undertake the function of building services like  
cabling, sockets etc., and also of partitions.  
The **combi-office** principle attempts to provide a suitable room  
concept for the specific requirements of an office organisation. This  
entails a room arrangement that is flexible where required, enables  
group work, provides individual rooms for concentrated work and  
a temporarily usable collective layout for particular communal  
activities. It is particularly suitable for independent, highly qualified  
work where the workplace can change with the daily programme.  
**'Hot desk offices' or 'business clubs'** are not spatial layouts but  
denote a particularly flexible organisation of work without fixed  
personal workplaces. Particular value is placed on variable room  
use possibilities and differentiated room qualities. For combi-  
groups and open-plan offices, efficiency is not achieved through  
rebuilding of rooms but via the business organisation and a flexible  
'club' atmosphere conducive to wellbeing.  
In new buildings, this experience leads to more value being  
placed on reversibility, in order to be able to react better to the  
ever-shorter innovation cycles of office technology. This leads to  
buildings which can be divided into user units of varying sizes  
without great inconvenience **\(rented offices\) -'\>8 - e,** or even  
permit a combination of production and administration **\(start-up**  
**centres\) *-'\>* 8.** The changed values regarding the workplace, plus  
high energy prices, are leading to new architectural forms with  
building elements intended to provide temperature regulation and  
natural ventilation \(conservatories, halls, double fac;\:ades\).

Space Requirement  
# Workplace  
According to the new Workplace  
Regulations, there are no longer any  
fixed minimum dimensions for work-  
places. But the requirements of the  
accident insurers and the fact that  
all workplaces today have computer  
screens means that the minimum  
dimensions in the relevant DIN EN  
standards and regulations apply.  
# Furniture areas  
The standard no longer prescribes  
fixed dimensions for workplaces,  
but requires sufficient working  
and movement areas for changing  
positions at work and for the  
individually adaptable placing of  
work equipment.  
The assignments of various areas  
are differentiated by the standard;  
however, they can overlap if this  
results in no limitation of the function.  
The areas are\:  
- work area\: table  
- shelf area\: plan area of the  
furniture  
- furniture function area\: space  
required for doors and drawers  
- movement area at the workstation  
- traffic and through-passages  
# Forms of office and work  
The office's form and thus its room  
layout are part of a system influe-  
nced by activity, procedural organ-  
isation, IT technology and company  
culture. The building structure and  
design of rooms can have a signifi-  
cant influence on the use. Efficiency  
gains can result from factors like  
reduction of the area per worksta-  
tion, rooms designed to support  
procedures and improve motivation,  
for which emotional factors above all  
are decisive, like material and colour  
ideas, but also the provision of quiet  
and communication areas for formal  
and informal meetings. The analysis  
of requirements can produce valu-  
able pointers to possible forms of  
office.

Computer Workstations  
Workstations are where elements such as computer screen,  
alphanumeric keyboard and document or sound recording device are  
decisive for dealing with the work. Computer workstations are not  
based on one standard solution but according to the specific work  
procedure \(e.g. information point, data entry point etc.\).  
The regulations are laid down in ZH 1/618, 'Safety rules for visual  
display workstations in office areas', issued by the Association of  
Commercial Accident Insurance Companies. They include\:

- ZH 1/535 'Safety rules for office workstations'  
- VDI and VDE \(German engineering and electrical associations\) standards

# Workplace layout  
Items which are frequently used during the working day should be  
put in the preferred places where they are visible and reachable ---7  
**0 - 0.** There should be a free movement area of at least 1.5 m2 at  
the workstation.  
**Furniture\:** This should enable the correctly defined working posture -  
upper arm and elbow vertical at an angle of approx. goo and thigh and  
lower leg vertical at an angle of goo ---7 **0.** To achieve the correct posture  
for people of different heights, table and chair sizes must be adjustable.  
Two ergonomicaHy equaHy valuable possibilities are\:

There should be sufficient legroom ---7 **0.**  
The desktop working area should be at least 120 x 80 em \(few  
documents, predominantly screen work; for specialist employees, at  
least 200 x 80 em\)  
**Environment\:** AU furniture in the immediate vicinity \(desktop etc.\)  
should have a coefficient of reflection of 20-50%.  
Lighting intensity should be 300-500 lx, and lamps have limited glare,  
e.g. through recessed ceiling grid luminaires or 2-K lighting ---7 p. 501-  
51 0. Light bands should be arranged parallel to the window. Matt  
surfaces in the room with recommended coefficients of reflection  
\(approx\: ceiling 70%, walls 50%, partitions 20-50%\).  
The view to the screen should be parallel to the window fagade and to  
light bands, with the screen if possible in-between. Install computer  
workstations in windowless zones.  
Recommendations for climatic conditions and sound reduction  
should be complied with. The increased use of equipment in offices  
will more probably result in a cooling load rather than a heating load  
\(---7 p. 466\).  
# Psychology of the computer workstation  
Negative effects can arise for the management that determines  
computer work if a strategy of rationalisation is pursued which excludes  
the employees from the working process as much as possible and  
attempts to restrict them to residual activities. Prof. Walter Volpert \(---7  
refs\) formulated nine criteria for the design of workstations, which define  
contrasting \(machine-person\) work tasks with the foHowing features\:  
- wide scope for action and decision  
- reasonable amount of time allowed  
- possibility of personal structuring of demands  
- performing tasks free of hindrance  
-sufficient physical activity  
- stimulation of varied senses  
- concrete handling with real objects \(or direct social relations\)  
- possibility of variations  
- encouragement and enabling of social cooperation and immediate  
contact between people

Filing  
Despite the application of new office technologies, the use of paper as  
the main information storage medium has increased. Until1980, paper  
consumption doubled every four years. Computer-aided storage is  
increasingly used as information depository in office communication  
systems. Letters, texts and newspapers, which are described as  
uncoded information, will continue to be part of the paper volume.  
Purpose\: Clearly arranged ordering and storage of files within short  
walking distance and efficient exploitation of the space. Space  
requirements for filing systems \(according to Ladner *-t* 0\). Increasing  
depth of shelves also increases the distance to walk between them.  
L x W \(filing furniture\) = space for furniture  
+ *Y,* L x W + 0.5 m = passage space  
total space required - space for furniture+ passage space  
Deep filing cabinets are more economical. The relationship between  
furniture floor space and passage space for a vertical filing system using  
large archive shelves \(Velox system\) and for a horizontal filing system is  
made clear in *-t* \$. Furniture floor space needed with vertical storage is  
5.2 rn2  
, passage space 4.6 m2 \(100\:90\}. With horizontal storage, furniture  
floor space 3.2 m2  
, passage space 3.6 m2 \(90\:100, ratio inverted\}. A  
horizontal filing system offers less storage space and the high shelves are  
hard to organise. Vertical storage offers a personnel saving of over 40%.  
Suspended files make about 87% better use of wall area than files on  
shelves -t0. Files can be transported with a paternoster lift. Workstations  
should include sorting shelves, small desk, chairs on castors.  
The filing system should be centrally located. A favourable window centre-  
line is 2.25-2.50 m, ceiling clearance height 2.10 rn \(2 storeys of normal  
office space = 3 storeys of filing\). The rooms must be dry, so attic and  
cellar are inadvisable. Continuous table *-1* 0 + CD with suspended files  
and writing surfaces combines workstations effectively. Trolleys can be  
used as writing surfaces, or for card index boxes. Mobile filing systems

and are adapted to the relevant requirements of filing systems, archives,

# Subsidiary and additional areas  
The total space requirement per workstation varies between 23  
and 45 m2  
, depending on organisational and status requirements.  
This includes 2.6 m2 car parking area in the basement, which is  
not included in the floor to space ratio. The tendency has been  
increasing since the 1970s.  
# Entrance area  
Connection between public and working areas. The important  
functions are lobby, access control, information, visitor registration  
and waiting zone. Important area for the company's corporate  
identity- the first impression is decisive!  
# Conferences, training  
Conference areas should be directly accessible from the entrance  
area. Provide sliding partitions \(which can divide large rooms\),  
tables, seating, presentation media, and also store rooms and a  
pantry for catering \(these subsidiary rooms require about *Vs* of the  
conference area\). Good noise reduction is important. A conference

Space requirement- 0.3-1.0 m2 per workstation.  
# Post room  
Undertakes the distribution of all incoming and outgoing post  
and goods. Work positions \(packing and sorting tables\) should be  
sufficiently large so that distribution can be rapid at peak times.  
Space requirement - 0.3-0.5 m2 per work position.

up as little space as possible \(purely paper archives rapidly take  
up 10-20 m per workstation\). For this reason, microfilming and  
some electronic archiving are worth looking into at an early stage.  
**f\) Space requirement for seating in conference and training rooms**  
Archive rooms should be designed for an increased floor loading  
of 7.5-12.5 kN/m2 \(for mobile units\)\~ Archives, p. 252.  
# IT technology  
Early planning of network technology is important. This will  
determine whether data centres or server rooms with or without  
constantly manned workstations are necessary and whether these  
should be placed centrally or decentralised in the building. These  
rooms should have a 70 em raised floor on account of the large  
amount of installation, and should be air-conditioned. Access  
control is particularly important. Back-up systems should if  
possible be separated from the data centre in fire-protected areas.  
# Social areas  
Canteens or cafeterias \(\~ Catering, p. 17 4 fl.\) are mostly operated  
as units by outside companies. Location near the reception and  
outside the access control allows outside visitors in.  
Tea kitchens should be as near to the workstations as possible  
and connected with communication zones. For every approx.  
50-1 00 workplaces, one -10 m2 kitchen.  
# Toilets  
Sanitary facilities are to be provided in accordance with the  
Workplace Regulations \(\~ p. 270\) and separation between the  
anteroom with washbasins and the actual toilets is important.  
A good ratio is one toilet unit per 50-80 workstations. Space  
requirement -0.6-0.8 m2 per workstation.  
# Cleaning services  
A cleaner's room should be provided on every floor, as a store for  
cleaning equipment and ideally with water supply and bucket sink.  
A central waste room, possibly enclosed waste collection rooms  
with separate collection containers and shredders. The caretaker  
should have a rest room, store and workshop in a central location.  
# Further special areas  
Garage areas with maintenance and parking facilities for company  
vehicles; company sports facilities, swimming pool, sauna and  
kindergarten should be considered as required.

OFFICE BUILDINGS  
Room Typology  
Types of offices  
Offices can be categorised according to size and occupation into  
two types\: single rooms and open-plan offices. All further types  
are variations and different arrangements of these basic types.  
Room types  
Single-room offices\: Single and double rooms are arranged in  
rows along a mostly artificially lit corridor. Jointly used infrastructure  
occupies expensive window space in occupied rooms, because  
no furniture is allowed in escape routes. The most economical  
occupation, by two or three people, disturbs concentrated work.  
Single rooms hinder internal communication. This is still the most  
common form of office layout ---\> 0.  
Open-plan office\: A form of office developed in the 1960s and  
1970s of the last century. Large-scale office landscapes with 1 00  
or more workstations are made possible by artificial lighting and  
ventilation; they stand for free communication and openness.  
Economical cubic structures, however, have the disadvantage  
of high maintenance costs. This form is not *very* popular among  
users---\> 0.  
Group office\: The experience with the open-plan layout led to the  
development of group offices with approx. 4-16 workstations; each  
office is used by a single team or department. This arrangement  
is preferred above all for creative, design or coordination and  
development activities with high internal communication needs.  
-;f\)  
Room systems  
Combi-office\: Very small single offices are separated by glass  
walls from the deep connection zone, in which communally used  
infrastructure is located. The combi-office was developed in  
the 1980s as an attempt to combine the advantages of single-  
room and open-plan offices. Each employee is provided with an  
individual workstation for concentrated work and a jointly used  
room in the central zone, with its glass partitions, encourage  
communication ---\> Cli\).  
'Hot desk' office, 'business club'\: Certain functions are assigned  
to workstations. The users choose the suitable working location  
for the current activity \(non-territorial offices\). The personal area  
of the employee is limited to a mobile desk/cupboard unit. This  
type of office is only made possible by new forms of business  
organisation and technical equipment like mobile phones and  
laptops. Combined with teleworking or with a high proportion  
of travelling representatives, savings of 20-50% are possible  
compared with personalised offices---\> p. 234---\> 0.  
Satellite office\: Office space is located in decentralised locations, for  
example in residential areas near the employee. In the form of rented  
office space, satellite offices provide 'service stations', not only as  
branch offices of large companies but also varied sizes of office and  
infrastructure for small firms or self-employed people. The intention  
is to *relieve* rush-hour traffic and offer seldom-used office space like  
meeting, conference or training rooms when required.  
Reversible office \(Revibllro\)\: This is actually not a type of office  
but rather a form of building which hosts functions of different  
office companies at more or less expense. The cost of equipment  
rises with increasing adaptability and compromises have to be  
accepted concerning office sizes and organisation. This type of  
building is rnainly suitable for offices for renting to tenants who are  
not yet known ---\> pp. 234, 235.

# OFFICE BUILDINGS  
Grid  
Grid module spacings define possible  
room sizes through the resulting spacing  
of columns and fagades. The fitting out  
and fagade grids must be the same in  
order to enable the partitions to connect  
to the windows. The structural grid can  
be offset against the fitting out grid. This  
reduces the problem of connecting the  
partitions to columns, but loses space  
in the rooms, which contain columns.  
Because of the different lifecycles of the  
building elements, an adaptable module  
dimension should be chosen. The  
modular dimensions, which have proved  
successful in recent years, are 1.50 m for  
single-room offices and 1.35 m for office  
types based on the combi principle.  
**Modular dimension 1.50 m**  
This is the economical module dimension  
for single-room offices consisting mainly  
of double workstations. Workstation  
depth 2.20 m \(80 em desk, 1 m  
movement area, 40 em shelf behind\).  
With 10 em wall thickness, this gives  
4.40 m clear room space.  
The usual depth of buildings with central  
corridors is 12-13 m. This dimension is  
only of limited practicality for combi-  
offices.  
# Modular dimension 1.35 m  
Room widths of 3.80 m \(-18 m2 usable  
area\) enable\:  
-additional filing storage; two computer  
workstations with a depth of 0.90 m, as  
recommended by accident insurance  
companies; one drawing board or  
drawing machine and one desk;  
one desk and meeting table for four  
people. All usual office workstations  
are possible, offering high flexibility of  
use without moving the partitions.  
# Partitions  
The junctions of light partitions demand  
particular attention to noise reduction.  
When glass partitions are specified,  
the required degree of sound proofing  
should be discussed with the user!  
# Fac;\:ade  
Vertical profiles in the fagade, which lie  
on the modular grid, should be wide  
enough to connect a partition. A better  
solution is with sound-insulated profiles  
running along the fagade. Take care  
with the opening lights of the windows.  
**Ceiling and floor**  
Screed bonded to the slab is good for  
sound insulation **--78,** D with integrated  
cable ducts, because airborne sound is  
transmitted only to a slight degree.  
With raised access floors and suspended

According to MBO 2002, every point in an occupied room must be

staircases from the end of the building of 30 m and from each other of

Building concepts  
Single-row layouts are uneco-  
nomical, and only acceptable  
with deep office rooms \(daylight?\)  
---70-f\).  
Two-row layouts have mostly  
been used for administration buil-  
dings until now; single rooms and  
small offices are possible with day-  
light ---7 0. The supply cores are  
situated in well-lit zones. The  
transitional form, three-row, is  
produced by offsetting the two-  
row layout in the supply area ---7 0.  
Three-row layouts \(typical of  
office high-rise\) ---7 8 + 0  
A large supply zone at the  
centre of the building is normally  
practical only for high-rise buil-  
dings \(greater proportion of  
vertical transport\). Daylight can  
mostly be exploited into a room  
depth of about 7.00 m. New  
daylight systems for the deflec-  
tion and transport of light \(prisms,  
reflectors ---7 p. 499\), exploit the  
available daylight still better.  
Lightwells can illuminate the  
centre of three-row buildings  
naturally ---7 e.  
Building alignment  
Coinpass orientation is variously  
estimated. According to Rosenauer,  
90% of all office buildings in the  
USA have a main axis *ENV,* because  
the deeply penetrating morning and  
evening sun is a disturbance. Sun  
from the south can be shaded more  
easily with sun blinds. According  
to Joedicke \(---7 refs\), the main axis  
in the N/S alignment is to ensure  
sunlight through all rooms. North-  
facing rooms are acceptable only  
for layouts without a corridor.  
Access systems  
Fixed points are sanitary facilities,  
stairwells, lift shafts etc., situated  
at maximum spacings defined  
in the building regulations ---7 e  
- Cl\}. The arrangement of these  
determines urban development's  
building structure ---7 0 - 0. For  
combined use units of less than  
400 m2  
, the corridors are not  
subject to the requirements for  
escape routes.

# Air conditioning  
Two fifths of the operating costs of an  
administrative building are energy costs.  
The energy required for cooling in the  
summer is considerably higher than for  
heating in the winter.  
The room temperature should be min. 19°C  
and max. 26°C \(legal interpretation of the  
Workplace Regulations\). The construction and  
alignment of the building are decisive for the  
energy consumption to provide air conditioning  
and light. Building elements which store heat,  
double fagades and light deflection systems  
reduce energy consumption.  
# Fully air-conditioned rooms  
The gross built volume and the total con-  
struction costs for air-conditioned build-  
ings are 1 .3-1 .5 times higher than for build-  
ings without air conditioning \~ **0.**  
**Gentle cooling** \~ **f\) - 0**  
In order to reduce peaks of energy  
consumption, large areas of solid building  
elements should be in direct contact  
with rooms as heat buffers. Ceilings are  
particularly suitable for this purpose  
because the partitions should normally be  
easy to relocate. A further development  
is building element cooling, e.g. capillary  
tube mats with refrigerant flowing through.  
Radiant ceilings work without the buffer  
effect of heavy building elements. Further  
savings of energy can be achieved with  
geothermal heat exchangers, which  
can pre-warm or cool the air supply to  
ventilation plant or passively heated halls  
by making use of the constant temperature  
underground. In order to achieve better  
regulation capability, there are suitable  
systems which regulate the temperature of  
the air supply with convectors. The radiant  
heating capacity of a building element in  
connection with temperature-regulated  
air supply can provide sufficient heating  
\(usable area can be gained through less  
floor or ceiling construction\). The cost of air-  
conditioning systems with building element  
cooling are not more than conventional  
air-conditioning systems. Advantages\:  
no draughts, no noise, reduction of the  
investment and operating costs \(water has  
1 000 x less pumped volume than air for  
the same performance, closed circuit, heat  
reclamation\), reduction of the supply cross-  
sections \(water instead of air\) and size of  
the building's energy control room.

Structure - influence of construction on the layout of offices ---7  
**0 - 0.** Construction proposals for the cross-sections of two-  
row office buildings with the following loading assumptions\:  
normal 5 KN/m2  
, additional 2 KN/m2 for screed \(8 em for floor  
duct and supply connections\).  
Ceiling height 2.75 m according to Vst regulation \(enables the  
later installation of raised floor and deeper suspended ceilings\).  
For predominantly sedentary activities, the reduction of the ceiling  
height by 25 em is possible, but min. 2.50 m clear. Corridors and  
sanitary facilities are permitted to be 2.30 m high \(this can be  
exploited for installation runs\). According to Kahl \(---7 refs\), the cost-  
effectiveness of a structure is less dependent on the optimisation  
of the individual components \(e.g. pre-cast elements\), and much  
more on their integration into a functional building. Differentiation  
between longitudinal and transverse spanning systems ---7 **0-0.**  
Constructive scope for decision-making via the example of a  
reinforced concrete slab with 6.50 m span. Criteria\: almost identical  
costs; higher weight has influence on costs for load transfer and  
foundations; thicker slab has advantages through greater stiffness  
under differing loading \(box-outs, spreader beams, point loads,  
various spans, various floor constructions\).  
Ribbed slabs\: Only economical over longer spans \(less self-  
weight, higher labour costs for formwork\). Cutting through the ribs  
is not possible, due to lack of space. Supporting beams have the  
same soffit level.  
Slab beams \(double T or Pi-slabs\)\: These are structurally advan-  
tageous for long spans. Installation should run parallel to the web;  
crossing runs should be carried out in the corridor ---7 **0 - 0.** The  
far;\:ade plane can lie behind, between or in front of the structural  
plane. Greatest variability with separation of construction and external  
envelope. Layout of columns, frontface offar;\:ade, back face of far;\:ade,  
in front or behind, have no influence on the compartmentalisation of  
the far;\:ade or the division arrangement \(grid, corner detail\).  
Internal columns ---7 p. 240 **0** A-D\: If the slab cantilevers with  
a cantilever of c = 1/5 L-1/3 L, the span is economical. Bracing  
through walls acting as deep beams, storey frames and the  
provision of solid access cores and end-fixed side zones.  
Building the walls\: Solid partition walls can replace columns  
and supporting beams, or can be considered as deep beams to  
provide rigidity ---7 **0 - f\).** Not reversible, openings should be  
specified in advance. The use of lightweight \(non-load-bearing\)  
partitions has the advantage of potential relocation, but also  
delays decisions about room layout, even during construction  
\(construction, studding - both sides 2 x 12.5 mm plasterboards  
approximately correspond to the sound reduction value of a 24 em  
block wall of density 1.2 kg/dm3  
, plastered both sides\).

# HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS  
Basics  
# Definition of high-rise buildings  
High-rise buildings are those intended for  
long-term human occupation whose upper-  
most floor on one side of the building is  
more than 22 m above ground level.  
# Typology  
There are two basic types of high-rise  
building\:  
1. The **block,** which has been designed as  
a high-rise building for economic reasons,  
and whose form has been developed from  
urban structure and planning, and from  
building regulations. Predominantly found  
in densely built cities, e.g. New York-\> **G.**  
2. The **tower,** erected as a solitary building  
and mainly intended to provide a symbolic  
and prestige effect to keep the client and  
the city at the forefront of attention -\> **e.**  
# Use  
High-rise buildings are a sign of extreme  
urban density and can also be seen as  
a town within the town. Use is therefore  
correspondingly varied\: on the lower floors,  
public establishments \(plaza, hall\); and,  
above, offices, hotels and apartments.  
Because high-rise buildings in Europe are  
mainly built as prestige projects, these  
are often company headquarters *I* office  
buildings with additional uses like hotels or  
apartments. In Germany, use as schools,  
hospitals or homes for elderly people is  
ruled out by the applicable regulations.  
# Location  
In Europe, the construction of high-rise  
buildings is mainly determined by political  
decisions. Because their effect is decisive  
for a city's character, the city normally  
decides where and what type of high-rises.  
The integration of a high-rise building into  
the urban landscape poses many questions  
for urban development planning. The preser-  
vation of street spaces, extension of public  
access areas, connection to public trans-  
port, pedestrian circulation, the needs of  
neighbouring buildings to receive natural  
light and alteration of the urban micro-  
climate all have to be considered.  
# Approval  
In addition to the normal authorities,  
further specialised bodies are also involved  
in the approval of high-rise buildings  
according to location and federal state,  
e.g. the requirements of air-traffic control  
\(Radar damping -\> p. 112\), broadcasting  
authorities, state criminal offices and water  
protection boards have to be considered  
and their approval gained. \~ g;

**0** Some of the world's highest buildings  
**f\) Range of cost -effectiveness for structural systems**  
Frame construction in steel or reinforced concrete is the standard  
solution. Spans vary according to material and type of constru-  
ction. Solid reinforced concrete slabs span 2.5-5.5 m, ribbed  
slabs 5.0-7.5 m, both with a maximum 12.5 m between main  
beams. Pre-stressed concrete can span up to 25m with only 0.75  
m structural depth -\> p. 244 **8.** The exterior wall should be a  
curtain wall in front of set-back external columns \(take note of fire  
protection -\> p. 246 **0\).** There are a multitude of mixed forms of  
construction such as steel frame with concrete floors. In areas at  
risk of earthquakes, special construction is necessary to prevent  
oscillation of the building.  
The design of high-rise buildings is determined by the construction  
system and the vertical access elements. The ratio of usable  
floor area to building cost becomes ever less favourable with the  
increasing height of the building. Construction and access areas  
take up a large part of the plan area. The division of high-rise  
buildings into sections with transport to 'sky lobbies' by express  
lift, where the passengers can transfer to normal lifts, reduces the  
space required for lifts and the travel time-\> p. 246 **e.**  
Cost-effectiveness depends on the 'sway factor', the ratio of  
maximum permissible horizontal deformation at the top to the  
total height of a building \(max. 1 \:600\).  
The decisive factor for the design of very high buildings is the  
horizontal forces \(wind\) and not the vertical loads. 90% of horizontal  
deformation comes from the shifting of the frame, or 'shear sway',  
and 1 0% comes from the slant of the entire building. Frame  
structures without special wind bracing are economic only up to  
about 10 storeys. Conventional frame systems lead to uneconomic  
dimensions for more than 20 floors. Reinforced concrete frames  
are practical up to 10 storeys without, and for 20-30 storeys with,  
bracing walls, and higher than that for concrete tube and double  
tube structures. The cost-effectiveness of a building is determined  
by material used, suitable type of construction and application of  
rational construction technology -\> **f\).**  
An example of a structurally economical solution is the John  
Hancock Center, Chicago, 1965, by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.  
The visible structural elements form the design concept. The tube  
principle considerably reduced the amount of steel required and  
the operational economics are improved by layered usage\:  
Floors 1-5 shops, 6-12 parking, 13-41 offices with flexible use,

Requirements for the parapet area in high-rise buildings to prevent fire  
**spreading from one storey to the next**  
# 246  
# HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS  
Requirements  
The requirements of the high-rise building guideline are mostly  
derived from the need for fire protection. Described here are  
mostly those relevant to the structural layout of a design. The  
exact requirements for particular building elements should be  
taken from the relevant state building regulations and the high-rise  
building guideline. Specific local regulations should be clarified at  
an early stage.  
# Escape routes  
Escape routes are min. 1.25 m wide and should if possible lead in  
two directions, to each staircase. The maximum walking distance  
from each point of an occupied room may not exceed 25 m.  
Corridors with two escape directions may be max. 40 m long.  
After 20 m, a smoke-proof self-closing door must be installed.  
Branch corridors with only one escape direction may be max.  
10m long. If a second escape route \(e.g. an escape balcony\) is  
available, max. 20 m.  
# Stairs  
High-rise buildings up to 60 m high\: at least two emergency  
stairs must be available, which must be located opposite in two  
separate fire compartments. Their walking width must be at least  
1.25 m. The wellhole must be min. 0.80 m wide in order to avoid  
having to lay hoses on the stairs. Smoke outlets must be provided  
at their highest point \(5% of the floor area but min. 1 m2\). The exit  
must be directly into the open air or through a lobby without any  
fire load. In exceptional cases, one staircase can be approved for  
high-rise buildings up to 60 m in height, if it is a safety staircase.  
Requirements for the location of stairs *-'t* **0 4\:\}.**  
# Lifts  
Up to about 25 storeys, it is usual to provide one group of lifts with  
all lifts serving all floors. If more than 6 lifts are necessary, they  
should be divided into two groups.  
In higher buildings, the lifts are split into groups. A group of lifts  
serves a certain number of floors with priority. When there are more  
than three groups, this system becomes uneconomic because  
of the high number of lifts in the lower area. High-rise buildings  
above about 200 m therefore have 'sky lobbies' reached by an  
express group \(mostly 2-3\) and further distribution continues from  
there. This enables a number of lifts in one shaft to provide the fine  
distribution *-'t* **0.**  
# Fire service lift  
In high-rise buildings more than 30 m high, there must be at least  
one fire service lift in its own shaft, from where every point of an  
occupied room can be reached within a radius of 50 m. It must  
have an anteroom with a hydrant, which is large enough to enable  
the transport of stretchers to the lift. Access routes must be at  
least T 30 fire-retarding.  
# Fac;\:ade  
In order to avoid fire spreading from one storey to the one above,  
there must be W 90 A fire-resistant parapets at least 1 m high  
\(fire spreading height\). Alternatively, a W 90 A horizontal building  
element projecting at least 1.5 m from the fac;\:ade can be provided.  
All-glass fac;\:ades \(also double fac;\:ades\) are permitted only with  
special approvals if particular protection measures \(area sprinklers,  
mist extinguishing systems\) can prevent the spread of fire to the  
next storey *-'t* **0.**  
Window areas which cannot be cleaned safely from inside, must  
be cleaned from the outside by trained personnel using suitable  
apparatus *-'t* p. 101. **'\).e block of shelf units**

# LIBRARIES  
Basics  
# Types of library  
**Public lending libraries** \~ p. 250\: offer a wide range of literature  
and other information, preferably on open shelves. The supply of  
literature covers all population and age groups. In larger cities,  
the functions of scientific and public libraries are sometimes  
combined.  
**Scientific** libraries\~ p. 251\: collection, acquisition and provision  
of literature on specific subjects for education and research,  
mostly publicly accessible without limitation.  
**State libraries\:** federal state and national libraries; collections,  
for example, of literature produced in the state or a region \(legal  
deposit copies\); publicly accessible.  
**Specialist libraries\:** scientific libraries for the collection of  
specialist literature and media on specific subjects, often with *very*  
limited group of users.  
# Components  
Three areas in *every* library\: user and reading area, store and  
administration. The space requirement for these areas differs  
according to the type of library.  
**User and reading area\:** With a good orientation system  
\(signposting of routes, functions and shelves with easily read  
signs\), the reading area with reading and working places should  
if possible be spread *over* as few floors as possible, also for ease  
of book transport; staggered floors should be avoided. Access  
should if possible be by stairs. All areas of the user and reading  
room should also be accessible by lift \(book transport, disability-  
friendly\). The floor in the user and reading area should be designed  
for a loading of 5.0 kN/m2  
•  
Traffic routes \> 1.20 m wide, clear distance between the shelves  
-in public areas always fixed- up to max. 1.30-1.40 m. Entrance  
and reading room area separated by access control with book  
security system. If possible, only one entrance and exit. The  
access control should ideally be situated near the lending counter/  
central information.  
**Outside access-controlled area\:** cloakrooms or lockers for  
clothing and bags/cases, toilets, cafeteria, newspaper reading  
corner, exhibition room, lecture and conference room \(which may  
be open outside library opening hours\), central information point,  
possibly also card index and microfiche catalogue, online catalogue  
terminals, book return, collection point for ordered books.  
**Inside access-controlled area\:** reader information, bibliographies,  
online catalogue terminals, handing out and return of books only  
to be used in reading area, issuing of books in educational book  
collection, copiers \(in separate rooms\), book stock on open  
shelves, user workplaces, possibly access to self-service stores.  
The provision of user workplaces in **university libraries** depends  
on the number of students and the distribution of the individual  
subject groups. Special workplaces for disabled people \(wheelchair  
users, visually impaired\), special work tasks \(microform reading  
and enlargement devices, PCs, terminals, CD-ROM and similar\:  
observe the guidelines for computer workplaces p. 236!\) and single  
workplaces \(cubicles, carrels, single work rooms\). The arrange-  
ment of the reading places should be in daylight. Space require-  
ment per single reading/working place 2.5 m2  
, per PC or single  
working place \~4.0 m2  
• Traffic routes \~1 .20m wide, clear distance  
between the shelves, which in public areas should always be  
fixed, up to max. 1 .30-1.40 m.

# LIBRARIES  
Basics  
**Lighting** in the user area\: generally approx. 250-300 lx; reading  
and working places, card index, information, lending counter  
500 lx. **Climate** in the user area\: 20° ± 2°C, -50 ± 5% relative  
humidity, air changes \(flow of outside air\) 20 m3/h x no. of people;  
these values can sometimes be exceeded according to the weather.  
Avoid direct sunshine as UV and heat radiation destroy paper  
and bindings. Air-conditioning systems should be used sparingly  
because of the high energy consumption and thus high operation  
costs. Window ventilation is possible for low building depth .  
**Safety and security** in the user area\: **fire protection** is adequately  
covered in the regulations and requirements of the local building  
inspectors. **Burglary prevention** through motion detectors and  
burglary-resistant glazing and **theft protection** through book  
security systems, optimally **securing** unsupervised emergency  
doors through electronically controlled automatic locking on  
alarm. Mechanical securing of **emergency doors,** also with  
acoustic and/or optical signals, is not very effective.  
**The stacks \(store\)** should ideally be situated in the basement  
on account of the more even climate and support of the higher  
loadings. 'Book towers' are inconvenient on account of the  
increased cost of air conditioning, transport and staff because of  
the limited space and flexibility. The largest possible continuous  
areas without steps are the most practical. Divide into fixed  
and mobile shelf blocks \('compact systems'\) depending on the  
structural grid of the columns \(-7 DIN specialist report 13\). Mobile  
stacks can increase the capacity by up to -100%. Floor load-  
bearing capacity for fixed shelves is min. 7.5 kN/m2  
; for mobile  
stacks min. 12.5 kN/m2 \(-7 DIN specialist report 13\}.  
**Climate in stacks\:** 18 ± 2°C, 50 ± 5% rei. humidity, air changes  
\(flow of outside air\) \~3 m3/h x m2; filtering of harmful substances  
\(dust, S02, NOx etc.\) is required according to location. The use of  
wall materials with a good capacity to retain moisture and heat  
can reduce the need for air conditioning. Slight air movement  
is useful for the avoidance of mould formation, particularly with  
mobile stacks \(use open ends\). Special collections and materials  
\(e.g. slides, film or sound and data storage media as well as  
card, drawings and graphics\) require a particular climate.  
**Floor load-bearing capacity** in administration and book  
processing areas \>5.0 kN/m2; can be higher in the technical  
areas \(workshops\) on account of machinery \(individual structural  
verification required\}.  
**Construction\:** Reinforced concrete or steel frame construction  
with a grid of\>7.20 m x 7.20 m and room heights of \~3.00 m have  
proved successful on account of the flexibility of fitting out.  
**Traffic routes\:** avoid crossings and overlapping of routes for  
users, staff and books.  
**Transport\:** Book transport carried out **horizontally** with trolleys  
\(no thresholds, differences of level should have ramps for ;;'ii6% or  
lifting platforms\) and conveyor belts; **vertically** in lifts, conveyor  
belts \(plan the route carefully, with sloping upward inclines; very  
low maintenance costs\), container transport systems \(mechanically  
programmable, combination of horizontal stretches and paternoster  
lifts\} or automatic container transport systems \(routes can be  
horizontal or vertical as required, automatic, mostly computer route  
control; high investment cost, currently very high maintenance costs\).  
**Space requirement** for bookshelves depends on the form of  
organisation, accessibility for users, type of shelves \(fixed or  
mobile\}, systematic subject categorisation with corresponding  
display, format separation and construction grid \(tables -7 DIN  
specialist report 13\}. Tr-------,

Space Requirement  
# Lending counter  
This is the interface between entrance areas and the normally  
accessible catalogue areas, the reading room with microfilm  
device, the stacks and the administration. Here the issuing and  
return of books takes place, information about the library is given  
and people are checked on entering or leaving the reading room.  
So there are many demands on the counter.  
Mobile counters of combined units are mainly suitable for  
smaller libraries. Larger libraries, especially when the book trans-  
port systems are integrated into the counters, tend to prefer  
permanently installed systems. The height of the counter depends  
on the rnain activity undertaken --7 **0,** 95-1 05 em is appropriate.  
It is better not to have any additional units above the counter in  
libraries mainly used by young people and children. The surface  
of the counter is subject to very heavy wear, so suitable materials  
should be specified, which can still look presentable after a long  
period of use \(e.g. solid wood, linoleum or laminates coloured  
right through\). Provide connections for computer and telephone,  
adequate lighting and a view into the open air \(comply with the  
requirements of the Workplace Regulations, as the counter is  
normally a permanent workplace\).  
# Public libraries  
These offer general literature and other media on directly acces-  
sible self-service display. Systematic collection and cataloguing  
by content of printed and other media is restricted to a few large  
public libraries. Public libraries have no scientific collection duty  
or archive function, but are lending libraries, which normally have  
small stores or none at all. The users are children, young people  
and adults. Public libraries aim their range of stock and services  
at meeting the needs of the users. As a place of communication  
\('market place'\) for the population, they offer, in addition to the  
traditional lending of books, browsing zones, citizen's advice,  
information, cafeteria, listening to music, areas for sitting and  
events, art lending, and/or travelling library.  
Stock \('media'\) can be not only books and newspapers but also  
magazines, brochures, games or new media \(CD, DVD, video,  
PC games\), which can be borrowed or used in the library. Rooms  
should encourage visitors to stay by being welcoming. Structure  
the areas into those for adults, children and young people with  
activity-oriented movement rooms, not separated but in zones  
with flowing transition. The space requirement is in line with the  
amount of stock --7 **0.** The target is two media units per inhabitant,  
but a minimum size of 300 m2 usable area with 10 000 media  
units in stock. They should be large, connected areas, almost  
square and flexibly usable, and extending horizontally rather than  
vertically \(less staff\), capable of extension and with an inviting  
entrance area. The shelf units in the adult area will have five or  
six shelves \(max. reach height 1.80 m --7 p. 249 \~\), and in the  
children's area four shelves \(reach height -1.20 m --7 p. 249 \$ -  
**0\).** Passages should not be longer than 3 m, neither niches nor  
compartments. Books are transported with a book trolley \(L x H  
x W\: 92 x 99 x 50 em\). Goods lift at the goods entrance, and in  
larger libraries also book transport systems. Floor loading in public  
libraries\: 5.0 kN/m2  
, in store-type self-service areas with denser  
stacking 7.5 kN/m2  
, with compact storage \(mobile shelving units\)  
12.5 or 15.0 kN/m2

Scientific libraries have always had a key role in the history of  
science and in the life of universities. They are not only a location  
for storing books, but places where books can be worked with.  
An important and decisive part of world literature has been  
produced in libraries. Their erection is among society's greatest  
building projects. Important architectural examples from the  
19th century show what high prestige has been applied to the  
task \(Biblioteca Laurentiana, Florence; Bibliotheque Nationale,  
Paris\).  
They collect and access printed publications and other  
information media for education and research, and offer it for  
use in reading rooms \(stock which is not lent out\) and also for  
lending from the closed stacks, the self-service shelves and,  
to select in the reading rooms, separately displayed teaching  
material or specially gathered collections for one term. As  
well as books and magazines, most other types of audiovisual  
media are collected, catalogued and available for use. The  
number of reading places is related to the number of students  
in the various subjects. Orientation is provided by systematic  
classification of stock by subject. The services offered include  
remote lending \(obtaining literature from distant libraries\),  
copying services and enlargement of micro-forms \(microfiche  
and microfilm\).  
Example\: Juridicum Halle\_\_\_. **0- f\).**  
# University libraries  
These are single- or two-storey buildings\: single-storey systems  
are centrally administered \(book processing and services\) and  
mostly have at least a few separate user areas in branch or  
specialist libraries. Two-storey libraries include a central library  
and an \(often larger\) number of libraries for faculties, specia-  
list areas and institutes. Stock is often freely available in  
reading rooms, often in self-service stacks \(shelving units  
spaced as in closed stacks\) and in closed stacks, the different  
forms of display being mixed in most university libraries. The  
ratio of stored to display and lending stock is determined by  
the structure of the stock, and/or the organisation type or  
library concept, and often also the space available in existing  
buildings.

# Basics  
Archives do not, unlike libraries,  
serve mainly to make available  
written, graphic and audio media,  
but for their systematic cataloguing  
and long-term preservation.  
In this function, they are often part  
of libraries, museums or universities.  
State archives keep all sorts of files,  
business records, maps, drawings  
and documents.  
In order to be able to accept the rapidly  
increasing stock, suitable storage  
systems such as rolling shelving  
units or plan chests \(---7 pp. 237,  
248\) must be provided. The loading  
on the floor slab should be paid  
particular attention \(---7 p. 248\). For  
the durability of the preserved media,  
the maintenance of a uniform climate  
is the most important factor, but  
full air conditioning has not proved  
acceptable on account of the high  
cost. Natural ventilation is the ideal,  
but also brings the danger of entry  
by air-borne pollutants. Systems  
without air conditioning need solid  
walls with the best possible diffusion  
values, and the temperature should  
be maintained by simple wall surface  
heating \(skirting radiators\).

# BANKS  
# Bank buildings  
There are two basic types of bank buildings\: high street clearing  
bank branches with customer transactions and special or central  
banks without public access. The latter institutions are large-scale  
investment and/or corporate buildings.  
High street clearing bank branches are a mixture of administration  
offices and customer service centres. The administrative share is  
larger for main offices and considerably less in smaller branches,  
because administration is mostly centrally organised. The main  
preconditions for the banking business are security, trust and  
reliability, which should also be visible in the design.  
The UK, in addition, has long-established building societies,  
originally funding house purchase loans from the deposits they  
accepted, but now most are also functioning as banks. Their  
operating basis resembles that of a bank, so their building design  
requirements are similar.  
Banks' functional areas are as follows\:  
# Processing zone  
Internal office area for administration without public access  
\(\~ p, 231 ff.\).  
# Special zones  
In addition to the social rooms for staff and the normal subsidiary  
rooms for administration offices \(\~ p. 238\), there are conference  
and prestige-promoting areas. These serve training purposes and provide space for exhibitions.  
# Security area  
Safes, today described as bank vaults or strong rooms, are mainly  
installed in larger bank branches or head offices. In new buildings  
there is solid and specially reinforced concrete construction and  
in old buildings a room-in-room structure of pre-cast elements.  
The ideal location is in the cellar near the entrance, because the  
shaft from the night safe has to be almost straight. The routes to  
the customer safe deposit boxes and to the bank strong room  
should if possible be separate. Delivery of cash and valuables by  
armoured vehicles also has to be considered. An access gallery  
with surveillance mirrors can be provided to monitor the strong  
room. Wall thicknesses are in accordance with the security level,  
from 80 em \(T1 0\) to 100 em \(T20\). For the customer safe deposit  
boxes, 'fully automated safe deposit systems' open at all times are  
available. These can be reached from the self-service area through  
an additional access control vestibule without staff involvement.  
The design should take into account the recommendations of the  
Research and Testing Association for safe and strong rooms and  
above all the requirements of the insurers.  
# Customer zone  
The introduction of automatic teller cash dispensers \(cash dis-  
pensers operated by bank staff\) with restricted and time-locked  
cash release means that the structural protection of the counter  
area is no longer necessary. Cash dispensing and simple infor-  
mation is mostly at self-service cash points \(ATMs\). Cashless  
transactions can be carried out by home banking. This reduces  
the space requirement in the customer area, because the activity  
mostly consists of consultations and reference to specialist de-  
partments. For initial information, standing consultation counters  
are sufficient, but thorough consultations require a separate room  
for privacy. Expert departments \(e.g. credit and investment\) are  
often located on the first floor of the customer area.  
The self-service zone is also accessible outside business hours.  
It is therefore mostly relocated into a lobby outside the customer  
area \~ **0.** This zone is equipped with cashpoints, account  
statement printers, deposit slot for the night safe and possibly the  
access to the safe deposit system.

A shopping arcade --7 0 is from 10,000 m2 in area, usually  
approx. 20,000-25,000 m2 in area, roofed, mostly a 2-3 storey  
street space with multi-level access, exploiting urban block  
zones, external access \(min. two\) via squares, streets or shop-  
ping areas, semi-public access routes; no fixed opening times.  
Smaller shops are often along the internal street, with well-  
known large-area chains mostly in the corners or at the end of a  
street as a 'magnet'. Internal streets often lead into squares or  
courtyards.  
A shopping centre/mall --7 Cli\) is a larger and more elaborate  
collection of retail outlets, eating places etc. It has fixed opening  
times, therefore no semi-public access routes; main external ac-  
cess normally from only one road, but additional side access from  
a car park or multi-storey car park is possible.

wake the interest of customers and to present an invitation to pur-  
chase\~ **6\) - 0, 0 - 0.** The design of shop windows depends  
on the particular goods being sold and should complement the  
layout, form and size of the entrance. The two basic types are  
windows with display area \~ **6\)** and windows with a view of the  
shop\~0.  
Shop windows with display area\: separation of the displayed  
goods and the sales area, mostly in department stores and spe-  
cialised retail chains.  
Shop windows with a view of the shop\: view through the win-  
dow into the sales area, mostly for specialised shops \(e.g. baker,

Checkout and Waiting Zones  
Types of checkout  
According to the product and shop type, there are various types of  
checkout\: single, area and central cash desks and rows of check-  
outs.  
Row of checkouts  
In specialised supermarkets \(self-service area\), these form the  
only exit from all shops with a closed sales area. The passing  
width between the checkouts should be sufficiently wide that  
shopping trolleys, pushchairs and wheelchairs can pass through,  
i.e. min. 1 m. Checkouts are mostly equipped with a conveyor belt  
\(sometimes a before- and after-sale belt\) and stationary scanner.  
Self-checkouts are also available as complete products.  
Single, area, floor and central cash desks  
In specialised shops, specialised retail chains and department  
stores with open sales, depending on the functional organisation  
of the shop, cash desks can be arranged as single, by area, by  
floor or centrally. Department stores with different specialised sec-  
tions have mostly area cash desks, specialised retail chains often  
have cash desks on each floor or grouped centrally, specialised  
small shops mostly have single cash desks.

**Q** Centric routeing \(variant 1\)  
Routes and escalators serve above all to highlight the promotion of  
goods and special offers. The larger the area of a retail outlet, the more  
important is the routeing concept It can be put into practice through  
different means on the floor of the shop\: lighting, fittings and pos-  
itioning of the goods on offer. The location of the goods is determined  
by the intention to encourage customers to buy by displaying, as they  
pass by, shelves, stock and thus all the product ranges *-t* **0-f\).**  
The following variants are common for vertical escalator access  
in shops\:  
**Double criss-cross\: *-t* 0**  
The direction of travel of this escalator is 180°.  
**Parallel layout\: *-t* 0**  
Escalators in the same direction lie above one another.  
The rule of thumb is one escalator for every approx. 1000 m2 of  
sales area.

# Fishmonger  
Because fresh fish do not keep very long, they are stored cool, but  
smoked fish have to be stored dry. The goods are odour-intensive,  
so the shops are accessed through control doors or protective  
curtains. Walls and floors must be easy to clean. Take into ac-  
count bulk deliveries in the design. Consider an aquarium \(display  
advertising\). *-7* **0 -f\)**  
# Game and poultry dealer  
This business is often combined with a fishmonger. Storage for  
only a day's needs. A workroom must be provided with pluck-  
ing machine and game scraper. Because poultry is susceptible to  
odour, it must be stored separately in the shop and the cold room.  
Counter worktops and walls \(marble, tiles, mosaic, plastic\) must  
be washable. Provide plenty of refrigerated display cases or cabi-  
nets. *-7* **e- e.**  
# Greengrocer  
Fresh vegetables, unprocessed or kitchen-ready, must be stored  
cool, but not chilled. Potatoes are stored in dark rooms and sold  
from the deposit-bearing containers they are delivered in \(baskets,  
crates, boxes\). Protective sliding inserts are provided under stor-  
age trays. Greengrocers *-7* **0-0** can possibly be combined with  
flower shops. Self-service shops offer pre-packed goods in trans-  
parent packs.  
# Butcher

4. process, 5. cool/store, 6. sell *-7* \(!\) **-G\).** A single-storey shop is  
advantageous, possibly with hanging and sliding rail system, be-  
cause sides of pork or quarters of beef weigh 50 kg. Processing  
and cold rooms must be 1.5-2 times the size of the shop. Walls\:  
tiled, mosaic etc. and washable. Counter tops\: marble, glass,  
ceramic.

Self-Service Shops  
Self-service shops mostly sell food. The staff is responsible for ad-  
vice, assistance and service. The butchery, cold meats, fruit and  
vegetable sections are staffed. The goods are displayed clearly in  
packaging according to type. It is important to design practical  
routeing. The round trip starts at the basket stack or trolley park  
and ends at the checkout or packing table. Wall shelves extend  
up to reach height \(top shelf is 1.80 m high and lowest 0.30 m  
above the floor\).

INDUSTRY  
Basics  
Industrial buildings, directly or indirectly, are designed for  
the production of goods. In addition to the actual production  
buildings \(preparation, manufacture, consignment, packag-  
ing\) these are also warehouses \(raw materials, finished prod-  
ucts\), technical and administration buildings and transport  
systems. The spectrum of production ranges from labour-  
intensive heavy industry to 'smart' low-emission and highly  
automated light industry. The requirements for the design are  
accordingly varied\: if the traditional factory hall is little more  
than a tool, the requirements extend to 'corporate identity',  
from recognition value to sympathetic and communication-  
oriented workplaces.  
Layout planning  
The layout is the classic basis of factory building. The various  
parameters of the planned production plant are defined and sys-  
tematised in the layout -0 0. It is processed in various stag-  
es \(ideal, trial, rough and precise layout\). One of the results of  
layout planning is the room allocation plan as a scaled functional  
scheme of the planned plant and as the basis for the design  
of the building. The structure designed in line with the layout is  
product-specific. In the course of the various non-specific de-  
sign work \(e.g. start-up centres\) and the simultaneous develop-  
ment of product and production plant, the layout becomes ever  
less significant as a design basis, being replaced by more flexible  
concepts.  
Design basis  
The design of industrial buildings is subject to numerous laws,  
guidelines, standards and regulations. In addition to the public  
planning law -0 p. 56, these are mainly environmental, health and  
safety, and fire protection requirements -0 f\). Further, there are INDUSTRY  
various state laws and product -specific regulations. Life cycles  
Analogous to the life cycles of the product, industrial building is  
subject to various economic phases -0 0. Ever shorter product  
cycles \(5-7 years\) are not in accord with the life of a normal build-  
ing. Aspects of adaptability, suitability for letting and resale value  
are therefore becoming increasingly significant in the design of  
industrial buildings.

Typologies  
The basic types of industrial building can be split into additive and  
integrative plants.  
In additive plants, the individual functional units are shaped  
according to their purpose and added to planar or linear struc-  
tures \(often along a production line\). The units can be extended,  
developed and exchanged separately -0 0.  
In integrative plants, the functional units are assembled to form a  
neutral structure -0 0. The advantages here are the minimisation  
of access areas and reusability. Possibilities for extension have to  
be planned into the building structure.

INDUSTRY  
Basics  
Production  
Production is the assembly over space and time of work, mat-  
erial and tools \(machines, raw material etc.\) to produce products  
and services. The performance required for production \(work/time  
unit\) is described as relevant performance and is a combination of  
human performance \(motor and exploratory skills\) and machine  
performance.  
Human and machine collaborate in the production cycle \~ 0.  
This comprises various forms of production \~ 0 and can be  
planned using flow charts \~ 8. Human performance is not con-  
stant, but is subject to numerous individual and collaborative  
factors \(strain -tiredness -recovery, age, sex, health\).  
The general requirements for workplaces are collected in the  
Workplace Regulations \(2004\) of the Federal Ministry for Indus-  
try and Employment \~ 8, of which detailed expansion is laid  
down in the Workplace Guidelines \(\~ p. 263 8\).  
Buildings in general Construction and strength according to type of use  
Dimensions of workplaces, air space Floors, walls, ceilings, roofs sufficient floor area and clear height \(depending on  
size of floor area\) for the performance of the work  
without impairment of safety, health or well-being;  
air space measured depending on the number of  
employees and the type of physical effort.  
surfaces must be formed according to the  
requirements of the business and be easy to clean,  
with sufficient insulation against heat, cold and damp  
at the workplace\:  
floor without unevenness, tripping hazards,  
dangerous slopes; must be load-bearing, safe for  
walking, not slippery;  
glass wails near workplaces must be clearly  
marked, non-breakable or shielded, and roofs which  
are not safe must be walked on only when adequate  
safety equipment is provided.  
Windows, fanlights must be safe to open, close, adjust and fix, must  
pose no danger in the opened position, and be safe  
to clean.  
Doors, gates location, number, construction according to type  
and use of the rooms and areas, transparent doors  
are to be marked at eye level, non-breakable or  
constructed with protection against breakage;  
construct hinged doors to see through with a view  
window; secure doors against levering out and failing  
out or over;  
provide highly visible doors for pedestrians in  
the immediate vicinity of gates for vehicle traffic;  
powered doors and gates must be safely usable,  
and in emergency capable of being opened  
automatically or manually.  
Transport routes must be easily and safely usable \(including stairs,  
access ladders and ramps\), sized according to  
number of users and type of business; where  
vehicles are used on access routes, sufficient space  
for pedestrians;  
transport routes for vehicles must run with  
sufficient distance from doors, footpaths, stair exits,  
etc. if necessary mark borders of transport routes.  
Escape routes and emergency exits number, size and arrangement according to use,  
equipment and size of workplace and number of  
people present, shortest possible route into the  
open air/into a safe area, permanent marking in  
suitable form, if necessary safety lighting, escape  
doors easily operable at any time, open outward,  
revolving and sliding doors are not permissible as  
emergency exits.

Shed Construction  
Production and warehouse buildings are often built as indus-  
trial sheds without internal floors but with large spans and room  
heights.  
Construction, spans and heights  
Timber, steel or reinforced concrete construction with spans of  
5-50 m according to client requirements \(arrangement of ma-  
chines, access routes and turning circles of vehicles\) and room  
heights of 3-6 m. Built as solid, trussed or cable-trussed struc-  
tures with fixed-end columns *-t* 0, frames *-t* 0 - 0 or as a  
framed construction stiffened with bracing, often as added or  
staggered buildings. Shed height and load assumptions are often  
dependent on the proposed overhead crane *-t* p. 287.  
Advantages of shed construction  
Low construction cost due to light roof construction and omission  
of expensive floor slabs; uniform natural lighting with rooflights,  
even for very deep spaces; heavy floor loading possible; few\(er\)  
fire protection requirements; flow of materials and people on one  
level.  
Disadvantages of shed construction  
Large area of land required; unfavourable ratio of plan area to vol-  
ume; unfavourable thermal behaviour \(heat loss, heat build-up in  
summer\).  
Lighting, ventilation, building services  
Lighting and ventilation \(and smoke extraction\) are provided by  
light bands, north lights or light domes in the roof construction *-t*  
0 - 0 or also strip windows in the fagade.  
Heating is normally \(central/decentralised\) air heating or overhead  
radiant heating \(temporary heating of single areas\).

height\) with 1 or 2 columns -7 **0,** 20 or 22.5 m \(5 m clear height\)  
with two columns -7 **e.**  
# Lighting  
Multi-storey buildings with windows on one side should face  
northeast, and, with windows on both sides facing north and  
south, they should be oriented east-west. The summer sun thus  
only shines into the interior to a limited extent and is easy to shade  
with blinds \(possibly continuously motorised sun awnings\), but in  
winter the room is pleasantly sunlit \(no disturbing shadows in the  
working area\) -7 **0.** The distance of the working area from the  
window should be twice as long as the clear window height -7 **e.**  
Stairs and toilets \(cool\) can be located on the north side.  
The best lighting is provided by free-standing buildings which are  
twice as far from each other as they are high \(ground floor angle  
of light = 27°\) -7 **e;** single-storey buildings with rooflights can be  
located between these.  
Approx. figures for window areas\: 1/1 0 of the floor area for rooms  
up to 600m2 \(Workplace Guidelines 7/1 -7 p. 263\); for fine work,  
provide 1 /5 of the floor area.

advantageous \(sun shades, venetian blinds, light-scattering glass

# INDUSTRY  
Transport  
Transport is a part of the material flow process. Transport planning  
is the definition of the transport relationships or tasks within the  
material flow and the planning of the interactions with storage -\>  
p. 268\. Essential terms in transport planning are\:  
**transported goods** \(material, transport unit\)  
**transport performance** \(quantity, times, deadlines\)  
**transport type** \(course of the transport routes\) and  
**means of transport** \(or conveyance\) technical equipment for the  
direct and indirect transport of goods.  
Means of transport can be divided into continuous and discon-  
tinuous conveyors\:  
# Continuous conveyors  
Continuous conveyors are mechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic  
systems with a defined transport route \(permanent or mobile\),  
along which the transported goods are continuously \(regularly, in  
cycles or with variable speed\) moved between loading and un-  
loading locations. Continuous conveyors are particularly suitable  
for the transport of similar goods over a fixed route, but the high  
automation and transport capacity comes at the cost of high in-  
vestment and low adaptability.  
Continuous conveyors include\:  
Conveyor belts -\> **0,** track and chain conveyors -\> **0,** screw  
conveyors, slides -\> **0,** endless overhead chain and rope con-  
veyors, moving tables -\> **0,** pneumatic \(pressure and suction\)  
conveyors \(bulk goods and liquids\), centrifugal conveyors and  
bucket chain conveyors.  
# Discontinuous conveyors  
Discontinuous conveyors work discontinuously. They can be dif-  
ferentiated into industrial trucks \(running on wheels on a floor\) and  
lifting devices \(mostly cranes\).  
# Floor conveyors  
Industrial trucks are manually or mechanically driven, mostly with-  
out being on tracks, for stacking heights up to 6 m, in special cas-  
es up to **1** 0 m. The advantages are the low plant costs and good  
suitability for medium distances between unloading and loading  
locations on a flat road or floor .  
Floor conveyors include hand sack trucks, platform trolleys, pallet  
trucks and fork lift trucks ...... **0- e ......** p. 269 .  
# Cranes  
Cranes are machines for the vertical lifting of large and heavy  
goods. Horizontal mobility can also be provided through wheeled  
trolleys or winch trolleys -\> **0 - «E\).**  
Swivel cranes -\> **0 - 9** enable the lifting of objects from any  
point in their radius of operation.

Storage is part of the material flow process and logistically forms

is cost-intensive and does not create economic value, leading to  
attempts to minimise the storage quantities and times or effec-  
tively combine the storage and transport of materials and goods  
through flexible **'just-in-time production'.**  
There is a wide range of different static and dynamic storage  
systems available for each storage situation and the goods need-  
ing storage --7 **f\).** The spatial arrangement of the different ware-  
houses in the production process can also be dealt with in various

# Picking  
Picking, or order assembly, denotes collecting articles out of the  
warehouse and making them ready for dispatch in accordance  
with an order. This can be single-stage picking \(specific to one  
order\) or two-stage picking, with an intermediate picking zone for  
temporary storage and assignment of the articles to a number of  
orders.  
The work is performed flexibly and with no technical support, or  
very little, as a 'man to goods' system --7 **0,** left, or for more ca-  
pacity with partly or fully automated transport vehicles and com-  
plex infrastructure as a 'goods to man' system --7 **0,** centre and

# Storage and shipping containers  
Storage containers serve to combine the goods into loading  
units with the purpose of maximising the exploitation of space  
and transport capacity and the avoidance of handling. The most  
common storage containers for unit goods are **stackable crates**  
made of timber or plastic, **pallets** \(flat pallets, pallets with side  
rails and additional equipment\) and also increasingly **containers.**  
On order to simplify international transport, the European pal-  
let pool has introduced the **standardised transport pallet** \(Eu-  
ropallet, Pool pallet, 800 X 1200 X 144 mm\) with various stacking  
attachments *-1* **0.**  
Standardised pallets can be exchanged within the pool without  
reloading. Numerous standard sizes for packaging, transport and  
storage have been derived from the dimensions of the Europallet.  
On account of the variety of uses and the rough handling and  
loading, storage pallets are subject to many quality standards.

# Changing rooms, clothes storage/lockers  
Changing rooms are intended for changing clothes and the stor-  
age of house, street and working clothing, by the employees of a  
company. They are required when the employees wear working  
clothes at work and changing elsewhere is not reasonable.  
Changing rooms should be on the direct route between entrance  
to the site and the working area. Separate washing and changing  
rooms should be easily accessible from each other\: there must be  
room for unobstructed changing in light of the number of users at  
the same time. If changing rooms are not required, clothes storage  
must be provided for each employee --; **0** -  
\~-  
They must be separate for men and women and be secure against  
draughts and view from outside.  
Changing rooms are to be equipped with seating, lockers \(for  
storing the clothing of all employees\), waste bins, mirrors and, if  
appropriate, a shoe cleaning machine. It is a good idea to align  
rows of cupboards and racks at right angles to the window wall.  
Window sills should if possible be at locker level.

# WORKSHOPS  
Joinery  
The development of plan forms from long sheds to more compact  
buildings ---\> **0** has been altogether more economical \(better ex-  
ploitation of the site, shorter working routes for mixed production,  
shorter supply pipework and cables, lighting also from above\).  
Multi-storey buildings are not appropriate for production areas,  
but can be recommended for offices, subsidiary rooms, stores for  
small parts and valuable furniture.  
Predominant construction types\: framed construction of steel, re-  
inforced concrete or timber. Walls and roof of large-format building  
elements,with good thermal and sound insulation. Double-glazed  
windows, mostly without opening lights, with a smaller proportion  
of opening windows according to regulations for ventilation and  
to see out.  
The space requirement for the illustrated examples is approx. 70-  
80 m2 per employee \(without open storerooms\).  
General production flow\: in small businesses with up to approx. 10  
employees\: linear, angled-shaped. In medium-sized businesses  
with over 1 0 employees\: U-shaped or circular \(square\) layouts are  
better for workflow.  
Working sequence\: timber store, cutting area, drying room, mach-  
ine room, bench workshop, surface treatment, storage, packing.  
The machines are placed according to working sequence\: door,  
loading and unloading, ramp, supervision, testing, acceptance,  
delivery.  
There is separation between machine and bench rooms consist-  
ing of a wall with doors. Company office and foreman's office are  
glazed with a view of the workshop. Workshop flooring\: wood,  
wood-block paving or magnesite/sawdust screed. It should be  
possible to work against the light in all places. Continuous strip  
windows, high sills \(1.00-1.35 m\).  
In order to deal with chips, sawdust and fine dust, an extraction  
system is required in almost all cases, even in the smallest join-  
eries, for working in accordance with workplace regulations and  
for operational reasons. Reduce excessive noise from machinery  
with rubber-bonded metal bearings.

Metalwork  
A large business is divided into workshops for gas welding, fitting,  
construction and repair, a smithy for ornamental ironmongery, plus  
construction and mechanical metalwork areas. The room relation-  
ships correspond to the functional scheme -\:\> **e.**  
The company office and foreman's office should if possible be  
located in the centre, with a view of all workshops if possible.  
Welding and forging should take place in rooms enclosed by steel  
doors, even in medium-sized workshops. The workshops should  
be lit from above, and additional lighting is required for individual  
machines \(provide socket boxes in the floor\).  
The floor should be of concrete, preferably on a concrete base  
slab. The welding bench is fitted with fire bricks. A charcoal pit is  
required for pre-warming before welding of metal and cast iron,  
with a small chimney above it; it is also suitable for brazing, forg-  
ing and annealing. There should be water and oil containers next  
to this for annealing.

Vehicle Repairs  
A customer-service business should be located with a good road  
connection \(even if this results in higher access and building  
costs\). In a location on the edge of town, advertising and cus-  
tomer loyalty require particular attention.  
Basic rule\: site % built, % unbuilt. Take possible later extension  
into account. For larger businesses, the average is 200 m2 per  
employee for workshop operation. In addition to this, rooms are  
required for sales, office, customer waiting room and social rooms  
etc.  
The building will be mostly steel construction, single-storey. Free-  
spanning shed construction without obstructive columns is pre-  
ferred. Possible future extension should be taken into account in  
the spacing of the bays.  
The workshop floor should be sealed against penetration of  
oil and grease, and grease separators installed in the drainage  
system. Provide extract duct for exhaust gases. Design automati-  
cally opening doors with air curtain. Installation ducts for elec-  
tricity, compressed air, waste oil and water are recommended.  
Check utility supply connections. Carwash equipment has high  
water consumption.

WORKSHOPS  
Bakery  
Systematic design includes the anticipation and recording of all  
future technical and operational processes to which the building  
will have to adapt. An investigation of the location should always  
be part of the design work.  
Room allocation plan  
Basic division\: storerooms, production rooms, sales rooms, build-  
ing services rooms, administration and business rooms, social  
and subsidiary rooms \~ 0. Work processes in or between the  
individual rooms \~ f\). Storerooms for raw materials, ingredients  
and packaging. Daily supplies are stored in work areas .  
Basic types of storage  
Raw material store\: grains, sugar, salt, baking agents, dry goods in  
sacks, flour in silos or sacks.  
Ingredients room\: fruit, toppings, dry fruit, fats, eggs.  
Packaging store\: space requirement for containers \{shelving,  
racks, cupboards\), stacking, counters. Space for traffic \(pas-  
sages\).  
Minimum area for stores 15 m2  
for all stores.  
; approx. 8-1 0 m2 per employee  
Short routes between stores and work areas.  
Separation of workrooms for bakery and pastries  
Bakery requires warm and humid room climate; pastry room  
should be cooler. Bakery has following areas\: dough preparation,  
dough processing, baking, storage of finished products. Pastry  
room\: cold area - cream, creme, chocolate, fruit; warm area -  
ready mixes, kitchen, fine pastries.  
Workroom area is sum of\:  
Space required for equipment, handling and processing, interme-  
diate storage \(trolleys\) and side counters. Space for traffic \(pas-  
sages\); lost space.  
Working from the internal operational plan \(layout\), the necessary  
space requirements can be determined.

# WORKSHOPS  
Fire Station  
**Fire station\:** is used for the accommodation of vehicles and other  
equipment.  
**Staffed fire station\:** is used for the accommodation of personnel,  
vehicles and other equipment in readiness for emergency services  
and also in some cases the constantly staffed control centre for  
the centralised receipt of reports, alarming, coordination and con-  
trol of emergency personnel. A flat should ideally be provided. The  
crews are either in readiness or on call for call-outs by telephone  
or fire alarm, either entirely or as reinforcement. Emergency call,  
warning and fire alarm equipment.  
**Functions before the call-out\:** Parking of private cars. Changing  
near the vehicle and fitting of equipment. Getting into vehicle.  
**After the call-out\:** Vehicles returning from a call-out are parked  
forwards into the vehicle hall via the yard. The vehicles are then  
re-equipped and fire-fighting water and fuel filled up. The crew  
change and wash. The plot should be in a position central to all  
parts of town or suitable for risk hotspots. Provide clear and un-  
obstructed access and exit routes and sufficient open areas, e.g.  
consider the turning circles for vehicles. Vehicle washing area with  
sand trap and petrol separator, tanks for diesel and petrol. The  
yard should be suitable for heavy vehicles \(about 16 t\). Under-  
ground and overground hydrants. Space is required for additional  
vehicles, perhaps also a helipad \(50 x 50 m\) with an additional  
15 m of free space. Sport facilities and green areas.

CHRISTIAN CHURCHES  
Liturgical Elements  
Guidelines for church building  
The individual state Churches and bishoprics have special  
guidelines for the churches to be built in their areas. In addition,  
the Places of Assembly Regulations also apply to spaces which  
are not predominantly intended for church services. For new  
building, alteration and refurbishment, the advice of the diocesan  
commission should be requested. Approvals are issued by the  
bishop's representative.  
Because churches serve religious faiths, the form of the building  
should be developed from the belief and the liturgy.  
Liturgical elements  
Religious elements required for all regular acts of worship.  
Pulpit---7 0  
Raised enclosed platform for preaching and the proclamation of the  
Word. The pulpit stands in a close liturgical relationship to the altar,  
but there are no precise regulations regarding its location. This is  
frequently to the right of the altar as seen from the *nave.* The height  
of the pulpit is 1.00-1.20 m \(pulpit floor level\) above the church floor.  
Lectern ---7 0  
In early Christian churches this was a mobile reading desk called  
the ambo for the reading of the Gospels and Epistles. The lectern  
should, despite being mobile, be placed in the immediate vicinity  
of the altar.  
Altar  
'God's table', focus of the celebration of the Eucharist. Fixed  
and mobile altars or sacrament tables are possible. The shape  
and material are not regulated. The altar is mostly rectangular,  
0.95-1.00 m high and free-standing, so that it is possible to walk  
around it without difficulty ---7 8. In reformed churches, however,  
other shapes are possible. An altar should not be used before it is  
consecrated by the bishop.  
Altar steps  
There should be an at least 1.50 m level area in front of the altar,  
next to and behind the altar min. 0.80 m \(if the altar can be walked  
around\). This area is often raised by one or two steps.  
Tabernacle ---7 0  
Shrine for the storage of the reserved sacrament. Tabernacle and  
altar are in a close liturgical and spatial relationship to one another.

# CHRISTIAN CHURCHES  
Furnishing, Vestry  
The layout and form of seating is of great importance for the  
dimensions and effect of the space, quality of hearing and view.  
In smaller churches \(chapels\}, an aisle of 1.00 m width is sufficient  
---7 **e** with pews containing 6-10 seats, or a central aisle of 1.60 rn  
width with seating both sides as ---7 **e.**  
Because of possibly noticeable cold emanating from the external  
walls, two side aisles with pews in between ---7 **0** containing 12-18  
seats is normal.  
Wider churches will have correspondingly more aisles. The total  
space requirement for each seat is therefore approx 0.63-1.0 rn2  
•  
For standing places, 0.25-0.35 m2 each is sufficient; for these a  
large part of the aisles, particularly in front of the back wall, is  
occupied. The width of the exit doors and steps must comply with  
the Places of Assembly Regulations.  
A central aisle on the altar axis is often desired for weddings,  
processions etc.  
**Confessional ---7 G\)**  
Three-compartment enclosed booth made of wood, in the central  
part of which the Catholic priest sits to hear confession. The  
person confessing speaks to the Catholic priest through one of  
the two side compartments through a grille of approx. 30 x 40 em.  
The lower edge of the opening should be approx. 1.00 m above  
floor level. The confessional should be situated inside the church  
at a location which is not too bright. Sufficient ventilation and  
extraction should be provided.  
Today, a confessional room is possible as an alternative.  
Vestry---7 **0**  
The vestry \(also known as sacristy\) is a side room in the church  
for the clergy, vestments and equipment for the service. It is best  
placed near and to the side of the altar.

Bell Towers  
Design  
The standards on bell towers should be complied with.  
A bell specialist can provide advice about the size and pitch of  
the bells, acoustics and weights. A bell founder designs the bell  
frame as the basis for the dimensions and layout of the belfry and  
sound openings, and also contributes loadings for the structural  
engineer, who has to consider static and dynamic loadings.  
1-- D --!  
e Straight yoke  
Bells  
Weight, alloy and wall thickness determine the sound. Electric  
ringing machines are often used today.  
Bell tower --\> 0 - 0  
According to regulations, this is a 'solo musical instrument' and  
forms an 'orchestra' together with the neighbouring bell towers.  
The desired audible range determines the height of the belfry  
\(or bell loft\) in the tower, which should be above the surrounding  
buildings. The quality of the bell tone depends on the tower's  
construction materials and the acoustic design.  
The belfry is a resonance and mixing space which decides the  
musical quality of the sound transmission. The room is fully  
enclosed apart from the sound openings. The natural resonance  
frequency of the tower should not result in any resonance at the  
frequency of the bells.  
Sound shutters --\> f\)  
A fair number of small openings at right angles to the direction  
of the bell swing is better than a few larger ones. The sound  
transmission angle should not be more than 30° from the  
horizontal \(to protect the neighbourhood\). The clapper strike  
should not radiate, which should also be considered in the layout  
of the sound shutters. The total openings should be max. 5%  
of the interior walls of the belfry if the wall surfaces are smooth,  
and max. 10% if rough. Concrete ceilings and floors can be clad  
with wood.

# SYNAGOGUES  
General Design Notes  
The first building commission from God, for a religious sanctuary,  
with exact technical and design specifications for the erection  
of the Tabernacle \(dwelling place\), can be found in the Bible  
\(Exodus 25-27\}.  
In a synagogue, the focal point is not an altar but the raised  
preaching rostrum \(almemor *-1* **0\),** from where Torah excerpts are  
read. The synagogue is aligned towards Jerusalem. In the front  
wall is the ark or chest \(Aron Hakodesh\}, where the Torah scrolls  
are kept --7 **e.**  
Between the rostrum and the ark is an aisle for the ceremonial  
procession before the reading from the scrolls.  
Constructing the plan of a synagogue is always an attempt to  
solve anew a spatial conflict defined by the positioning of two  
room elements of equal significance - the preaching rostrum  
\(almemor\) and the holy ark \(Aron Hakodesh\} - in a sacred room.  
In orthodox synagogues, the ark is mostly located on the east  
\(mirach\) wall and the rostrum in the middle of the room. In more  
liberal synagogues, the two elements are spatially combined and  
orientated toward the east wall.  
The space for women is at least symbolically separated from, and  
out of the view of, the men, often in the form of a balcony. At the  
entrance to the synagogue, there is a fountain or washbasin for  
handwashing. The ritual bath \(mikva\) for women, with immersion  
pool, is normally in the cellar. It should have natural running water  
that has not flowed through metal pipes. A more liberal synagogue  
might have an organ, but it would be unobstrusive.  
The symbols of the Star of David, the seven-branched candlestick  
\(menorah\) and tablets of the Mosaic law are essential elements. The  
decoration consists of plant, geometrical or written ornamentation\:  
depictions of people are excluded.

MOSQUES  
General Design Notes  
The mosque - in Arabic, masjid \(smaller\), jamia masjid \(larger\) -  
is a prayer house, cultural centre, community place of assembly,  
courthouse, school and university, with the Qur'an being the  
central source of life rules, teaching, law and religion for Islam.  
In Islamic countries, the mosque stands in the bazaar \(souk\) at the  
centre of public life. Where bazaars are missing in other countries,  
they should be designed into the mosque \(hairdresser, shop for  
halal food, cafe\).  
There are basic categories of mosque design and seven distinctive  
regional styles, e.g. the pillared hall and courtyard in much of the  
Middle East, Spain and North Africa, and the triple domes and  
courtyard of the Indian sub-continent. In the decoration, depictions  
of people or animals are not allowed. Plant and geometrical  
ornaments \(arabesques\) and verses from the Qur'an in Arabic  
calligraphy are popular and have developed into a high art form.  
Minaret  
Smaller mosques seldom have a minaret, but larger ones always  
do. There are neither organ nor bells in Islam. From the minaret,  
with stair or lift to the mostly roofed upper walkway, the muezzin  
calls to prayer five times daily, today often with a loudspeaker  
\(which in some countries is not allowed\).  
Prayer hall  
The prayer hall is laid out with a praying area of 0.85 m2 for each  
person. The hall is normally rectangular to square, often with a  
central dome and is aligned to Mecca as prayer direction \(qibla\).  
On the interior of the front wall, there is the prayer niche \(mihrab\),  
and next to that the pulpit for the Friday prayers \(minbar\), always  
with an odd number of steps, for the mosque prayer leader  
\(imam\). An often only symbolic separation or a balcony serves to  
segregate the men and the women.  
Entrance  
At the entrance, there are shelves for the shoes of the believers  
and rooms for ritual washing and showers, always with flowing  
water. The WCs are mostly as squatting closets aligned at right  
angles to the direction of Mecca. Mosques often have separate  
entrances for men and women, or the stairs to the women's  
balcony can be in the entrance area.  
Decorative well  
Many mosques have an inner courtyard of the same size as the  
prayer hall, which can also be used as an extension for festivals and a  
decorative fountain or well \(sabil\) for ritual washing. In warm countries,  
geometrically arranged trees are planted here to give shade.  
Subsidiary rooms  
Office, library, lecture and tuition room, store rooms and flats for  
at least the imam and muezzin complete the room allocation plan.

Single practices  
A practice of a single specialist must have a minimum amount  
of space \(approx. 150 m2\) and functions separated into rooms,  
which are differentiated and extended according to speciality.  
There is a general division between the patient and the staff areas.  
At the entrance, there is a waiting area with cloakroom and WC, and  
the doctor's area with consultation room is placed near the waiting  
area. The treatment room and laboratory are next door. An extension  
of the consultation and examination area for repeated treatments  
and a separate diagnostic zone are sensible. The number and size  
of the rooms are based on the particular specialist qualifications of  
the doctor \(internist and general practitioner, surgeon, orthopaedist,  
gynaecologist etc.\). Patient WCs, staff changing rooms with WCs  
and staff lounge complete the programme. Separate children's play  
areas can be a good idea in the waiting area \(e.g. gynaecology\).  
Waiting room  
The size is in accordance with the number and frequency of visits  
to the treatment rooms, depending on the specialisation of the  
doctor. If the practice is organised to require appointments, the  
size of the waiting room can be reduced.  
Appointment planning and recording of services take place in  
the reception. The staff here must be able to oversee the waiting  
room and the entrance, and the connection to the medical area  
should be as short as possible.  
Consultation room  
The doctor's consultation room \(12-16 m2\) is a visually and  
acoustically enclosed room and primarily intended for the  
purposes of establishing case history, consultation, study of  
diagnostic findings, development of therapy plans and protocols.  
The furniture should include a desk with PC workstation, at least  
two chairs and an X-ray display.  
Examination and treatment rooms  
In size \~20 m2  
, these rooms differ according to the nature and  
form of treatment. The minimum furnishing would be a chair  
and couch for the patient, revolving stool, workbench with basin  
and instrument table. Adequate space for movement should be  
planned for the doctor and patient.  
The size of other specific examination and treatment rooms  
\(X-ray, taking blood samples, various therapies\) depends on the  
required specialist instruments, apparatus and storage room plus  
integrated changing room \(1.5 m2\). Separate office support is not  
necessary. Better is a generous reception with daylight and desks  
\(equipped with PCs\) with direct access to patient files. Washbasins  
with additional disinfectant dispensers are to be provided in all  
rooms with patient contact and treatment.  
Medical centres/group practices  
These terms denote the combination of two or more doctors  
practising together with shared staff and facilities. The creation of  
such practices can result in a clear saving of space with improved  
performance and convenience, for example if facilities like X-ray,  
laboratory tests and various therapies, as well as administration  
and staff rooms, can be used communally.  
In the UK group practices mainly consist of general practitioners  
\(GPs\), who if necessary refer patients to specialists \(usually based  
in hospitals\). The group practice may also include practice nurses,  
midwives, health visitors, physiotherapists and other health  
professionals.

# HOSPITALS  
General, Modular Grid  
The investment and operating costs of a hospital are extremely  
high, so operational planning and an economical room allocation  
plan must be produced as a priority to reduce the operating and  
staffing costs. This is discussed and laid down at the preliminary  
design stage through collaboration by the responsible authorities,  
client, doctors, architects, specialist designers and the hospital  
administration. Based on the operational planning and the room  
allocation plan, the architectural design team can proceed with  
the construction and form of the building and the installation of  
systems, while planning equipment for medical requirements,  
fittings and furnishings.

Hospitals, clinics and health centres serve to treat and care for  
patients with acute and chronic illnesses. The medical and care  
objectives determine the size of the specialist departments and  
treatment facilities according to the nature and extent of the  
conditions. Regarding domestic requirements, modern hospitals  
offer something of the nature of a hotel. The atmosphere of a  
sanatorium with particular emphasis on hygiene, which was  
usual in the last century, is no longer desirable. Patients' length  
of stay is becoming increasingly short. In a main hospital the ratio  
of the areas for care to the areas for examination and treatment  
is approaching '1 \:'1. Reform of health provision is making great  
changes in the hospital landscape and among service providers,  
which can be public, non-profit making or private.  
# Structure  
The general hospital is functionally divided into areas for  
examination and treatment, care, administration, social services,  
supply and waste disposal and services. Additionally, there are  
residential areas and sometimes areas for tuition and research  
\(university teaching hospital\). The above operational areas are  
close neighbours but operationally separate. It is necessary to  
maintain short horizontal and vertical connections while preserving  
the greatest possible flexibility and a smooth flow of traffic  
between all departments. Hospitals are categorised according to  
their function into general and specialist hospitals and university  
teaching hospitals. The current changes in health policy are leading  
to different financial structures and also to new types of building  
like outpatient medical centres and patient hotels. Hospitals are  
also divided into those for basic provision \(up to about 240 beds\),  
normal provision \(up to about 520 beds\) and main hospitals \(up to  
800 beds\), depending on their particular purpose.  
# University teaching hospital  
With their maximum provision, teaching hospitals are comparable  
to some main hospitals in their departmental structure and  
service provision. They possess particularly extensive diagnostic  
and therapeutic equipment and at the same time are engaged  
in education and research. Lecture theatres and demonstration  
rooms should be included so that the operation of the hospital  
is not disturbed by students. Wards need to be larger to  
accommodate rounds attended by a large number of people. The  
specialisations and particular requirements of a teaching hospital  
demand special organisation, function and room allocation plans.  
# Specialist hospital  
Specialist hospitals are intended for particular types of treatment  
or groups of complaints\: accident and emergency, rehabilitation  
clinic, orthopaedic clinic, gynaecology etc. There are also hospitals  
specialising in tuberculosis, cancer, mental disorders, different  
types of surgery etc. There is a flexible overlap with health resorts  
and care, rehabilitation and homes for the elderly. The number of  
specialist hospitals is increasing greatly \(e.g. dermatology, lung  
and allergy clinics\) due to the growing specialisation of medicine.

# Space allocation plan  
A space allocation plan has to be produced as part of the  
design process, and this forms the basis of the structure and  
requirements of the entire hospital. Any specialist emphasis in a  
hospital has an effect on the nature and size of other departments.  
The area guideline values can give an overview of the size of the  
individual departments. It should be noted that these guideline  
values are only recommendations and depend on the specialist  
equipment and services of the hospital in question.  
# Building design  
Possible alterations of use in the course of the period of  
operation of a hospital will have a considerable influence on  
the design concept, and need to be considered in addition to  
shortness of distances, efficient work flows and operational  
interactions. For the design of new hospitals intended for  
regular provision, approx. 42 m2 usable area per bed can be  
assumed, and for the gross built volume approx. 200-280 m3  
per bed.  
Hospitals are frequently built in a number of construction  
phases or are extensions of existing hospitals. Therefore a  
comprehensive target and development plan \(scale 1 \:500\)  
should be produced at an early stage showing and arrang-  
ing logistically the different phases. The construction and the  
design \(routes, corridors\) must be laid out so that the build-  
ing can be extended in various ways. The architect should  
take note of the current regulations and guidelines \(model  
hospital building regulations, operational regulations of the  
hospital, state building regulations etc.\) at the beginning of  
the project.  
# Modular coordination  
The application of modular coordination of dimensions  
should form the basis for the design of a hospital. This  
involves the adoption of a reference system, basic module  
and multiple modules in order to determine the purpose,  
location and dimensions of a building element. For hospital  
building, the preferred dimension of 12 M = 1.20 m is  
recommended. If this module is too coarse, then preferred  
dimensions of 6 M or 3 M can be chosen. All building  
elements are integrated into this modular system and  
matched with each other. The creation of the basic grid,  
horizontally and vertically, defines the load-bearing structure.  
The effects of using a modular system are short construction  
times, the simpler exchange of finishing elements and thus  
less disturbance to existing use.  
# Structural grid  
The structural grid must enable good route planning and  
the possibility of differentiating the operational departments  
into zones\: main function, subsidiary functions and traffic. A  
comparison of the individual departments and their required  
rooms leads to a structural grid, which is suitable for all  
operational departments.  
Structural grids of 7.20 m or 7.80 m have proved successful  
in practice. Column spacings of 7.20 m or 7.80 m enable  
the various departments to be included in the design with  
the least difficulty. Smaller structural grids \(e.g. 3.60 m x  
7.20 m\) are also possible, because the number of larger  
rooms such as operating theatres \(approx. 40 m2\) is relatively  
small. Reinforced concrete slabs should be designed without  
downstand beams in order to simplify the routeing of the  
service installations.

# Access  
# Useful life  
Structure, walls, fittings and finishings have different lifetimes.  
The structure should if possible be framed in order to keep the  
construction of the walls and partitions flexible. Medical equipment  
is replaced after approx. 5-10 years according to department  
and depreciation, which can have significant effect on the spatial  
arrangements \(e.g. linear accelerators, MRI scanners\). The possible  
installation and removal of such equipment without disrupting the  
load-bearing structure should be taken into account in the design.  
# Site  
The site for a hospital needs enough space for the building, its  
access and any possible extensions, and should be in a quiet  
area. Contaminated ground should be avoided. Separated access  
roads for visitors and patients, staff, goods and emergency  
vehicles, as well as a helicopter pad, all need to be taken into  
account in the selection of a site. The minimum land area for an  
acute hospital with rectangular layout is approx. 15,000 m2  
.  
# Orientation  
The best orientation for treatment and operational rooms is  
between north-west and north-east. For the fronts of patient  
rooms, south-east or south-west is favourable, with pleasant  
morning sun, little heat build-up, few sun protection measures  
necessary and temperate evenings. East-west rooms in contrast  
have deeper summer sun penetration but little winter sun.  
# Building forms  
The form of the building is determined to a considerable extent  
by the selection of access and routeing. A decision should be  
reached at an early stage whether a design with a main corridor  
\(spine\) and branches \(transverse corridors\) is chosen or whether  
circulation will be radially outwards from a cruciform core.  
Possible extensions and construction phases should be taken into  
account. The vertical section of a hospital should be designed so  
that the functions care, examination and treatment, supply and  
waste disposal, delivery of patients on stretchers, service yard,  
storage, administration and clinical medical service can be laid out  
separately and reached quickly.  
An example of a **vertical structure\:**  
-top floor\: helipad, air conditioning plant  
- 2nd-3rd floors\: care wards  
- 1st floor\: operating theatre area, central sterilisation, intensive  
care, maternity, nursing mothers, children's ward  
- ground floor\: entrance and information, radiology, clinical  
medical service, outpatients, delivery of stretcher patients,  
emergency cases, administration, cafeteria  
- basement\: archive, physiotherapy, linear accelerator, radiation  
therapy, laboratory, kitchen with service yard  
The different floors' height requirements should be noted\: care  
area approx. height 3.40 m \(less construction = flat slab with  
floor structure = 35 em = 3.05 m clear height\), examination and  
treatment height approx. 4.20 m, supply and waste disposal and  
services approx. height 4.20-5.00 m.

HOSPITAlS  
Corridors, Doors, Stairs, Lifts  
Corridors  
Corridors have to be of suitable dimensions for the expected  
traffic. Generally accessible corridors should be at least 1.50 m  
wide and those in which patients are transported on beds must  
have a usable width of at least 2.25 m. The suspended ceiling in  
corridors can be lowered down to a height of 2.40 min. in order to  
provide room for service runs. This does, however, lead to the use  
of special fire protection ceilings in order to secure escape routes.  
Fire protection requirements must be observed. Internal corridors  
should be avoided because these have to be mechanically smoke  
extracted. The usable width of corridors should not be narrowed  
by installations, columns or other building elements. Windows for  
lighting and ventilation should not be wider than 25 m apart.  
Doors  
The placing and selection of suitable doors in hospitals deserves  
particular attention. The construction and quality of room doors  
must meet the requirements of sound reduction and fire protection,  
and the surface cladding must resist long-term cleaning and  
disinfection.  
The clear opening height of doors is according to type and  
function\:  
- standard door \(unfinished\)\:  
doors through which beds pass\:  
-corridor doors, double\:  
885 x 2135 mm  
1260-1375 x 2135 mm  
2400 x 2400 mm  
In firewalls, T90 doors \(held open\) should be installed in order not  
to obstruct traffic.  
Stairs  
For safety reasons, stairs must be built so that they can accept  
the entire vertical traffic in case of need. They must also be  
constructed to prevent sound and odour transfer and prevent  
draughts. Stairs must have handrails without free ends on both  
sides. Spiral stairs are not permissible as emergency stairs. The  
usable width of emergency stairs and their landings must be at  
least 1.50 m and not more than 2.50 m.  
Door leaves must not restrict the usable width of the stair HOSPITALS

Operational Areas  
Hospitals are laid out according to operational areas and  
operational departments\:  
- examination and treatment  
-care  
- administration  
- social services  
-education and research  
-other  
The examination and treatment area is, besides care, the most  
important within the overall organisation of a hospital and is  
characterised by particular features resulting from its specialisation  
and equipment.  
Patient-doctor contact varies according to discipline, as does  
the frequency of patient examinations. The precise determination  
of the location of the various examination and treatment areas  
in the building and their relation to each other can be made in  
general terms. The individual departments in the examination  
and treatment area are preferably situated in the basement, or  
on the ground floor and first floor, with outpatient attendance  
concentrated in the ground floor. The combination of all medical  
disciplines into a cohesive area is important in order to improve  
cooperation and consultation.

# Outpatient facilities  
Facilities for outpatient treatment are visited daily or consulted  
many times, according to an appointment schedule, by patients  
capable of walking.  
Of particular importance is the allocation of outpatient rooms. A  
separation of the routeing of outpatients and inpatients should  
be included in the design work at an early stage. The number of  
outpatients attending depends on the size of, and the specialist  
departments in, a particular hospital. If there are a large number  
of outpatients, then a larger dedicated area can be provided,  
separate from the rest of the activity. There must, however, always  
be a rapid connection to the X-ray department. The increasing  
significance of outpatient \(day\) surgery should also be considered  
\(larger waiting rooms, more outpatient rooms\).  
# Outpatient surgery  
The share of operations performed on outpatients will increase  
further. Outpatient \(or day\) surgery departments can be added to  
existing hospitals, integrated into the surgical department or set  
up as independent clinics. In the hospital, the department should  
be near the main entrance and the emergency care department.  
The patients in an outpatient surgical centre \(mainly undergoing  
elective operations as part of an outpatient, day clinic or short-stay  
treatment arrangement\) are in a different physical and mental state  
from patients delivered as emergency cases. A clear guidance and  
signposting system and friendly, confidence-boosting ambience  
are particularly recommended.  
One surgical department which concentrates on elective  
outpatient treatment, has a 'modern' room arrangement with  
smaller operating theatres \(approx. 30 m2\), a multi-functional  
preparation room, smaller washrooms for two operating theatres,  
one recovery room with five places, and a quiet zone. There are  
no purely preparation and post-op rooms, storerooms or classic  
access control lobbies for patients.  
# Outpatient medical centre  
This is a separate establishment associated with a hospital for  
the treatment of patients on an outpatient or short-stay basis;  
the room and organisational structure differ considerably from  
inpatient hospital treatment. The spectrum of complaints treated  
and the medical services offered have to be considered. The  
technical medical equipment can be reduced and the room  
furnishing can be designed rather more generously regarding  
hygiene \(e.g. carpets, parquet\).  
Inpatient care and therapy of patients with infectious diseases,  
chronic illnesses, serious complications after an operation etc.  
are not provided here, so the stringency of the hospital building  
regulations can be partially relaxed or even waived for a particular  
project with carefully reasoned exemption applications.  
The decision about the quantity and quality of ventilation  
equipment, anaesthetic technology, ceiling supply units, radiation  
protection equipment etc. should be critically examined, because  
there are considerable potential savings. For most operations, air-  
handling systems to reduce bacteria counts and particles are not  
necessary, so the advance determination of the planned spectrum  
of operations is also of economic significance.

HOSPITALS  
Examination and Treatment  
Reception and emergency provision  
The accident and emergency unit must be quickly reached by  
accident patients \(on stretchers\) via the ambulance hall \(clear  
access road height= min. 3.50 m\) and by ambulant patients from  
the main entrance.  
A good location for this department is the opposite side to  
the main entrance. The department consists of a row of small  
examination and treatment rooms \(16-21 m2\), equipped with a  
couch, small operating light, cupboard units with sink and possibly  
patient cubicles. There must also be a plaster room with plastering  
bench and a first-aid room for treating shock. Additionally, surgery  
rooms \(similar to operating theatres\) should be available. The  
X-ray department should be nearby. Storage places for at least  
two stretchers and for wheelchairs should be provided in the  
ambulance hall.  
The clinical service doctors, surgeons and anaesthetists should  
be grouped in the vicinity.  
Clinical medical service  
This term describes all the management rooms of the individual  
specialist departments/clinics. The classic medical service  
facilities include a medical superintendent's room with office  
support, a senior doctor's room and an examination room with  
waiting area and toilets. These clinical medical service rooms form  
the core of the outpatient zone on the ground floor of the hospital.  
General medicine \(internal medicine\)  
Further rooms should be provided for the following specialisms\:  
Ophthalmology\: Treatment room \(25 m2\) with slit lamp, capable  
of being darkened; squint treatment room; laser room.  
Ear, nose and throat\: Treatment room \(25-30 m2\), capable  
of being darkened, with treatment table or treatment chair for  
examinations.  
Urology\: Urological treatment is connected with X-ray diagnosis.  
The treatment room \(25-30 m2\) has a table for endoscopic  
examinations and is equipped with suspended irrigator and floor  
drainage. Next door is an instrument room with sink.  
Functional diagnosis  
Functional diagnosis is becoming *ever* more important in hospitals,  
partly due to progress in heart/thorax examinations and also  
the increase in complaints relating to heart-lung and circulation  
functions.  
All examination rooms must be accessible through patient  
cabins, possibly also preparation rooms \(for left heart catheter  
measurement\).  
Endoscopy  
An endoscope is a mirror instrument used to illuminate and  
observe cavities inside the body. It is inserted through natural  
body openings with the patient under partial anaesthesia.  
The categories are gastroscopy, bronchoscopy, rectoscopy,  
laparoscopy and cystoscopy. The device is prepared directly in the  
examination and treatment room. WCs should be provided for the  
patients before entering. This department should have a bedded  
waiting area and rest room \(beds = no. of endoscopy rooms x 2\) .

Examination and Treatment  
# Laboratory medicine  
The laboratory is mostly concerned with the preparation and  
processing of blood, urine and stool samples. The laboratory  
should be a large room with standing and sitting workstations.  
Specialist laboratories are added on as separate rooms.  
Subsidiary rooms include rest room for staff, rinsing room,  
sluice room, disinfection room, cold room. Quick connection to  
other departments is provided by a pneumatic delivery system.  
Laboratory areas can also be completely off-site and serve several  
hospitals.  
# Pathology  
The pathology department of a hospital includes rooms for  
storage of bodies, dissection, refrigeration of bodies, laying out,  
placing into coffins, coffin storage and changing rooms for the  
pathologists. Separate access for relatives and the shortest  
possible road access for undertakers are important. This  
department should not be in the vicinity of the service yard.  
# Radiology  
Radiology requires rooms in which ionising radiation is applied  
for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. It should be near the  
outpatients department and the ambulance approach road. The  
heavy weight of the equipment \(up to approx. 14 t\) means that  
this department is better located on the ground or first basement.  
A connecting room for staff, which also serves as store, dictation  
room and possibly as switch room, is advantageous. The size of the  
departments' rooms is determined by the large medical equipment  
and related technology. Sonography, mammography and jaw  
radioscopy need room sizes of approx. 15-18 m2  
, radioscopy  
and exposure rooms approx. 20-30 m2  
. The access for patients  
should be through two changing cubicles for each radioscopy  
room and a wide \(1.25 m\) door for beds is also necessary. WCs for  
gastroscopy, colonoscopy and contrast medium patients should  
be attached to the radioscopy rooms. Angiography rooms require  
a preparation room with cupboard units \(sink, pharmaceutical  
refrigerator\). The exposure room for computer tomography must  
have dimensions of approx. 35 m2  
• Between the switchroom and  
the exposure room is a door and a clear window. An additional  
room for switching cabinets and a room for film development are  
also sensible. The walls and ceilings are protected with lead inserts  
\(e.g. in plasterboard walls\). The lead equivalent values in walls and  
ceilings depend on the X-ray equipment and its manufacturer, with  
whom early collaboration is essential.

# Operating department  
The location of the operating department in the overall organisation  
of the hospital is of great significance. The design should include a  
short distance to the intensive care unit, recovery room and central  
sterile store, because rapid access between these departments  
must always be ensured. Surgical departments are best placed  
centrally and with easy accessibility in the core of the hospital.  
# Organisation of the operating department  
The following rooms or room zones belong in every operating  
department\:  
-operating theatre, preparation, transfer, scrub room, sterile  
goods store, with a total area of approx. 80m2•  
The operating theatre should be as square as possible to enable  
proper working with the operating table \(size approx. 6.50 x  
6.50 m\) turned in any direction. The clear ceiling height must be  
3.00 m with a space above the ceiling of approx. 70-80 em for  
air conditioning and other services. Operating theatres should be  
designed to be as uniform as possible to enable interdisciplinary  
work. The doors to the operating theatre operate automatically.  
The basic equipment includes an adjustable and transportable  
operating table system mounted on a fixed plinth in the centre of  
the operating theatre.  
# Routeing  
In order to reduce infection through contact, the various work  
processes should be separated.  
The one-corridor system, in which pre- and post-operative patients,  
clean and dirty goods can all be present in one corridor leading to  
the theatres, is still often used today for reasons of cost and space.  
Two-corridor systems are better, with the patients and staff or  
patients and dirty goods separated. The separation of the flow of  
patients from the work area of the operating theatre is important.  
In exceptional cases a **preparation room** is sensible. The size is  
approx. 3.80 x 3.80 m. Electrical sliding doors on the side toward  
the operating theatre, with 1.40 m clear opening width and clear  
windows, which should provide a connection to the operating  
theatre. The fixtures should include refrigerator, sink, rinsing unit,  
cupboard for cannulas, sockets for anaesthetic equipment and  
emergency power supply.  
Likewise, a **transfer room** is advisable only in exceptional cases.  
It is equipped like the preparation room. There is a sliding door to  
the working corridor with a clear width of 1.25 m. There should  
be a sink.  
A **scrub room** with at least six places should be provided in the  
immediate vicinity of the operating theatre. The minimum width of  
the room should be 1.80 m.  
One **sterile goods room** is required per operating theatre, of  
approx. 10-15 m2  
• This must be directly accessible from the  
operating theatre. There are also floor layouts with a large central  
sterile goods store. The **equipment room** should not be too far  
from the operating theatre; size 20 m2  
•  
The **operating theatres control centre** should be centrally  
located and have a large area of glass from which to oversee the  
working corridor. In addition to a desk, there should be cupboards  
and a pin-board for organisational planning.  
**Dictation rooms** can be provided as small room units of approx.  
6 m2  
, as the surgeons need this room only for reports after  
operations.  
There must be a **cleaning room** of 5 m2 in every operating  
department, because cleaning and disinfection is performed after  
each operation. Near the control lobby for patients, sufficient  
space should be provided for clean, prepared beds, one clean  
bed per operation.  
**Toiletfacilities** should not be located near the patients' control  
lobbies, and are to be avoided in the operating area for hygienic  
reasons.

# HOSPITALS  
Examination and Treatment  
A number of essential supply and workrooms are associated  
with the operating theatre. The operating department includes  
staff and patient control lobbies, instrument preparation, waste  
disposal control lobbies, supply control lobbies, storage space  
for operating trolleys and also, in the direct vicinity, the recovery  
room. Integrated into the patient control lobby are the functions  
bed transfer, preparation of the operating table and storage for  
operating tables.  
A replacement power supply is necessary for operating depart-  
ments to ensure the continuance and completion of operations in  
case of a mains failure.  
# Post-operative patient monitoring  
The **recovery room** has to accept post-op patients from several  
theatres. The number of beds required is thus 1.5 times the  
number of theatres. There should be a nurse's observation point  
with a view of all beds and a dirty room next door. The recovery  
room should be designed as a large, suitably arranged space.  
The **equipment preparation room for anaesthetic devices** has  
a dirty side for unsterile \(infected\) material and a clean side for  
devices prepared for use. The fittings include sink, storage and  
worktop space, and steam sterilisers. Operating instruments are  
prepared exclusively in the central sterile store, which is situated  
outside the operating zone.  
A **plaster room** with plastering bench also belongs in the operat-  
ing suite, particularly where many surgical-orthopaedic operations  
are carried out.  
The dimensions of the **staff lounge** correspond to the size of the  
operating department. Each theatre team \(surgeons, anaesthet-  
ists, operating department practitioners \(OOPs\), theatre nurses,  
anaesthesia nurses\) should be assumed to have eight members.  
The lounge should have sufficient seating, cupboards and a sink.  
Natural **lighting** of the operating theatre is psychologically  
advantageous, but is often impractical due to the layout of the  
rooms. The artificial **lighting** of the operating environment must  
be designed so that the light can fall from various directions  
according to the layout of incisions. The most frequently used  
lighting system is the mobile operating light suspended from the  
ceiling. This consists of a swivelling ceiling light, usually equipped  
with an additional light in the form of a satellite. The main light  
contains a number of small lights in order to avoid sharp shadows.  
The division of the operating theatre into septic and aseptic zones  
is medically controversial, but is still sensible as a precaution.  
Floor and walls must be flat and easily washable throughout.  
# Air conditioning  
Operating departments are nearly always air-conditioned. The  
ventilation serves to reduce micro-organisms by filtering, diluting  
and replacing the air. The supply of appropriately conditioned air in  
the required quantities is provided by the air-conditioning system.  
15-20 air changes are required per hour to achieve a reasonable  
decontamination of the air between operations. In order to create  
an extensively sterile zone in the operating theatre, there should  
be no uncontrolled air intake from surrounding rooms. This can  
be achieved through an airtight envelope around the operating  
theatre \(tightest possible joint sealing during construction\) and/or  
by protective pressurising \(i.e. pressure dropping from the room  
to be protected to other, less vulnerable areas\). A standard lays  
down the air flow direction in the operating area. The operating  
theatre has the highest pressure in order to prevent air entering.  
The lowest pressure should be in the subsidiary and functional  
rooms. Windows in operating theatres should be lockable. ODD \~ o

# HOSPITALS  
Examination and Treatment  
Maternity unit  
In addition to the task of overseeing normal births, the maternity unit  
also treats women with complications. A room similar to an operating  
theatre, for caesarean births, is therefore absolutely necessary in  
addition to the normal delivery rooms. In situations where a theatre-  
like delivery room is not possible inside the maternity unit, the unit  
should be next to the general operating theatre. The maternity area  
should be attached to the post-natal and baby care zones.  
The delivery suite should include a room for midwives and for  
observation \(large glass window\) and a labour room. The delivery  
room should be equipped with a changing table with integrated  
baby bath and a radiant heater. A demand has arisen recently for  
further equipment for various types of birth \(water birth etc.\), and  
a bath for relaxation near the delivery room is also very popular.  
A specific team of staff work in the maternity unit and require the  
appropriate lounge, clean and dirty workrooms, reception, and  
toilets for staff and patients.  
Radiotherapy  
Conditions diagnosed as tumours are treated in the radiotherapy  
department. Each treatment room requires a changing cubicle for  
ambulant patients and a waiting area for bedbound patients, and  
each department requires doctor's rooms, a switch room, possibly  
a localisation room, services rooms and a film development  
room. A workshop and at least one physics laboratory are also  
necessary.  
The safety conditions are particularly stringent for radiation  
therapy\: a series of laws, regulations and standards is in place.  
Radiation protection can be achieved by using lead inserts or thick  
concrete \(e.g. barite concrete\) walls.  
The massive weight of radiation equipment and its required  
constructional radiation protection mean that radiation therapy  
will be located in the basement or ground floor. The clear ceiling  
height of radiation rooms must be 3.00 m and the concrete walls  
can, depending on the exact equipment, be up to 3.00 m thick for  
the treatment and examination area in the primary radiation area  
and up to 1.50 m thick for the secondary area.

# Physiotherapy  
This department can be placed on the ground floor, but should  
have adequate natural ventilation through rooflights or light shafts.  
It must be accessed through a reception area.  
Physiotherapy is divided into a dry and a wet area, the latter  
consisting of exercise bath \(approx. 4 x 6 m\), 'four-cell' bath,  
'butterfly' bath, inhalation rooms, massage baths, hand-foot baths  
and the associated subsidiary rooms. The separation between wet  
and dry areas should be implemented completely.  
The necessary subsidiary rooms are changing rooms for women  
and men, wheelchair-friendly toilet, staff and patient toilets,  
lounge, laundry store, waiting zone, cleaning room and services  
rooms for the exercise bath.  
In the dry area, there are gymnastics rooms \(approx. 40-50 m2\)  
for group treatment and single therapy rooms \(approx. 20 m2\) for  
Bobath concept and exercise therapy. The clear ceiling height  
must be min. 3.00 m.

# HOSPITALS  
Care  
The care department is laid out as an enclosed unit and through  
traffic should be avoided. The wards must be naturally lit but  
functional rooms, like those for treatment, or the duty station with  
clean workrooms and pharmaceutical stores, can be located in  
the internal artificially lit area.  
The normal size of a care ward is 30-36 beds. If the arrangement  
of the central functional rooms is appropriate \(nurses' station,  
clean workroom etc.\), then a number of wards can be structurally  
combined.  
With other organisational forms of medical care, economic ward  
sizes of up to 48 beds can be reached. The rooms must be laid out  
so that there is sufficient room for movement. A sufficient number  
of patient cupboards, and space for care equipment \(walking  
frame, corn mode\) and care devices must be available.  
# General care  
Standard care units provide general inpatient care, particularly for  
short-term and acute illnesses, with predominantly short stays.  
Units with the same space requirement should be structured  
above each other, in bed blocks.  
The individual wards of a hospital are increasingly being run on an  
interdisciplinary basis and mixing the sexes, so the wards should  
be planned as units capable of being combined. Each ward must  
have at least one doctor's room where minor examinations can  
take place.  
# Room relationships  
The ward entrance lobby must be clearly visible from the glazed  
nurses' station, and pharmaceutical stores and wash rooms  
should be easily accessible. The logistics of patient supply requires  
centrally located supply and waste disposal rooms for medi-  
cation, laundry, waste and catering.  
# Wet cells  
Each patient room should have its own wet cell with WC,  
washbasin and sometimes also shower, although these can also  
be separated as shower rooms. The wet cells should be accessible  
for disabled people.  
The heights of vanity unit and WC are important \(vanity unit  
rnin. 86 ern so that wheelchairs can fit underneath\). The WC for  
wheelchair users should be at a height of approx. 49 em, i.e. top  
level of the toilet seat. Each ward should also have staff, visitor  
and wheelchair WCs.

# Size of patient room  
Patient beds should be accessible on three sides, and next to the  
bed there should be at least one side table. On the window side, a  
table \(90/90 em\) with chairs \(one per patient\) should be provided.  
It must be possible to open the built-in cupboard without having  
to move bed or side table.  
The minimum size for a single bedroom is 16m2  
, for two and three  
bedrooms 8 m2 per bed \(Hospital Regulations\). The room widths  
should be chosen so that the beds at the back can be wheeled out  
of the room without having to move the first bed out of the room  
\(minimum width 3.45 m with an axial width of 3.60 m\).  
# Fitting out patient rooms  
In order to protect the walls of the room from damage by beds,  
side tables or trolleys, a protection rail made of suitable material  
must be fixed to all walls \(height min. 40-70 em above floor level\).  
This also applies to the corridors in the ward.  
**Patient cupboards** must be sufficiently large. A suitcase com-  
partment above the cupboard and a lockable compartment for  
valuables inside the cupboard are useful.  
The **room doors** must be large, 1.26 x 2.13 m, on account of  
frequent bed transport, and sound protection to the corridor  
should be 32 dB. Behind the beds, there is a supply rail for air/  
gas and lighting. Special sockets can supply oxygen, vacuum  
and compressed air. Also integrated are sockets, reading lamp,  
telephone, nurse call button and radio.

Care  
# Workroom, clean/medication  
The clean workroom should be about 20 m2• The fitting out  
consists of fixed shelving or a flexible storage system of modular  
units, which are filled up in the central stores, and pharmaceutical  
cabinets. Special cupboards for medicines should be available  
and also a safe for narcotics.  
# Workroom, dirty  
This room is for the staff in the vicinity of the patient rooms. One  
dirty workroom should be provided for every eight beds. There  
should be cleaning and disinfection sinks \(emptying bed pans\),  
wash-hand basins, worktop with lighting, cupboards or shelves  
for dirty washing bags, room size approx. 8-10m2•  
# Nurses' station  
The nurses' station, size approx. 25-30 m2  
, should be in the centre  
of the ward. It should have a large glazed opening to the corridor  
for visual and communication contact \(observe fire regulations\).  
# Staff lounge/kitchenette  
The staff lounge, size approx. 16 m2  
, with its own kitchen work  
area, staff refrigerator and possibly lockers for valuables. The  
**kitchenette** is for preparation and warming up of small amounts of  
food for patients. The equipment depends on the organisation of  
the main kitchen, e.g. catering distribution system with insulated  
trolley.  
# Ward doctor's office  
The ward doctor must be able to examine patients here. In addition  
to the desk, there should be room for shelves and an examination  
couch. Room size approx. 16-20 m2  
.  
# Patients' lounge  
As general meeting point for patients, size approx. 22-25 m2  
. The  
furnishing should be homely. A television set no longer has to be  
provided here, as this is normally mounted on the wall in each  
patient room. The question of separate lounges for smokers and  
non-smokers should be clarified at an early stage with the hospital  
management.  
# Patient bathroom  
The equipment includes a bath with lifting device, which is  
accessible on three sides. An additional shower in a version  
designed for disabled people is also useful and an accessible WC  
should be integrated.  
# Services room  
Each ward must have its own electricity distribution board for  
high-voltage electricity, emergency power supply and communi-  
cations/iT. Room size 8 m2

# Nursing mother and neonatal care  
The care of nursing mothers and babies includes all activities  
necessary after a hospital delivery for the bodily, medical,  
psychological and social support of nursing mothers and  
newborns with normal progress.  
The organisation of care for nursing mothers is similar to that for  
general care. Where the care of newborns is centralised, their care  
unit is located at the edge of or within the nursing mothers' unit.  
In order to reduce infection, the area is divided into small rooms  
or compartments. The babies are carried or wheeled on trolleys  
into the nursing mothers' room for breastfeeding. This creates a  
more frequent and intensive contact between mother and child  
than the former arrangement with a central breastfeeding room.  
The accommodation of new mothers and newborns in one room  
\('rooming-in'\) avoids the transport of babies and makes less work  
for the staff.  
**Care units** are mostly smaller than for normal care; limiting the  
size of the care group to 10-14 beds is sensible. For hygienic  
reasons, the requirements for the care of nursing mothers and  
newborns are higher than for normal care. Therefore, in addition  
to the normal control lobby system, a lobby plus cloakroom must  
be provided for visitors. The bed space can be designed as with  
normal care but the spacing of the beds needs to be larger to  
allow for the baby's cot. The sanitary facilities must include  
hip-bath/shower combinations and showers.  
**Neonatal care units** comprise\: cot spaces for newborns, nappy  
removal, baby bathing, nappy fitting, cradle space, work area for  
neonatal nurse, possibly parking for transport trolley, work area  
for the departmental sister, nurses' lounge, kitchenette, doctor's  
office, examination and treatment room, clean workroom, patient  
bath, day room for patients and visitors, store, equipment and  
cleaning rooms, staff and visitors' WCs, linen cupboards.

# Intensive care medicine  
Patients with significant disturbance of vital bodily functions  
are treated in intensive care. A direct, short route to the surgical  
department and to the medical service \(anaesthesia\) is necessary.  
The patients are permanently monitored by doctors and care  
staff. The organisation of intensive care is similar to that of related  
disciplines like neurosurgery, heart/thorax surgery, transplant  
surgery and neurology or interdisciplinary fields like surgery or  
internal medicine.  
For general hospitals without a particular medical specialisation,  
the integration of intensive care with surgery and internal medicine  
is usual. Intensive care must be spatially separated from the  
general care area and accessible only through a system of control  
lobbies \(for hygiene reasons\).  
The central point of every intensive care ward is an open nurses'  
station with a view of every room. The number of patients \(6-36\)  
in an intensive care unit depends on the total size of the hospital.  
Each unit requires a duty station, a clean workroom \(preparation  
of medication and infusions\) and a materials and equipment room.  
The beds can be arranged in an open, closed or combined  
layout. The open layout requires a spacious area. The patients are  
separated visually by half-height partitions with glazed window  
elements. In the closed arrangement, the patients are separated  
into different rooms.  
Further facilities should be provided\: anaesthesia preparation  
room, clean material room, dirty workroom, cleaning room, waiting  
room for relatives, doctors' on-call lounge, documentation room,  
and possibly consulting room. There should be connections for  
oxygen, compressed air and vacuum at every bed space.

Care  
# Paediatric care  
The proportions of patients in dedicated children's hospitals  
are babies \(35%\), premature babies \(13%\}, small children  
and schoolchildren up to 14 years old \(22%\) and all ages after  
infectious illnesses \(22%\}. The accommodation of this last group  
should aim to avoid contact between patients and other patients/  
staff. Isolation wards should be provided for measles, chickenpox,  
diphtheria, scarlet fever and TB. Rooms should also be provided  
for teaching, activity and play. The design of children's wards  
should be similar to that of a kindergarten, rather than a sterile  
clinical area.  
**Care of the mentally ill**  
This can be open or closed \(as well as in the special forensic form  
under a hospital treatment order\). The special nature of mental  
illness results in a higher space requirement for day rooms, dining  
rooms and rooms for occupational and group therapy. Small care  
units \(up to 18 patients\) should be created with short circulation  
routes and homely design in order to give the patients a feeling  
of security. The trend is towards the integration of psychiatric  
departments into general hospitals.  
# Care of radiotherapy patients  
In the design of nuclear medicine care groups, which address the  
diagnosis and therapy of patients undergoing radiation treatment,  
compliance with the Radiation Protection Regulations is the first  
principle. The size of a care group should correspond to a normal  
care group. The operational centre is divided into a controlled area  
and a supervised area. In this way, patients who have received  
the greatest radiation doses are separated from those treated with  
less. Patients should therefore be accommodated in single-bed  
rooms.

# Day clinic  
In the course of the reform of  
health provision, many hospi-  
tals are partially outsourcing  
certain clinical areas, which  
can be operated by private  
doctors' collectives. These  
specialist clinics are for pati-  
ents who are cared for only  
during the daytime without a  
bed in the hospital. Outpatient  
operations can also be carried  
out. Because these patients  
are separate from the usual  
operation of the hospital, a  
separate entrance is required.  
The reception and waiting  
areas are designed in a simi-  
lar way to a doctor's practice  
and should avoid a 'hospital'  
atmosphere.

Administration, Social Services  
# Management and administration  
Administration offices are divided into those dealing  
directly with patients, and other offices. Offices for patient  
admission and dealings with friends and relatives should  
be provided near the main entrance. The offices for  
internal hospital business are\: administrative director's  
office with secretarial support, accounts department and  
personnel department. Conference and meeting rooms  
are also required. In larger hospitals, social workers and  
psychologists also work in the administration.  
Increasing rationalisation in accounting and the  
application of IT need to be considered in the design,  
perhaps involving raised floors and the central accounts  
office with pneumatic postal delivery connections.  
# Records  
A short distance between records and working areas is  
advantageous but mostly difficult to achieve. A location in  
the basement with access by stairs is possible.  
There is a difference between stores and records rooms  
for files, literature, films, administration, X-ray department  
etc. Mobile shelving is useful to reduce the space  
requirement for the same storage capacity. The high  
loading assumptions for shelves \(up to 1000 kg/m2\) have  
to be considered. The storage term for patient files is 30  
years.  
# Library  
Medical libraries should be provided with open shelving,  
without closed stores and book issue. A large part of the  
literature is journals. Sufficient availability of reading tables  
with lamps is important. Hospital libraries are divided into  
patient libraries and medical libraries for doctors. The  
significance and use of these is reducing through today's  
omnipresent IT and Internet resources.  
# Main entrance and services  
A simple and easily recognisable main entrance with  
vehicle access and disability parking places must be  
created for general patient and visitor traffic and delivery  
by taxi. Special entrances should be avoided if possible.  
The entrance hall should be designed as a waiting room  
for visitors on the open door principle, with the layout  
today more like a modern hotel lobby. From here, visitors,  
outpatients, inpatients capable of walking and business  
traffic go their separate ways.  
The size of the entrance hall is in accordance with the  
hospital's bed capacity. The reception can put telephone  
calls through and also act as the post room. Also in the  
entrance hall are coin telephones, and kiosks for sweets,  
flowers, stationery etc. A cafeteria for visitors and pa-  
tients is situated directly next to the entrance and is open  
all day offering a free choice of warrn and cold food and  
drink. Also important are storage facilities and the pro-  
vision of rooms for staff in accordance with Workplace  
Regulations.  
# Pastoral care and social services  
There should be a non-denominational chapel or prayer  
room. This has adjoining rooms for the chaplain and  
vestry, and side rooms. These facilities also need offices  
for the chaplain and the social workers. **0** Supply centre, Cologne University Clinic\: kitchen, prepared stores

# HOSPITALS  
Supply and Waste Disposal  
# Supply area  
Commercial and technical supply enters the hospital either via  
a separate service building or at a neutral supply and waste  
disposal level \(basement\) under the main building. There should  
be an access for deliveries into the service yard, separated from  
the main entrance and the arrival of patients on stretchers. The  
location of delivery and waste disposal areas to the north is  
ideal. External and internal traffic routes should be designed so  
that interaction with the traffic in the care and treatment areas is  
avoided as much as possible.  
It should be taken into account in the design that this area of the  
hospital can potentially cause noise and odour nuisance \(waste  
containers, kitchen waste, etc.\). There is a noticeable tendency  
towards increasing centralisation of supply and waste disposal  
facilities and also the outsourcing of certain functional areas \(e.g.  
laundry, kitchen\).  
# Sterile goods supply  
The central sterile store should be near the surgical department,  
the largest consumer \(smaller stores of sterile goods in the the-  
atres themselves are no longer needed\). The layout is structured  
according to the direction of flow of materials into acceptance,  
pre-cleaning, washing machine, sterilisers, packing zone and  
sterile goods store. All the instruments for use in the hospital are  
prepared here. The departments with particularly heavy use are  
surgery with 40% and operative intensive care and internal inten-  
sive care with 15% each.  
The number of sterilisers required depends on the size of the  
hospital and the surgical department. Size of central sterile store  
approx. 40-120 m2  
•  
# Pharmaceutical supply  
**Pharmacy\:** In medium-sized and large hospitals, the pharmacy  
stores formulations and carries out the production of drugs under  
the management of a qualified pharmacist. For design purposes,  
the rooms required are dispensary, materials room, drug store,  
laboratory and possibly also issue desk. Rooms may also be  
required for herbs, dressings, substance storage, on-call room.  
The equipment of pharmacy and laboratory includes formulation  
table, work or packing table and a sink. The fitting out is similar  
to that of the dispensary. The location of the pharmacy should  
involve a short route to the lifts, pneumatic post etc. Since fire-  
hazardous substances and acids are stored here as well as  
various narcotics, the walls, ceilings and doors need to meet  
security standards.  
**Dispensary\:** In hospitals without a full pharmacy, medicines  
requiring approval are issued from the dispensary. This consists  
of work and dispensing rooms with direct access to the circulation  
corridor. The equipment consists of desk, washbasin, sink,  
scales and lockable cupboards. Adjacent rooms are the dry and  
proprietary medicines stores, cold store for hazardous substances,  
a dressings room and a darnp store according to fire regulations.  
# Bed preparation  
The processing of used beds and mattresses is normally done  
today with spray and wipe disinfection in the ward, or possibly  
even in the room.  
Pushing numbers of beds through the building and the heavy  
mechanical wear and wetting of the beds, usual in central bed  
processing, is no longer necessary. It can, however, be sensible to  
provide for separate disinfection of mattresses in the basement,  
possibly combined with a bed repair roorn.

# Catering  
Providing patients with appropriate nutrition places high demands  
on the preparation because there are often particular requirements  
regarding protein, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, dietary  
fibre or flavourings. The predominant catering systems rationalise  
the individual phases of conventional food preparation \(preparing,  
processing, transporting, serving\). The processing of food is  
separated into normal and diet recipes. After preparation and  
cooking, the food is assembled on the portioning conveyor. The  
ready-portioned trays are taken to the wards on serving trolleys  
for distribution. The same trolleys transport the washing up back  
to the central washing up and trolley cleaning room. Staff catering  
amounts to about 40% of total catering. The cafeteria for staff  
should be very close to the central kitchen.  
The location of the kitchen on the supply level guarantees an  
efficient flow of delivery, storage, preparation, processing and  
serving. When frozen food is used, the function and fitting out of  
the kitchen alters. The clear ceiling height in the kitchen is 4.00 m,  
and the size depends on the requirements and the number of  
patients in the hospital.  
The design should also provide a special diet kitchen \(min. 60 m2\)  
with a desk for the head chef, vegetable cleaning area \(30 m2\) with  
room for waste \(5m2\), a daily supply room \(8m2\), a cold room with  
compartments for meat, fish and dairy products \(each 8 m2\), and  
a pre-cool room \(1 0 m2\) with chest freezer and cooler.  
The **goods reception** should have sufficient storage space  
\(15-20 m2\). The main store, with fruit and vegetable store \(20 m2\),  
dry goods store \(20 m2\) and store for conserves is next door.  
Provide sufficient changing rooms and social rooms for the  
kitchen staff.  
The **central washing-up** unit of the central kitchen is organised  
around one or more large dish washing machines \(approx. 30 m2\).  
There should be sufficient worktop space for dirty and clean racks.  
New cooking methods make it possible to supply food for a  
number of hospitals from one central location.

Laundry provision  
The collection and delivery of laundry is normally undertaken by  
an external organisation. In the hospital, only collecting rooms for  
dirty and clean washing \(each 30 m2\) need to be provided, near  
the service yard.  
Storage  
This is divided into coarse pallet storage, rack storage and special  
storage. All storerooms should be centrally placed near the  
service yard and very robustly built. A logistics room is required,  
from where the collection and delivery services for the hospital  
are controlled. The distribution and storage of goods is rationally  
controlled from here. Important\: for hygienic reasons, dirty and  
clean items should be separated. Automatic laundry transport  
systems are cost effective only for large hospitals \(from 400 beds\).  
Workshops  
Connected with the service yard, these could be metalwork,  
joinery and electrical workshops, and a medical technology office  
with materials stores, replacement parts store, general stores and  
parking for vehicles.  
Housekeeping and transport service  
Multi-purpose mobile units and trolleys are often used for the  
distribution of requested items to each location of use and at the  
same time for storage. A pneumatic delivery system should be  
provided for the sending of small goods \(medicines, paperwork\).  
The scope of the transport facilities depends on the size of the  
institution; the supply and disposal quantity is about 30-35 kg per  
bed and day. For large, bulky goods \(beds, ventilators, heart-lung  
machines\), normal bed lifts are available. Separate groups of lifts  
can be arranged for the transport of medium-sized goods \(food,  
laundry, rubbish, consumables\).  
Service yard  
The design should consider the parking and turning areas for  
delivery trucks, also the multitude of types of waste \(kitchen  
and special rubbish, glass, waste paper, developing fluid etc.\)  
and their storage areas. The service yard can also provide  
service rooms for emergency power generator., sprinklers, oxygen  
and compressed air, and other supply requirements. With its  
location in the basement, the service yard will require a ramp  
\(gradient less than 15%!\) for access. Minimum size of a service  
yard\: 30 x 30 m.

Plant and service rooms, shafts and installation areas  
Early consideration of the buildings/rooms required for the  
installation of building services is a precondition for optimised  
layout and for hygienic and energy-saving operation of the  
facilities. The size and location of plant areas should generally be  
able to fulfil the following requirements\:  
a\) optimal transport of air \(short routes\)  
b\) energy-saving specification of building elements  
c\) compliance with hygienic requirements and provision for  
cleaning  
d\) provision of maintenance and repair areas at central plant area  
Building requirements  
*Space required for air-conditioning plant*  
The area and space requirement for air-conditioning equipment is  
determined by\:  
a\) volume flow  
b\) number of thermodynamic conditioning stages  
c\) installed elements  
d\) connection situation for the duct network  
The minimum height of a central plant room should be 3 m clear  
for optimal operation; 4-4.5 m following the number of functional  
units. The calculation of the area needed should be discussed  
according to the specific technical requirements, and a specialist  
building services engineer should be appointed. General note\:  
the size of the air-conditioning equipment can be estimated via  
the volume flow with a speed of 2 m/s. The total length is the  
sum of the length of the individual elements required, taking the  
thermodynamic functions into account, and additional space for  
connection at each end and maintenance.  
# Cooling plant room  
The cooling plant room has to provide space for chillers,  
expansion vessels, cold water and cooled water distributor and  
collector, main pumps and the associated control equipment.  
The space required depends on the nature and type of chiller and  
the capacity. Room heights should be more than 3 m, which may  
depend on the output.  
# Recooling plant  
The area and space requirement for recooling plant is determined  
from the required cooling capacity, the type of cooling, the form  
of the air intake and outlet, the mounting and the noise insulation.  
The selection of the room height and the floor area must take into  
account the lateral proportion, operation, maintenance and repair.  
The installation should also take special aspects of noise emission  
and fumes emission into account. The recooling capacity depends  
on the type and capacity of cooling.  
# General equipment of plant rooms  
Preferably, plant rooms should be located near the supply area.  
The location of the central plant area should ensure suitable  
conditions for supply and disposal and result in short distances  
for air/gas supply.  
Plant rooms must comply with the fire protection and safety  
requirements of the relevant state building regulations, the  
conditions imposed on the particular building and the Workplace  
Regulations if appropriate. The operation of the technical  
equipment in the plant rooms should not impair the environment  
nor cause nuisance in the building through noise or vibration.  
# 316  
# HOSPITALS  
Technical Supply  
# Technical details, temperature requirements  
The temperature in plant rooms must not sink below soc for  
technical reasons \(danger of frost!\) and should also not exceed  
40 oc \(because of electrical equipment\), which should be ensured  
by suitable technical measures. Damp and increased humidity  
should be avoided. Plant rooms should be equipped with a water  
supply with hose connection and backflow preventer, and also at  
least one floor gully. The EU safety data sheets for the equipment  
and consumables should be at hand in case of breakdowns. The  
installation of electrical equipment should comply with German  
Association of Electrotechnicians \(VDE\) standards. Plant rooms  
should have at least one power socket \(230 V, 16 A\) and a three-  
phase connection \(400 V\) suitable for the particular situation. The  
nominal lighting intensity in plant rooms should be 1 DO lx; and  
at switching panels, and regulation and measurement equipment  
200 lx.  
# Requirements for service shafts and horizontal ducts  
Shafts are employed for vertical service runs and horizontal  
services use service ducts or are fixed below the floor slab,  
with cables in cable trays. In accordance with the applicable  
state building regulations, installation shafts and cable runs in  
buildings, with the exception of buildings of limited height and any  
installation shafts or cable runs which bridge fire compartments,  
must be detailed so that fire and smoke cannot enter staircases,  
other storeys or other fire compartments. Installation shafts  
and ducts must comply with fire resistance class L30, L60 or  
L90 for the relevant pipe or cable. Comb-shaped connection to  
functional areas is ideal. The sum of air ducts, pipe runs and  
cable trays should remain constant in relation to the height of the  
storey. Shafts and ducts should be detailed so that they cannot  
act as structural stiffening. Only main shafts and ducts are  
permissible in this case. Accessible shafts should be reachable  
from a corridor.  
# Suspended ceilings  
The space between structural and suspended ceiling should  
not be used directly for air supply and cannot be used directly  
for air extraction, depending on the extracted air collection  
arrangements. The spacing between the bottom of the slab  
and the top of the suspended ceiling depends on the degree of  
installation \(air ducts, water pipework, electric cable runs, lighting  
elements, air handling units, air intakes and outlets, sprinkler  
pipework\) and should normally be min. 400 mm. A smaller ceiling  
space is possible in exceptional cases.  
# Gas supply plant room  
The special oxygen pipework is supplied from operational and  
reserve units with automatic switchover equipment. In order to  
ensure short transport distances, direct access to the service yard  
is sensible, e.g. for delivery and collection of the cylinders. The  
storage of the cylinders can be combined with the air/gas pumps  
\(vacuum, nitrogen, compressed air\) in order to enable centralised  
control \(possibly computer-controlled\). The gas cylinders are  
being replaced nowadays with bulk tanks, which must be situated  
in the open air and at least 5.0 m from buildings. **Electrical installation *I* high voltage plant**  
Electricity supply is generally from a public medium-voltage mains  
network \(1 0-20 kV\) provided by the electricity supply organisation.  
The mains connection transformation to low voltage \(400 V\) and  
distribution inside the building take place in the hospital sub-  
station. The appropriate switchgear and transformers should  
each be placed in their own room, and the Regulations for  
Building Electrical Service Rooms and the VDE standards should  
be complied with. In larger hospitals, a number of specialised  
electrical rooms should be provided in addition to the sub-station.  
The' installation is sized depending on the dimensions of the  
building and the energy requirements of the individual pieces of  
equipment. The hospital sub-station should be situated centrally  
and provided with good, ideally level, road access as well as  
adequate ventilation and extraction. A location in the basement is  
not suitable if there is any risk of flooding.  
A hospital should also have an emergency power system,  
which continues to supply certain defined equipment in case  
of a mains failure. This arrangement is provided by emergency  
power generation sets with diesel motors and alternating current  
generators. This equipment should be placed in its own room  
with ensured air supply and extraction, and exhaust gas escaping  
above the roof. An additional emergency power supply must be  
provided for lighting in operating theatres and certain vital medical  
devices. Decentralised battery sets are provided for this for use in  
the room containing the medical device.  
Starting from the sub-station, the general and emergency power  
supplies are distributed separately, in a star shape, through  
the hospital. Depending on the building structure and the  
distance, this may be via distribution boards on each floor or  
one central distribution board. The arrangement and number of  
distribution boards on the floors have to be in accordance with  
fire compartments, whose assignment to functional areas should  
also be taken into account. The distribution boards are separated  
into general and emergency power supply and placed in their own  
rooms.  
**Telecommunications *I* IT**  
The correct functioning of telephone and data networks in a hos-  
pital is essential for the care of patients and the basis for econ-  
omic success. A central telecommunications room and also at  
least one server \(IT\) room should be provided to accommodate  
the system components, each with a size of 35-70 m2  
• Uninter-  
ruptible power supplies and an extra cooling system should be  
provided.  
In order to optimise availability, a further IT room should be planned  
for backup systems in another building or at least another part of  
the same building. Starting from the central telecommunications  
or server room, the star-shaped distribution cabling \(copper or  
fibre-optic cables\) runs to the distribution hubs on each floor. The  
telecommunications and IT devices are connected from here.  
The modern 'structured cabling topology' provides unified sockets  
for telephone, IT and medical technology, enabling rapid reaction  
to the very fast progress of development in communications  
technology.  
Speech communication in administrative areas is provided by  
analogue and digital telephones, which are connected directly  
to a central telephone system. Cordless mobile DECT phones  
in connection with powerful communications servers are rapidly  
replacing traditional pagers, and provide a second route for  
communication.  
# HOSPITALS  
Technical Supply  
Each patient room is provided with a patient operating panel  
with call light, signal connections for wall-mounted TV and/or  
bedside devices and sockets for telephone and Internet access.  
TV signals come either from a cable operator or from a satellite  
reception system and are fed centrally into the signal network.  
When a patient presses the call button, the light signal system  
communicates with the locations where the care staff have logged  
in. The prioritisation of calls\:  
- patient call  
-we call  
- emergency call  
- resuscitation call etc.  
is also supported, as is forwarding of any calls to the mobile DECT  
phones of the care staff, including detailed information. The fire  
early warning and alarm scheme includes a fire alarm system  
with automatic and manual alarms as a loop system, which saves  
cabling, and an electro-acoustic system with its own cable network  
to maintain function. The delivery routes and roads to the parking  
places are secured by barriers. These can be manually controlled  
by the gatekeepers or automatically controlled according to  
identification or invoicing.  
Cameras are provided, either fixed or adjustable, to monitor the  
entrance areas, access roads and specific areas; the images are  
sent through a central cross-loop to the monitors for observation.  
The operating units for the telecommunications components\:  
- switchboard for the telephone system  
- camera control  
- server for the hospital information system  
-control server for the patient media system  
- lift surveillance etc.  
are installed in the lodge or entrance area in smaller hospitals.  
In larger hospitals, these will be installed in a central control room.  
This is where all relevant fault reports arrive and are processed  
centrally. The requirement for prompt recording of and access  
to all relevant clinical and patient data is ensured by the use of  
complex software. The functionality of the user applications is  
based on active network components in the central server rooms  
and IT rooms on each floor, together with the system of servers.  
Stationary PC workstations in functional and care departments  
and mobile data recording stations in the wards are integrated  
into the network and support the care staff. The internal network  
is secured from access by unauthorised third parties by firewall  
solutions, which have to be updated constantly.  
Speech and data integration \(VoiP - Voice over IP\) and database  
consolidation \(SAN\) of all IT and medical IT systems are an  
important part of hospital IT.  
The radiology department, in particular, with a number of systems  
producing and processing images, places very high demands on  
the quality and capacity of the network.  
The appointment of specialist engineers is absolutely necessary.

# STADIUMS  
Overview  
Ancient stadiums, whose size has never been matched \(the Circus  
Maximus in Rome had room for 180,000 spectators\), still form the basis  
for today's sports venues. The dimensions are normally determined by the  
70 x 1 09 m layout of a football pitch and the running track around it \~  
p. 323. The basic shape of the playing area is an ellipse, which is similar to  
the ancient egg shape. A stadium is normally partially dug into the ground  
and the earth removed is heaped around it. From the town planning aspect,  
sports facilities must fit well into the terrain and the transport and utility  
supply conditions should be good\: rail, bus, tram stops, large car parks etc.  
Industry in the immediate vicinity should be avoided because smoke, smell  
and noise are undesirable. Covered and open-air facilities for various types  
of sport can be combined and integrated into the zoning plan of the city.  
The orientations of ancient arenas were usually west-east or south-  
north, according to the various times of competitions \~ **0;** in Europe,  
northeast-southwest so that most spectators had the sun behind them.  
Open entrances are therefore at the eastern end. The pay booths were  
placed far forward, and behind them the flow of visitors distributed  
itself to various points in the stadium. These provide access, mostly  
up the heaped areas, or up stairs, to the stand at half-height and then  
to the rows above and below\~ **0.** For acoustic reasons, the Roman  
architect Vitruvius recommended a fixed gradient of 1 \:2 for both rows  
of seating and standing places. Nowadays, when loudspeakers are  
used, the inclination only has to ensure a good view.  
Accordingly, with staggered seats, the audience in each row should  
be able to see over the heads of those two rows in front. This results  
in a parabolic curve. The best viewing conditions are from the long  
side of an arc.  
The width of the access passages and stairs must be worked out  
using the sudden flow of spectators leaving \(in contrast to the  
gradual trickle of those arriving\). According to the calculations of  
C. van Eestern, each 5000 spectators at the Amsterdam stadium \~  
**8** require 7 minutes \(or 420 seconds\) to leave using the 9.5 m wide  
stairs provided \(in Los Angeles 12 minutes, in Turin 9 minutes\).  
So one spectator uses 1 m stair width in  
9.5 x420 =O 8  
5000 . s  
or in 1 s, for each 1 m stair width,  
5000  
9.5 X 420 =  
1'25 S  
spectators leave. The formula for the necessary stair width for a  
defined number of spectators intending to leave the stadium in a  
desirably short time would therefore be  
stair width \(m\) = no. spectators  
evacuation time \(s\) x 1.25  
First-aid rooms should be provided according to the number of  
spectators and close to the spectator area. A group of rooms is  
s  
necessary for every 20,000 spectators\: treatment and rest room  
15m2  
, store room 2m2 and two toilets with lobbies to prevent odour  
transmission. For stadiums with room for more than 30,000 spectators,  
there should also be a 15 m2 room for public safety personnel \(police,  
sw  
fire service\). The commentary boxes will be in the main stand with a  
good view oft he sports field, each box 1.5 m2  
. Behind every five media  
boxes, a switchroom of 4 m2  
• One car parking space for every four

**Spectator and VIP areas**  
The design is based on the relevant state Places of Assembly  
Regulations, which contain requirements for access routes, stairs,  
ramps and spectator places. Further regulations can be prescribed by  
ruling sports bodies, e.g. the FIFA guidelines for international games  
prohibit standing places in stadiums.  
According to the number of spectator places planned, stands are either  
placed on the long sides of the sports field \(a good view, because the  
distance is not too far\) or, for more than approx. 10,000 places, around  
the entire playing area. Because sporting events mostly take place in  
the afternoon, the best spectator places are on the west side \(no glare\).  
If the spectator places are arranged in a multi-row layout, sufficient  
super-elevation should be provided to improve the viewing conditions.  
For smaller stands with up to 20 rows of standing places or 1 0 rows  
of seating, this can be a linear gradient of 1 \:2, but in all other stadiums  
the linear gradient should be parabolic. In this case the gradient for  
sitting and standing places can be determined by using spectators'  
sight line construction, with the super-elevation 12 em for standing  
places and 15 em for rows of seats \~ **0.**  
**Seated areas** \(Places of Assembly Regulations\)  
Seated place width 0.5 m  
For design purposes, in rows of seating the required space is two  
visitors per m2• This can be provided as row seating \(benches\) or as  
individual seats, which have to be fixed and immovable when there are  
more than 5000 visitor places. Seats with backrests offer more comfort  
\(height min. 30 em according to FIFA guidelines\) and there must be a  
clear passage width of 40 em between rows of seats. Seats must be  
arranged in blocks of max. 30 rows. Behind and between the blocks,  
there must be aisles with a min. width of 1.20 m. Depending on the  
layout of the access and exit routes, each row of seats may contain\:  
20 places if there is an aisle to the open air at one side, or  
40 places if there is an aisle to the open air at both sides  
Sitting and standing places must be separated. A 1.20 m width of  
escape route \(stairs, ramps, level surfaces\) must be provided for every  
600 places, with a minimum width of 1.20 m.  
**Standing terraces** \(Places of Assembly Regulations\)  
Standing space width 0.5 m  
For design purposes, in standing terraces the required space is two  
visitors per running metre of terrace. A 1.20 m width of escape route  
\(stairs, ramps, level surfaces\) must be provided for every 600 places,  
with a minimum width of 1.20 m. In order to ensure that standing areas  
fill and empty evenly and to avoid dangerous crushes, they should  
be divided into blocks of about 2500 places. These blocks should be  
fenced apart and separately accessed.  
Within a block of standing terrace, 'wave breakers' \(crush barriers\)  
should be provided. It must be ensured that, seen from each standing  
place, there is a suitably strong parapet about 1.1 m high within 1 0  
rows. Possible diagonal surging must be hindered by a staggered  
arrangement of the 'wave breakers'.  
**VIPs\:** Larger stadiums should provide a covered VIP box with movable  
seating.  
**Roofing of stands\:** The intention should be to provide cover for as  
many places as possible. Overlapping of stand structures can increase  
the number of covered places. The Berlin Olympic stadium has recently  
received a new roof\~ **4I!\)-** \$.

for very heavy use.  
A **combined large field** includes a large  
playing field, with areas for track and field  
events next to and on the field. It consists  
of the following areas\: -7 **e**  
1 playing field 68 x 1 05 m \(70 x 1 09 m with

1 shot put ring; throwing direction westwards  
For practice in throwing disciplines, the  
provision of a run-up or throwing field is  
recommended for safety reasons. This  
consists of a grass area for landing about the  
size of a large field and a run-up or throwing  
area for javelin, discus and hammer on the  
southern short side -7 **0.**

The dimensions given in *-1* Ci\) are in line with the competition rules and  
must be observed. Deviations are possible for school sport, training and  
leisure sport.  
Hammer throwing equipment is laid out similarly to discus equipment *-1* 0  
- 0. except the throwing circle has only \~2.135 m safety cage *-1* 0-f\) for  
competitive facilities; otherwise, the more simply constructed safety cage,  
as for the discus, can be used *-1* e.  
Javelin facilities consist of a run-up track and a throwing sector. The width  
of the run-up track is 4 m, length is normally 36.5 m, but min. 30 m. The  
run-up track is divided from the throwing sector by a permanently marked  
curved throwing line.  
Shot put facilities consists of a ring and a landing sector *-1* 0 - 0. The  
normal length of shot put facilities is 20 m, for top-level sport 25 m.

# Number of courts required\:  
Currently the number of active tennis players is 1.6-3% of the  
total population. Ratio of courts to players for new courts is 1 \:30;

. population x 3  
no. courts required \(T\) = -'-----'--------  
100 X 30  
Area required for children's court\~ **0.**  
Parking places\: normal tennis playing \(without spectators\), four  
vehicle parking places per court.  
Plot size\: net area \('usable sport area'\) is identical to the tennis  
court and the areas required for the practice wall and the children's  
court. Experience shows a 60-80% supplement to the net area  
gives the plot size. The location of the courts should be in the N-S  
direction **if** possible.  
Deviations are possible *0N* is better than E\). More than two courts  
next to each other is not recommended, behind each other only  
with visual separation. Artificial lighting at 10m height is needed  
at the long sides. ·  
The production of the space allocation plan should include later  
requirements for flats \(caretaker, trainer, tenant\) and garages from  
the start. The project should be designed so that building can  
proceed in stages without disturbing the tennis.

Tennis  
Ceiling heights for indoor tennis halls are fixed internationally. Davis  
Cup rules require a height of 10.67 m; recommended height 9-11  
m, although 9 m will normally suffice---+ **0.** Tennis is also possible  
in gymnastics and sports halls with 7 m height. The hall height is  
measured from the floor, at the net, to the underside of the roof  
truss, and must be the same over the entire 10.97 m width of the  
court. The height is min. 3 m at the outer edge of the playing area.  
Types of halls\: demountable hall, permanent hall, convertible hall.  
Hall internal dimensions 18.30 X 36.60 m ---+ **\(t.** Because the size  
of the courts and the prescribed areas of the court outside the  
markings are fixed internationally, this gives\:  
tennis hall with 2 courts Te H 2  
singles + doubles \(S + D\)  
\(2 X 18.30\) X \(1 X 36.60\) = 36.60 X 36.60  
with 3 courts Ti\(Se H 3  
+D\)  
which gives analogously a hall area of 54.90 x 36.60 m. These  
dimensions are the ideal for sporting flexibility. If 'economical  
tennis halls' are planned, this makes a reduction of the built area  
possible but will restrict the use.  
The uses are\:  
1. both courts suitable for singles competition  
2. one court suitable for doubles competition  
3. practice or leisure play on both courts, 2 singles games or 1  
singles and 1 doubles.  
Considering the possible savings, this gives the following hall size\:

Miniature Golf  
A miniature golf course consists of 18 clearly separated lanes  
\(exception\: driving shots\}, which are numbered and must correspond  
to the standard regulations of their system. Lanes suitable for  
competitions have the following features\:  
actual playing area  
lane demarcations \(mostly strips\)  
tee marking  
one or more obstacles \(can be omitted\)  
borderline \(can be omitted\)  
set-down markings \(can be omitted\)  
hole  
and perhaps further components and/or markings specific to the  
system.  
Playing area size\: min. width 80 em, min. length 5.50 m. Playing  
areas intended to be level must be completely flat \(90 em spirit level\).  
In case the edges of the playing area are not determined by strips,  
then they must be marked otherwise \(exception\: driving shots\). The  
edge strips must be so installed so that they enable a strategy to be  
implemented. Each lane must have a tee-off marking. The type of  
marking must be standardised within one course or for a certain lane  
system. The obstacles must be practical in construction and shape  
and installed permanently \(according to the sporting purpose\). The  
location of obstacles which are not fixed should be marked.

# SPORTS FACILITIES  
Miniature Golf  
Each obstacle must be different from all the others on the course,  
not only externally but in how they are played. A strategy must be  
possible.  
The borderline marks the end of the first obstacles. On lanes  
without built-in obstacles, it shows the minimum distance the ball  
has to be hit from the tee in order to remain in the game. If the first  
obstacle takes up the entire width of the lane, then the borderline  
is identical with the end of the obstacle. Lanes which can only  
be played from the tee have no borderline. Borderline markings  
should be laid out so that the marking edge pointing to the tee is  
identical with the obstacles.  
Set-down markings\: when setting down or moving the ball during  
play is permissible, there must be markings showing where the  
ball may be set down .  
It must be possible to reach the target from the tee marking  
with one stroke. If these are target holes, then the diameter may  
not exceed 120 mm. For the systems Minigolf, Miniaturgolf or  
Sterngolf, 1 00 mm is the limit.  
Markings must be applied to all lanes. The game is played with  
golf clubs and golf balls. All clubs which are usual in golf, or similar  
objects, are permissible.  
The striking area of the club head may not exceed 40 cm2  
• All  
miniature golf and golf balls are permissible of any material. Ball  
diameter \~37 mm and \:"'i43 mm. Balls made of wood, metal,  
glass, glass fibre, ivory or similar material, and also billiard balls,  
are not recognised as miniature golf balls.  
Miniature golf lanes normally have the following standard sizes\:  
Lane length 6.25 m, lane width 0.90 m, target circle diameter  
1.40 m --7 p. 329 **0.**  
# Minigolf\:  
Developed by the Swiss Bogni at the start of the 1950s; consists  
of 17 concrete pistes \(12 m long\) and one long piste \(approx. 25 m  
long\). The concrete pistes are surrounded by tubular steel frames.  
The obstacles are made of natural stone.  
# Cobigolf\:  
One of the most difficult lane systems, the 'little gates' set in front  
of the obstacles are a special feature. The course also consists  
of 18 lanes.These are in large format \(12-14 m length\) and also in  
small format \(6-7 m\).  
# Sterngolf\:  
A Sterngolf course consists of 18 lanes; 17 of the concrete pistes  
have a semi-circular target area and the last has a star as a 'target  
circle'. This gives the system its name. The lane length is 8 m, lane  
width 1 m and end circle diameter 2 m. The lanes are bounded by  
pipes. The tee is marked by a circle of 30 em diameter and the  
hole is 1 0 em diameter.  
All the obstacles are standardised for all lane golf systems, and  
selected and constructed according to sporting requirements.  
Therefore it is possible to hole every lane in one stroke, because  
every player of miniature golf aims to take as few strokes as  
possible on every lane.  
A score of 18 -every lane holed in one- has often been achieved. f---2.0---1

Golf Courses  
**Practice areas --7 0** are used either to practise the short game  
or for beginners taking up golf. A golf centre as an independent  
sports facility can, for example, be laid out on an area of only  
10 ha. This would include a practice area, an approach green, a  
practice green and a 9-hole golf course \(par 3\) --7 **0.**  
Recognised standard lengths of golf courses vary between the  
standard 60 with a normal length of 37 49 m and the standard  
74 with a normal length of 6492 m. These overall lengths of golf  
courses result in the 'par' score.  
**Elements of a golf course**  
The course starts at the tee, which has no specified size. It should  
be about 200 m2 with adequate width. Fairways are 30-50 m wide  
and 100 to \> 500 m long. At the end of the fairway is the green,  
min. 400 m2  
, but normally 500-600 m2  
• Aprons to the greens,  
which are not usual everywhere, min. width 2.5 m. Roughs are  
areas with growth of various heights at the edge of the fairways  
and over the remaining areas. Bunkers are the most common  
artificial obstacle, but have the disadvantage of working as foreign  
bodies in the landscape.  
Golf courses are best situated in uneven terrain with flat  
slopes between wooded thickets, trees or tree groups without  
undergrowth, with natural hazards \(watercourses, lakes\), with  
cuttings and hillocks, or among dunes on the coast. The size  
of a course depends on the number of holes and their length  
\(distance from tee to hole\}.

1-18 Fairways  
Golf courses are not standardised  
as sports facilities and are generally  
unique. Nearly always today, they  
can be constructed only on former  
forest or agricultural areas. Golf  
course design requires the direction  
of a versatile expert, who needs the  
expertise of a landscape architect,  
landscape ecologist, soil scientist,  
cultural technician, economist etc. -  
and golfer. Before the actual design  
work can begin, background data  
has to be collected. Catchment  
area of the intended site\: number  
of inhabitants in the area within 30  
minutes by car required for a 9-hole  
golf course is approx. 100 000, in  
order to achieve a sufficient number,  
about 300, members of a golf club.  
An important part of a golf club is  
the practice area, which comprises a  
grass area, a practice green and an  
approach green -7 p. 331 **f\).** Grass  
practice areas should be as flat as  
possible with a width of min. 80 m  
in order to provide practice space  
for about 15 golfers simultaneously.  
The length should be min. 200 m  
\(better 225 m\) and arranged so that  
neighbouring holes are not disturbed.  
The ideal location is near the  
clubhouse. Approach greens should  
have a minimum area of 300 m2 and  
be shaped. A sand trap for practice  
strokes should be min. 200 m2 and  
have various depths.  
The design of a golf course should  
generally assume that the completed  
facility will provide an 18-hole course,  
which means sufficient land of min.  
55 ha \(better 60 ha\) must be available  
in the longer term. In order to offer  
the alternative of a half round \(9  
holes\) on an 18-hole golf course, the  
1st tee, 9th green, 1Oth tee and 18th  
green should all be within reasonable  
distance of the clubhouse if possible

# Boat types  
Competitive races are possible only if every competitor has the  
same equipment. This has led to mostly standardised types of boats  
competing in sailing regattas. National classes are recognised by  
national ruling bodies and international classes by the International  
Sailing Federation in London. This also regulates the Olympic  
classes, which are newly specified after each Games\(----\> **9** Examples  
of sailing boat classes and dimensions\).  
The depth of water required in harbours, marinas and watercourses  
depends on the type of boat. Usually specified are 1.25 m \(dinghies,  
centreboard boats\) and 4-5 m \(keelboats\) depth of water. Uniform  
water levels are favourable for the construction of harbours and safety  
of the boats.

Structures protecting against wave impact, suction and swell are  
important for every marina.  
**Breakwaters** \(or **moles\)** are formed of rammed sheet piles or  
stone boulders --7 **f\) - 0.** Concrete caissons can be used only in  
relatively shallow water. --7 **0** Floating piers consisting of concrete  
pontoons are also possible. --7 **0** Breakwaters should permit  
pedestrian access for sightseeing.  
**Sheet pile walls** offer permanent coastal protection with the least  
use of space. They normally consist of rolled steel profiles with  
vertical interlocking, but can also be of timber or plastic. A sheet  
pile wall is nearly watertight and, because of the great resistance of  
heavy sheet pile in place, can bridge large spans. Sporting boats,  
which are tied up against a sheet pile wall, must be protected  
against mechanical damage with fenders. Steel pile walls can also  
rust, which does not look good in a marina. --7 **0**  
**Dolphins** consist of steel pipes, sometimes filled with concrete  
or timber. Min. length 3 x water depth, depending on the seabed.  
Boats and quays are fixed to dolphins. The average lifetime of  
timber dolphins in seawater is 15 years and of steel pipes 35 years.  
Because this lifetime varies greatly with location, information  
should be sought locally.  
**Banks** stabilise coasts and are formed by rubble, concrete or  
planting. Slopes depend on the height, ground conditions and  
detailing. --7 **f\) + 8**  
# Slipways and cranes  
Boat cranes can be permanently mounted in the service wharf  
area or else be mobile cranes. This requires load-bearing ground  
and sufficient space for landside access \(car with trailer + truck\),  
according to the size of the crane and the boat. The coastal  
protection at this location will have to be vertical.  
A **travellift** is a mobile lifting device for transporting boats in the  
marina. --7 p. 335 **0**  
**Slipways** are ramps for launching boats. Smaller and lighter boats  
can be launched on a trailer, but larger ones will require the trailer  
to be towed. --7 **0 - fli\)**  
**Construction materials** and details for marine works are exposed  
to attack by the sea and should be made of stable, durable and  
lasting materials. Corrosion is considerable in water, especially  
seawater. Buildings should be sealed against wind and spray, and  
insulated for thermal protection in summer and winter.

Design of moorings  
Berths should always be aligned to the wind, with the size  
of berths appropriate to the type of boat and how the boat is  
moored \(bow or stern\). If sailing boats without motors are to  
be expected \(a regatta harbour\), there should be sufficient  
space for manoeuvring to halt the boats. Sailing boats stop  
by running into the wind, which can take 2-5 boat lengths  
according to type *-t* **e.**  
Behind the harbour mouth, there should be a turning  
circle to allow the largest ship to turn. This turning circle,  
-35-60 m diameter, is necessary to enter the harbour  
safely and for manoeuvring in a storm *-t* **0.**  
Quays  
The choice of type of quay is determined by the strain from  
the load, ship impact and hawser tension.  
Fixed quays on rammed piles are endangered by high  
tides. *-t* p. 354 **0**  
Modern floating quays are fixed to mooring posts or  
anchored, and enable safe and controllable docking at any  
water level. *-t* p. 354 **0**  
Berthing at a mooring is normal in southern waters *-t* **0**  
The water depth at the mooring place should be min. 1.8  
times the deepest draught. The berth should be provided  
with electricity and water and a drainage connection. Tying-  
up equipment like bollards, clamps or rings of adequate  
size is needed. Slip-resistant surfaces and planking of  
quays are necessary, as are a handrail on one or both sides  
and lighting for the quays and berths.  
Provide waste containers of sufficient number and size  
\(rubbish separation!\).  
Size of berths  
The size of berths depends on the boats in the marina.  
Berths of various sizes should be offered, ideally sorted  
according to size. A few berths for superyachts \(length over  
21 m\) are also necessary. Manoeuvring and tying up at the  
berths should be safe.  
Dry storage marina  
If there is too little space available on the water, boats  
can be stored on shore and transported by a travellift to  
be launched in max. 30 min. The dry storage marina is  
equipped with quays and berths on land so that the use  
of the boat is also possible on land \(water, drainage and  
electricity connections\). The ratio of land to water in such a  
marina is about 80\:20.  
The investment costs are only about 40% of a comparable  
conventional marina.

SPORTS FACILITIES  
Water Sport, Marinas  
The first stage of designing a marina is a feasibility study  
and various approvals on land and water. A marina is always  
intended for leisure and tourism. The specialisation trends for  
marinas are fitting-out marina, event marina, berth marina,  
mini-marina, dry store marina etc. ---7 p. 337.  
Selection of location  
The boats must be protected. Access by water and by road  
on land must be guaranteed. Marinas should ideally not be  
built in open countryside but rather in connection with leisure,  
urban or tourist attractions.  
Size and capacities of marinas  
There should be a minimum depth of water to suit the  
intended sporting boats. *Avoid* sporting and ecological  
conflicts and overloading on the water. On average, only  
33% of the marina's boats will be on the water at the same  
time. Consider the simultaneity factor \(describes the ratio of  
the total permitted number of boats to the average number  
of boats underway\), determination of the technical space  
requirements for individual types of boats, and sufficient  
spacing from other boats.  
Organisation of areas  
Mooring area\: toilet pump, lifebelts, supply columns for  
electricity, water, waste disposal; this area should be safe,  
attractive and functional ---7 p. 335\. Technical area\: slip  
ramp, crane, chandler, workshop, motor service, repair area  
\(consider emissions and influence of pollution\). Restaurant  
area\: with terrace overlooking the water. Service area\:  
harbour master, showers, toilets, information \(must be easy to  
find\). Parking\: safe and easily accessible for cars and trailers  
---7 e.  
Layouts  
Right-angled harbour ---7 8\: mainly for medium-sized marinas  
\(1 00-400 berths\), long major breakwater running parallel to  
the shore, closed at one end; alignment to the main wind  
direction and to waves must be considered.  
Open breakwater parallel to the shore ---7 0\: the breakwater  
is not accessible and offers only limited protection, as the  
harbour is open on two sides. It is suitable only for shores  
without sediment deposition, but can be used for inland  
waters. Disadvantage\: reflection of the waves from the shore  
through the harbour against the inside of the breakwater.  
Enclosing breakwaters ---7 0\: two breakwaters run from the  
shore and form a funnel-shaped harbour entrance. This is  
*very* expensive to construct and suitable only for locations  
with the best possible natural conditions- the ideal type for a  
protected coastal marina.  
Island harbour ---7 8\: with sensitive shores, if water depth  
is insufficient or space is a problem. According to local  
conditions, an island marina can be piled or constructed on  
pontoons.  
Land storage of boats  
Larger boats are stored in sheds or in the open air *over* the  
winter. Storage should be safe against storms if on blocks  
and jack stands, with sufficient safety spacing between  
boats ---7 e.  
Open areas and roads in marinas must be adequate for  
boat transport and storage. The car park should have an  
associated lockable place for trailers.  
Turning areas should be sufficiently large for vehicles with  
trailers and cranes and in front of slipways, diameter min.  
18m, and load-bearing \(min. 6 t axle load\). In large marinas,  
these areas should be concrete or asphalt surfaced. ---7 0 **0** Water touring rest place

# Superyacht marinas  
Yachts of more than 21 m/70 ft length are described as  
superyachts. From a length of more than 30 m, these yachts have  
professional crews. Such yachts require particular attention in the  
design of a marina, either as an extension of an existing marina or  
as an independent marina.  
The location can only be exclusive with high-quality tourist  
attractions, and connection to an airport and a major city. The  
superyacht business in Europe is mostly concentrated in the  
Mediterranean.  
Superyachts require extensive space for berths **0 - 8** and have  
heavy utility requirements **0.** Water depths of min. 8-9 m are  
required.  
The concept of a superyacht marina corresponds to the  
requirements of a 5-star hotel, with 24-hour service for technical  
support and a personal reception service. Zoning is similar to  
a 5-star hotel, plus separated areas for crew and service --+ **9.**  
The security of ships and crews need to be ensured through  
appropriate facilities. 24-hour security service, video surveillance  
and electronic access control systems, as well as the lighting of  
the most significant areas of the marina, are important.  
**Security in marinas**  
Security facilities in marinas protect boats, equipment \(electronics\)  
and people from the forces of nature and criminality, vandalism  
and terror.  
Active measures\:  
Arrangement, visibility of berth areas  
Alarm systems on boats  
Security for berths, jetties \(gates\)  
Passive measures\:  
Video surveillance of berths  
Lighting of the marina  
Security service, security patrols  
Emergency measures, security plan  
Security management  
Marinas inside waterfronts with public access require a lockable  
central area \(harbour office\) and additional 24-hour surveillance.  
The marina should be marked with notices and rules, which can  
be implemented as marina regulations and enforced by police.  
Each marina requires an emergency plan, which provides  
the greatest possible safety in an emergency, with employee  
instruction and training. Training days should be carried out at  
least twice a year.  
# Sustainability  
Environmental technologies can be implemented in marinas to  
save energy, but also for the exploitation of alternative energy\:  
geothermal, wind power, waterpower, photovoltaic, solar heating  
etc. can all be employed in marinas. A good marina should function  
without external energy supply. An environmentally friendly marina  
protects water and subsoil through the use of environmentally  
safe materials \(no water pollution\).  
Environmental acceptability is achieved through concentrating  
the marina equipment and technology into functional areas,  
which can be switched off in the winter - energy zones and  
levels of operational intensity. Public transport instead of shuttle/  
taxi service, energy-saving times \(e.g. 24\:00-6\:00\), price levels  
according to energy use etc. 1.65-1.70

# SPORTS FACILITIES  
Water Sport, Rowing and Canoeing  
Rowing boats are predominantly team boats belonging to clubs.  
Like kayaks and canoes, they are mostly found on flowing  
waterways which are free of obstacles, in attractive countryside.  
A boathouse has windows or skylights to the north, in order to  
keep sun out. Doors £';2.50 x 2.75 m, to carry boats in above the  
head. Boathouse width £';6.00 m, length ideally 30 m, height 4.0  
m if possible --\> **G\).** Oars 3.80 m long, spoons 15-18 em. Storage  
near the entrance, horizontally on racks or, better, hanging from a  
clamping ring above a pit \(depending on boathouse height\).  
Between boathouse and water jetty, a shore strip £';20-30 m wide  
is required for cleaning and preparing the boats, with water taps  
and parking space for trailers. If possible, provide nearby lawn or  
woodland areas for camping.  
Rowing basin for training with shortened oars--\> **\(f\),** basin size for  
an eight 12.60 x 7.60 m. Single or double-sided rowing basin \(also  
offset\). Water circulation creates similar currents to open water.  
Ideally, this facility should be combined with a sports hall or indoor  
pool and their changing rooms.

Riding facilities/stables should, if possible, be in the immediate  
vicinity of land suitable for riding. Areas with high ground and  
air humidity, as are often found in valleys, should be avoided,  
as should windless locations, where providing the desired  
ventilation may be difficult. Ideal sites are in hilly and windy  
areas. However, slope gradients for buildings and riding arenas  
should be \<1 0%.  
Saddle rooms, as far as possible, should be long and rectangular,  
with a large wall space and a width of 4.0-4.5 m. Saddles can be  
hung in three rows, staggered above each other *--1* **\(i\).** Saddle  
rooms and grooming rooms should have heating and be well  
ventilated.  
In riding arenas the minimum headroom for show-jumping and  
horseback acrobatics is 4.00 m *--1* **0-0.** No universal rule can be  
applied to the space allocated to spectators. In general, though,  
spectators should not look down too steeply on the horses. An  
effective solution can be to use a spectators' gallery *--1* @\), with  
the first row for seating and the second for standing. Behind this  
is room for two rows of circulating people. This arrangement will  
create 200 seated and standing places in a 20 x 40 m arena. The  
size of the main entrance has to be large enough to allow access  
for medium-sized lorries \(3.00 m wide, 3.80 high\}. Side entrances  
should be 1.20 m or more wide and min. 2.80 m high. Doors have  
to open outwards.  
The ring fence as enclosure of a riding ring has many purposes  
--. **0.** It simplifies dressage riding of horses and saves the riders  
from injury. Angle of the slope to the vertical f\:;;20°. Glass windows  
\< 2 m above the floor of the riding arena should be protected by a  
fine mesh grille. An exercise area of approx. 1000 m2 is sufficient  
for 10 horses, mostly in pairs daily and weekly.

# SPORTS FACILITIES  
Equestrian Sport  
Most of the operational functions of the various types of riding  
facilities are basically the same, apart from variations due to special  
operational features or local conditions. Building specifications vary  
primarily according to the size of the business or stable occupation  
number, which is decisive for the design of the individual elements  
and determines whether various functions can be combined *---1* **0.**  
Generally, the core of the organisation is the buildings needed for the  
accommodation, care and feeding of the horses, always designed as  
a self-contained structure. A covered riding area is essential to enable  
activity to continue in all weathers. Flats for stable boys, grooms and  
instructors should be designed together with the facilities.  
The long axis of the show-jumping arena should be aligned  
north-south out of consideration for the horse and rider *---1* **8**  
because most of the jumps are approached towards the main axis of  
the riding arena. Tournament arenas, which are aligned north-south,  
should have the stand for the judges and single-sided spectator  
stands on the west side, because major events take place in the  
afternoon. The minimum area of the riding space is 20 x 40 m net \(pure  
riding area\) *---1* **f\).** 20 x 60 m riding areas are required for dressage  
from class M and eventing. The riding space needs additional spaces  
at the sides \(\~3.0 m\) and at the entrance \(\~5.0 m\), so the arena  
has a gross area of 26 x 48 m *---1* **f\).** For competitions, the minimum  
distance of the spectators from hooves is 5 m, for indoor trials 20 m.

A  
SPORTS FACILITIES  
Ski Jumping  
The distance of the parapet of  
the lowest judge's cabin from the  
horizontal 'd' through the tip of the  
ski jump= D x tan 16°- tan 20°.  
The cabins should be arranged as  
steps in the sloping line passing  
through the ski jump table edge to  
the end of the point 'd'. The upper  
edge of the floor of the individual  
cabins is 1-1.20 m below the  
parapet. The slope of the tower  
to the track axis should be 7-10°,  
so that the judge can observe the  
entire flight and landing. At the  
top of the starting ramp, as many starting places as possible should be  
uniformly distributed along the length E/5, whose vertical spacing should  
be about I m. Lowest starting place= E- E/8.  
Minimum width of the landing piste at K = Li/7 + 4 m.  
Notes\:  
All slopes are to be given in old divisions \(360°\). If the transfers are parabolic,  
then Ri and R2 are the smallest curves of the parabolas. If the starting  
ramp is natural, the parts actually used should be marked every 2m in order  
to simplify the exact determination of the starting place. The slope of the ski  
jump table and also a number of points on the curve between starting ramp  
and the tip of the ski jump table should be determined on both sides with  
fixed profiles, so that even non-experts can produce the exact and correct  
profile during the construction of the jump. It is recommended that profile  
markers should be placed at both sides alongside the landing profile and  
into the run-out to enable the creation of the exact snow profile, particularly  
if there is a lot of snow. Ski jumps whose L is \>50 m should not normally  
be built with a V0 \<21 m/sec. Ski jumps with L \>90 m are not approved by  
the FIS \(International Ski Federation\); exception\: flying ski jumps.

Shooting Ranges  
Location\: if possible in a gully within a wooded area, with  
surrounding hillside to catch bullets naturally, away from public  
roads and buildings. Shooting ranges are also possible in  
buildings, e.g. in combination with public multi-purpose sports  
halls. Common categories are air gun range, pistol and small  
calibre range -7 **0 - 0** -7 p. 349.  
The safety requirements for Germany are laid down in the  
'Guidelines for the construction and acceptance for shooting  
ranges for sporting and hunting shooting' from the German  
Shooting Association. Apart from the normal permission for the  
building of a shooting range, a report is also required from an  
accredited shooting range expert. The right of 'neighbours' to  
object on the grounds of noise nuisance is mostly upheld. Safety  
constructions like overhead baffles, side protection \(walls or earth  
banks\) and the closing off of the range must be built of approved  
construction materials or are tested by the expert.  
In the UK, rifle and pistol \(but not air gun\) ranges require the  
approval and safety certificate of the Ministry of Defence. Early  
approval is also needed from the National Small-Bore Rifle  
Association \(NSRA\) or the National Rifle Association \(NRA\).

# Elevation safety  
The total range of a shot is mainly determined by the ideal angle of  
elevation. According to experience, the vertical elevation needing  
to be safely restrained is 20° for air pressure and C02 guns and  
Zimmerstutzen rifles, and 30° for rifle ranges and handguns.  
For high crossbow and archery ranges, the regulations differ.  
Endangered areas are to be protected by dedicated safety  
structures. A shooting range must be constructed so that,  
according to experience, no danger to shooters taking part can  
arise internally nor externally to the surrounding neighbourhood.  
The requirements of the Federal Pollution Control Law must be  
complied with.  
An assessment whether a specific site is suitable for the building  
of a shooting range is essential for the estimation of the cost of  
building. An accredited expert on shooting ranges can provide the  
architect with the necessary specialist information, and should  
always be consulted. Particular points to note are\:  
Distance from existing or planned built-up areas and inhabited  
houses, intended shooting direction \(north or north-east\), soil  
conditions and features of terrain, utility supplies, waste disposal,  
road connection, routeing of roads \(also planned\), car parking,  
holiday and leisure areas. Can or must there be deviations from  
the guidelines? Any required protection measures should be  
included in the design from the start. Ranges can be built in  
separate construction sections.  
The procedures for approval and permission are determined  
by state regulations. The layout and extent of a shooting range  
should include the consideration of additions and extensions,  
which could become necessary in the future and can be built at  
reasonable cost. The design of open-air ranges should include  
noise protection measures.

Stands  
Spectator stands ----\) **0 - 0** can be fixed or mobile. For smaller  
installations with up to 1 0 rows of seats, a linear rise of the seats  
\(height 0.28-0.32 m\) can be assumed. All other installations  
should have a parabolic rise \(height for seats 1.25 m, standing  
places 1.65 m\), sightline rise for seats 0.15 m, standing places  
0.12 m. Row spacing for seats 0.80-0.85 m ----\) **f\) - 0.** For  
standing places, 0.4-0.45 m. Sightline origin point 0.5 m above  
the boundary marking of the playing area.  
Protect spectator places behind goals with mobile catch nets.  
Seats in upper levels and galleries should be closed off with nets  
while practice matches are underway. For the group of rooms  
including entrance hall, changing and sanitary facilities, teachers'  
room, additional sport room and hall, it is recommended to arrange  
a separation of the routeing of people wearing street shoes and  
sports shoes ----\) **0 - 0.** Showers must be immediately accessible  
from changing rooms, with a drying area between the wet area of the  
shower room and the changing room. Shower rooms divided into  
two room units must be connected to the two adjacent changing  
rooms so that one or both of the room units can be used from either  
of the changing rooms ----\) **0 - 0.** Teachers' rooms should be near  
the changing rooms. The first aid room must be on the same level  
as the sports area and can be integrated into the teachers' room.  
Spectator stands can generally be accessed from below or above;  
from below leads to lower costs \(spending on stairs and access  
galleries is saved\), but this is disadvantageous for the organisation of  
events because of visitors passing the base of the stand, disturbing  
competitors and existing spectators ----\) **0.** Free sides should be  
protected by \~1 m high barriers, measured from the traffic surface.

Climbing halls  
Bowling alleys  
BS EN 12572  
DIN 18032  
DIN EN 12572  
Climbing halls make climbing possible all year round, whatever  
the weather. The size and shape of halls is variable depending on  
the operator's ideas and space available \(up to 2500 m2 indoor  
area\).  
Concentrating the subsidiary functions is practical in order to keep  
a large part of the area for climbing. The entrance with reception  
and cash desk can be supplemented by a cafeteria and shop for  
climbing equipment.  
Sanitary facilities are similar to those in a fitness centre. Sensible  
additions would be a steam bath/sauna with rest zone, possibly  
also a fitness area.  
A high degree of daylight is desirable \(smoke extraction domes  
as daylight sources\) and artificial light should only be indirect to  
avoid dazzling of climbers and safety staff. Climbing walls must be  
regularly maintained by an expert according to the manufacturer's  
recommendations.  
Types of climbing wall\:  
**Boulder wall\:** This is climbed at low height without safety ropes.  
The climbers move horizontally \('traverse'\) or 'boulder' short  
stretches upwards. The wall can be climbed without supervision.  
There must be a jumping-off area of gravel, bark mulch or mats.  
**Top rope or lead wall\:** Roping is necessary on account of the  
height. The climbers mainly climb upwards and, at the top of the  
wall, are let down by a climbing partner or abseil themselves.  
It is also possible to boulder at the foot of this wall and it must  
be secured against unsupervised climbing. No grip should be  
reachable up to a height of 2.5 m. If a top rope or lead wall is in a  
sports hall, the requirements for sport operation in sports halls still  
have to be met \(e.g. impact protection\)  
Climbing walls are modelled on natural rock faces in their surface  
and design. The colour scheme is variable and often in accord  
with a Cl scheme. Dimensions and shape are flexible. The height  
for sport climbing is up to 18m, exceptionally to 30m. Climbing  
walls are built by specialist firms and are offered as a building-  
block system or as a free design of the climbing area.  
The support construction \(steel or wood\) must support itself or  
be extended from the hall construction, with cladding of various  
materials -0 **0.** Various grip and step elements can be screwed  
to these types of climbing wall. The climbing grips are made of a  
resin mix with quartz sand dusting and are fixed to the wall with  
M1 0 Allen bolts. The types range from 3 em to beer crate size.  
Grips of various colours can mark different 'colour' routes. The  
combination of various colours in one route enables a number of  
routes on the same section of wall. The number of grips per m2  
should be in accordance with the intended user group.  
An ideal layout provides differentiated areas for beginners and  
experts, and separate areas for children.

SWIMMING POOLS  
Indoor Public Pools  
The size of an indoor swimming pool building depends on the  
size of the pool/water area \(or the dimensions of the basin and  
the diving boards\), the surrounding areas, additional facilities and  
required room heights.  
Building plot  
For indoor pools \(without parking\) allow a plot size of 6-8 m2 per m2  
of planned pool area; if the water area is very large, a smaller value will  
suffice. Additional open-air areas \(terraces, sun decks, sunbathing  
lawns\) can add about 1 0-20% to the total plot size.  
A building plot which is flat or with a max. slope of 15° enables the  
design of a public indoor pool on one level, which is a precondition  
for an economically and functionally optimised design. A greater  
slope to the terrain will lead to higher building costs or functional  
disadvantages.  
Parking  
1 car parking space per 5-1 0 clothes lockers for the swimming  
pool.  
1 bicycle space per 5 clothes lockers for the swimming pool.  
If there are facilities for spectators\: 1 additional parking space  
for every 1 0-15 spectators. If catering is included\: 1 additional  
parking space for every 4-8 seats.  
Subsidiary spaces  
The total water area serves as the basic value for determining  
the subsidiary rooms. With leisure pools this value should be  
supplemented to take additional functions into consideration.  
Area in front of entrance\: 0.2 m2/m2 of water area.  
Entrance hall\: floor area 0.15-0.25 m2/m2 of water area,  
depending on the pool size and the leisure orientation. Also 5 m2  
wind lobby, 5 m2 cash desk or automated paying area, 1-2 m2  
cleaning room and toilets \(1 WC each for ladies and gents\).

**Diving facilities** are used for school and competitive sport. Two  
diving-off points are used\: a rigid platform at heights of 1, 3, 5 and  
10 m, and a rebounding springboard, made of aluminium, wood or  
plastic, at heights of 1 and 3 m. The height of the diving positions  
is measured from the water surface. The climb up to the board or  
to the platform is up steep steps. All diving facilities are on one  
side of the pool --\) **0-f\). Water temperature\:** 24-28 a c. In order  
for divers to be able to discern the water surface better, water  
rippling devices or sprinkler jets can be provided.

**Combinations of indoor and outdoor swimming pools** enable,  
according to the type of operation, almost complete spatial,  
functional and·operational combination of the individual facilities'  
components. At the same time, they also offer more flexible  
opportunities for use and thus possess a higher leisure value than  
outdoor or indoor pools alone. The differing needs at different  
times of year require different areas of water indoors and outdoors.  
Operation can be categorised into summertime, wintertime and  
in-between \(pre-season and after-season\).  
The following types of operation can be considered\: simultaneous  
use of the inside and outside water areas with common opening  
times, unlimited bathing time and unitary entrance price; separate  
use of the indoor and outdoor water areas with different opening  
times, partially unlimited opening times \(outdoors\) and different  
prices; seasonal use of only one part, e.g. by mothballing one  
part. Combinations of indoor and outdoor swimming pools  
can sometimes also be achieved by extending the facilities at  
existing pools, adding an indoor or outdoor section. If the indoor  
and outdoor parts of a new project are not to be opened in one  
construction phase, then the design of the entire facility should be  
undertaken, including technical specialist design work. This can  
avoid double expenditure. The first construction phase should  
generally be the indoor swimming pool.

# SWIMMING POOLS  
Indoor and Outdoor Pools  
The building plot size should be in line with the requirements for an  
outdoor pool. With a plot requirement \<1 0,000 m2 for the indoor  
element, a supplement of 5.00 m2 per m2 of water area should be  
added for the outdoor. Otherwise, the design recommendations  
for indoor or outdoor pools apply.  
The pool area of the outdoor pool should ideally be connected  
to the pool area of the indoor pool. This ensures better utilisation  
between seasons, central supervision and a favourable technical  
combination. The lounge area with catering should have a view of  
both pools if possible.  
Access to the outdoor pool is normally through the entrance hall  
of the indoor pool, but at peak times this can be supplemented  
by the *covered* entrance zone. The cash desk and access control  
area should serve both parts if possible.  
A close link between the pool areas in the indoor and the outdoor  
facilities enables flexible use. The connection between the two,  
preferably to the non-swimmers' section of the outdoor pool, can  
be through a swimming channel \(with access in the indoor pool\) or a  
closed corridor. The intention is that the bathers can reach an outdoor  
pool from the indoor pool without contact with cold outside air.

# Construction details  
The use of foils for the lining of swimming pools saves the normal  
expense of waterproof sub-structure. The foil in areas around  
stairs, standing steps and children's paddling pools should have an  
embossed and structured surface for safety reasons. At penetrations,  
fixed flange connections are helpful ---7 **0-**\~- Possible condensation  
on the side away from the water should be considered, and secondary  
drainage or relief drillings should be provided under the waterproofing  
layer. In order to empty the pool, the floor is constructed with a  
gradient of 5% or max. 10%. In order to securely connect the foil,  
use bonded sheet metal profiles ---7 **0 - 0.** Also possible are pre-  
fabricated pools in one piece as a shell structure, or segmental pools.

A recirculation system is usual today, generally providing flat  
water flow with the good surface cleaning effect of a skimmer or  
a channel.  
# Filter types  
Gravel \(deep filter, sometimes with cleaning air injection\), diatomite  
\(surface filter\), plastic foam. Algae is combated with chlorine,  
chlorine-free algae agent, or copper sulphate.  
# Heating  
With counter-current apparatus or through-flow heater in the  
heating boiler- mind the regulations! This prolongs the swimming  
season considerably at relatively low cost **--70 - 0.**  
# Protection of children  
Can be through fencing, covering the pool or self-activating alarm  
device \(reacts to waves\).  
# Frost protection  
For rigid pools with inserted edge beam, heating or overflow kept  
frost-free. A pool should not be emptied in winter \(sloping edge  
of pool\).

In contrast to the separated features of a commercially operated  
sauna --7 p. 373 f., the functions of a private sauna can all be  
integrated into one room, e.g. changing and relaxation \(can also  
take place in the house\) or pre-cleaning and cooling \(can take  
place in the same room with the same sanitary facilities\).  
Free-standing **sauna cabins** or facilities \(e.g. in the garden\) are  
normally constructed of spruce in log cabin style, and are either  
self-built or bought pre-fabricated. The log cabins are available in  
various versions, either as sauna cabins --7 **4D\)** or also with shower  
and changing or relaxation room --7 **Ci\).** There are also sauna  
cabins available as prefabricated or kit elements for installation in  
existing rooms --7 **CD+ 0.**  
**Sauna stove\:** Sauna cabins for installation usually have electric  
stoves \(which require a three-phase supply above a certain size\),  
while log cabin types mostly have solid fuel stoves \(which require  
a chimney\).  
**Plunge pool--7 8 - 0** max. depth 1.20 m.

Sauna/Wellness  
**Spa** is the general term for health and wellness establishments,  
which should generally include\: sauna facility, massage and  
solarium, relaxation, fitness and condition training \(including  
swimming -7 Indoor and outdoor swimming pools\).  
A commercially operated **sauna** \(size III-IV -7 **E\)\)** will include\:  
**Changing room,** shower room with **washing facilities, sauna**  
**cabins, rest/relaxation room** and **subsidiary rooms** \(staff room,  
reception, cash desk, sanitary facilities for visitors and staff\).  
In public saunas, separate rooms are provided for changing,  
preliminary washing and toilets; for staff and visitors' toilets, the  
relevant building regulations apply. Access to swimming areas,  
food/drink providers and fitness areas is increasingly being offered  
in spa and well ness establishments.  
The **wash room** is used for washing with warm water before  
entering the sauna -7 **0 - 0.**  
The **cooling room** is used for cooling off between visits to the

**AMUSEMENT ARCADES**  
The provision of gambling machines, often called fruit machines  
or slot machines, is controlled by gambling regulations. According  
to these, a gambling machine offering the possibility of winning  
money or goods may be made available in amusement arcades or  
similar enterprises.  
On a floor area of 15 m2  
, only one gambling machine to win money  
or goods may be positioned. The total number may not exceed  
10 machines \~ **e.** In the calculation of floor area, storerooms,  
corridors, toilets, anterooms and stairs are not considered.  
In addition to building regulations, planning regulations also have to  
be borne in mind forthe building of amusement arcades. Amusement  
arcades are permissible as places of entertainment in urban planning  
zones. In exceptional cases, they can be approved in other zones, in  
which commercial businesses which could cause a nuisance are not  
allowed. Automated entertainment machines, which offer prizes as  
goods, can also be made available in amusement arcades, but other  
games only if their winnings are paid in cash.  
Games may not be organised in amusement arcades without  
permission. Neighbouring amusement arcades can share common  
toilet facilities \~ **e.**  
The 'Pachinko' amusement arcades usual in Japan \~ **41!\) - 0** are  
not permissible in Germany. Balls won in these games can be  
exchanged for goods.  
In the UK, gaming by means of machines is restricted and is  
governed by the Gaming Act 1968.

Street Spaces  
**0 Street spaces in cities become readable when their areas are blacked in, because the eye understands black areas as**  
**cohesive and white areas as holes.**  
The percentage of space boundaries in  
the field of view determines how open  
**or closed a street space is read as. The**  
perception of architectural details on  
buildings also depends on the distance  
from the building \_, p. 40. The formula  
on p. 40 can be used to determine the  
relationship between the distance of an  
observer from a building and the scale  
of a drawing of a building. The degree of  
detailing at a scale can thus be matched  
**to a certain distance of the observer.**  
The relationship of scale to distance  
according to the formula is approximately\:

The spacing and height of  
opposing buildings have an  
influence on the impression

The design intentions for street  
spaces, in addition to the fulfil-

give orientation and provide  
residential quality. Identity is  
the result of emphasising par-

axes. Distinctive places provide  
more ways of orientation and  
offer means of identification.  
Apart from building fagades,  
trees are the strongest space-

Types of Road  
Classification  
As part of the transport network, the layout of roads depends  
on their function in the network's structure. The classification  
of roads has to differentiate their location inside or outside  
a built-up area and above all their function as access for  
properties and buildings next to the road, leading to the  
important distinction between roads which are built along and  
those which are not.  
Roads without adjacent building  
These roads are almost entirely used for vehicle traffic. Their  
design is based on the planned average speed, the connection  
function level and the category group. The correct road category  
can be found in \~ **0** and, together with the forecast number  
of vehicles, the cross-section of the road can be determined \~  
p. 378 **o.**  
Roads with adjacent building  
These roads are part of the public space and serve a multitude  
of uses in addition to transport, though the predominance of  
motorised transport has today led to them being mostly formed  
by the needs of road traffic. Town and transport planning has the  
purpose of achieving a balanced relationship between road traffic  
and the other important functions of the street space. These are,  
for example\:  
communication areas relaxation, strolling, walking, demonstrating ...  
play areas cycling, roller skating, ball games, playing  
hide and seek  
commercial use  
green areas  
market stalls, pavement cafes, food stands  
binding dust and pollutants, oxygen  
production, microclimate improvement  
Elements of road cross-section  
The publications of the Research Company for Roads and Traffic  
\(FGSV\) give basic dimensions for the various uses of street  
spaces. The traffic space is measured from the width required by  
the traffic participant plus a margin for movement, dependent on  
the speed. Together with the safety distance from solid obstacles,  
which has to be kept free, this gives the clear space required  
for traffic \~ p. 379. To determine the profile of the street space,  
the recommendations in the Appendix for Main Roads and the  
Recommendations for the Construction of Access Roads state a  
number of criteria which enable a differentiated adaptation of the  
available space for various needs. The most important decision  
criteria are\:  
1. Zones, divided into town centre zones, areas of old buildings  
near to the town centre, residential areas, industrial and  
commercial areas and village areas.  
2. Type of connection road\: main road, main feeder road,  
residential street and residential side street.  
3. Requirement for park and green areas.  
4. Type and frequency of public transport.  
5. Type of use of the pedestrian areas. In addition to  
pedestrian routes, these offer opportunities for the social and  
communications functions of street spaces.  
After these factors have been evaluated, a decision is made as to  
which size of vehicles will be allowed to travel on the road and at  
what speed. The required carriageway width is then derived from  
considering possible encounters \~ p. 379.

Motorways  
Motorways are roads without adjacent building, designed for high-  
speed vehicles and express transport. The two carriageways, one  
in each direction, are separated by a central reservation. Each  
carriageway consists of two or more Janes and normally a hard  
shoulder...; **0.**  
Motorways are linked to each other by grade-separated \(...; p. 381\)  
intersections. These can be three-directional ...; **0 - 'Ii\>** or four-  
directional intersections ...; **0 - 0** and specialised junctions for  
joining and leaving the motorway...; **0 +\(D.**  
Motorways are the safest roads and have the highest capacity.  
The most important factor in the design and construction of new  
motorways is environmental impact.  
Route signage ...; **0\:** the location of the sign for junctions is at  
1 000 m, and for intersections 2000 m before the turn-off.  
In order that built infrastructure next to the motorway does not  
negatively affect traffic \(obstruction of view and reduction of  
concentration\), legislators have identified adjacent zones where  
building is either forbidden or restricted...; **8.** Building restriction\: the  
erection or significant alteration of buildings and facilities at a distance

Traffic Space  
Vehicle traffic space is the sum  
of the space required by the  
assessment vehicle, the margin for  
movement at the sides and above,  
the addition for two-directional  
traffic, and the spaces above the  
drainage channel at the edge of  
the road and the hard shoulder. The  
maximum width of the assessment  
vehicle is, in accordance with  
European standards, 2.55-2.60 m.  
Traffic space for bicycles is one  
lane each, 1.00 m wide and 2.25 m  
high \~ p. 384. Traffic space for  
pedestrians is a walking strip  
0.75 m wide and 2.25 m high.  
The height of the traffic space for  
vehicles is 4.20 m, plus a safety  
margin 4.50 m \(or, better, 4.70 m\),  
in order to be able to renew  
elevated superstructure. For foot-  
paths and cycle tracks, the clear  
height is 2.50 m.  
The width of the safety space at the  
sides is measured from the edge  
of the traffic space to the side. The  
necessary width depends on the  
permissible maximum speed.

For roads with adjacent building, there are no standard cross-  
sections. A suitable profile is developed considering the various  
requirements of users and adjacent property owners for sections of  
the road. The precondition for this is the decision as to which type of  
vehicle the road space should be designed for-\> p. 391. Examples of  
various built-up road cross-sections are given here -\> **0-0.**  
The intention should be to give the road a distinctive image. This  
can be achieved through clear, differentiated dimensions, differing  
arrangement of the various cross-sections, a balanced relationship  
of the width and height of the street space and diversity of planting.  
As a result of this, the layout of the street space should enable  
orientation in the street and also in the town itself.

Intersections  
Intersections are categorised into **grade-separated** and **at-**  
**grade.** Grade-separated means that the roads cross at different  
levels \(with at least one bridge\) and are connected by ramps  
or slip roads \(a motorway-type junction\). Intersections on one  
level are at-grade \(with and without traffic lights\). These can be  
T-junctions \(one road meets another\) \_\_\_.. **0-f\)** or crossroads \(two  
roads cross\) \_\_\_.. **e - e.**  
The design of crossings as roundabouts \_\_\_.. **G\) - 0** has become  
common in some countries \(e.g. UK, Germany\). Small roundabouts  
are defined as diameter = 25-40 m, large roundabouts \>40 m.  
Their advantages are\: less danger of serious accidents, traffic  
light control no longer required, less noise nuisance, energy  
saving and reduction in speed on urban roads. The diameter of  
the roundabout depends on the necessary waiting queue length,  
which depends on the traffic volume.  
A staggered traffic crossing allows more space, clearly  
understandable road section and spatial definition of the road.  
This is suitable for slow traffic in residential areas\_\_\_.. **e.**  
Building is forbidden within 20 m of federal main roads, measured  
from the outer edge of the carriageway. Building is restricted up  
to 40 m from the edge of the carriageway. \_\_\_.. p. 378 Motorways.

Footpaths and Cycle Ways  
Areas for walking should always be designed to be varied and  
interesting, also taking into account likely children's usage.  
Weather protection can be provided by trees, arcades and maybe  
protecting roofs. Roadside pavements should if possible not  
be narrower than 2 m \(of which 1 .50 m min. width and 0.50 m  
safety distance from the carriageway\). A much wider pavement  
is, however, often appropriate. Near schools, shopping centres,  
leisure facilities etc., a min. width of 3 m is ideal. \~ **0- 0**  
Roadside cycle ways should be min. 1 .00 m wide for one-way  
traffic and 2.00 m \(min. 1.60 m\) wide for two-way traffic, with  
safety strips of 0.75 m added to the road. Combined footpaths  
and cycle ways should be 2.50 m \(min. 2.00 m\) wide \~ p. 384.

Bicycle Traffic/Storage  
Dimensions of bicycles --7 **0 - 8.** Note allowances for baskets  
and children's seats. Include space for special bicycles\: recumbent  
bicycles are up to 2.35 m long; tandems up to 2.60 m; bicycle trailer  
\(with shaft\) approx. 1.60 m long, 1.00 m wide; bicycles adapted for  
disabled people and for delivering goods.  
Offer comfortable parking --7 **0** wherever possible; cramped  
parking can cause injury, soiling and damage when locking,  
loading or wheeling in and out. Double rows with overlapping front  
wheels can save space --7 @. In contrast, stacking vertically is  
problematic as it can cause damage.  
There should be an appropriate number of parking spaces,  
according to rules of thumb and building regulations --7 **CD.** Cycle  
stands offer steady support, even when loading the bicycle.  
Locking should be possible using only one U-lock, securing the  
front wheel and the frame to the stand at the same time. Frame  
stands are therefore suitable --7 **e.** Bicycle stands which do not  
provide sensible locking opportunities are only suitable for internal  
use in areas of restricted access. Provide an intermediate bar for  
children's bicycles. Bicycle stands are mostly used on both sides,  
in which case the space required is 1.20 m --7 **e.**  
Bicycle passage width 1.80 m --7 **0-e;** also provide cross-aisles.  
The entire layout should be as clear and helpful for orientation  
as possible. Additional parking areas may be required for bicycle  
trailers and special bicycles.  
Where bicycles are parked for many hours, provide roofing and  
lighting. The parking location should be placed so it is easy to  
find and ride into, and where there are social controls. Supervised  
bicycle parking can be appropriate for major events, stations,  
open-air swimming pools and shopping centres. Locations for  
bicycle parking can also be converted from car parking spaces .

Space required by bicycles\: brisk riding in one direction from 1.40 m  
width, better 1.60 m; overtaking and meeting oncoming bicycles at  
reduced speed 1.60-2.00 m width; widths of 2.0Q-2.50 m are better,  
if bicycles with trailers also use the cycle way.  
The basic dimensions for the traffic space of bicycles can be  
deduced from the basic width of 0.60 m plus the height of the cyclist  
---7 **0** and the required margin of movement in various situations.  
Passages between cycle stands should not be made too narrow\:  
passage width min. 1.50 m \(preferably 2.00 m\) up to a length of  
10m, 1.80 m width up to 15 m, 2.20 m width up to 25 m. Interrupt

Noise Protection  
# Guidelines for road noise protection  
Increased environmental awareness has made noise mitigation  
ever more important, especially in traffic spaces. In particular,  
the intensity of noise caused by greater traffic load, and denser  
building, demands effective protection in the form of earth walls,  
noise reduction walls and noise reduction pyramids --7 **0 - 8.**  
Road traffic noise should be reduced by about \~25 dB \(A\) on the  
other side of the noise reduction wall. This reduction is described as  
*!'!.* LA, R, STR. and is a modified noise reduction value for road traffic  
noise. Noise reduction walls can be reflecting *!'!.* LA, a, STR. \<4 dB  
\(A\), absorbing 4 dB \(A\) \~LA a STR. \<8 dB \(A\), highly absorbing  
8 dB \(A\) \~LA a STR. The relevant standard and the Guidelines for  
Road Noise Protection \(RLS- 81\) give detailed calculation methods.  
The mitigation effect of a wall is not dependent on the construction  
material, but mostly on the height of the wall. The effect against road  
traffic noise is based on the creation of a noise shadow, but this, in  
contrast to a visual shadow, is not fully effective. Bending of the noise  
allows a part to reach the shadow zone. The proportion is smaller,  
the higher the wall and the longer the bypass route of the deflected  
noise. A multitude of pre-cast concrete elements are available from  
the industry, and also noise reduction walls of glass, timber and steel.

PARKING FACILITIES  
Vehicles- Turning  
The type, size and design of a place where vehicles can turn depend  
on the particular use of an area, the vehicles and the urban planning  
function. It is difficult to make generally valid recornrnendations  
for the selection of the correct turning place. The requirements of  
the fire services and refuse disposal trucks have to be considered  
in turning place decisions. Some authorities responsible for waste  
disposal decline to rernove rubbish from dead-end streets where  
refuse disposal trucks can only perform a three-point turn or have to  
drive backwards for considerable distances.  
Turning places can be formed as hammerheads -7 **G - 0,**  
turning circles or turning loops -7 **0 - 0.** Hammerheads demand  
manoeuvres such as three-point turns, so turning circles and loops  
are preferable as they allow trucks to turn in one swing.  
Turning places should for practical reasons be laid out  
asymmetrically to the left -7 **0 - 0.** The perimeter of turning  
places should allow sufficient space without fixed objects being  
endangered by the overhanging parts of vehicles. The centre of  
turning loops can be planted -7 **0.** Hammerhead turning places  
-7 **G** are only suitable for cars. They are not necessary where  
the road is more than 6 m wide, which can also include garage  
forecourts or footpath crossings.

# PARKING FACILITIES  
Parking Spaces  
Parking spaces are usually outlined by 12-20 mm wide yellow or  
white painted lines. When parking is facing a wall, these lines are  
often painted at a height of up to 1 m for better visibility. Guide  
rails in the floor along the side have also proved popular for  
demarcation of parking limits, and can be about 50-60 em long,  
20 em wide and 10 em high.  
Where vehicles are parked in lines facing walls or at the edge of  
the parking deck in a multi-storey car park, it is common practice  
to provide buffers, restraining bars or railings up to axle height to  
prevent cars from going over the edge. Where cars are parked  
face to face, transverse barriers about 10 em high can be used to  
act as stops at the front. Overhang on vehicles must be taken into  
account --7 **e.** For lining up in front of a wall, a stop rail or rubber  
buffer will be sufficient --7 **e.**

Parking Spaces  
If individual parking spaces are bor-  
dered by pillars, walls or columns,  
then the width of the parking space  
on the relevant side is increased by  
0.10 m --7 0 - e. \(This does not,  
however, apply to mechanical lift-  
ing platforms or automatic garages.\)  
If parking spaces are bounded by  
a footpath, cycle way or separation  
strip on the facing side via a kerb,  
then the kerb will be used to esti-  
mate the border of the parking space  
--7 0 + Ci\). The examples show how  
parking spaces can be integrated  
into their surroundings by design  
elements without impairing their func-  
tion --7 0-0.  
To increase open areas, parking  
spaces can be partly or completely  
lowered or provided with green roofs.  
The greening not only has design  
value but also provides shadow and  
improves the ecological situation

Multi-storey Car Parks  
For multi-storey car parks the requirements for the layout of  
parking spaces and access are in principle the same as for open  
car parks. The Garage \(multi-storey car park\) Regulations require  
a minimum width for parking spaces of 2.30 m. The Research  
Company for Roads and Traffic \(FGSV\), however, recommends  
a minimum width of 2.50 m for all publicly accessible parking  
spaces on account of the increasing size of cars.  
All structural elements \(ceilings, walls, columns, reinforcements\)  
of multi-storey car parks must be fire resistant. The recommended  
clear access height for car parks above and below the ground is  
2.20 m. An addition of 25 em is practical for the direction signage  
for cars and pedestrians, plus a further 5 em for later resurfacing.  
This gives a total height of 2.50 m plus construction over the access  
ways, thus a storey height of 2\. 75-3.50 m, depending on the chosen  
method of construction. A relatively close spacing of columns can  
reduce building cost without impairing function if the construction  
height is carefully chosen ---7 **f\) - 8.** Wide-spanning column-free  
constructions have 7-12% less column area on plan ---7 **e.**  
Underground car parks result in considerably higher costs for  
construction and operation than those above ground.  
Uphill sections and ramps must be designed and built in line with  
the above ---7 **e.** Straight or spiral car park ramps are created  
by sloping the floor slab ---7 p. 393, or forming spirals ---7 **e.** with  
vehicles both sides of the access way. The areas, including access  
areas, on which a certain number of vehicles can be parked can  
be determined for preliminary design from ---7 **0.** The examples  
---7 p. 393 and p. 394 show layouts of multi-storey car parks and  
ramp arrangements. Reinforced concrete construction \(in in-situ  
concrete, pre-cast elements or a combined form\) comply best  
with the fire-resistance requirements. Steel structures are normally  
designed as a main beam/secondary beam system and mostly  
have to be clad with concrete or fire protection boards, or sprayed,  
for fire resistance reasons. Car parks catering for passenger cars  
should be designed for a live loading of 3.5 kN/m2 and the ramps  
for 5 kN/m2 for design purposes, for greened roofs 1 0 kN/m2

Vertical curves at crest should be designed with a radius of

up to 15%, it is sufficient to provide a flattening at the

Ramps  
There are various systems of ramps to overcome height differences  
and to access the various storeys of multi-storey car parks. The  
gradient of ramps should not exceed 15%, for small car parks 20%.  
Between public roads and ramps with more than 5° gradient, there  
must be a horizontal run of \~5 m length, or in the case of ramps for  
cars the run should be \~3 m long, with ramps at up to 1 0% gradient.  
Possible arrangements of ramps can be divided into four groups\:  
**Straight, parallel and continuous multi-storey ramps** with  
intermediate landing, access and exit opposite---+ **0.**  
**Sloping floor levels \(no-loss full ramp system\).** The entire area with  
parking spaces is on a slope, a space-saving system. Slope \~6%.  
**Half-storey offset levels** \(D'Humy ramps\). Parking spaces are on  
half-storeys and the height difference is overcome by short ramps.  
This is a space-saving system but not very smooth to drive around  
and therefore only intended for smaller car parks---+ **0. e** and **e.**  
**Spiral ramps.** This system is relatively expensive yet has poor  
visibility, and the circular form leads to residual areas, which are  
hard to exploit---+ **0-0.** The spiral ramps must have a transverse  
gradient of \~3%. The radius of the inner road edge is \~5 m. In  
large multi-storey car parks, ramps also used by pedestrians  
must have a \~80 em wide raised pavement, unless routes for  
pedestrians are provided elsewhere.

According to the Garage \(multi-storey car park\) Regulations, small  
car parks are of 6100 m2  
, medium car parks 100-1000 m2 and  
large car parks 61000 m2 usable area. Underground car parks  
are defined as having the floor level 61.30 m below ground level.  
Large multi-storey car parks must have separate access and  
exits. They are located near large traffic concentrations like those  
at stations, airports, shopping centres, theatres, cinemas, offices,  
administrative buildings and large residential buildings. Medium  
and large multi-storey car parks must be in easily accessible areas.  
Such car parks must have a clear height of min. 2.0 m in areas  
accessible on foot, also under support beams, ventilation ducts  
and other building elements. The ground floor is generally higher,  
as it usually has other uses.  
Escape routes of max. 30 m are required to the stairs or exits.  
For vans the clear height is 2.50 m. Floor loadings according to  
the relevant standard. Open multi-storey car parks have apertures,  
which cannot be closed, leading directly into the open air, with a  
size of one third of the total area of the envelope wall, with the  
opposite wall at a maximum distance of 70 m. These provide  
transverse ventilation even with weather protection measures.  
Concerning the minimum dimensions for access, exits and internal  
routes, these must include no space for starting to drive round a  
curve. Particularly where ramps join to internal routes at right angles,  
additional room must be provided for the start of driving round the  
corner and the relevant minimum radii must be complied with. It  
must also be possible for larger cars to drive in and out without  
manoeuvring processes -7 p. 393 **0.** The planned traffic routeing  
must always be checked against the relevant swept curves.  
**Criteria for the quality of multi-storey car parks\:**  
The scale of the fa9ades of multi-storey car parks should fit into  
their surroundings. The fa9ade elevation can also be used for other  
functions, for example as offices -7 **0.** Further criteria\: integration  
into urban planning coherence, natural lighting and ventilation,  
greening, uncomplicated system for charging fees, good access  
to public transport- Park and Ride.  
# Safe operation  
Video surveillance, glass areas in lobbies \(observe fire protection  
requirements\), visual contact with the outside, visibility through  
the longest possible column spacing, light colours differentiating  
the storeys, distinctive marking of parking spaces to help visitors  
find them again.

Parking Systems  
Parking systems are mostly  
used for private parking. The  
selection and specification of  
the system should also take  
larger than normal vehicles into  
account \(e.g. off-road vehicles,  
vans and sports utility vehicles  
-SUVs\).  
Two cars can be parked one  
above 'the other in single  
garages on movable platforms  
---7 **0 - f\).** The operation is  
electric, or in case of power cuts,  
with a hand pump. A parking lift  
can handle up to three cars ---7

and operated by the doorman  
with a control panel. Loading  
per parking space is 2500 kg.

Parking platform systems ---7

parking for various amounts of  
room. Cars stand on parking  
platforms, which are moved  
via a control desk to clear the

is used where greater available  
depth could provide two, three  
or more rows of places but too  
much area would otherwise  
be lost for access. Therefore,  
in front of a stationary row  
of places, sideways-moving  
parking platforms are provided,  
which can be moved so that the  
places behind can be reached.

# PARKING FACILITIES  
Trucks- Parking and Turning  
Owing to the large variation in the  
size of trucks, it is not worth marking  
out permanent lanes or bays on the  
ground. The basic measurements  
for space and actual requirements  
for the manoeuvring and parking of  
trucks are taken from the vehicle  
dimensions and whether driving  
straight, cornering, or entering or  
driving out of the parking place.  
Especially while cornering, the  
swept curve of the trailing inner rear  
wheels must be taken into account.  
The turning circle for the largest  
vehicles permitted under the road  
traffic regulations is an outer turning  
circle radius of 12m. An outer turning  
circle radius of 1 0 m is nevertheless  
considered sufficient for the vast  
majority of trucks which come within  
the scope of the regulations -7

Service areas  
Service areas \(Raststatte\) on autobahns in Germany are  
administered by the company Tank und Rast. The facilities are  
situated directly on the autobahn with access by slip roads. In  
addition to the petrol station, further service units are operated  
by leaseholders. According to the size of the facilities, this  
can be fast snack bars, restaurants, sales areas or overnight  
accommodation.

Petrol stations supply fuel and lubricants, mostly in combination  
with maintenance and care services. Because petrol station shops  
in Germany are excepted from the shop closing time regulations,  
the proportion of sales area devoted to car accessories and goods  
required daily has increased considerably.  
# Important regulations and technical rules\:  
In addition to the relevant building regulations\:  
WHG \(water management law\) applies, on account of the storage  
of fuel and associated water, fire and explosion hazards.  
VAwS \(regulation of requirements for the handling of substances  
harmful to groundwater\) mostly concerns specialist firms and  
testing duties.  
TRwS \(technical rules for substances harmful to water\)  
TRbF \(technical rules for flammable liquids\)  
Petrol stations must be erected by certified specialist firms \(WHG\).  
State regulations control\:  
1\. Parking space size \(2.50 x 5.00 m = 12.50 m2\)  
2\. Required number of parking spaces \(e.g. depending on the  
extent of premises, and the number of petrol pumps and  
people working at the station\).  
3. Required queuing space for automatic car wash \(e.g. area  
sufficient for 50% of the hourly washing capacity\).  
For design purposes, dimensions specific to cars should be  
considered\:  
Turning circle\: car 12.50 m HGV 26.00 m  
Vehicle width\: car 1.85 m HGV 2.50 m  
Vehicle length\: car 5.00 m HGV 18.00 m with trailer  
These data can be used to derive the dimensions of pump islands  
and passage widths *---t* **0 -e.**  
The paving around the petrol pumps must be impervious to liquids  
and the run-off channelled into side kerbs and/or a downward  
slope. These areas \(length of the petrol hose + 1 m\) must drain  
through a suitable liquid interceptor or be roofed over. Reduced  
dimensions for the surfaced area impervious to liquids and the  
siting of the tanks apply to private petrol stations, categorised as  
petrol stations for private use with low consumption \(the quantities  
are regulated by the states\).  
Petrol pumps must have protection against vehicle impact with at  
least 20 em spacing and 12 em height *---t* **f\).**  
Each petrol pump should if possible dispense all the fuels on  
offer \(multi-dispenser petrol pump\). For private petrol stations,  
there are simple petrol pumps with electronic control systems  
for personalised control of access and quantity *---t* **0.** Autogas  
\(LPG\) filling stations require their own dispensers. There are no  
requirements concerning surfacing, because autogas is not  
classed as a liquid hazardous to groundwater. Measures should  
be taken to ensure rapid distribution of any leaking gas \(earth wall  
or dip into which the gas can be blown by the wind\).

**Car wash facilities**  
These are used for the environmentally friendly washing of cars  
and are installed as a public service business, also for trucks  
on the premises of the haulage company. Mobile tyre-washing  
equipment is available for building sites, tips and landfill sites.  
As with petrol stations, the groundwater protection regulations  
are to be observed. Car washes require, according to system,  
100-600 I of water per car. This must be reprocessed and at least  
80% recycled. For closed systems \(no drainage connection\), there  
is a simplified approval process under groundwater protection  
regulations. A car wash needs about 40-50 m3 for settling and silt  
retention basins \(underground tank 0 3 m\). Fresh water is required  
to cover evaporation losses, to reduce the salt content in winter, to  
rinse off and for the application of liquid waxes.  
# Self-service car wash stalls  
These are mostly roofed parking spaces, on which cars can be  
cleaned by the customer with a high-pressure cleaner and hand  
washing brushes. Small installations have one or two places,  
larger installations up to 12 places, which can be served by a  
central services room --7 **0-0.**  
**Portal car wash**  
This takes up little space. The customer has to get out and the  
entire washing equipment in the portal then travels over to the  
parked car. This type of car wash can be installed in the open  
air, but is better indoors, ideally enabling the customer to drive  
through. Because the portal stops in front of the car parking space  
when not in operation, the building is min. 9-10 m long, width min.  
4.60 m, height min. 3 m \(for portals for cars up to 2.1 m in height\).  
The clear space at the side between portal and building elements  
is min. 50 em.  
A portal car wash can wash about 5000-50 000 cars per year or  
5-18 vehicles per hour --7 **0.**  
**Tunnel car wash**  
The vehicles are carried on a conveyor through fixed washing and  
after-care portals. This technology enables a high capacity and  
various washing programmes in the same pass time. The length of  
the car wash is 20-60 m. A tunnel car wash can process 30-100  
vehicles per hour or 20 000-200 000 per year. -\) **e.**

# PUBLIC TRANSPORT  
Conditions, Means of Transport  
Legal basis\: General Railway Law \(AEG\), Passenger Transport  
Law \(PBefG\), Regulations for the Construction and Operation of  
Trams \(BOStrab\), state public transport laws.  
Each residential, commercial or industrial area should be accessible  
by public transport. Accessible means that the distance \(as the  
crow flies\) to a transport stop complies with the values in **0.**  
All areas with contiguous building development and more than  
200 inhabitants \(or a corresponding number of commuters  
and/or students\), should be accessible, as should comparable  
establishments in terms of traffic generation \(locations with  
special functions\).  
In addition to the bus, there are various types of rail vehicle that  
can make public transport quicker, more convenient and more  
attractive than individual travel\:  
- **Rapid urban transit railways\:** predominantly electric,  
independent rail systems within an urban area \(overground and  
underground - subway in USA\) or region, sometimes with at-  
grade crossings but with absolute priority  
- **Urban railways\:** as underground railways partially independent  
from road traffic, or above ground on dedicated permanent tracks  
or with at-grade crossings with road traffic without absolute  
priority  
- **Trams\:** on track beds integrated into roads or dedicated; when  
trams make use of the public street space, they are subject to  
road traffic regulations \(StVO\).  
Mixed systems are also possible, e.g. urban railways and trams  
on the same permanent track or trams using rail tracks \(e.g. in  
Karlsruhe\). The use of the permanent track by buses is feasible,  
resulting in better integration of different transportation elements  
\(stops, bus/tram stations\) and priority switching at traffic lights.  
Of great importance is the spatial and scheduling integration of  
various means of public transport with each other and also with  
road and cycle traffic \(P\(ark\) + R\(ide\), B\(icycle\) + R\(ide\) etc.\) and  
appropriate design of changing points -\) **0.**  
# Overhead line systems  
Power supply is normally provided by overhead wire and pantograph  
on the roof, although underground railways and some urban railways  
can also use live third rails at the side \(approx. 20 em above the  
running rails\) -\) **0.**  
# Rail profiles  
Wide-base rails of various dimensions are normally employed  
\(urban rapid transit or urban rail 49 E 1, trams 41 E 1, dimensions  
-\) **G\).** In street space, grooved rails \(59 Ri 1, 60 Ri 1\) are used,  
which can be joint-sealed to the paving at the sides. Open track  
beds are sometimes greened.

**Tram stops\:** platform min. 3.50 m or, to provide space for waiting  
shelters and two-sided platforms, min. 5.50 m. The permissible  
minimum width in the road space \(according to BOStrab\) of 1.50 m  
should be improved on out of consideration for the passengers \(where  
space is restricted, 2 m is the minimum for a side exit\). Safety space\:  
0.85 m wide from the vehicle gauge on the door side of the rail vehicle,  
which can also lie on the road pavement.  
**Dynamic stop\:** if there is no transport stop island, a traffic light  
should be placed further back along the road to protect the  
passengers getting in and out.

# PUBLIC TRANSPORT  
Stops and Stations  
The design of public transport stops is important. Railway systems  
are normally designed very specifically for the location. Therefore,  
platform and floor heights in the vehicle have to be matched in order  
to ensure passenger-friendly and accessible entrances and exits.  
# Platform layout  
The layout of central and side platforms depends on construction,  
operational and transport considerations, especially for **platforms**  
**in tunnels.**  
Central platforms are simpler for the passengers to navigate, but  
two-way carriages are necessary. If stations are lower and an  
intermediate storey is required, then this can be used as a grade-  
separated road crossing by general pedestrian traffic. When the  
platforms are on one side, then twice the number of accesses,  
stairs and installations \(kiosks, timetables etc.\) are needed. One-  
way carriages are possible because doors are required on the  
right-hand side only. When stops are located on viaducts, side  
platforms are preferable because platforms can be projected,  
so no surface is lost apart from the supports. Successive stops  
should if possible have the same platform layout \(for passenger  
orientation\).  
# Platform length  
This depends on the length of the longest train intended to stop  
at the station. In the case of underground and urban rapid transit,  
platform length is the train length plus 5 m \(to allow for imprecise  
braking\). Double stops are also possible for trams.  
# Platform width  
The platform width depends on the number of passengers and the  
location, type and width of the access and exit routes. Platform,  
stairs and exits should be designed so that the platform can  
be cleared, without queues, before the next train arrives. The  
minimum widths are, in general\:  
- side platforms 3 m  
- central platforms with stairs at the end of the platform 6 m  
-with stairs within the usable platform length 7 m.  
# Stairs  
Staircases can be located at the end of the platform or within  
the usable platform length. The width of fixed stairs should be  
a multiple of 0.60 m \(at least 2.40 m\) plus width for handrail and  
cleaning channel. Provide a handrail both sides and additionally in  
the middle of stairs wider than 6.00 m -7 **0.**  
Escalators provide extra comfort for passengers, and accelerate  
and canalise the traffic flow; they should be used for medium  
and high passenger numbers. 1-1 %-track, or preferably 2-track,  
escalators should be used \(800/1 000 mm step width\). Construction  
widths vary between 1.40 and 1.65 m, according to manufacturer.  
# Lifts  
Additional passenger lifts should be installed \(possibly as a refit\)  
in above-ground and underground railway stations to aid the  
journeys of disabled people and others with restricted mobility  
\(due to pushchairs, luggage etc.\) -7 **f\).** Lifts should be easily  
recognisable with waiting areas outside the main traffic flow.  
# Platform surfacing  
To improve drainage, this should have a camber of at least 1%  
\(max. 3-5% in tunnel stops and 2-3% in open-air stops\). Platform  
edges should be slip-resistant and made of profiled and clearly  
coloured material \(if appropriate with a broad white band\) to help  
those with poor eyesight. Contrasting guide strips, which can be  
felt with a white stick, should also be provided for visually impaired  
people. Working space for

section of curve must be installed between the straight section and  
the circular arc with radius R, with the curvature of the transition  
curve increasing constantly from 1\: = up to 1\: R \_\_. f\). Circular  
curves may have to be canted in order to keep the centrifugal  
force arising when travelling round the curve within reasonable  
bounds \(\~0.65 m/sec\). Canted curves and transition curves should  
coincide.

For entrance doorways the clear width should be \~3.35m and for  
new structures \~4.00 m.  
For tunnels, the extra clearance needed beyond the trains'  
kinematic envelope clearance to the wall for a single-track stretch  
of line is 0.40 m; for a double-track stretch of line it is 30 em.  
There are minimum distances required between buildings and  
railway tracks for new structures. These vary according to  
location. Typical examples are\: a fire resistant structure with  
suitable cladding must be separated by \~7.50 m from railway  
land; the corresponding distance for soft covered structures that  
are not fire resistant is \~15m. The latter also applies to structures  
in which combustible materials are stored.  
Platform heights vary from country to country, and can be as  
small as 0.38 m. However, access to platforms must not involve  
passengers having to cross the track. This requires tunnels  
or bridges, which should have a width of 2.5-4.0 m. If there is  
circulation in both directions, 4.00-8.00 m is desirable. Steps on  
bridges or in tunnels should be the same width as the bridge or  
tunnel. 1645

2 The kinematic envelope is the cross-sectional profile of a vehicle at any  
position along its length, enlarged to include the effects of dynamic sway  
and vertical movement caused by speed, \(dynamic effects of\) track  
cuiVature and cant, track positional tolerances, rail wear, rail head/wheel  
flange clearances, vehicle wear and suspension performance for the  
particular track location under consideration. The determination of the  
kinematic envelope is the responsibility of the operator of the proposed  
vehicle and shall be in accordance with the Railway Group Standard.

This information is based on the Railway Group Standard which  
applied to all new design and new route clearances for railway  
vehicles and loads from 3 February I 996.  
The purpose of this Railway Group Standard is to set down the  
engineering requirements for the safe passage of rail vehicles and  
their loads by reconciling their physical size and dynamic behaviour  
with the opportunities offered by the railway infrastructure.  
This standard applies to infrastructure owned by Network Rail  
and any other infrastructure interfacing with it and affecting its  
physical clearances \(e.g. private sidings or works into which, or  
out of which, trains will work onto Network Rail lines\).  
It shall be complied with in the design, maintenance and alteration  
of the railway infrastructure, in the design and modification of  
traction and rolling stock and in the conveyance of out of gauge  
loads.  
Standards are constantly evolving as faster trains are developed  
and heavier loads are transported. The national rail administration  
should, therefore, always be contacted for the latest standards  
and details.

This diagram illustrates minimum lateral and overhead  
clearances to be adopted in construction or  
reconstruction and for alterations or additions to  
existing track and structures for line speeds up to  
165km/h \(!OOmph\).  
All dimensions are in mm.  
\* The dimension to be used when line speed exceeds  
165 km/h \(100 mph\).  
The clearance dimensions given are valid for straight  
and level track only and due allowance must be made  
for the effects of horizontal and vertical curvature,  
including super-elevation \(cant\).  
The standard structure gauge allows for overhead  
electrification with voltages up to 25kV. However, to  
permit some flexibility in the design of overhead  
equipment, the minimum dimension between rail level  
and the underside of the structures should be  
increased, preferably to 4780mm or more if this can be  
achieved with reasonable economy. The proximity of  
track features such as level crossings or OHE  
sectioning may require greater than 4780mm.  
Permissible infringements in respect of conductor rail  
equipment, guard and check rails, train stops and  
structures in the space between adjacent tracks are not  
shown.

# RAILWAYS  
Freight Transport  
Today rail-borne freight transport is a part of international goods  
transport. In order to remain competitive with road transport,  
rationalised loading and unloading systems \(combined transport\)  
have been developed.  
# Loading ramps  
These can be head or side ramps situated in or next to stores  
or logistics warehouses. The length is approx. 700 m in order to  
load and unload entire trains. Clear opening width of entry doors  
\~3.35 m or for new buildings= 4.00 m. Inside buildings the railway  
structure gauge \(p. 408 --7 **0\)** and the clear profile and swept  
curves for HGV traffic \(p. 461 and p. 398\) should be considered.  
Loading ramps\: see also Supply and disposal \(pp. 461-462\).  
Side ramps, at which goods wagons are unloaded and loaded  
through outward-opening doors, may not be higher than 1.10 m.  
The height must not exceed 1.00 m if the outward-opening doors  
of passenger carriages may also have to be opened. Otherwise,  
side ramps for the loading and unloading of wagons may, except  
on main lines, be up to 1.20 m above the top of the rail. Details  
of safety distances \(for workplaces\) according to GUV-VD 30.1  
are also to be complied with. Storage and logistics warehouses  
should be designed for the goods to be handled. Goods are  
normally transported on pallets, as these are easier to load. For  
logistics reasons, Europool pallets \(abbreviated to **Europallet\)** are  
mostly used \(--7 p. 269\). They are standardised according to UIC  
Bulletin 435-2 of the International Union of Railways.  
# Combined transport  
Combined transport denotes the transport of the goods in one  
and the same transport unit \(exchangeable container, container,  
semi-trailer\) or it can be transported in the same road vehicle with  
one or more transport methods. Starting with shipping, containers  
have become universal for the transport of unit goods and are also  
increasingly used for bulk materials. They enable short handling  
times between the various means of transport on water, road  
and rail.  
The logistics centre is described as a combined or inter-modal  
transport terminal and is mostly part of a freight centre. Portal  
cranes stack the containers automatically for intermediate storage  
and load them onto other vehicles.  
# Containers  
Containers used for international transport are predominantly  
ISO containers with a width of 8ft \(2.44 m\) and a length of either  
20 ft \(6.06 m\) or 40ft \(12.19 m\), with the abbreviated descriptions\:  
TEU \(fwenty-foot Equivalent Unit\) and FEU \(Forty-foot Equivalent  
Unit\). Other lengths --7 **0.** Standard containers are 8 ft 6 in high  
\(2.59 m\), and 'High-Cube' \(also described as HQ 'High-Quantity'\)  
containers are 9 ft 6 in \(2.90 m\). The dimensions are chosen so  
that containers can also be transported in most countries by truck  
or rail. In European land traffic, containers with a width of 2.50 m  
or 2.55 m are used \(inland containers\). Containers are so robustly  
constructed that they can be stacked up nine high \(load-bearing  
capacity min. 4 fully loaded containers\).  
There are various special types of containers, like refrigerated  
containers for perishable freight, tank containers for liquid and  
gas loads, car containers for car transport and living containers  
for temporary accommodation. Another combined transport  
possibility is the loading of complete trucks or road trailers onto  
special wagons. This 'rolling road' or piggyback transport requires  
only a ramp at the end of the track, because the trucks can drive  
onto the train under their own power.

# RAILWAYS  
Stations  
Stations can be halts with a platform located next to a line without  
points, or stations with at least one point so the trains can bypass  
the station or turn. Stations are described according to the layout  
of the tracks and the location of the station building \(depot\).  
1. Through station \(most frequent layout, e.g. Cologne main  
station, Hannover main station\) *-1* **e.**  
2. Terminus \(e.g. Leipzig or Munich main stations\) *-1* **8.**  
3. Multi-level station \(e.g. OsnabrOck main station, Berlin main  
station\)  
4. Island station \(station building between the tracks, e.g. Halle/  
Saale main station\) *-1* **0.**  
The approach line to the station through the city can be at street  
level, on banks with roads passing underneath or in cuttings  
or tunnels with the streets passing over. The route alignment  
leads to the location of the station *-1* **0 - e.** with a low-level  
arrangement being the most acceptable variant for urban planning  
\(e.g. the design for Stuttgart 21, conversion of the terminus to  
an underground through station while still using the old station  
building\).  
Design basics  
The following principles apply to new building and also  
refurbishment \(in order according to importance\)\:  
1. Operational safety and accident prevention  
2. Feeling of security and well-being  
3. Simple orientation  
4. Simple building maintenance  
5. Brand recognition/formation  
6. Attractiveness of form  
Stations should be designed to achieve the shortest possible  
walking distances to other forms of transport. Urban rail and  
underground stations should be under the station building if  
possible. Local public transport should be available as near as  
possible to the platform. It should be possible to park long term  
and taxis and private cars should be able to draw up.  
The station building contains areas leased to external leaseholders  
\(normally shops or services\) in addition to the services operated by  
the railway company, like a TraveiCentre, a ServicePoint, waiting  
areas, a lounge \(at large stations\) and luggage storage.  
Pedestrian underpasses and bridges  
The minimum width of underpasses and bridges is 2.50 m. Larger  
widths should assume a multiple of the walking width of 0.80 m.  
The clearance height should be at least 2.50 m, but has to be only  
2.25 m under supplementary installations.  
Accessibility  
If more than 1000 passengers per day catch a train, then at least  
one barrier-free access \(i.e. convenient for disabled passengers\)  
should be provided. Ramps are always available and maintenance-  
free. Lifts should be pass-through \(Roll-On Roll-Off principle\)  
with glazed cabins. The minimum size is regulated by the state  
building regulations. It should also be possible to transport prams,  
pushchairs, luggage trolleys and cycles without problems. Access  
to the platform is permissible only along the platform with a  
1.5 m x 1.5 m waiting area in front of the lift.  
Tactile and colour-contrasted guide strips should be provided  
on the floor. On the platforms, these mark potentially dangerous  
areas. At stairs and ramp handrails, the platform numbering  
should be applied in Braille. **0** Station aisle, Hannover

# RAILWAYS  
Station Buildings  
Station buildings \(German Railways uses the term reception  
buildings\) serve to connect the railway network to other means of  
transport. The services offered in-house by the railway company  
are limited to essentials like sales of tickets and tours, information  
and taking care of luggage. Other services and shops are operated  
by leaseholders in the station area -----\> **0-e.**  
# TraveiCentre  
The TraveiCentre is for personal advice and the sale of tickets.  
The fitting out is modular on a metre grid, and the smallest unit, a  
counter, is 2 m x 3 m. The elements are delivered completely pre-  
installed. The adjustable legs enable adaptation of the installation  
and compensation for the height difference between the seated  
staff and the standing passengers. The system can be completed  
with various supplementary elements -----\> **e.**  
A sufficiently large area should be provided for waiting customers  
with a free space in front of the counter. If there is more than  
one counter, organise one centralised queue if possible. Ticket  
machines are also provided to relieve the workload at the  
counter-----\> **e.**  
# ServicePoint  
The ServicePoint is the central source of information between  
customer and service staff and is the direct point of contact for  
travellers. In order to cover the different requirements and local  
conditions, a product family has been developed with three basic  
types\:  
1. Singular type ServicePoint\: free-standing in the reception building,  
various sizes, modular, different layouts for 1---4 employees \(for  
two workplaces LWH\: 3.00 m x 5.00 m x 3.50 m\).  
2\. Integrated type ServicePoint\: within a fagade or inside the  
station building, adjacent to the TraveiCentre, for 1---4 employees  
\(LWH\: 2.00 m x 2.60 m x 3.10 m for one workplace, with each  
further workplace elongating the fixture by 1.70 m.\)  
3. Mobile type ServicePoint\: a rolling stand for flexible use in  
the station building and also on platforms, for one employee  
each \(LHB\: 0.90 m x 0.80 m x 2.30 m\). These sizes are at the  
design stage and could still alter.  
# Stairs  
The usable stair width should be a multiple of 80 em \(walking  
passage width\) but at least 2.40 m clear. The stair width can also  
be determined from the expected passenger numbers according  
to the formula\:

stairs should be 1.5 times the stair width. The first and last steps  
must, and all other steps should, be provided with a 6 em wide  
contrasting strip.  
# Escalators  
From a passenger density of more than 3000 people per hour or,  
with a difference in levels of 8 m, more than 500 people, escalators  
should be provided. The minimum width should be 1 m in order to  
be able to transport luggage trolleys -----\> p. 126 ff.

Platforms  
# Widths  
Platforms can be described, according to their location, as central  
platforms \(between two tracks\) or side platforms \(with only one  
platform edge\). The width of a platform is essentially derived from  
the number of passengers. The decisive factors are the waiting  
zone, the walking route width of 0.80 m and the width of the safety  
zone, which is determined from the permissible highest speed of  
trains passing through --7 **0.** The details of distances to the track  
bed always relate to the track centre-line.  
The minimum widths are\:  
Side platforms Central platforms = 2.50 m -1.65 m + 2 x 0.80 m = 2.45 m  
= 2 x \(2.50 m- 1.65 m\) + 2 x 0.80 m = 3.30 m  
# Platform heights and lengths  
The heights of platforms are related to the top of rail level.  
Common values are 76 em, for local transport also 55 em, and for  
urban rapid transit 96 em. Old platforms may still be 38 em high.  
The heights and lengths of platforms depend on the expected  
operational schedule --7 **f\).** These lengths can be extended to  
meet local requirements for signalling equipment.  
# Platform roofing  
Three standard types of platform roofing are available for selection  
according to the status of the station and cost of building.  
Systems which need only a short construction time in the danger  
zone and place less stringent requirements on their foundations  
\(frame construction on the table principle\) are good, because they  
disrupt scheduled services only for a short time. These closures  
have a high cost for safety staff, the securing of the overhead wire  
system and closing tracks.  
Roof construction is based on a multiple of the 30 em grid  
\(standard 9 m\) of the platform paving. The clear height should be  
min. 3.25 m in order that a free height of 2.50 m remains under  
the suspended information system. Attention should be paid  
to the necessary queuing and waiting areas and the specified  
distances to the track. The design of structures and of elements  
hanging from the roof construction needs to take into account the  
additional loading from buffeting by passing trains.

# RAILWAYS  
Platform Furniture  
The federal railway authority \(EBA\) is the approval body for  
structures built on areas dedicated to the railway. Small buildings  
under 100 m2 require no building permission. It is normally  
obligatory to select structural and fitting out elements from a  
listed product portfolio, which has been optimised and tested  
with regard to safety, maintenance expense and corporate  
design.  
Raster22®  
DB Station&Service AG has developed the product-independent  
Raster22 \(Grid22\) for weather protection systems, wall elements,  
display cases and seating furniture. This is a dimension and  
interface system \(90 and 150 em\) derived from the paving slab  
module of 30 em. 12.5 em construction space is provided for  
columns and connection elements, so that the remaining fields  
of 77.5 or 137.5 em can be filled with installed elements like wall  
panels or display cases. The dimensions of the display cases  
are derived from the maximum size of a CityLight poster of  
approx. 200 x 136 em. The vertical dimensions are taken from  
the grid dimension of the route guidance elements of 12.5 em.  
This grid system enables construction elements from various  
manufacturers to be combined and simplifies the design of  
connections and foundations. Two product families of seating  
furniture are available, a bench and an individual seat system.  
Various types of fixing and seating made of 4 mm wire \(weather-  
and vandalism-resistant\), or plywood rails for indoors, offer  
various possible uses.

# The aviation market  
The wave of privatisation in aviation \(airlines, airports, etc.\) has  
created a complex market with hard competition. The **passenger**  
**transport** segment \(business and holiday flights, either scheduled  
or charter\) is differentiated from the **air freight** sector, and each  
is split into the geographical segments Germany, Europe and  
outside Europe. Highly varied business strategies are pursued by  
the airlines with the main differences being **speed** \(flight times,  
flight durations, rapid transfers\) and price\~ **0.** For example, the  
**'Hub-and-Spoke'** model\: major 'international' airports \(hubs\) are  
connected by large planes and the spokes are represented by  
the regional connections to national airports. In order to reduce  
waiting time for transfers, flights are bundled at certain times of  
day into **'nodes'** \~ **0.**  
The **'cheap flight'** model\: these use low-cost airports \(few  
runways\) and cheap slots \(unfavourable flight times\) and are flown  
with medium-sized planes.  
The traditional income source for airports, their take-off and  
landing fees, are becoming ever less significant in contrast to  
rent received for commercial and office space at the airport. This  
development is having a great influence on modern airport design  
and architecture.  
ICAO Convention Aschaffenburg  
**The design basis for the construction and operation**  
**of airports is the provisions of annex 14, volume 1 of**  
the Convention of the International Civil Aviation  
Organisation \(ICAO\) as the basis for national laws.  
The International Civil Aviation Organisation \(ICAO\) is a  
specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for  
the planning of civil aviation. Over 180 countries belong  
to the ICAO. Germany is represented by a permanent  
delegation from the federal ministry of transport,  
building and housing. The tasks of the ICAO include the  
standardisation and safety of aviation, the development of  
**infrastructures and the production of recommendations and**  
guidelines. The ICAO also allots the ICAO codes.  
Public planning law Mlhl d t\~  
c.e;t 0  
\(National\) public planning law includes approval  
conditions for the construction of airports. This normally  
affects large-scale projects with regional significance, for  
which a regional planning procedure with additional

# Environmental aspects  
As part of the planning and approval process, the design of an  
airport has to consider many aspects of environmental protection  
\(environmental impact assessment, landscape impact and  
mitigation plan, etc.\). In addition to the transport connection, the  
noise nuisance from the airport is a central evaluation criterion,  
with corresponding thresholds. The area on the ground where the  
take-off or landing of a plane produces a certain level of noise  
specific to the plane is called the noise carpet.  
In addition, the daily operation of an airport is connected with  
a range of environmental problems. This particularly concerns  
**noise reduction** \(e.g. through night flying restrictions, noise-  
related fee structures, construction sound insulation measures\),  
**groundwater protection** \(e.g. through rainwater retention basins  
to control the surface water run-off from airside paving, sparing  
use of environmentally harmful chemicals \(de-icing agents for  
planes and runways\), **energy-** and **environmental management**  
and **waste management\).**

Categorisation of airfields  
The term airport, according to Aviation Law, is a general term for\:  
- airports \(with surrounding area subject to additional building  
regulations\)  
- airfields \(perhaps with a limited surrounding area subject to  
additional building regulations\)  
- glider airfields, heliports  
Airports and airfields are divided into transport and special  
airports and airfields, either accessible for every aviator or  
serving special purposes \(e.g. airfields belonging to companies  
or flying clubs\).

Runway system\: the number and arrangement \(spacing\) of the  
take-off and landing runways determines the possible number of  
movements per unit of time -7 p. 420.  
Terminal\: \(handling, check-in and customs building\) the capacity  
of the handling system for passengers and baggage or the freight  
flow per unit of time is determined by the following parameters\:  
connections to ground transport \(main line trains, urban rail, car  
parking, length of approach roads\); passenger handling \(number  
of check-in counters\); baggage handling \(number of counters and  
capacity of the transport system\); and the organisation of passport  
control, security controls, access controls before boarding \(size of  
waiting rooms, number of gates\) -7 p. 421.  
Apron\: the term apron includes parking ramps for planes with  
the associated taxiways, roads and parking areas for handling  
vehicles. The apron connects the runways and taxiway system  
with the terminal and is functionally closely related to it. Apron and  
terminal should be designed together -7 p. 422.  
Additional buildings\: various additional functions are essential for  
the operation of an airport, and have to be included in the overall  
layout\: administration, maintenance, fire service, airfreight, etc.  
Service areas\: \(non-aviation\) the strategic assignment of  
commercial and service areas \(hotels, restaurants, parking, shops,  
etc.\) to the actual functional areas of the airport is of increasing  
significance in the design of an airport -7 p. 421.  
Ground transport network\: the comfortable, reliable and  
punctual connection of an airport to the ground transport network  
\(inter-modality\) is of decisive importance for the functioning of an  
airport.

# AVIATION  
Runways  
Runways \(abbreviated RWY\) are for the acceleration of planes for  
take-off and for slowing after landing. The direction, length/width  
and number are determined by various factors\:  
The **direction** is determined by the local wind and topographical  
conditions. The intention should be that the airport can be flown  
into 95% of the time. A high frequency of strong crosswinds can  
make necessary a second runway for taking off and landing **--+f\),**  
The **number** depends on the traffic volume; a parallel arrangement  
with a spacing of more than 1310 m is beneficial to enable  
simultaneous taking off and landing, thus achieving full capacity  
# --+0.  
The **length/width** depends on the type of the aeroplane's design  
and the predominant local climatic and topographical conditions,  
like temperature, air pressure \(analogous to elevation\), terrain  
gradient etc. \(large airports have a runway of up to 4000 m length  
and 40-65 m width\). At both sides and as an extension of the  
runways, the Aviation Law prescribes **areas with additional**  
**building regulations--+ 0.** The aviation authority issues approvals  
for building projects in these areas. In addition, **obstruction**  
**limitation areas --+ 8** are specified, within which there are  
limitations to building structures.  
Runways are described according to their compass direction  
\(in tenths of a degree\), and if parallel with an additional R \(right\),  
L \(left\) or C \(centre\). Marking and lights code the individual sections,  
centre-line, width and load-bearing capacity of the runway. The  
taxiway systems of an airport are designed so that the runway can  
be cleared as fast as possible after landing \(quick exit taxiway\) and  
the take-off position can be reached as quickly as possible.

In the design of a terminal, complex technical and functional  
interactions \~ **0** \(separation of the public and the secure areas,  
organisation and dimensioning of the handling areas, movement  
and waiting zones, conveyor systems with multi-storey routes\)  
have to be balanced with many other prerequisites. The size and  
variety of requirements give the design some of the character of  
town planning.  
Handling  
Handling of passenger traffic covers all customer contact and  
services, from checking in through security controls until boarding  
the plane. Handling is performed in specified stages \~ **0** and is  
undertaken by the airline itself or by an outside company acting  
as handling agent. The principle of handling is to make sure that  
no unchecked passenger or unchecked piece of baggage can  
gain access to a plane and that there is no contact between  
checked and unchecked passengers.  
A further important principle is the separation of national and  
international \(or 'Schengen'/'non-Schengen'\) passengers. The  
increasing variety of security levels \(various source and destination  
countries and the transit traffic of passengers within an airport\)  
leads to a multitude of parallel routes and security controls with  
corresponding lobbies \(and waiting times\). The handling and  
transit speed is an important factor in the success of an airport in  
international competition and the routes should therefore be quick  
and short.  
Non-aviation  
Non-aviation includes all commercial activities at the airport which  
are not directly associated with flying \(hotels, congress centres,  
shopping, restaurants, etc.\). The turnovers in the non-aviation  
sector at major airports are larger than charges for taking off and  
landing. The organisation of a terminal therefore has to balance  
functional procedures \(short routes and transfer times\) against  
strategically positioned service and shopping areas, as well as,  
to an increasing degree, hotels, congress centres and other  
secondary facilities.

Terminal concepts  
Terminals differ according to the arrangement of the gates,  
their linking to each other and to the building. In addition to the  
capacity and the areas required, the possibility of extension  
is an important factor in the selection of a terminal concept.  
Modular concepts have become increasingly common in airport  
design in recent years\: linear concepts with satellites are usual,  
which means that a linear main terminal building is connected  
underground or over bridges to satellite units that are also linear  
---7 **f\).** Access from the building into the planes is normally direct  
along jet bridges \(passenger boarding bridges\) ---7 **0.**  
A cheaper but lower capacity variant \(waiting areas\) is offered by  
transporter concepts ---7 **e.** where the passengers are indirectly  
transported from building to plane on buses. There are also pier  
concepts with central reception buildings ---7 **G.** When there are  
two or more piers, however, sufficient room must be provided in-  
between for at least two planes to taxi in and out, which leads to  
corresponding distances.

Apron  
The apron provides parking spaces for the planes and the  
associated movement areas \(apron taxiways\), roads for handling  
vehicle traffic and parking areas for handling vehicles. The  
assignment and dimensioning of operational roads on the apron  
is of great significance for efficient and safer running of the  
airport. Roads on the apron enable direct and safer connection  
between the apron and other operating areas of the airport and  
there should be a minimum of crossings with taxiing planes or  
other operational functions. Apron roads can be run in front of or  
behind the planes or next to the ends of the tarmac. If they pass  
under loading bridges, this imposes a certain clearance profile on  
all handling vehicles. As a result of the extensive mechanisation  
and containerisation in aeroplane handling, sufficient space must  
be provided for handling vehicles and machinery.

# CEMETERIES  
Mortuary and Crematorium  
**Urns** are containers for the ashes resulting from the cremation of  
a body. Their dimensions are normally restricted by cemetery rules  
-\) **0.** Wall compartments in urn halls \(columbariums\) are mostly  
38-40 em wide and 50-60 em high.  
**Coffins** are sized to suit the deceased person. The laying out of  
the dead takes place in compartments \(or cells\) in the **mortuary,**  
which are separated from each other by lightweight half-height  
walls \(composed of sheet metal or plants\) -\) **e.**  
In larger facilities, the **compartment passage** for coffin bearers  
is separated from the **viewing passage** for mourners -\) **e.** who  
can see the body through airtight panes until the burial/cremation  
ceremony. Projecting pillars between the cells avoid the mourners  
disturbing each other as far as possible -\) **e.** Newer facilities,  
however, often have no special passage for mourners, as shown  
in -\) **0** without side passage. **Compartments\:** usual dimensions  
2.2 X 3.5; 2.5 X 3.75; 3.0 X 3.5 m.  
**Mortuary\:** a room where the deceased person is placed until  
the funeral, situated either at the entrance or in the middle of  
the cemetery with a passage \(3.5-4.0 m wide\) for hearses. The  
temperature in a **mortuary** should be ;\:;;2oc to \~12°C. Central  
heating and cooling must be provided to maintain this temperature,  
above all in summer, with constant ventilation. The floor of the  
mortuary must be impervious, smooth and easy to clean, and the  
simplest wall finish is lime wash, which has to be renewed often.  
Larger mortuaries also require\: one room for attendants and coffin  
bearers of 15-20 m2 with toilet and washroom.  
A location should be provided for the bier \(size 2.20 x 1.08 to 3.0 x  
1.1 m\).  
**Crematorium\:** facility for cremating bodies into ashes; example  
-\) p. 426 **f\)** In the **incineration room,** the coffin is taken from  
the transport trolley and placed on the carriage, which carries  
the coffin onto the fireclay grating in the oven. The **combustion**  
**chamber** is either in the basement with the coffin being lowered  
in -\) **0,** or behind the assembly room and separated from it by a  
lobby -\) **0** -  
\~; and -\) p. 426 **0.**  
Transport on the level is most simply provided by manual winches,  
but the lift is better hydraulically driven. The doors to the lobby or  
the floor opening then close slowly as the coffin disappears into  
the lobby or the basement.  
The **cremation** is performed by special ovens fuelled by coke,  
gas or electricity \(consumption about 45 kW for each cremation;  
height of the two-storey oven 4.3 m\) with no production of dust  
or odour through 900-1 oooo dry air, so that the flames do not  
touch the body. The oven is heated 2-3 hours in advance and  
the cremation itself lasts 11.4-1% hours. The ashes are collected  
in a steel box for preservation in the urn. Viewing apertures are  
provided for monitoring the cremation.  
The facilities described above are ideally situated behind the  
crematorium **chapel.** The size of the chapel varies; typical might  
be \~1 00 seats and 100 standing places, also 1-2 rooms for  
the mourners \(which may be additional to the chapel\) and other  
ancillary rooms -\) \~. It serves all denominations \(and so requires  
two rooms for clergymen\).  
The **administration offices** should be relatively near\: one room  
for the board, 2-3 offices, coffin store, stoker etc. Behind that,  
a gardener's area with greenhouse, room for the gardener and  
possibly garden architect, social rooms for employees, equipment  
room, seed room, WC etc. JD \~DOD JD\~DDC

LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE  
Design Aspects and Concepts  
The term landscape design covers two apparently contradictory  
elements. Landscape is traditionally thought to refer to undisturbed  
natural landscapes, and design is evidently artificial. But we must  
recognise that untouched landscapes are almost absent from  
large parts of the world, or exist only as a temporarily abandoned  
terrain subject solely to sporadic attacks.  
Built and unbuilt land are today strongly related in a dialectic  
relationship \(we refer to urban landscapes\). This has also generated  
a spatial way of thinking in landscape design, comparable with  
architectural or town planning design processes.  
Aesthetic landscape compositions are no longer based on  
classical garden designs or providing greenery around the  
building as a decorative accessory -they are congenial solutions  
for a space, which form an inseparable unit with buildings or town  
planning. So it is evident that landscape architects are integrated  
into the project team right from the start, like structural or services  
engineers.  
The foundations are\:  
Horizontal aspects  
The general structuring of outdoor areas in context with the  
surroundings is regarded as a horizontal aspect. This is a  
fundamental organisation following considerations like idea,  
function, design and form. It can produce horizontal results  
\(paving, lawns etc.\) and also vertical \(buildings, trees, pergolas  
etc.\).  
According to concept, items can be related to each other, repeated  
or contrasted; or a number of items can be superimposed. Open  
areas can, for example, continue themes or materials from  
buildings or provide a contrast. The ideal is to produce a central  
theme without functional limitations and then develop a design to  
make it readable.  
Vertical aspects  
Vertical aspects of concepts for outdoor areas derive from the  
fundamental horizontal aspects and substantiate them. Not only  
is the selection of materials important but also the spatial contexts  
of the immediate surroundings. If there is a dip or a rise in the field  
of view, this lends the space to different interpretations.  
On the peak of a rise or in an open area, a roof, object or  
shelter can offer an impression of spatial definition. In street  
environments, trees can reduce the proportions of high buildings  
to a human scale and create small spaces within large. Vertical  
aspects, whether built or planted, should be to a sensible scale  
and integrate seamlessly into the overall concept of landscape  
architecture.  
Form of illustration  
The decision how to illustrate with plans or drawings depends  
greatly on the stage of the project work. In the preliminary design  
and actual design phases, hand sketches and drawings can even  
today still contribute to a project's presentation. At these stages,  
forms of illustration have a great significance. Quick 20 or 30  
sketches can be a great help in explaining open areas at meetings  
with the client.  
In the phases of detailed design and the production of working  
drawings, the functional depiction of structures and objects is  
more important.  
The type of illustration will be aligned with the design concept. A  
minimalist design will not, for example, include playful depictions  
of trees and vice versa. This enables the consideration of the  
'world' in the design with few limitations. Pictures associated  
with individual components of the design can be selected and  
presented to supplement the ideas behind it.

# EARTHWORKS  
Soil  
**Design of earthworks**  
Modelled areas of ground are generally perceived as pleasant and  
interesting and can have a strong effect on the perception of a  
space. The human eye looks for viewpoints and fixed objects in  
an open area. An example of this is the common hilly landscape  
with meadows, farmland and isolated trees in open man-made  
countryside. This impression can be achieved with intentionally  
designed terrain modelling as an addition to vertical structures or  
plants.  
Homogeneously occupied areas \(lawns, ground-cover planting  
of uniform height, paving\), with sunken centres in particular,  
make spaces seem larger. Wavy or hilly ground modelling can  
also enlarge the impression of space. According to the situation,  
this can enable economic synergies to be gained through the  
management of earth quantities.  
# Definition of soil  
Soil is the outermost layer of the earth's crust and is largely  
formed by organisms. Soil can be generally categorised into  
**subsoil** and **topsoil.** While topsoil is often dark-coloured and  
bustling with life and roots, subsoil is often lighter-coloured and  
rather less weathered, with few living things and roots. The topsoil  
extends downwards as far as signs are discernible of living things,  
weathering or roots, often down to solid rock.  
A classification of soil can be found in ---7 **0.** Soil types can be  
roughly identified by appearance, smell and rolling in the fingers.  
**Preservation of topsoil**  
This is ensured on building sites by temporary storage in stockpiles  
---7 **0.** If these are not in the shade, the tops should be covered  
\(with turf, straw etc.\) to prevent excessive drying out. If the storage  
is to last longer, green manure plants may be planted. Topsoil piles  
should be turned over at least once a year with the addition of  
0.5 kg of quicklime per m3  
•  
Filling has to be **compacted,** if garden structure, lawn or planting  
work is to be carried out \(particularly important for the construction  
of paths and paving\).  
1. Driving over with construction machinery \(bulldozer\) will mostly  
compact filling sufficiently.  
2. Sluice only good filling material such as sand and gravel.  
3. Cohesive material should be rolled in layers of 30-40 em,  
always from outside to inside, i.e. from the slope into the  
middle of the filling area. Gravel also has to be rolled to  
construct paths.  
4. Stamping or ramming is possible for all stable soil types.  
5. Only loose, non-cohesive soils can be vibrated for compaction.  
All compaction work should take account of the later use. For  
paths and paving, the soil has to be compacted fully but lawns  
require 1 0 em, and areas for planting 40 em, of loose soil at the  
surface.  
# Slope protection  
To avoid erosion, slips, wind erosion etc. Generally, the most  
stable slopes for all bulk materials are achieved by filling in layers.  
Profiling of the layer beneath ---7 **8** serrates the loose filling material  
into the subsoil and prevents the formation of slip planes.  
In the case of higher banks with steeper slopes, the formation  
of steps ---7 **0** provides security against slipping \(step width  
\~50 em\). If the steps are inclined into the slope, then a  
longitudinal gradient should be provided to permit the drainage  
of collecting water. Feature **Reference guideline**

# EARTHWORKS  
Soil  
# Soil formation  
Soil formation is achieved by the excavation of topsoil and removal  
of obstructions. It should ensure the following\:  
1. Correct profile \(short and long term\)  
2. Water run-off  
3. Degree of compaction  
4. Load-bearing capacity and suitability for transporting  
With earth structures the soil formation must comply with certain  
requirements --7 **0.** which should be checked in each individual  
case. Soil in these areas also has to comply with various degrees  
of compaction according to use.  
The individual degrees of compaction are, for example, evaluated  
with the deformation modulus EV 2 --7 **f\)** and differ above all in  
the existing subsoil conditions and the planned pavement loading.  
When a formation for earth structures or. roads is described,  
a differentiation is normally made between coarse and fine soil  
formation for vegetation areas. For sport grass areas, this fine  
formation can even demand a precision of max. 30 mm on a 4 m  
straight edge.  
# Soil loosening  
According to the nature of the subsoil, it can often be subjected  
to unintended further compaction during and after various  
construction activities on the site. In particular driving on wet soil  
has a negative influence on the soil structure. In over-compacted  
soil, roots remain small and flat. The compacted soil is also  
particularly susceptible to damage from drying and waterlogging.  
Soil is loosened in landscape construction by digging over  
30-40 em deep, or through the use of a pick or machines for  
loosening. Care should be taken not to cause further compaction  
with the necessary machines.  
The best-known machines are the subsoil grubber, reversible  
share grubber and plough. Rotary tillers, which are often also  
used, should not be employed too often or too intensively as they  
destroy the soil's crumbly structure and create a soil that can no  
longer absorb and store water and has to be replaced.  
# Soil improvement  
Soil improvement denotes processes to improve the properties of  
the soil for planting as quickly as possible and improve unsuitable  
sandy or clay soils through the appropriate measures. The risk of  
damage due to drought \(sandy soils\) or waterlogging \(clay soils\)  
is reduced if soil containing loam or clay is mixed into sandy soils,  
or sand is mixed into clay soils. Soil improvement using peat or  
dung is possible but either not readily available or too expensive.  
At the moment, well-rotted organic compost from organic waste  
is recommended for the improvement of all growing soils. The  
normal treatment is about 1 0 litres per m2 of organic compost  
with the RAL \(German quality assurance\) mark. This means a layer  
1.0-2.0 em thick.  
This compost is worked flat into the soil, not deeper than 20  
em. This improves the soil structure significantly and works in  
enough nutrients to start the growth of all plants, meaning that  
no additional mineral fertiliser is required at the start of planting.  
Soil improvement or soil consolidation is also carried out to improve  
load-bearing subsoils. This is often done through the addition of  
binder. Firstly, the deficiency of the soil in the relevant property  
should be determined in light of the intended improvement \(to  
provide a temporary road etc.\). The individual processes are  
shown in --7 **8.** The term 'soil treatment' is often used in Germany  
but internationally this is described as 'soil stabilisation'.

GARDEN ENCLOSURES  
Walls and Fences  
Design aspects of walls and fences  
During the planning stage it should generally be noted that  
walls and fences form vertical optical barriers. This should be  
used intentionally to create spaces or particular views \(visual  
domains\). Individual spaces can be created out of large areas  
either geometrically or also organically. The selection of materials  
should consider the overall design concept. For example, paving  
can be of materials \(natural stone, brick etc.\) that 'grow out of'  
their original location, and can be continued into walls to create  
a tranquil and homogeneous effect. Walls and fencing offer a  
multitude of design forms and types.  
Fences are normally made of wood or metal. Wooden fencing is  
generally cheaper but not so durable.  
Wooden fences are normally used in rural areas or for special  
requirements \(animal pounds etc.\). Functional enclosures, like  
fencing to keep out wild animals, can also be integrated into  
hedges \~ \~- Wooden posts should always be well protected  
against soil moisture if at all possible \~ 0.  
Metal fences can offer a high-quality and durable appearance.  
Industrially manufactured metal fencing with panels of wire  
mesh or metal rods \~ G\) are a compromise between cost and  
usefulness and are available in builder's merchants or DIY shops.  
Metal mesh or grilles are more stable than wire mesh fences and  
can be used to meet security requirements. The spacing of the  
bars is normally varied with height\~ G\).  
High-quality metal fences require design work in advance, and are then  
made up by a smith/metalworker. The design should include criteria  
like overall appearance, suitability of the various parts for processing  
\(galvanising, coating\) and function. Corrosion-protected metal fences  
can be concreted into the ground without further treatment.  
The rights of neighbours/duty to enclose  
Regulations about the distance of walls and fences from  
boundaries are laid down in the Law on the Rights of Neighbours  
and the individual state building regulations. The normal situation  
is that every house owner has to fence the right-hand side of their  
boundary as seen from the road. The joint back is to be fenced  
communally, i.e. the costs of minimal fencing \(wire mesh fence,  
height = 1.25 m\) are to be shared. If a house owner has a sole  
duty of enclosure, then they must bear the cost of fencing alone  
and the fencing must stand on their own property. If the enclosure  
duty is shared, then the barrier must be centred on the boundary.  
There is a general duty of enclosure when it is usual in the location.  
Exceptions are regulated in the law mentioned above. Walls and  
retaining walls \(including enclosures\) do not require, for example,  
according to the building regulations in Berlin, building permission  
unless they exceed 2.0 m in height.  
Under English law, ownership of, and responsibility for, walls and  
fences etc. are specified in the deeds of the property.

# GARDEN ENCLOSURES  
Walls and Fences  
**Walls** are differentiated into retaining walls and freestanding  
walls. The particular feature of retaining walls is the earth filling to  
one side ----\> **0** so the effects of moisture and the longevity of the  
materials have to be taken into account.  
**Retaining walls** can be self-supporting ----\> **Cli\),** of concrete with  
facing brick or of dry stone ----\> **e.**  
The simplest form of retaining wall is the angled pre-cast concrete  
wall ----\> **\(f\)** - \$. These walls are structurally reinforced and are  
available in the trade from a height of 55 em. They have the  
advantage of a pre-defined structural design according to loading  
case. **Freestanding walls** are only subject to damp from the soil  
through the foundations and are therefore less problematic in the  
choice of materials. The selection of materials and dimensions of  
the bricks or blocks is important to enable a face on both sides.  
The appearance of the face of walls is very varied according to  
material ----\> **0 -f\)** and depends on the possibilities offered by the  
material \(brick, natural stone, broken stone etc.\). ·  
Walls over 1 m high should generally be structurally calculated.  
There are guidelines and standards for each type of masonry  
\(brick, stone etc.\). The effect of the pointing on the material  
should be investigated because otherwise there is a danger of  
efflorescence.  
In order to protect the masonry from damp from above, a coping  
should be provided ----\> **e - e.**  
# Copings  
The tops of walls must be protected against rain and snow by  
covering them with large slabs or stones. The coping element  
should have a cross-fall of at least 0.5%. Longitudinal joints in the  
coping are not allowed and butt joints must be at right angles to  
the wall centre-line. A drip mould should be provided min. 3 em  
outside the face of the wall ----\> **e** in order to keep vertically falling  
water off the face. For natural stone walls, copings of the same  
material can be used. Nailed zinc or aluminium coverings are also  
suitable----\> **e.**

PERGOLA AND TRELLIS  
Pergolas  
Design aspects of pergolas and trellises  
In addition to the selection of a material for the planned pergola, its  
position within the outdoor area needs to be considered carefully.  
Large pergolas form spaces almost like buildings, and should be  
justified by their function or particular aesthetic value. Pergolas can  
lead to special places or viewpoints \(linear arrangement\), and can be  
used to divide spaces and/or as a sitting area \(point arrangement\).  
Pergolas with climbing plants should be detailed in accordance  
with the particular characteristics of the intended plant \(spacing of  
supports for climbing or winding plants\).  
A pergola is a room-forming row of columns or pillars. The verticals  
can be masonry pillars\~ **0** or simple timber\~ **f\).** If timber uprights  
are used, they should be protected against damp from the ground  
\~ **0 + f\).** The construction generally appears lighter if the overhead  
construction is thinner or lighter than the verticals. It should be  
clarified in advance whether climbing plants are to be integrated.  
Trellises are supports for climbing plants and can also be used  
as a visual barrier.  
Espalier-trained fruit trees are classically grown against fagades.  
The supports are mostly made of wood \~ 8 - **0,** 4li\) - \(9.  
When designing support systems for climbing plants, attention  
should be paid to the growth height of the intended climbers,  
as the uppermost wire may, for example, not be reached by the  
plants. It is generally advisable to consider the architectural effect  
of the fagade without plants. The basic decision is between linear  
and full-area growth according to local conditions.

# PERGOLA AND TRELLIS  
Trellises  
**Trellises or other support systems for climbing plants** can be  
used for the decoration of walls or also in the vegetable garden  
\(where it is important to keep the plants within reach for picking\).  
Various methods have proved successful ---\> **0 -f\).**  
Fan and espalier training of fruit trees ---\> **8 - Cl\)** is found in  
farm gardens or, more often, in private fruit and vegetable  
plots. In commercial fruit plantations, trees are planted in  
patterns---\> **4l!\>- 0** to optimise economic success.  
**Green walls,** formed of plants that cannot support themselves,  
require climbing aids. Such support systems are made of wood for  
small areas but larger areas, above all at heights, use metal wires  
---\> **0.** The spacing of the wires should be suited to the intended  
plant. In addition to the growth height, the type of plant \(with  
tendrils, winding etc.\) should be investigated.  
Growth heights of 2-20 m are possible. Some plants, especially  
twining and winding plants such as Celastrus \(staff vine\), can  
squeeze and damage trees or downpipes.  
The spacing of the horizontal wires should be between 20 and  
max. 50 em according to species. Spanned wires should be  
plastic-coated to protect the plants from frost damage.  
The greening of walls can sometimes have legal significance\: for  
example, fire walls require special permission and should generally  
not be planted as this could spread a fire. The greening of a wall  
should generally be agreed with the owner. If, for example, the  
neighbour's wall is to be greened, this should be agreed in a  
contract.  
Supports for climbing plants are generally excepted from approval  
procedures. The relevant building regulations should be complied  
with, and listed building regulations or local regulations concerning  
the appearance of buildings may also be applicable.

PATHS, PAVING, STEPS  
Design Aspects  
For the design of paths and paved areas, questions of proportion  
are important and the selection of materials is decisive. Firstly,  
the correct dimensions for path width, free paved areas and  
enclosed spaces need to be determined according to the use  
and surroundings. The human being should always determine the  
scale.  
Then the colour and type of paving material should be chosen in  
connection with the overall design, and the surrounding buildings  
or roads. Light-coloured, large-format paving appears generous.  
With special edging or structuring, segments can have the effect  
of rooms. The general rule is to make a function or use easily read  
from path widening or paved areas.  
Paved areas in gardens can be surfaced with the most varied  
materials. Areas to be driven on are normally paved with asphalt,  
concrete, or concrete or stone paving. A surface for vehicles \(e.g.  
fire service access\) can be created by rolling broken stone and  
permitting grass to grow on it. For less frequently driven areas,  
paving slabs, waterbound macadam or timber paving can also  
be used. Road building is subject to specialist regulations, which  
define the surfacing in accordance with local ground conditions.  
In principle, this can be with binder \(special construction\), without  
binder or waterbound \(standard construction\). Waterbound  
construction --7 **0 - 0** should be carried out with entirely  
permeable layers including open joints.  
Roads with heavier traffic should be constructed with a hard edge  
to act as an abutment --7 **0-0.** Clear areas where no vehicles can  
gain access can be covered loosely --7 **0 - 0** or with concreted  
back supports. The technical regulations concerning sufficient  
camber --7 **0- 8** should be complied with. There should always  
be a fall away from buildings\: in public areas, a minimum fall of  
2.5% is required. The various laying patterns --7 CJi\) + G\> should  
always be suited to the material being used.  
For all paving, the surface treatment is important for the function  
and design. For natural stone, flamed, consolidated, sawn,  
sandblasted or split surfaces are usual. The slip-resistance of  
paved surfaces in external works is important.  
Design aspects of steps  
Steps overcome height differences\: they are therefore always  
significant as a vertical design aspect and require detailed  
matching to the overall theme. Flat and wide steps with low risers  
appear softer, more spacious and stronger in design. The steeper  
and narrower the steps, the more functional the impression.  
In addition to the dimensions of the steps, the material and colour  
should also be selected in harmony with the external works design.  
The possibilities range from expensive natural stone materials with  
high-quality processing to simple timber steps in woodland. The  
other important accessories to steps, like handrails, should also  
be well matched to the design in order to present the end result  
as a homogeneous finished product. One good idea is to continue  
the paving leading to and from the steps like a carpet in the  
form of similar steps. The cheeks of the steps should always be  
considered with the proportions and function of the overall work  
Steps should always be laid out according to the step length  
rule \(2 x h + b 365\). Steps have a fall to the front --7 41\} in order  
to prevent ice formation. According to the size of the steps,  
additional measures can be necessary to secure the foundations  
--7 0-41\}. Handrails should normally be provided if there are more  
than three steps \(the exact details are given in the state building  
regulations\). It can be sensible to have ramps integrated into  
the steps, particularly at house entrances and access routes to  
bicycle storage --7 **Ci\).**

Rainwater Management  
# Design for drainage  
Normal drainage installations like box gutters or floor gullies  
allow room for design in their material \(metal, cast iron\) and form  
\(grating, slot gutter etc.\), and the effect of these choices should not  
be underestimated. Above all the positioning should be planned  
exactly, e.g. fitting into the pattern of slabs.  
Complete system solutions \(rainwater management\) can be  
implemented as a design idea. Modelled landscape with integrated  
percolation basins or rain gardens, where water collects in a dip  
and soaks away, water areas to accept the drainage and ditches  
with corresponding planting can all enable nature-like or more  
formal design. The topography of the terrain should be closely  
considered. Attractive water landscapes can be combined with  
the necessary provision of drainage functions. Technical facilities  
like French drains, cisterns etc. should be kept in the background  
if feasible.  
**Rainwater management** is urgently suggested for ecological  
and economic reasons in order to preserve the natural rainwater  
cycle as far as possible. Optimised rainwater management means  
that no rainwater drains into the sewers. The basic principle of  
rainwater management is to avoid, reduce or at least greatly delay  
surface water running off into the drains where it arrives or in  
the immediate vicinity. The following measures can contribute to  
this\: soakaways, permeable paving, rainwater exploitation \(water  
harvesting\) and roof planting  
**Drainage** is generally differentiated into linear or point drainage.  
Depending on the surfacing, surface falls should be provided to  
drain surface water appropriately at all times of year. It should be  
ensured that no surface water is drained to susceptible structures,  
buildings or onto neighbouring properties. The precipitation is  
collected in gutters or gullies and then mostly run into gully traps  
in the underground drainage pipes or to soak away in infiltration  
facilities. The hydraulic capacity of the inlets and thus the  
collected area should be calculated according to Guidelines for  
Street Layout- Drainage \(RAS-EW\). The approximate rule is\:

**Infiltration measures** \(surface infiltration or rain gardens, French  
drains\). In addition to underground drainage, water can also  
be removed by surface drainage through terrain modelling and  
infiltration. Either constructional features \(French drains, infiltration  
in dips in the ground, infiltration trenches\) or grass areas with topsoil  
covering \(rain gardens\) are used. The first step is to determine the  
soil composition and the infiltration capacity of the ground \(kf  
value\) in connection with the local precipitation. The guideline is

The pyramid is the basic 'Christmas

goblet shape because the branches are  
kept very short and thus less likely to

VEGETATION  
Plants  
Design with vegetation  
Design with vegetation, which includes plants, trees, bushes,  
grasses and lawn or meadow plants, is extremely varied.  
Nonetheless, all landscape design should place the complete  
concept before the plant selection. Modern landscape architecture  
understands itself as an open-air architecture, into which the  
plants have to integrate as an important part of the overall design  
scheme. Horizontal and vertical spatial characteristics \(trees,  
shrubs etc. in height and form\) play an important role before the  
selection of plant genus, species or type.  
Once the spatial units have been decided, the exact choice of  
plants can be made according to aspects like growth form, leaf  
form and colour, blossom colour and date, autumn colour and  
suitability for the location \(soil, light\). Economic considerations  
concerning care and maintenance also have to be included. The  
selection of the correct planting is an elementary part of good  
landscape design, with the stimulus and challenge that this  
element always changes with the time of year and with successive  
years.  
Plants  
Under the general terms perennial herbs, grasses, ferns, geophytes  
\{bulb plants\) and woody plants, there are countless varieties of  
plants. In general, the botanical names are used to name plants  
and these are normally derived from Latin and Greek. The botanical  
name is composed of plant family, genus, species and variety  
\(e.g. family Araliaceae\: *Hedera helix* 'Arborescens'- common ivy\).  
Together with the quality grading by the Association of German  
Tree Nurseries \{BdB\) of the plants and their abbreviations, the  
countless varieties can be exactly named and ordered. Particular  
forms of growth \{hanging - pendula or column-shaped- fastigiata\)  
can often be understood from these names.  
Plant quantities differ greatly depending on the plant family,  
genus and species. Different plant spacings apply for productive  
plants *-7* f\) - 0 than for general landscaping. Overall, the  
objective \{fast growth of the plant\) should be observed. Perennials  
and small ground-cover plants are planted at 6-12 plants/m2  
,  
solitary wood plants at 0.5-2 plants/m2 and a single-row hedge is  
usually planted with 3-5 plants/running metre.  
When plants are delivered, attention should be paid to permitting  
only a short time span between the. uprooting at the nursery and  
planting. Storage should not exceed 48 hours. Delivery includes  
all ATV requirements and also planting. If intermediate storage is  
unavoidable, then the plants should be protected against drying  
out, overheating and frost. Some possible measures are stacking  
them roots to roots, spraying with water and covering the roots  
with soil or tarpaulins. A storage place out of the wind and the sun  
is best. They should be wrapped up only if there is no chance of  
early planting.  
The best planting time is generally the autumn and early part  
of the year; for fruit trees late autumn. In landscapes with early  
frosts, planting can be as late as October, or in mild regions until  
November.

Plants and Lawns  
**Planting** is regulated in detail in the relevant standard. Planting holes  
should be dug with a width of 1.5 times the root ball. The topsoil  
should be separated while digging and replaced at the top again after  
planting. Trees and larger bushes should be protected against wind  
damage after planting, for example by **staking---; f\)- 0.** The stakes  
should be outside the root ball if possible and always set against  
the prevailing wind direction. Debarked, round stakes are usual.  
Plants are removed from pots or small containers \(for perennials and  
ground-cover plants\) and put directly into the ground with a planting  
spade. Planting methods *vary* according to type of plant.  
**Distances of plants from boundaries** of neighbouring properties,  
as given by the Law on the Rights of Neighbours, are to be  
complied with. Hedges up to a height of 2.0 m should be planted at  
a distance of 0.50 m, or if over 2.0 m in height at 1.0 m, measured  
from the side surface, small trees at a distance of 1.50 m and large  
trees at 3.0 m. \(measured from the centre of the trunk\). There are  
exceptions and special rules for particular types of neighbouring  
areas \(public roads, woodland etc.\).  
For gardening professionals, the **care of plants** counts contractually  
as extra work. Woody plants are normally acceptable when they show  
signs of new shoots in the last third of June, and for perennials when  
they have sprouted, budded or produced roots. Area \(ground-cover\)  
planting is acceptable when no more than 5% of the plants have died  
but there is a continuous appearance despite this. Annual and biennial  
flowers, flower bulbs and tubers, and all other plants are acceptable  
immediately after planting unless additional care has been agreed.  
In addition to the sowing of lawns, expensive turf lawns \(thin-cut  
lawn mats\) can also be used. For lawn areas, a fertile soil layer  
of at least 10 em should be prepared. Grass generally grows at  
temperatures above approx. soc and stops growing at approx.  
30°C. A newly sown lawn can be used after about six weeks.  
A **selection of sowing types** and sowing quantities \(lawn for  
walking, playing, meadow etc.\) is given **in** RSM \(Standardised  
Seed Mixtures\) 2008 from the FLL series.  
The **care of lawns** counts contractually as extra work. Sowing  
work is acceptable when a cover of approx. 75% is reached.  
Landscape grass areas are acceptable with a projective ground  
cover of approx. 50%. Turf and rolled lawns are acceptable when  
the growth of roots into the soil is recognisable.

# BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING  
Supporting Slopes and Riverbanks  
**Design in the application of biological engineering**  
Biological measures in engineering are mostly biologically  
oriented answers to construction requirements, like the support  
of slopes or riverbanks. They are therefore to be seen as part of  
the overall planning and to be designed accordingly. It should be  
clarified whether such measures should be intentionally visible or  
concealed as far as possible.  
Experience of the application of biological measures can enable  
banks and slopes, which otherwise would have required retaining  
walls, to be part of the vegetative scene. The overall design idea  
and the corresponding choice of materials should always influence  
the implementation of the functional necessities.  
The use of biological solutions to support slopes can be divided  
into the support of slopes and of riverbanks.  
# Supporting slopes  
It is necessary to support steep slopes, but the ideal is to create  
slopes with rounded transitions to flat terrain and planted with  
grass, perennials or trees.  
When slopes are designed steeper than the natural angle of  
repose, they should be supported with turf, fascines, paving or  
masonry. At a slope greater than **1** \:2, turfs should be nailed with  
timber pegs. Turfs can also be stacked to hold up steeper slopes  
with inclinations of **1** \:1.5 to 1 \:0.5.  
Fascines \(bundles of sticks\) are suitable for supporting steep  
slopes where plant cover would become established only with  
difficulty. They can be living or dead. The latter \(willow stakes  
hammered in\) require subsequent planting with deciduous woody  
plants.  
To support large cuttings, as in road building or properties on a  
slope, elaborate measures are necessary **"""""'0- e.**  
Anchored beam grillages are of various types, e.g. consisting of  
horizontal, pre-anchored beams with standing posts. The panels

# Supporting riverbanks  
While, in the design of slope support, earth pressure and gravity  
are the forces to be considered, the design of riverbank support  
also has to take into account the effect of water and wave impact.  
The optimal riverbank protection is a natural vegetation profile  
next to the flowing water \~ **4!!\)** and healthy root systems prevent  
the bank being damaged by wave impact.  
There are many methods of protecting against erosion, particularly  
the area above and below the waterline, which is most subject to  
wave impact, e.g. bundles of willow fascines, rhizome edgings or  
brush mattresses are possible.

The ventilation of a greenhouse  
should be designed so that, when it  
is opened, the temperature is almost  
the same as outside. To achieve this,  
it is necessary that about 20% of  
the roof area opens as a ventilation  
band or a single casement. Sun  
protection can be necessary if there  
is insufficient natural shading outside  
to create a bearable climate under  
strong sunshine. The sun protection  
can be mounted inside or outside, but  
the effect of external sun protection  
is greater when the distance between  
it and the glass is large enough \~ 0

Garden Pond  
Ponds should integrate harmoniously into gardens. The correct  
location is of decisive significance for the flourishing of plants and  
life forms. Most bog and water plants require plenty of sunlight,  
approx. 4-6 hours per day, and the preferred location is near  
terraces and seating.  
If the plants, water and sand have been provided in the appropriate  
quantities, then a biological equilibrium arises after about 6-8  
weeks and the water should become clear. The ratio of water  
surface area to water quantity must be right \(about 400 litres per  
m2 of water surface\). The garden pond then becomes a habitat for  
insects and plants.  
The planting of the pond is done before topping it up with water,  
which is added carefully. Planting time\: from May to September.  
In order to achieve a harmonious overall picture, tall plants should  
be planted individually in the water garden at half-height and with  
a spacing of 30-40 em. Low plants at the edge should, in contrast,  
be set only in groups. Spacing from plant to plant\: 20-30 em.  
The first planting with **underwater plants** is sufficient with five  
plants per m2  
• The plants multiply quickly. Plants in containers can  
be brought to the correct water level by planting higher or lower.  
They can be planted in baskets, containers or directly into special  
earth. Pre-fabricated ponds provide planting baskets at the  
correct depths and prevent the gravel or planting earth slumping  
or slipping \~ **f\) - e.**  
The pond should be appropriate for the size of the garden. Ideal  
is a water area of 20-25 m2  
, but as little as 3-5m2 offers a habitat  
for many species. Wetland, shallow-water zones \~ **0 - f\)** and  
waterlogged borders help to expand the pond area and create a  
more natural balance. Generous water zones 5-20 em deep and  
another area at least 80 em deep are necessary for insect larvae  
and newts to overwinter. The deep zone serves as an escape zone  
for the creatures.  
The pond should stay full in the winter in order to prevent frost  
heave. Fish, frogs and amphibians survive the winter only if anti-  
ice devices and aeration stones are used.

of a natural pool in comparison with conventional pools is low  
maintenance cost \(no cleaning, pump\) and its ecological value  
\(biotope effect, allergy-free, as no chlorine is needed\). On the  
other hand, turbidity or temporary formation of algae have to be  
accepted in some weather conditions. These problems normally

FEA, Dessau Dessau  
The design of the external works for the Federal Environment  
Agency \(FEA\) in Dessau is based on a continuous idea\: it mediates  
between the building and the city and forms its own landscape  
theme - nature in movement. This is divided into two landscape  
areas\: 1. inside the building, 2. outside the building. Elements of  
naturalistic design, which are based thematically on the function  
of the building, are part of the production.  
The planting follows a functional and an aesthetic principle. The  
functional component is aligned with the pragmatic requirements  
for external works, like for example the enclosure of the plot \(a  
hornbeam hedge borders the plot to the west, the fire service  
perimeter road to the east is marked by planting with red bushes  
and ground-cover plants\). The aesthetic component is oriented  
towards the sculptural quality of each plant with regard to the  
theme of the building \(meadow areas are sown with grasses  
and wild flowers, succession areas covered with broken stone  
demonstrate natural development, approx. 1 00 new trees have  
been planted, green fields are strewn with ground-cover plants,  
perennials and decorative shrubs\).  
The material excavated during the construction work was used  
to model the plot. Paths/paved areas, covered with mosaic  
stone paving and waterbound surfacing, also serve as fire service  
perimeter access. Paths are bounded with steel edges and rails  
found on the site. The guidance system for the visually impaired  
consists of black natural stone slabs let into the pale paving.  
Relaxation areas are overlaid with travertine slabs, access roads  
with concrete pavement and parking spaces with grass-jointed  
paving. The fire service perimeter access \(eastern side of the  
building\) is asphalted. The roof run-off from the canteen pours  
down a gutter into a pond, which is waterproofed with a mixture  
of mineral and clay elements. The drainage of the paved areas  
features gutters, cast covers and gully traps, which are connected  
to the existing rainwater pipes. Furniture like benches, waste bins,  
bicycle support frames and bollards, able to be lowered, taken out  
or fixed, flagpoles and works of art all add to the overall effect.

# FARMYARDS  
Basics  
The selection of location for a farm has to balance topographical  
and climatic conditions with business considerations. This should  
take priority over factors resulting from ownership. Buildings for  
livestock have almost the same climatic requirements as houses  
for people. Extremely frosty, misty or very windy regions and par-  
ticularly exposed locations should be avoided. The relationship  
of the buildings to each other, the arrangement of the functional  
areas in relation to nearby residential areas and the prevailing wind  
direction should all be taken into account. The prevailing wind  
direction is more important in summer than in winter.  
The choice of location should differentiate between the transport  
connections internally and externally. The quality of external trans-  
port connections is determined by the connection of the farm to  
public roads, leading to customers and marketing organisations  
\(farm shop, dairy etc.\). For the quality of internal connections, a  
good link to the main farm road network in the vicinity is more  
important than the farm itself being near the fields.  
The arrangement of the buildings should observe the following  
distances\: min. 1 0 m between all buildings, from the farmhouse  
to the buildings for livestock at least 15 m; from the farmhouse  
southwards to the plot boundary at least 10 m and west or east  
min. 6 m **-70.**  
Animal husbandry operations with technical facilities normally re-  
quire areas of 4000-5000 m2  
, with plot widths of 35-45 m, and ap-  
prox. 1000 m2 for the residential area including garden. \(UK farms  
tend to be larger than those in other European countries, which  
may be in part the result of differing inheritance practices.\) Work-  
ing and transport routes within and outside the buildings should  
not exceed the following gradients\: for hand trucks = 5%, motor  
vehicles= 10%, short hills max. 20%.  
The residential garden serves as an extension of the house. The  
location should if possible be to the south or west of the house,  
min. 1 00 m2 lawn, paved and secluded sitting area, borders for  
flowers, bushes, children's play area and washing line, altogether  
needing approx. 400-500 m2  
. Personal consumption requires a  
vegetable garden with 50-60 m2 per person and an orchard ap-  
prox. 100 m2 per person.

Space Requirements  
The following tables show the plot size required according to pro-  
duction capacity and type of operation, based on investigations  
by Herms and Hillendahl. Various plot areas can be reduced, e.g.  
through the installation of a tower silo instead of a silage heap,  
upstairs instead of downstairs feed rooms, slurry storage under  
the slatted floor instead of in outdoor containers, building up to  
boundaries etc.  
The tables of plot size *-7* **0 - 8** do not take into account all the  
space required for housing machines and workshops or for the  
residential area, as these do not have to be in the farmyard.

Dung and Drainage  
The amount of dung and urine produced by farm animals depends  
on the type of animal, its live weight \(expressed in large animal  
units, I LU = 500 kg live weight\) and the type and composition of  
the fodder and drink. Exact determination of contents is not poss-  
ible because the composition of fodder normally varies over the  
farm year, so only average values can be given -7 \$-**m.**  
**Solid dung\:** The normal litter quantity of 1.5-2 kg of straw per LU/  
day results in a stacking height of solid dung of 2.0-2.5 m, equiv-  
alent to a dung slab of 0.5 m2/LU x month. The slurry pit collects, in  
addition to urine, cleaning water and a large part of the rain falling  
through and being polluted by the dung heap. If evaporation of% of  
the rain and 3m2 dung per LU is assumed \(corresponds to 6 months'  
storage\), this gives slurry production of 0.64 m3/LU x month.  
**Liquid dung \(slurry\)\:** Dung, urine and cleaning water are collect-  
ed. When slurry is stored in closed pits, then no rainwater gets in;  
for open slurry tanks a free space of 20-30 em above the highest  
slurry level should be sufficient to take the rain. Evaporation of  
the water and part of the slurry liquid makes the free space larger  
again. Milk cows produce about 1.4 m3/LU x month of slurry. In-  
tensive fattening of bullocks with maize silage fodder can reduce  
slurry production to about 1.0 m3/LU x month.  
**Regulations\:** Among the most frequent causes of pollution from  
farms are structural failure of slurry and effluent stores, mismanage-  
ment and lack of maintenance of slurry handling systems and prob-  
lems with dirty water disposal. National regulations have been tight-  
ened in response. In England and Wales the Control of Pollution  
\(Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Fuel Oil\) Regulations 1991 set legal  
minimum standards for installations, including that they may not be  
located within I 0 m of watercourses that might become polluted.

Climate in Animal Housing  
In addition to their own characteristics, fodder and behaviour, the  
climate in their housing has the most decisive influence on the perfor-  
mance and health of the animals. 'Climate' includes the factors tem-  
perature, humidity, air movement, air composition, light, ventilation,  
window area, building volume, orientation of building and its thermal  
insulation. The air intake speed should be between 2.0 and 5.0 m/s  
according to the width of the building. Ventilation systems are divided  
into convection ventilation and forced ventilation--. **f\)- 0.**

Housing Poultry  
\(See also Laying Hens *-t* p. 455.\)  
Housing for poultry requires  
careful design and construction  
in order to keep them success-  
fully. Coops should be clean,  
airy, free of draughts, dry, ther-  
mally insulated and weather-  
proof. Provision should be made  
for cleaning out. The window  
area should be max. 1/10 of the  
floor area. Timber construction  
with a thermal insulation layer  
is best. Adjacent rooms should  
be provided for feed preparation  
and storage. The form of the  
house should be suitable for the  
direction of the sun, the window  
side south and the door east.  
Laying nests will be at the dark-  
est location. A chicken coop is  
divided into a scratching room  
with litter and pit for droppings  
with the perch above *-t* **0.**  
The run is ideally of unlimited  
size and the area should be  
grassed with a tree for shade  
*-t* Cli\), a compost heap and a  
sand bath. The number of hens  
depends on the size of the run  
and the free floor area of the  
empty coop. If the run is of un-  
limited size, 5 hens per m2 coop  
floor area. If the run is smaller  
than 4 times the coop floor  
area, then 2 hens can be kept  
per m2 coop floor area. There  
should be room for perches,  
feed bowls etc. in the area.

Rabbit hutches  
These \~ 0 - 0 are often free-  
standing at wind-protected rear  
sides of barns and houses. Hutch-  
es can be stacked 3 x vertically  
\~ 0. They should be protected  
against rats and mice, and be  
easy to clean and with urine drains  
\~ **f\).** For the breeding of fatten-  
ing and meat rabbits \~ **9** - 0 in  
close roorns, there are stringent re-  
quirements for the construction of  
the hutch and the climate. Rabbits  
react to poor climate rnuch more  
sensitively than piglets or chicks.  
Thermally insulated buildings with  
forced ventilation are required for  
breeding and fattening. The hutch  
volume should be 4.5-5.5 m3 per  
doe including offspring. The tem-  
perature in the breeding hutch  
should be 10-28 °C, optimally  
18 oc, in the fattening hutch 20 °C.  
Goat sheds  
If possible these should face to the  
east or south. Dry with good venti-  
lation and lighting, window area =  
1/5-1/20 of the floor area. Where  
goats are tied up in numbers, the  
standing width should be 75-80 em,  
depth 1.50-2.00 rn, without includ-  
ing the passages necessary in front  
and behind the pens. A paddock  
next door to the south is ideal.

Sheep Housing  
**Sheep housing** should face to  
the east or west; single hous-  
ing is much like goat housing  
\~ p. 453. Intensive sheep farm-  
ing requires large, free-standing  
sheds with flexible housing  
according to time of year \(win-  
ter, early year, lambing time,  
after lambing\), separated by  
fences according to age and sex.  
Floor 50-60 em below ground  
level. Door threshold 20 em  
above ground level. The height  
difference of 60-80 em is filled  
with dung, which remains for  
3-4 months.  
Feeding racks should there-  
fore be adjustable, ideally  
with a manger, either round  
\(diameter 2.20 m\) or elongated  
mangers - 3.40 m is sufficient  
for 25-30 sheep. Spacing be-  
tween feed containers 2.30 m,  
from the wall 1.80 m. Doors  
to the south, divided at half  
height. Door width \~2.50 m,  
door height \~2.80 m, to re-  
*move* the dung.  
Building height 3.30-3.50 m,  
window area 1 /20-1/25  
of the building floor area,  
high-level tilting window.  
All building components,  
timber on plinth 15-20 em  
above highest dung level,  
should be protected against  
dung salts.  
Feed mixing place 1/10-1/15 of  
the pen area. For small herds  
\~m2 turnip store should be  
provided. Storage for hay and

All types of facility must provide a **minimum area of 2.5 m2** and  
be equipped so that the hens can move to a reasonable extent  
according to their personal needs\: i.e. can move to **feed, drink**  
**and rest.** The lighting is to be sufficient for the birds to recognise  
each other and for the people responsible for care to be able to  
see them properly. The floor must provide hard standing for the  
birds and have access to adequately dimensioned and distrib-  
uted feeding and drinking facilities. The facility should also pro-  
vide a freely accessible nest during the laying phase with a floor  
constructed so that the birds do not come into contact with wire  
mesh. A litter area should also be provided to enable the laying  
hens to peck, scratch and dust-bath as is their nature. The laying  
hens in a group must be able to enjoy simultaneous and undis-  
turbed rest on a perch.

# ANIMAL HUSBANDRY  
Pig Keeping  
The animal welfare requirements for the commercial keeping of  
pigs are laid down in the Animal Welfare Law and in the Animal  
Welfare, Animal Husbandry Regulations. The regulations contain  
general provisions for pig-keeping facilities and for the keeping  
of pigs\:  
Pig sheds \(except for birthing pens\) must be constructed so that  
the pigs have eye contact with the other pigs kept there. The pigs  
must be able **easily to lie, stand up, lie down and adopt a natu-**  
**ral posture.** The pigs must have a dry lying area available. They  
must not unavoidably come into contact with urine and dung.  
There must be adequate equipment for the reduction of heat  
stress at high shed temperatures. The **floor** of the pig shed must  
be **slip-resistant** and provide a **firm footing** over the entire area  
where the pigs live and in the driving gangways. The construc-  
tion must be appropriate for the size and weight of the pigs and  
no holes, gaps or cavities are allowed which might lead to risk of  
injury.  
If a **slatted floor** is used, the maximum width of the gaps is 11  
em for suckling piglets, 14 mm for fattening piglets, 18 mm for  
young pigs for breeding and 20 mm for young sows, sows and  
boars. The width of the tread surface in areas where the pigs live  
must correspond to the slatted floor and, if slatted concrete floor-  
ing is used, it must be at least 5 em for suckling and fattening pig-  
Jets and 8 em for all other pigs. If **metal grating flooring** is made  
of wire mesh, the wires must be plastic coated and the external  
diameter of the coated wire must be at least 9 mm.  
In the area where the pigs lie, the floor must be constructed so that  
the health of the pigs cannot be harmed and heat transmission is  
not too high or too low. The degree of perforation of the floor may  
not be more than 15% \(except for fattening piglets\).  
The **lighting** of the sheds must \(applies to new building from  
04/08/2006\) be natural daylight. The window areas must have a  
total area of at least 3% of the shed floor area and be arranged so  
that the lighting is as uniform as possible. The window area can be  
reduced to 1.5% of the shed floor area on account of technology,  
construction or building regulations as long as artificial lighting as  
comparable as possible to natural lighting is also provided.  
It should be ensured that each pig has access at all times to  
**activity material** without health risks, which serves their natural  
inquisitiveness and can be investigated, moved and altered by the  
pig. Each pig must have constant access to **water** in sufficient  
quantity and quality, and if the pigs are kept in groups additional  
drinking troughs are to be provided in sufficient quantity separate  
from the feeding trough.  
In addition to the general requirements, the Animal Welfare, Animal  
Husbandry Regulations contain further provisions for the keeping  
of **sucking piglets, young sows, sows and boars ---\> 0.**  
If the farm intends to market products as **organic,** the provisions  
of the EU Eco Directive will also have to be complied with **\_\_\_\_.f\).** Q Cow 8 Young animal in stall

ANIMAL HUSBANDRY  
Dairy Farming  
The requirements for cow sheds, according to the Agri-  
cultural Investment Support Programme \(AFP\), annex 1,  
'Special requirements for particularly welfare-oriented hus-  
bandry', represent the current standard for keeping cows in  
terms of animal welfare and can be considered as minimum  
requirements \(which can be deviated from in exceptional cas-  
es according to the farm's situation\). The provisions of the  
EU Eco Directive and Recommendations for horned cows also  
contain ideas of future developments in conventional livestock  
farming.  
Lying box dimensions and design  
The dimensions of the lying boxes have to be based on the aver-  
age bodily dimensions of the 25% largest animals in a herd. The  
values below therefore represent lower limits. The dimensions for  
individual cows can be worked out as follows\:  
Lying length\: \(0.92 x diagonal rump length\)+ 21 em  
Lying box length\: lying length+ 21 em+ \(wither height x 0.56\)  
Lying box width\: wither height x 0.86

Finishing Beef Cattle  
The methods used to finish beef cattle are divided into single and  
group management --7 **0.** Keeping animals singly requires con-  
stant adaptation of the stall on account of the fast growth of a bull.  
Different stalls are therefore required for different ages. Pay atten-  
tion to good drainage of urine from the lying area.  
The advantage of keeping cattle singly is that herd behaviour is  
excluded. Group management \(6-15 animals ofthe same age and  
similar weights is usual\) requires that the animals have already got  
used to each other as calves.  
According to the bedding quantity and the system of dung re-  
moval, either the animal can walk and lie in the entire area of the  
pen, which is completely straw-bedded, or the lying and feeding  
areas are separated. Animals kept singly are tied and short stalls  
are recommended --7 **f\).** The design of a shed for finishing beef  
cattle must create the possibility of bringing single animals or  
groups in or out of the stalls without danger. The best ventilation  
is provided by convectors or extractor systems. These work reli-  
ably with roof pitches of about 20°. Beef cattle are normally fed  
maize silage.

ANIMAL HUSBANDRY  
Keeping Horses  
The correct care according to the needs of the species is a pre-  
condition for the health, performance and tong life of the horse,  
and also for its willingness and mental stability. Today, after 5000  
years of domestication, the needs of horses are still similar to  
those of wild animals on the steppes. Horses are herd animals  
and social contact is essential. Whether kept in groups or singly,  
attention should be paid to the social relationships and compat-  
ibility of horses. When horses are kept separately, ensure at least  
sight, sound and smell contact between the animals. Foals and  
young horses must grow up in groups.  
Keeping in groups\: This can be in single boxes or group boxes  
with adjacent paddock.  
Single boxes\: Tie stalls are not to be recommended in the long  
term. When horses are kept singly, a movement area at least as  
large as a single box is better than none at all. Stables for heavy  
horses should be planned with a ceiling height of at least 1.5 x  
withers height, i.e. approx. \~2.70 m.

Keeping Horses  
Although the horse is insensitive to wind \(and has a physiologi-  
cal need of air movement\), draughts should be prevented. This is  
done with artificial ventilation systems providing constant airflow.  
There is little point in attempting an 'ideal' stable temperature.  
With sufficient preparation and appropriate management, any  
horse can tolerate winter temperatures in the stable, even a few

# LOADING YARDS  
For shops up to approx. 200m2  
, it is safe to assume smaller de-  
livery vehicles, which can stop in normal car parks. Shops over  
200 m2 should provide a parking area of 3.5 m x 12 m for HGV  
deliveries. Vehicles should if possible be able to drive in and out  
forwards.  
Average design values for loading yards are given for larger de-  
partment stores and supermarkets in \~ **0.** Yards which are built  
over should have a clear height of at least 4.90 m. The width of  
single-lane straight ramps should be min. 3.50 m, with two-way  
traffic min. 6.75 m. Ramps should not have a gradient of more  
than I 0%. Changes of gradient of more than 8% should have a  
transition curve of radius 50 m. At changes of gradient, height  
supplements must be considered according to the length of the  
HGVs. Spiral ramps should be designed in accordance with the  
swept curves of the FGSV.  
Safety distance between two trucks with trailers standing next to  
each other\: on ramps min. 1.50 m, at loading hatches min. 3.00 m.

Rubbish chute systems can be provided in multi-storey build-  
ings to simplify the transport of waste from upper floors to  
waste collection bins. They were very popular for a time \(par-  
ticularly in high-rise flats\) and were even a requirement for  
buildings of more than five storeys, but because of the main-  
tenance costs and increased construction requirements \(rub-  
bish separation, fire protection\) they are now provided only in  
special buildings.  
**The design is normally undertaken by a specialist firm, and**  
**an appropriate maintenance contract should be agreed with**  
# them.  
Rubbish chutes can easily spread fire from one storey to another  
and therefore represent a **considerable fire hazard.** They are  
therefore forbidden in some \(more recent\) state building regu-  
lations, or are associated with appropriate construction require-  
ments.  
# Construction  
Rubbish chute systems consist of the following elements\: the  
drop chute with the rubbish intake location, the rubbish collection  
room with holding bins, rubbish presses, etc. and the ventilation  
system.

# Details  
Rubbish chute systems must have **separate intake doors** for the  
various categories of rubbish. These must be away from occupied  
rooms.  
Rubbish chutes and collection rooms must be constructed of **fire-**  
**resistant materials.** Cladding, insulation materials, internal wall  
skins and all equipment near the shaft and collection room must  
also consist of **non-flammable materials.** The installation of a  
**fire extinguishing system** may be required \~e.  
The **drop shafts** of rubbish chute systems must fall from the up-  
permost rubbish intake location vertically and with no changes of  
cross-section. Constantly effective **ventilation** \~ **0 -f\)** must be  
ensured. Rubbish chutes must be constructed so that fire, smoke,  
odour and dust cannot get into the building, waste is transport-  
ed safely and the transmission of noise is prevented. The intake  
doors \~ **8 - 0** must be constructed so that no dust nuisance  
occurs and no oversize waste can be inserted. There should be a  
cleaning opening at the top of rubbish chutes. All openings must  
be fitted with doors made of non-flammable materials.  
**Rubbish collection rooms** \~ **0 - 0** must be of adequate size.  
Their internal access must be through fire-resistant and self-  
closing doors. Collection rooms must be accessible from the  
open air for disposal and should have constant ventilation and  
a floor gully with odour trap. The waste should be collected in  
wheeled bins.

Layout of storage space for rubbish bins \(according to building regulations in  
Berlin\)  
**Waste** must be collected separately in suitable containers and be  
disposed of appropriately. This objective can be achieved by the  
provision of rubbish collection rooms, which are easily and safely  
accessible for the waste disposal provider either within the build-  
ing or in corresponding areas outside the building, for the tempor-  
ary storage of waste materials. Either option should be equipped  
with tightly closed rubbish bins in different sizes for the various  
categories of waste ---\> **0.**  
On account of the high fire load of solid rubbish \(and the associ-  
ated odour nuisance\), the **model building regulations** include the  
following provisions\:  
Solid waste can be temporarily stored **inside** the building.  
Waste can be stored temporarily inside buildings with more  
than two flats or a usable area of 400 m2 \(building classes 3-5\)  
only if the **rubbish collection room** complies with the following  
requirements\:  
1. The partition walls and ceilings are constructed as room-  
forming elements according to building regulations with the  
fire-resistance of load-bearing walls.  
2. Openings from the inside of the building into the collection  
room should have fire-retarding, self-closing closures.  
3. The rubbish collection rooms can be emptied directly from the  
open air.  
4. Constantly effective ventilation is provided.

If the quantity of waste is large, then the use of waste crushers  
or waste presses is worth considering. Offices and administration  
buildings will also need a paper shredder. Collection rooms for  
foodstuff waste \(wet rubbish\) must be cooled. In large buildings,  
rubbish collection rooms should be provided on the floors \(near  
the lift\) if possible, to avoid the lift lobby being used as a waste  
collection centre.

**EMERGENCY POWER ROOMS**  
**Emergency power supply systems** \(diesel generator sets\)  
Emergency power units are combustion motors \(usually diesel\)  
which are coupled to generators to produce electricity. They are  
used for a limited time in case of a power cut \(and are thus not for  
constant power supply\) and supply emergency and safety lighting,  
lifts and other critical usages \(e.g. in operating theatres in hospi-  
tals, server rooms and industrial processes etc.\). They consist of a  
diesel motor and a generator mounted on a base frame \(e.g. steel\)  
on a foundation with elastic supports between machine set and  
frame, and a starter and battery ---7 **0.**  
There are mobile \(container generator sets\) and permanently in-  
stalled diesel generator sets including switching gear. The perfor-  
mance range is between 5 and 2000 kVA \(kilovolt amp\) according  
to specification.  
The design starts with the determination of\:  
- motor power  
- sound insulation  
- exhaust system  
# Emergency power rooms  
The required dimensions, height and openings of the room for a  
generator set vary according to the power and configuration of  
the motor ---7 **f\).** Air supply and extraction can be through forced  
ventilation \(shaft\) ---7 **0.** It is also possible to run the extract air  
together with the exhaust of the diesel motor up a vertical shaft  
to exit above the roof ---7 **f\) - 0.** In this case, sufficient sound  
insulation should be provided with a silencer in the ductwork ---7  
**f\) - 0.** The manufacturers of the motors give information about  
the required quantity of air and thus the size of the supply and  
extract ducts.  
On account of the high noise level involved in running a generator  
set for testing and maintenance, it is recommended not to place  
it near inhabited rooms which should be particularly quiet \(e.g.  
the care rooms of a hospital\). Measures should also be under-  
taken to keep the noise level as low as possible. Another measure  
is to position the frame, on which the generator and motor are  
mounted, on spring dampers to reduce the sound transmission  
into the structure.  
# Uninterruptible power supply \{UPS\) systems  
There is normally a gap of at most 15 seconds between the power  
cut and the switching to emergency power. UPS systems are used  
to continue power supply without interruption during this time.  
Static UPS systems are bridging battery power devices, whose  
batteries are constantly charged from the mains.  
According to equipment and requirements, a UPS system should  
be able to protect the connected consumer from the following  
risks\: power cuts, voltage fluctuations, voltage peaks, low voltage,  
excessive voltage, lightning effects/switching peaks, interference  
voltage and frequency fluctuations.  
While UPS systems are designed to cope with a power cut of at  
most 30-60 minutes, diesel-powered emergency generators can  
supply power during much longer interruptions.

# RENEWABLE ENERGY  
Overview  
Scarcer resources and increas-  
ing energy prices are resulting  
in more interest in renewable  
energy sources. The limited  
supply and increasing con-  
sumption of energy reserves  
is leading to the necessity of  
developing alternatives. The  
construction and operation of  
buildings represents a large  
proportion of overall energy  
consumption.  
In addition to saving energy  
through ever improved thermal  
insulation and more effective  
methods of energy processing  
with higher efficiencies, the use  
of renewable energies is be-  
coming increasingly significant.  
The development and diffusion  
of new and optimised process-  
es and equipment is supported  
by grant programmes.  
The optimal design of each  
building project has an essen-  
tial role to play. The forecast  
demand for electrical and heat  
energy for a particular build-  
ing should be compared with  
the opportunities available at  
the location and the most ef-  
ficient process selected. As  
new processes and devices are  
developed or made effective,  
existing buildings and systems  
should be checked often for  
efficiency and may need to be  
upgraded.  
The methods of exploiting re-  
newable energies are multi-  
farious and are being extended  
constantly. The type and extent  
of this use depends on the  
possibilities at the location, the  
type and size of the building  
project and the budget.  
The application of a particular  
process can be supported by  
public grant programmes and  
the energy industry. What can  
be grant-aided and to what  
level varies according to region  
and is regularly adapted to al-  
tered conditions \(regulated in  
the Renewable Energy Law -  
EEG\).

Sunlight is converted into electricity in solar cells. This is an  
important element of the ecological design of buildings, because  
renewable electrical energy is generated. Solar cells can use direct  
and diffused solar radiation. Shadowing of their surface is to be  
avoided, with partial shadows having a more serious effect than  
temporary shadows \(i.e. trees are worse than clouds\).  
The solar yield depends on the climate and the alignment of the  
panels-\> **0.** The optimum alignment in northern latitudes is facing  
due south, with a tilt angle from the horizontal dependent on  
latitude. At good locations, in Germany for example, an average  
annual yield of 800-900 kWh/m2 can be expected, or under  
optimum conditions approx. 1100 kWh/m2 • A rule of thumb is to  
expect to require 7.5 m2 of panels for each kW of installed capacity.  
Solar cells are connected together into larger units called modules.  
Various types of module \(mono-crystalline, multi-crystalline,  
amorphous\) differ in performance, efficiency and appearance.  
Mono-crystalline cells have uniformly dark grey to black surfaces,  
multi-crystalline grey to blue and variable; semi-transparent  
modules are also possible.  
The conversion of the direct current coming from the solar cells  
into alternating current in the inverter causes little conversion loss.  
Most systems are connected to the grid for more cost-effective  
operation\: the electricity coming from the solar modules is fed into  
the grid, which requires a separate feed-in meter.  
Large photovoltaic installations should be operated with changing  
tilt and alignment \(tracking\), with separate solar generators and grid  
feed-in equipment to achieve the optimum yield. Grid-connected  
systems work completely automatically without maintenance and  
have a lifetime of at least 20 years. Solar-generated electricity  
fed into the public grid is paid for over a guaranteed period as  
regulated in the Renewable Energy Law \(EEG\).  
Photovoltaic elements can be integrated into the building envelope  
in various ways or mounted subsequently. They are designed for  
use in the open air and can be used as an independent part of a  
fagade or roof. Solar cells are UV-resistant and weatherproof.  
They can play an important architectural role and also fulfil other  
functions\: sound, visual, sun and weather protection. Solar cells  
are mostly built on roofs, for which there are various possibilities\:  
mounted on the roof \(independently, mostly for later installation\},  
integrated into the roof covering or forming the roof itself. The  
installation of photovoltaic modules in fagades is also possible,  
in which case they should be back-ventilated in order to avoid  
reduction of yield *-j* **0 +e.**

# RENEWABLE ENERGY  
Bioenergy  
# Biomass energy  
Biomass is exploited for energy through thermo-chemical or  
biological processes \(burning, gasification or liquefaction\). The  
most significant sources are biodiesel, wood and agricultural  
waste products. Biodiesel is made by liquefying renewable  
raw materials which contain oil. It can replace heating oil or  
conventional oil and be used in appropriate boilers or block  
heating and power plants.  
# Wood as an energy source  
Wood is available in great quantities and can be used in various  
forms. The water content of newly felled wood is 40-50%. Air-dried  
wood contains 15-20% water and produces twice the calorific  
value. There are various types of wood with different moisture  
contents, density, calorific value and also size, form and processing.  
Wood for burning is available as logs, wood chips and pellets.  
For smaller installations up to 15 kW nominal heat output, natural  
logs can be used, which can be hardwood or softwood from  
forestry or waste products from timber processing. Demolition  
timber should be avoided. In larger installations, it is also possible  
to use sawdust, straw and further sources.  
Centralised boilers are preferable to single stoves on account of  
better possibilities for controlling emissions. Automatically fed  
boilers show better emissions values than hand-fed.  
In wood chip or pellet systems, the fuel is fed into the combustion  
chamber from an adjacent room or from a container using a spiral  
auger conveyor or pressure system. The continuous supply of fuel  
ensures a good degree of efficiency and enables the output to be  
adapted according to demand.  
Pellets \(pressed waste products of wood-processing industries  
with a very high energy value of 4.3-5.0 kWh/kg, about 1/3 that  
of heating oil\) are delivered in trucks and blown into the storage  
container. The technology and the space required for the  
installation is comparable to an oil heating system.  
The size of the boiler also corresponds to a boiler for oil or gas.  
The safety standards are, however, lower than for heating oil.  
Containers for wood chips are filled by tipping from a truck.  
In order to extend the burning time in the boiler, heating water  
buffer cylinders are a sensible addition to a pellet or wood chip  
heating system, and are necessary for log heating systems; 40  
litres per kW of nominal output should be assumed. Boilers for  
solid fuel up to 1 MW thermal output do not require a permit.  
A further technological possibility is gasification of wood \(e.g. of  
wood chips\) for use in a block heating and power plant, for which  
some heating oil is required to start the motor. The combination  
of a wood-fired boiler with a thermal solar system is sensible  
because the water can be pre-warmed by solar energy and heated  
to feed temperature by the boiler -7 **e.**  
# Biogas  
The agricultural production of biogas on farms from slurry or  
harvested materials has great potential and is of increasing  
importance. The biomass is gasified in a digester, which then  
feeds a gas engine for combined heat and power. The digested  
slurry is spread on the fields as fertiliser and the residual sludge  
can be used as compost. Biomass gasification is a continuous  
and sensitive process and requires constant monitoring. A biogas  
plant requires a permit under the Federal Emissions Control Law.  
Gas from landfill sites \(fermentation of solid matter\) can also be  
employed to produce heat and power using gas probes or gas  
collecting drains for the operation of heat and power systems or  
simply as heating gas. Water Surface water river, lake, seawater

RENEWABLE ENERGY  
Geothermal Energy, Heat Pumps  
Ground source energy  
This describes the exploitation of geothermal energy at a depth  
to approx. 400 m. The temperature gradient is about 3 K/1 00 m  
of depth and temperatures of approx. 7-11 oc can be expected  
at a depth of 1 0-20 metres; the flow of warmth is influenced only  
by weather and air temperature near the surface. The relatively  
constant temperatures can be exploited for heating and cooling.  
Many processes are available for energy use\:  
Ground source heat collectors  
These are metal or plastic pipes laid horizontally under the  
ground. The spacing and depth are dependent on the properties  
of the soil. The heat extraction is 10-40 W/m2• Geothermal heat  
collectors should not be built over and the surface should n\~t be  
impermeably paved.  
Downhole heat exchangers  
These require less space and have better thermal performance than  
ground source heat collectors. They can be installed as indirect or, less  
often, as direct systems in a closed circuit. An indirect system would,  
for example, connect a brine circuit with the heat pump through an  
intermediate heat exchanger. There are various construction types\:  
U-pipe or double-pipe probes and coaxial probes, where the  
borehole is grouted with a cement-bentonite suspension for better  
heat transfer. The extraction output is 20-70 W/m.  
Groundwater wells as a heat source  
Heat can be extracted directly from an aquifer\: heat exchangers  
shaped like an immersion heater are lowered down boreholes into  
the aquifer and connected to a heat pump with a brine circuit. The  
usual process is the extraction and refilling of the groundwater  
with pumping or suction wells. Such systems \(and also downhole  
heat exchangers\) generally require a permit, and the required  
drilling work must always be performed by approved firms. Then  
extracted energy can be used directly to heat or cool building  
elements or indirectly with heat pumps.  
The suitability of using air or surface water as a heat source should  
be investigated for each specific project, because the annual  
variation of temperature is directly opposite to the heating demand.  
Heat pump  
Environmental or geothermal energy is exploited in a thermodynamic  
process through the introduction of mechanical energy\: % of the  
energy required for heating is gained from the environment and  
the remainder is consumed as electricity to power the compressor.  
Heat pumps are of particular interest for integrated energy supply  
concepts, because they can be used for heating and also cooling.  
A heat pump essentially consists of evaporator, compressor,  
condenser and expansion valve. These parts are connected with  
pipes in a closed medium circuit. The effect is to extract heat from  
the surroundings by evaporation. The now gaseous medium is  
compressed in an electrically driven compressor, increasing the  
temperature and pressure. A further heat exchanger then transfers  
this heat to the heating system, causing the medium to condense  
again. The control valve serves to reduce the pressure in the  
medium to the low initial pressure.  
Heat pumps can be used with low-temperature heating systems  
\(optimal for relatively low feed temperature such as in underfloor  
heating\) and central water heating. The heat delivered by the  
compressor of the heat pump must always be dissipated, thus the  
installation of a buffer cylinder \(not necessary for underfloor heating\).  
The heat pump works independent of the time of day or season and  
is considered to be an environmentally beneficial heating system.  
The electricity for the operation of a heat pump is sometimes grant-  
aided through lower electricity prices and requires a separate meter.

# RENEWABLE ENERGY  
CHP, Block Heating and Power, Fuel Cells  
**Combined heat and power \{CHP\)** is the combined production of  
heating and mechanical energy, which is converted into electricity  
in a generator. The basic idea is the generation of electrical energy  
and the exploitation of the heat, which is always produced at the  
same time. Smaller installations \(for one or more buildings\) use  
combustion motors or gas turbines instead of the water/steam  
circuit normally found in a power station.  
A **block heating and power system** is a small power station, which  
produces electricity and space heating at the same time, working as  
a mini- or micro-CHP system. The size of a block heating and power  
system has a decisive influence on its cost-effectiveness, because  
the energy produced by a CHP system consists of about *Ya* electricity  
and % heat. The variable energy demand for buildings according to  
time of day and season necessitates the sizing of the block heating  
and power system according to electricity or heating demand. If  
the block heating and power system is designed to meet heating  
demand, then excess electricity is fed into the grid and electricity is  
consumed from the grid when the output is insufficient. If the block  
heating and power system is designed to meet electricity demand,  
then excess heat is stored in a buffer cylinder and an external boiler  
is required when the heat produced is insufficient.  
Block heating and power systems are mostly designed to meet  
the heating demand. The precondition is that the curve of heat  
and electricity demand against time is known for the building or  
consumer group. For the design of new residential buildings, the  
demand can be estimated fairly accurately using characteristic  
curves. A block heating and power system will normally produce  
enough heat to meet basic requirements and excess electricity is  
fed into the grid though an additional meter. The heating demand  
at peak times is then met by an additional source of heating.  
Block heating and power systems are available in various sizes\:  
the smallest models for single houses from approx. 2 kW of  
electrical power and powered by a four-stroke or Stirling motor  
\(micro-CHP\), small plants up to 30 kW can be used for blocks  
of up to six flats \(mini-CHP\). Compact block heating and power  
systems cover the range up to 400 kW, above that large systems  
are needed. The space required for a mini-CHP system from 5.5  
kW electricity output is 4m2  
, for 15 kW 6.5 m2  
, and any areas for  
additional heating boilers should be added.  
For installation in buildings, sufficient air supply and extract openings  
should be specified and the exhaust pipe continued to above the  
roof. The system should either be encapsulated as a module or  
sufficiently sound insulated between itself and occupied rooms.  
**Fuel cells** produce electricity and heat out of water and hydrogen  
in a reverse-electrolysis process. They consist of electrodes \(anode  
and cathode\) and an electrolyte. This separates the electrodes  
and the reaction partner supplied. Fuel cells generate DC, which  
is concerted into AC in an inverter. The waste heat can be used  
for space heating through a cooling circuit. Hydrogen is produced  
from natural gas or methane/methanol in a reformer. Like CHP  
systems, fuel cells produce electricity and heat simultaneously,  
but without mechanical parts or noise.  
As with a CHP system, the selection of the correct fuel cell can  
be based either on electricity or heating demand, and in the same  
way design to cover base load with an alternative source for the  
production for peak loads is sensible. The excess heat in the summer  
months can be used to drive an absorption refrigeration machine.  
Fuel cells are differentiated according to operating temperatures  
\(high-temperature, low-temperature fuel cells\) and electrolyte used.  
Low-temperature fuel cells are already available for smaller building  
applications like blocks of flats or small commercial use, but high-  
temperature fuel cells are practical only in large applications because  
they produce electricity and heat in large quantities and the high  
temperatures have to be dispersed through multiple use in an energy  
cascade. Fuel cells are suitable for upgrading and new installations. Thermal

# BUILDING PHYSICS  
Thermal insulation  
Thermal insulation measures are necessary in buildings to limit  
heat loss and to protect against condensation; verifications that  
these have been carried out are required, as stated in various  
standards and regulations\:  
The **Energy Saving Regulation \(EnEV 2007\)** contains limiting  
values for the **primary energy demand** and the **transmitted heat**  
**demand** of residential and non-residential buildings \~ p. 4 7 4. The  
determination of the coefficients of thermal conductivity \(U-values\),  
the energetic design values \(heat transmission resistance, thermal  
conductivity\) and the essential basic terms are described below.  
**Heat quantity,** unit Wh \[= 1.16 kcal\]; temperature oc; temperature  
difference K \(Kelvin\). 1.16 Wh \(= 1 kcal\) increases the temperature  
of 1 000 g of water by 1 K \(= **thermal capacity\)**  
**Heat transfer** can be by convection \(carrying\), conduction,  
radiation or water vapour diffusion; heat transfer can be slowed by  
thermal insulation, but never prevented.  
**Thermal conductivity** *'Jc,* unit W/mK \[kcal/mhK\], is a property of a  
material; the smaller this value, the less the thermal conductivity.  
The design values include, in contrast to the nominal values, a  
supplement for practical application \(temperature, moisture,  
ageing\).  
**Thermal resistance R,** unit m2K!W \[m2hK!kcal\] is a property of  
a layer\: **R** = d/A, \(d = layer thickness in m\). The calculation of the  
thermal resistance is important for the determination of the heat  
transfer coefficient U \~ **0 - 0.**  
**Surface resistance** is the thermal insulation value of the air film  
adhering to the building element. The external surface resistance  
\(Rsel and the internal surface resistance \(Rsil are differentiated.  
**Overall resistance 1/U,** unit m2KIW \[m2hK!kcal\], is the sum of  
the resistances of a building element to the transmission of heat  
\(thermal resistances and surface resistances\)\: **1/U** = Rsi + **R** + Rse  
**Thermal transmittance U,** unit W/m2K \[kcal/m2hK\], is the  
reciprocal of the overall resistance 1/U and the most important  
parameter for the calculation of thermal insulation.  
Maximum values are prescribed for various cases.  
Energetic values \(design values\) for individual building products  
\(thermal conductivity *'Jc,* thermal resistance **R\)** are required for the  
calculation of the U-values. \~ **0 - 0** show the calculation of  
thermal transmittance **U** through the example of an external wall  
with an external wall insulation system and also a pitched roof.  
\(This building element consists of a rafter component \(15%\) and  
an insulated area between the rafters \(85%\). Thermal resistance  
**R** in this case is composed of the average of the upper limit value  
**R'T** and the lower limit value R"T. For the determination of **R'T,**  
the rafter component and the insulation component are added  
according to area. For the determination of **R"T,** the individual  
thermal resistances and surface resistances are added.\)

# BUILDING PHYSICS  
Thermal Insulation  
# Water vapour diffusion  
The air in a room, and also the air in general, contain water in the  
form of water vapour. The quantity of water in the air, depending on  
temperature, is called the **relative humidity.** It is important to note that  
warm air can absorb much more water vapour than cold air. The relative  
humidity can therefore fluctuate greatly according to the temperature  
conditions, although the absolute quantity of water remains constant.  
For the formation of condensation, an important factor is that **the**  
**relative air humidity increases with falling temperatures.** In  
extreme cases, this can be so pronounced that the air is no longer  
capable of holding the water in the form of vapour and it is then  
deposited as condensation.  
The atmospheric air pressure Is 1 bar or 1000 mbar \(also called hecto-pascal\). In a water  
vapour-air mixture, part of this pressure \(called the partial water vapour pressure or partial  
**vapour pressure\) is created by water vapour. It is also advantageous to use this value to**  
describe the water vapour content of the air \(-\> **f\)\)** because this enables considerations  
about diffusion to be illustrated more clearly \(0.6 mbar = 1 g water/kg air\). Differences of  
**partial vapour pressure are then only dffferent contents of water vapour molecules at the**  
same overall \(air\) pressure.  
Different partial vapour pressures attempt to equalise through diffusion \(by wandering  
through the building elements and their layers\). The layers of the building element oppose  
**this with their diffusion resistance; this gives the thickness of the air layer, which would**  
have the same diffusion resistance as the building element; it is calculated as the product  
of the layer thickness d \(em, m\) and the material-specific vapour resistivity m. Under  
diffusion, a partial vapour pressure gradient is set up inside the building element; as with  
the temperature distribution in the building element, this gradient is distributed among the  
individual layers ofthe building element according to their proportion of its overall diffusion  
resistance. The surface air film layers in this case can be neglected on account of their lack  
of thickness \(outside 0.5, inside 2 em\). \(Example; inside 20•/50% C = 11.7 mbar, outside  
-15'/18% = 1.3 mbar, difference 10.4 mbar. Wall \(24 em extruded clay block\)\: m x d =4.5  
x24= 108 em. Internal plaster\(1.0 em\); mx d =6 x 1.0=6 em. 108 +6= 114 em \(100%\)  
\(108 em= 94.7% =9.8 mbar, 6 em =5.3% =0.6 mbar\)  
**4Ii\)** Calculation of partial vapour pressure  
# Diffusion examples  
In order to avoid damage to buildings, condensation in building  
elements should be avoided.  
Condensation occurs where the actual water vapour content  
threatens to become more than that possible for the temperature.  
In the examples --\> **0 - 0** the building element including its  
surface air films is shown to a scale according to its insulation; the  
curved line is the curve of the maximum possible partial vapour  
pressure, which is determined by the straight temperature curve.  
The following are important to avoid damage\:  
# Sufficient thermal insulation  
Example --\> **0** shows a single-layer building element without  
condensation.  
But in example --\> **0** condensation is formed on the inner face  
of the building element, because the proportion of the surface  
air film is too large. The surface air film cannot exceed a certain  
proportion X of the overall resistance I /U --\> **8.**  
# Correct sequence of layers  
The gradient of the diffusion curve should be as steep as possible  
on the inside and flat on the outside--\> **0;** otherwise, condensation  
occurs --\> **0.** This gradient is given by the layer factor jlA.\: inside,  
high water vapour resistance factor, good thermal conductivity =  
high layer factor flA.\: outside, low water vapour resistance factor,  
low thermal conductivity = low layer factor il"-·  
**Vapour barrier at the correct location**  
If there is a vapour barrier on the outside, then the entire vapour  
pressure gradient occurs there and the result is condensation--. **0;**  
if this is to be avoided, then a vapour barrier must be installed on the  
warm side with an equivalent diffusion resistance suitable for the  
location, in which case the layers in front of the vapour barrier must  
not exceed a certain proportion of the overall thermal resistance

BUILDING PHYSICS  
Thermal Insulation  
Construction without vapour barrier *--t* 0 - f\)  
The traditional way of building does not use vapour-retarding barriers.  
The layers are arranged so that no condensation is formed *--t* p. 472.  
In very damp rooms, the vapour pressure distribution should be  
checked by calculation. Multi-layered walls are constructed as two  
layers with cavity insulation or as an external wall insulation system.  
On the external side of the insulating layers, there is a risk of  
cracking due to heat build-up and substrate with poor shear  
strength, so mineral render reinforced with mesh is used here \(or  
plastic modified render\).  
Construction with vapour barrier *--t* 0 - 0  
More recent building \('warm roof', 'warm fagade'\) features an  
external vapour barrier layer \(e.g. waterproofing\) and, on account  
of this, an additional internal vapour barrier. In order to prevent  
condensation on the inside face of the building element, the layers  
in front of the vapour barrier cannot exceed a certain proportion  
of the overall thermal resistance *--t* p. 472. Warm fagades require  
careful construction and have therefore mostly become established  
as prefabricated systems \(sandwich construction\). In a warm roof,  
a water vapour pressure equalisation layer is arranged under the  
waterproofing, and only an equalisation layer for the damping of  
stresses is provided under the vapour barrier.  
Construction with rear-ventilated outer skin *--t* 0 - 0  
The rear ventilation of the skin removes the vapour barrier effect  
of the relatively vapour-sealed outer layers. The width of the air  
gap with panel-like external skin amounts to min. 20 mm, or for  
brickwork outer skin min. 40 mm.  
Functional ventilation requires a height difference \(minimum fall  
1 0%\) between air inlet and outlet.  
If there is less fall, then a vapour-retarding/vapour barrier layer is  
required \(arranged as *--t* Construction with vapour barrier, above\),  
because there would otherwise be condensation on the outer  
skin resulting from excessive vapour transmission. The layers of  
the inner skin are to be formed as with the construction without  
vapour barrier and with falling layer factor. The inner skin must  
nonetheless always be airtight.  
Thermal bridge  
Thermal bridges are parts of building elements with low thermal  
insulation compared with surrounding areas. This results in the  
proportion of the surface air film in the overall resistance increasing  
so that the surface temperature of the inner side of the thermal  
bridge sinks and condensation forms.  
The increased heating cost due to the thermal bridge are often  
insignificant, as long as it is relatively small, but in order to avoid  
condensation on the inner surface of the building element, with  
unpleasant results like mould etc., the temperature of the inner  
surface of the thermal bridge must be improved \(e.g. by reducing  
the cooling effect of the thermal bridge with an insulation layer  
against the 'external cold', increasing the heat transfer to the  
thermal bridge by increasing its surface area, high-conducting  
surroundings for the thermal bridge and/or blowing with warm air\).  
This means that thermal resistance Rsi is reduced in relation to the  
thermal bridge and thus also the proportion of the surface air film  
in the overall resistance 1/U *--t* p. 4 71.  
Typical examples of thermal bridges are shown in *--t* 0 - 0.  
However, even a normal external corner in a building *--t* 8 forms a  
thermal bridge, because a smaller internal surface introduces heat  
opposite a larger external surface, which loses heat. In addition,  
the surface resistance of the surface air film in the corners is  
considerably higher than between the corners.

# Energy Saving Regulation  
The Energy Saving Regulation 2007 **\(EnEV 2007\)** replaces the  
formerly applicable energy saving regulations 2002/2004. The limit  
values for residential buildings have not been altered. For non-  
residential buildings, however, a new verification process is now  
required. In addition to thermal insulation regulations, subsidiary  
measures like, for example, those concerning condensing boilers,  
are required, as already in EnEV 2002/2004.  
Under EnEV 2007, a new overall consideration of the energy  
required for heating, hot water, ventilation, cooling and lighting  
\(only for non-residential buildings\) is to be produced.  
# The energy consumption necessary to heat rooms will no  
# longer be the regulated parameter, but the quantity of primary  
**energy to be used for heating, hot water etc. under standard**  
# conditions.  
Excerpts from the Energy Saving Regulation, using the example of  
a new residential building\:  
Normally heated houses are to be evaluated according to whether  
they adequately limit the annual primary energy demand and the  
transmitted heat requirement in accordance with the new EnEV  
2007.  
Depending on the ratio of **heat-transmitting area A to heated**  
**building volumes** Ve \(A!Ve **ratio\),** the maximum permissible  
annual primary energy demand will be determined according to  
EnEV 2007, according to the **envelope area process.** The basis  
for this is the monthly balance procedure \(DIN EN 832\) with the  
conditions given in DIN 41 08.  
For the **thermal insulation design of stairwells,** a temperature  
of \~15°C can be assumed in accordance with the design. This  
temperature may have to be ensured by the provision of radiators  
in the lower stairwell.  
# Design values of building products  
For the determination of U-values in the verification of thermal  
insulation, the **energetic characteristics** are required for each  
building product. These are called the **design values** of the  
thermal conductivity and the thermal resistance of the materials  
and components, and also the design values of the thermal  
transmittance coefficients of glazing, windows and French  
windows, including frames. The design values can be taken from  
the tables in DIN EN 12524.  
Some important building products, like thermal insulation and  
masonry components, are, however, not included in this standard.  
For these items, the design values are to be determined from the  
**nominal value** in DIN V 4108-4 or from **type approvals** under  
building regulations or other guidelines.  
The nominal value for a product is multiplied by conversion  
values for temperature, moisture and ageing to give the design  
values. The nominal values for the thermal conductivity of  
thermal insulation materials are also to be subjected to a  
partial safety factor of y = 1.2, which has been laid down by the  
responsible standards committee. According to harmonised  
European standards, this should apply to all insulation materials,  
which carry aCE mark. DIN V 4108-4 deals, in tabular form, with  
the conversion into the design value for all common building  
products.  
# 474  
# BUILDING PHYSICS  
Thermal Insulation  
In a similar way, the above two standards are to be used for the  
determination of the required energetic characteristics for the  
calculation of thermal insulation according to EnEV 2007.  
**Heating system and drinking water heating**  
The heating system and drinking water heating are to be  
constructed in accordance with the requirements of EnEV 2007.  
# Sun protection  
According to EnEV 2007, protection from summer heat is to be  
verified independent of the proportion of the building's surface  
taken by the window area following DIN 4102-2\. This states  
that summer heat protection depends on the **climatic region**  
and **sun input factor S** of the transparent external building  
elements.  
The verification of thermal protection in summer depends on  
the following factors, among others\: Overall degree of energy  
transmission of the glazing, window inclination and orientation,  
frame as proportion of the windows, effectiveness of the sun  
protection apparatus, proportion of window area in the fac;\:ade  
\(related to rooms\), climatic region \(building location\), light or  
heavy construction \(effective thermal capacity\). These factors  
are collected into a maximum permissible sun input factor  
Smaxo which may not be exceeded by the room-related sun  
input factor S.  
# Wind and airtightness  
EnEV 2007 states that new buildings are to be constructed so  
that the heat-transmitting surface envelope, including joints,  
is sealed **permanently airtight** in accord with the state of the  
technology.  
This means that air infiltration at the joints of the external windows,  
French windows and roof windows must be compliant. As part of  
the EnEV 2007 stipulations, when using **mechanical ventilation**  
**systems** the inclusion in calculations of **heat recovery** or a  
controlled **reduced rate of air changes** is permissible only if the  
airtightness of the building is verified. Ventilation systems must  
also be equipped with means for the user to influence the airflow  
volume per unit of use. It must be ensured that the heat recovered  
from the extract air is used before the heat provided by the heating  
system. In closed condition, there must be compliance with EnEV  
requirements. A test of airtightness \(blower door test\) can be  
taken into account in the calculation of the annual primary energy  
demand for the verification of thermal insulation.  
# Thermal bridges  
Good thermal insulation includes not only highly insulated building  
components, but also the appropriate connections between the  
building elements. There is a danger of additional heat loss at  
these joints and low surface temperature in the building elements  
during the heating period. **Additional consumption of energy** for  
heating and the possibility of condensation and mould formation  
are the result. Thus it should be borne in mind that this thermal  
bridging effect can have considerably worse consequences with  
highly insulated elements than with building elements with less  
thermal insulation. Thermal bridges can be considered, according  
to EnEV, for the determination of the annual heating energy  
demand by increasing the thermal transmission values \(U-values\)  
or in a separate verification. **BUILDING PHYSICS**

Energy pass  
According to the Energy Saving Regulation \(EnEV\), an energy  
pass must be issued within a specified period \(and with certain  
limitations\), for new buildings and for structural alterations, in  
connection with which energetic calculations are carried out for  
the entire building. Normally this also applies to existing buildings  
that are for sale or a new let \(there are exceptions, e.g. listed  
buildings!\).  
The energy pass documents the energy demand or consumption  
of a building and, with a graphic evaluation \(see --7 8\), provides  
a simple comparison with an average similar building  
The procedure for the determination of the energy figures in the  
energy pass is laid down by EnEV \: energy demand is presented  
as annual primary energy demand and final energy demand, and  
energy consumption as the energy consumption value.  
Primary energy demand shows the overall energy efficiency of  
the building. It also takes into account, besides the final energy,  
the supply chain \(e.g. investigation, extraction, distribution,  
conversion\) of the energy source being exploited. Low values  
point to a low demand and thus to high energy efficiency and  
energy use which is light on resources and the environment  
Final energy demand is the annual energy requirement for  
heating, ventilation and hot water \(in non-residential buildings also  
for cooling and lighting\) according to the technical rules and is a  
measure of the energy efficiency of the building and its facilities'  
technology. Low values signal a low demand and thus high energy  
efficiency.  
These figures are calculated on the basis of construction and other  
building-related documents and assume standardised conditions  
\(e.g. climatic data, user behaviour, indoor temperature\). In this  
way, the energetic quality of a building should be documented  
independent of the user behaviour and weather situation, but  
the calculated values permit no forecast of the actual energy  
consumption on account of the standardised conditions.  
The energy consumption value is determined for the building  
based on the heating and hot water cost invoicing. Climatic  
factors are applied to the recorded energy consumption for  
heating to convert this to an average value for Germany. The  
energy consumption value does give an indication of the energetic  
quality of the building and its heating system, but there can be  
clear deviations on account of the differing heating and ventilation  
behaviours of the users.  
EnEV 2007 contains in its annexes samples of energy passes for  
residential and non-residential buildings --7 f\). Energy passes also  
have to be displayed for public buildings \> iOOO m2  
• They are  
issued by qualified neutral building experts and are valid for i 0  
years.  
If measures are possible for the sensible improvement of a  
building's energetic properties, these are appended to the energy  
pass as a modernisation recommendation. The energy pass  
brings advantages when marketing a building, offers a spur to  
investment and provides additional certainty for decisions about  
buying or renting. mean hearing range

BUILDING PHYSICS  
Sound Insulation  
Sound  
Sound propagates as mechanical vibrations and pressure waves,  
which cause very small increases or reductions of pressure,  
measurable in microbars \(\~b\), compared to atmospheric pressure  
\( = 1.0333 kg/cm2\). For example, the pressure variation when  
speaking with a raised voice is about a millionth of an atmosphere.  
Audible sound vibrations lie in a frequency range of 20--20000 Hz  
\(hertz\); 1 Hz = 1 vibration/second \(for sound insulation in building,  
the range between 100 and 3200 Hz is of significance, as this is  
where the human ear is particularly sensitive\). Sound pressures  
within the range of human hearing vary from the audibility threshold  
to the pain threshold\~ 0. This range is divided into 12 parts= 12 B  
\(bel\) \(named after Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone\).  
fJ.s 1/10 bel= 1 decibel \(dB\) is just audible to the human ear as a  
pressure difference at the standard frequency of 1000 Hz, decibels  
are used as the physical measure of sound intensity related to an area  
unit\~ 0. Sound levels are normally given in dB \(A\) or, above 60 dB,  
in dB \(B\), a measure roughly equivalent to the former phon.  
Sound reduction  
Sound reduction denotes all measures undertaken to reduce sound  
transmission from the source to the hearer; it is not possible to  
entirely prevent transmission. If the sound source and the hearer  
are in one room, this is done by sound absorption; if they are in  
different rooms, it is mainly achieved with sound insulation. Sound  
reduction measures are differentiated according to the source of  
the noise into airborne sound \(if the sound source agitates the  
surrounding air\), structure-borne sound \(when the sound source  
agitates a building element\) and impact sound \(structure-borne  
sound typically caused by footsteps on a floor or stairs\).  
The measurement of airborne sound is normally given as the  
weighted sound reduction R'w, i.e. the difference in sound  
level between the room containing the source \(loud room\) and  
the receiving room \(quiet room\), taking into account bypass  
transmission through flanking building elements. For impact  
sound, the analogous parameter to be determined is the  
weighted impact sound level L'n,w·  
The sound is transmitted through air as a longitudinal wave and in  
solid materials as a bending wave\~ f\), The transmission speed  
of a longitudinal wave is 340 m/s, that of a bending wave varies  
according to material, layer thickness and frequency.  
The boundary frequency is that at which the transmission speed  
of the bending wave in a building element is also 340 m/s; at this  
frequency, the transfer of sound out of the air into the building  
element and vice versa is particularly good and thus the sound  
insulation of the element particularly bad, worse than would be  
expected for the wall density. For heavy elements, which bend  
stiffly, the boundary frequency is above, and for thin, soft materials  
is below, the relevant frequency range\~ 0.  
Generally sound insulation is produced by mass, and works  
better with heavy, thick building elements where the sound energy  
first has to transfer from air into the element, then excites the mass  
of the element and then repeatedly transfers from the material  
into the air, which all cause a reduction in sound. If, however,  
the building element is directly excited \(impact sound\), then the  
insulation is naturally less effective.  
Sound-insulating lightweight construction in the form of  
cladding layers, which bend flexibly, and with the cavity filled to  
prevent the internal reflection of the sound, makes use of the  
repeated transfers air-element-air-element \~ e.

# BUILDING PHYSICS  
Sound Insulation  
With **airborne sound,** the sound wave excites the building  
element \~ **0.** so the influence of the boundary frequency on the  
sound insulation increases \~ **0.** DIN 4109 lays down values for  
the sound insulation required to prevent sound transmission from  
neighbouring homes or workplaces \(weighted building sound  
reduction including 'secondary path' transmission R'w\) \~ **0.**  
**Secondary path** transmission reduces the effectiveness of airborne  
sound insulation more than that of irnpact sound insulation. For this  
reason, test certificates for sound-insulated walls should always  
include the consideration of secondary paths normal in a building.  
Particularly effective as secondary paths are panels which bend  
stiffly and have a density of 10-160 kg/m2  
; for this reason, party walls  
between flats or houses should always weigh at least 400 kg/m2  
•  
**Doors and windows** with their low sound insulation values  
\~ **0** have a particularly negative influence on airborne sound  
insulation. Even if their proportion of the wall area is srnall, the  
resulting sound insulation value is mostly less than the arithmetic  
mean of insulation values of wall and opening, which makes the  
sound insulation of the door or window always the first priority.  
**Walls** with insufficient sound insulation can be improved with an  
insulating layer\~ p. 477 **0.** These have particularly good sound  
insulation if they bend flexibly and are supported by soft springy  
insulation \(cavity filling\).  
Soft, flexible cladding layers are relatively insensitive to srnall  
sound bridges \(in contrast to hard cladding layers\).  
Only type-tested construction systerns should be used for sound  
insulation cladding.

Party walls  
The diagram *-1* 0 shows a two-skin party wall with a separating  
joint over the entire depth of the houses. The mass per unit area  
of the individual layers with plaster must be at least 150 kgfm2,  
and the thickness of the separating joint must be at least 30 mni.  
With a thickness of the separating joint \(layer spacing\) of more than  
50 mm, the mass of each skin can be 100 kg/m2  
. The joint cavity  
is to be filled with gap/ess full-surface fibre insulating boards, as  
in DIN 18165 \(impact sound insulation boards or separating joint  
boards approved for this application\) without sound bridges.  
If the skins are constructed of in situ concrete, mineral fibre  
insulating boards with particular suitability for the high loadings  
during concreting are to be used. If the single skins have a weight  
per unit area of more than 200 kg/m2 and the separating joint has  
a thickness of more than 30 mm, no insulation boards have to  
be installed as long as suitable construction measures are taken  
to avoid sound bridges \(e.g. through timber guides removed after  
the wall has been built\).  
For cavity walls, the weighted sound reduction R'w,R can be  
determined from the sum of the weights per unit area of the single  
skins. The continuous separating joint without sound bridges can then  
be assumed to be 12 dB better for the two-skin wall construction.

Impact sound insulation  
Impact sound is caused by the floor slab being directly excited  
to vibration. The standard curve *-1* **8** gives a standard level of  
impact sound, i.e. the maximum level that can be heard in the  
room below, when a standardised 'stamper' is at work above. The  
values immediately after completion must be 3 dB, better to allow  
for the effect of ageing. The normal form of impact sound insulation  
is a floating screed consisting of a gapless soft springy insulation  
layer covered with a protecting layer. The actual screed layer  
can be of cement screed, anhydrite or poured asphalt \(thickness  
laid down in DIN 4109\}. The floating screed also provides the  
required protection against airborne sound and is permissible for  
all types of floor slab \(slab groups I and II\}. The edge is always to  
be constructed to permit free movement *-1* **0** and can only be  
sealed with permanently elastic jointing materials *-1* Cli\), because  
the screed layer is prone to bending and is therefore extremely  
susceptible to sound bridging. When slabs are used which provide  
adequate insulation against airborne sound \(slab groups I and  
II\}, the sound insulation can be provided by a soft springy floor  
covering. Slabs in slab class I can become class II through a  
suspended soft ceiling. The measurement unit of the improvement  
of impact sound insulation through floating screed or soft springy  
floor covering is called the impact sound reduction \(dB\).

Sound from services can occur as **plumbing fixture sound,**  
**pipework sound or filling/emptying sounds.** The **maximum**  
**permissible sound level** from services in neighbouring residential  
units is 35 dB \(A\). Noisy elements of services \(water pipes,  
waste pipes, gas riser pipes, waste disposal units, lifts\} may not  
be installed in the walls of rooms where quiet is required \(living  
rooms, bedrooms\).  
**Plumbing fixture sounds** can be reduced through the  
specification of sound-insulated valves with test certificate.  
Test group I with \:;;\:;20 dB \(A\) fixture sound level is approved  
for anywhere; test group II with ;;;;so dB \(A\) fixture sound level  
is approved only for internal house walls and for walls adjoining  
services rooms. Installing sound dampers can achieve additional  
improvement in all fixtures. **Pipework sounds** are caused by the  
formation of vortices in the pipework. Remediation is possible  
through the specification of bends instead of sharp angles,  
adequate dimensioning and sound-insulated fixtures ---7 **0.**  
**Filling sounds** are caused by water pouring into bathtubs etc.;  
improvement is possible by muffling the objects, fitting aerators  
on the taps or sound-insulating the feet of the bath \(in which case  
the edge has to be permanently elastically sealed\). **Emptying**  
**sounds** \(gurgling\) can be prevented by proper sizing and  
ventilation of drainpipes. **Heating boilers** can be sound-insulated  
by supporting them on insulated supports \(isolated foundation ---7  
**f\)\),** sound-absorbing boiler base, sound-dampening hood for the  
burner, connection to the chimney with sound-insulated leading-in  
tube and to the heating circuit with rubber compensators.  
Sound transmission in **air ducts, ventilation and air**  
**conditioning systems** can be reduced by the fitting of  
silencers. These consist of sound-absorbing packing, between  
which the air flows ---7 **0.** The thicker the packing, the deeper  
the frequencies which are absorbed. Ventilation ducts should  
also be sound-insulated ---7 **0.**  
# Sound absorption  
Sound absorption, in contrast to sound insulation, does not  
normally reduce the transmission of sound through a building  
component. Neither does it influence the sound, which reaches  
the ear directly from the source; it **only reduces the reflected**  
**sound.** Because the direct sound reduces with distance from the  
source, the reflected sound is just as loud or louder than the direct  
sound outside an 'echo' radius around the sound source ---7 **0.**  
If sound reflection is reduced, then the level of reflected sound  
sinks outside the previous echo radius. The sound absorption  
capacity of a room is given in m2 of equivalent sound absorption  
area, the ideal sound-absorbing area, which would have the same  
absorption capacity as the room itself. \(For a reverberation time of  
1.5 s, the equivalent sound-absorbing area \(A\) would have to be  
0.1 m2 per m3 of room volume M; for half the reverberation time,  
it would be twice the size.\)  
# Protection from external noise  
The best protection against noise from outside \(traffic noise, etc.\)\:  
appropriate design of the building - occupied rooms positioned  
on the side away from the noise; sound-insulated construction of  
the external walls; above all, sound-insulated doors and windows;  
installation of sound-insulating blinds on the fagade side; and  
sound protection through landscaping \(embankments, walls,  
planting\). The sound reduction effect of these measures can be  
read from ---7 **0** for various wavelengths \(wavelength approx.

BUILDING PHYSICS  
Sound Insulation  
Structure-borne sound  
Vibrations in solid bodies are described as structure-borne sound.  
This is produced either by airborne sound or by direct mechanical  
excitation -7 **0.**  
Because the alternating mechanical forces are mostly higher than  
those caused by pressure fluctuations in the air, the audible result  
of direct excitation is also normally louder. Resonance phenomena  
often occur, which can lead to louder audible radiation in narrow  
frequency ranges.  
If the radiated airborne sound is monotonic, then the cause is usually  
direct structural excitation. Protection from structure-borne sound  
therefore has to aim at stopping the direct excitation or its propagation.  
Precautions against structure-borne sound transmission  
In water installations, only fixtures of testing mark groups I or II  
should be used; the water pressure should be as low as possible.  
The water velocity is of less significance.  
Baths and shower trays should be supported on floating screed and  
separated from the wall. They should be installed with joints to the wall.  
Wall-hanging WCs cause direct structural sound excitation, but a rigid  
fixing is unavoidable. Elastic layers could perhaps be introduced.  
Water and drain pipes must be fixed with elastic materials and  
should have no contact with the building structure. Pipework is to  
be fixed in accordance with DIN 4109 to walls with surface loading  
\>250 kg/m2 -7 **e.**  
Lifts should be installed in separate shafts Goints filled with \>3 em  
mineral fibre\) -7 **0;** otherwise, the top of the shaft should be elastically  
supported -7 **e.**  
Pumps and equipment must be supported on structure-borne,  
sound-insulated foundations and elastically connected. Expansion  
compensators require stress relievers because the internal pressure  
also acts along the longitudinal axis of the pipe -7 **0.**  
Rubber granulate panels are particularly suitable for insulating  
foundations because of their high compression strength. Impact  
sound insulation of mineral fibre or polystyrene foam could also  
be used in some cases. Cork and solid rubber are unsuitable  
because they are too stiff. The more the insulation compresses  
under loading without being overloaded, the better is the effect.  
For flat insulation layers, the loading should normally be \>0.5 N/mm2  
.  
If this cannot be ensured, then single elements, designed to add to  
the weight of the equipment, should be used. The insulation effect  
is also best in this case if the elements are subjected to maximum  
loading without being overloaded. These single elements can be  
made of neoprene or steel.  
Steel springs have low stiffness, which leads to the best structure-  
borne sound insulation -7 **0.** For some special cases, air springs  
are used. The individual springs should be correctly located in  
relation to the centre of gravity so they are evenly loaded -7 **e.**  
If the excitation is periodic, e.g. vibrating or rotating masses, the  
excitation frequency must not coincide with the natural frequency  
of the elastically mounted system. Any resonance could cause large  
displacements, which could break elements with low damping -7 **0.**  
Particularly good sound insulation is achieved by using double  
elastic suspension -7 **0.** Unfavourable interaction, e.g. foundations  
on floating screed, can lead to a worsening of the situation.

# BUILDING PHYSICS  
Room Acoustics  
The design of room acoustics should produce the optimal  
conditions for listeners to hear speech or music.  
Various factors have to be considered, of which the most important  
is the **reverberation time,** i.e. the time taken for the sound level  
to **drop** by 60 dB after the sound source has ceased ---7 **0.** This is  
evaluated in the range of a drop of -5 to -35 dB.  
Another factor is the **absorption surface** of the room, determined  
by its quantity of absorbing material and the **echo.**  
The calculation of the **reverberation time t** of a **room volume V**  
normally uses the **Sabine formula\:**  
The **degree of sound absorption** Ci.s is material-specific and is  
determined in echo chambers. The **individual surfaces** S \(e.g.  
people, seating, decoration\) of the total sound-absorbing surface  
in the room are entered into the calculation with their specific  
values. The reverberation time is calculated for the frequencies  
f = 125, 250, 500, 1 000, 2000, 4000 Hz. References to medium  
frequency are normally based on 500 Hz.  
If a single, subjectively recognisable peak projects from a regularly  
falling reverberation curve ---7 **0,** this is described as an **echo** ---7  
**f\).** Different values of time and intensity count as echo criteria  
for speech and music. Because rooms intended for music should  
be designed for a longer reverberation time, they are normally  
regarded as less critical with regard to echoes.  
# Requirements for rooms  
# Reverberation time  
The optimal reverberation time depends on the intended use  
\(music, speech ---7 **9\)** and room volume. The reverberation time is  
generally dependent on frequency, i.e. it is longer at deeper, and  
shorter at higher, frequencies. For frequencies of f = 500 Hz, the  
empirically determined values according to ---7 **e** can be given as  
optimal.  
# Speech intelligibility  
This serves to judge the comprehensibility of the spoken word ---7  
**0.** This is not standardised, so various concepts - like sentence,  
and syllable, intelligibility and evaluation with logatomes- are usual.  
For the measurement with logatomes, large groups of listeners  
have to write down individual meaningless syllables, e.g. 'lin', 'ter'  
\(logatomes\), and the degree of correctness is used for evaluation.  
\>70% counts as excellent speech intelligibility. Newer, objective  
processes use modulated rustling signals and lead to reproducible  
results at less expense.  
# Impression of space  
The impression of space describes the perception of the  
reflections emanating from the room according to time and  
direction. For music, diffuse reflections are favourable for sound  
volume, while early reflections with delays of up to approx. 80 ms  
\(corresponding to 27 m of distance\) improve clarity compared with  
direct sound. Speech requires shorter delays, of up to 50 ms, to  
protect comprehension. **0** Berlin Philharmonic\: staggering the rows of seating

# BUILDING PHYSICS  
Room Acoustics  
# Primary structure of rooms  
The design of the primary structure of a room is the most important  
acoustic design criterion. Early side reflections are subjectively  
considered to be better than ceiling reflections, even with very low  
delay times \(because of the asymmetry of the acoustic impression\),  
because the two ears receive different signals. **Narrow, high**  
**rooms with structured, geometrically reflecting walls and**  
**diffusely reflecting ceilings** are therefore the most simple for room  
acoustics.  
The **volume required for good sound** depends on the purpose  
of the room \(--7 p. 482 \(\}\). Guideline values are 4 m3/person for  
speech and 10 m3/person for \(concert\) music. If the volume is too  
small, this allows too little reverberation.  
# Room shape  
For music, narrow, high rooms with structured **walls** \(early side  
reflections\) are particularly suitable. Near the podium, reflection  
surfaces are necessary for early initial reflections and the balance  
of the orchestra. The **back wall** of the room should not cause any  
reflections towards the podium, because this could have an echo  
effect.  
Parallel, unstructured surfaces are to be avoided in order to  
prevent flutter echoes through multiple refection --7 **8.** Providing  
folds in the walls with angles of \>5° can remove the parallel effect  
and achieve diffused reflections --7 **e.**  
**Ceilings** serve to lead the sound into the back of the auditorium  
and must be shaped accordingly --7 **9** - \(\}. If the shape of the  
ceiling is unfavourable, this causes great fluctuations of volume  
through sound concentrations.  
Less favourable are rooms with side walls becoming further apart  
towards the back, because this could make side reflections too  
weak --7 \(\). This disadvantage can be compensated for with  
**additional reflective surfaces** \(Weinberg steps\) in the room or  
a heavy folding of the walls to guide the sound \(e.g. Berlin and  
Cologne Philharmonics --7 **0\).**  
Multi-purpose rooms with variable podiums and level floors are  
often problematic for music. The **location of the podium** should  
if possible be on the narrow side of the room. For speech or small  
rooms \(chamber music\), podiums along the long walls are also  
possible \(Beethoven Archive --7 **0\).** Podiums must be clearly  
raised above the level of the floor in order to assist direct sound  
transmission, because otherwise too much volume is quickly lost --7 **e.**  
**Banking** of the seats is also acoustically advantageous \(uniform  
direct sound to all seats\). The rise of the curve should follow a  
logarithmic spiral --7 **G.**

# Secondary structures  
For the calculation of reverberation time, the entire sound-  
absorbing surface of the room is taken into consideration, i.e. all  
individual surfaces in the room \(e.g. people, seating, decoration\)  
are taken into account, together with their specific degree of  
sound absorption \(---7 Sabine formula p. 482\}.  
The selection, arrangement and material of the **secondary**  
**structures** can largely compensate for the disadvantages  
of an unfavourable primary structure. Flexible \(electronically  
controlled\) sound-insulated surfaces can also achieve adjustable  
reverberation times.  
# Secondary reflection surfaces  
Reflection surfaces can be used to remedy the faults of a primary  
structure \(e.g. walls widening towards the back of the room  
addressed through folding of wall surface; and an undesirable  
ceiling shape through suspended sails or splitting surfaces into  
elements ---7 **0- f\).\)** An appropriately curved ceiling can achieve  
very good sound guidance ---7 **e.**  
**Diffuse reflections\:** Surfaces from which echoes can be expected  
must reflect diffusely, i.e. scatter the sound reaching them ---7 **0.**  
Diffuse reflections lead to flat, uniform reverberation time curves  
through the uniform distribution of sound.  
Structuring of walls by folding surfaces necessitates angles \>5°.  
Prominent surface structures \(parapets, niches etc.\) are also effective,  
through splitting of the sound waves or delayed reflections ---7 **0.**  
# Absorbing surfaces  
Absorbing surfaces can avoid sound concentrations and adapt the  
reverberation time to the required values. The desired reverberation  
time is balanced using a combination of absorbing surfaces with  
different properties. This is determined by their structure\:  
resonant surfaces \(which move with vibrations\) absorb **low**  
**frequencies.** Area, separation and level of cavity filling can be  
varied for fine adjustment ---7 **0.**  
surfaces with openings in front of cavities mostly absorb  
**medium frequencies** \(Helmholtz resonator\); proportion of  
surface taken by hole, cavity volume and damping of cavity  
determine frequency, extent and form of maximum absorption  
# ---70.  
porous materials are used for the absorption of **higher**  
**frequencies.** Layer thickness and flow resistance influence the  
distribution towards lower frequencies ---7 **0.** An appropriate  
alternation of reflecting and absorbing surfaces has an effect  
on the reflection like a serious structuring of the surface ---7 **0.**  
# Seating  
The achievable reverberation time is often determined just through  
absorption by the listeners and the seating. In order to make the  
reverberation time less dependent on the number in the audience,  
a type of seat material is needed which provides such great  
**absorption,** both on the seat and its backrest, that, occupied or  
not, its absorption is the same. Additional absorption surfaces for  
high frequencies are then only necessary if the specific volume  
of the room is significantly exceeded \(---7 p. 482 **0\).** If room  
volume and seating are correctly matched to each other, then it is  
mostly necessary to correct the reverberation time only for lower  
frequencies. BUILDING PHYSICS

At a latitude of 50°, each hour of thunderstorm causes about  
60 lightning strikes to the ground and 200-250 cloud to cloud  
discharges.  
People in the open air are endangered by step voltages within 30m  
of the strike location \(trees, masonry etc.\) Damage to buildings is  
mostly the result of the heat produced by ground strikes, which  
can heat and turn the water content of soil to steam, and of excess  
pressure, which can cause explosive destruction of walls, masts,  
trees etc.  
Lightning protection systems  
A lightning protection system is intended to fix the lightning strike  
using roof conductors and ensure that the building remains inside  
a protected zone \('Faraday cage'\). A lightning protection system  
consists of 'roof conductors', conductor lines and earthing  
rods or electrodes.  
'Roof conductors'  
These are metal lightning rods, conductor lines and roof surfaces.  
No point of the roof should be more than 15 m from the nearest  
'roof conductor'. Structures projecting from the roof, bay windows,  
chimneys and ventilation cowls are of particular significance for  
the detailing of lightning protection systems and should always  
be connected.  
On account of the danger of ignition from the corona effect,  
thatched roofs should have metal bands on timber supports  
60 em above the ridge\~ e- e.  
When a lightning current flows through the earthing resistance,  
this creates a voltage drop, e.g.\: 100 000 Ax 5 em = 500 000 V.  
The entire lightning protection system and all parts with metal  
connections to it are subjected to this potential at the moment  
of a lightning strike. The very effective measure of connecting all  
large metal parts and cables to the lightning protection system is  
described as equipotential bonding.

Surface earthing electrodes \(earthing tapes\) are laid as a ring or

soil type and moisture content \~ \$. If earthing electrode rods  
are driven more than 6 m into the ground, they are described as

Lightning Protection  
**Lightning protection zones**  
The property to be protected is categorised into various lightning  
protection zones \(LPZ\) ---\> **0.**  
**Protection zone OA\:**  
This is outside a building to be protected. Direct lightning strikes  
are possible in this area, and there is an undamped field of  
lightning discharge.  
**Protection zone OB\:**  
The lightning protection equipment on the building to be protected  
results in areas in which direct lightning strikes can be ruled out  
according to the protection class. There is an undamped field of  
lightning discharge. Such areas outside the building are described  
as protection zone OB.  
**Protection zone 1\:**  
This describes the actual building to be protected The boundary  
of protection zone 0 is normally the roof, the external walls and  
the cellar floor of the building to be protected, of which the  
characteristics \(shielding of the external envelope of the building\)  
have to fulfil certain requirements.  
**Protection zone 2 and higher\:**  
It can be sensible, or requested, to provide further protection  
zones inside protection zone **1.** For example, the central server  
room as protection zone 2 and individual electronic devices as  
protection zone 3.

Physical Basics  
# Requirements for daylight in internal rooms  
All rooms for permanent human occupation should be lit with  
sufficient daylight. There should also be a reasonable visual  
connection with the outside. The corresponding requirements are  
essentially laid down in DIN 5034, in the Workplace Guidelines and  
in the state building regulations.  
# Light, wavelength, colour, unit  
Within the range of electromagnetic radiation, visible light is a  
relatively small part, with wavelengths of approx. 380-780 nm --7  
**0.** Light \(daylight and artificial light\) is the range of electromagnetic  
radiation between ultra violet and infra red, which can be  
processed by the eye. The colours of the spectrum in daylight all  
have their wavelength, from violet with relatively short wavelength  
to red with the longest wavelength. Daylight, which is experienced  
by the human eye as white, contains all wavelengths. The analysis  
of wavelengths is of significance for architectural design.  
The intensity of light or illuminance- particularly for artificial light-  
is measured in lux \(lx\), and daylight in internal rooms is given in %.  
# Astronomical basics\: the sun  
The sources of radiation and light-producing daylight are not  
constant. The sun is our 'primary source' for the creation of daylight,  
independent of the time and various weather situations. The angle  
of the earth's axis of 23.5°, the daily rotation of the earth around  
its own axis and the annual rotation of the earth around the sun  
result in the position of the sun depending on date and time for any  
particular place on earth --7 **f\).** This is described by two angles\:  
azimuth a5 and elevation angle Ys  
Azimuth a5 \: projection on plan of the position of the sun, measured  
as the horizontal angle from 0°. oo = north, goo = east, 180° =  
south, 270° =west --7 **8,** as seen by the observer. Elevation angle  
y.\: projection of the position on elevation of the sun above the  
horizon, as seen by the observer --7 **e.**  
**Determination of sun's position**  
There are various methods of determining the position of the sun  
for a particular location, e.g. determination of the azimuth and  
elevation angle.  
On account of the declination of the sun in the course of the year  
--7 **f\)** there are four essential sections of the year \(seasons\) or sun  
positions\: on the equinox dates of 21 May and 23 September, the  
day and night are of equal length and the declination of the sun  
is 0°.  
On 21 December is the winter solstice \(shortest day\) with solar  
declination -23.5°, and the 21 June is the summer solstice \(longest  
day\) with solar declination +23.5°.  
The position of the sun results from the latitude. On the 21/3 and  
the 23/g at noon \(a5 = 180°\), the sun has the same zenith angle  
at each latitude. For example, at latitude 51° north \(London\), the  
zenith angle at noon \(a.= 180°\) is 51°--7 p. 48g **f\).** The elevation  
angle of the sun above the horizon is then goo - 51 o = 3go.  
The sun at noon \(\<Xs = 180°\) stands about 23.5° higher on the 21/6  
than on the 21/3 and the 23/g, that is 3go + 23.5° = 62.5°, and on  
the 21/12, the sun is about 23.5° lower than at the equinoxes, that is  
3go- 23.5° = 15.5°. These differences are the same for all latitudes.  
This enables the corresponding elevation angle of the sun to be  
determined for all latitudes and times of year. DAYLIGHT

To determine the position of the sun, loop-shaped curves are  
drawn for each full hour, with the thick line representing the first  
half of the year and the thin line the second. The loop shape of  
the hourly curves results from the elliptical orbit of the earth and  
the inclination results from the ecliptic. The times given refer to  
the time reference meridian in each case, i.e. the local time at the  
relevant location \(Darmstadt\).  
The intersection points of the daily curves with the hourly curves  
with the same line thickness mark the position of the sun to the  
day and the hour. In the polar diagram, the position of the sun can  
be read from the right angle of the sun \(azimuth\) and the vertical  
angle of the sun \(elevation\) -7 0.  
Projection of the path of the sun  
With the stereographic projections -7 0, the discs supplied can  
be used to determine the path of the sun \(in each case on 21st of  
the month\) according to season and time.  
Sun position, time and date determination  
The position of the sun determines daylight conditions according  
to time of day and date. For purposes of determining daylight  
\(e.g. for sun position diagrams\) solar time is normally given .  
Each location is part of a time zone with uniform local time\: if the  
local time is of interest, then the solar time has to be converted  
into local time = solar time + time conversion + time difference,  
including possible consideration of summer time.

Insolation  
**Determination of insolation on buildings**  
This process enables the insolation on a  
planned building to be read immediately by  
laying a plan drawn on transparent paper  
according to its actual compass direction  
over the table of the sun's path or vice  
versa. The following details of the sun's  
path refer to the area at latitude 51 .5° north  
\(London- Cardiff- Dortmund\} --7 **0.**  
For the southern area at latitude 48° north  
\(Freiburg im Breisgau - Munich - Salzburg  
- Vienna\), 3.5° should be added to the  
calculated solar elevations.  
For the northern area at latitude 55° north  
\{Edinburgh - Newcastle - Bornholm -  
Konigsberg\), 3.5° should be deducted.  
The degrees shown in the second outer  
ring refer to the azimuth, i.e. the angle of  
the projection of the apparent east-west  
movement of the sun on the horizontal  
plane. The standard local times given on  
the outer ring refer within Germany to  
locations at longitude 15° east \(Garlitz  
- Stargard - Bornholm = meridian of  
Central European Time\). For locations at  
longitudes to the east of this, the local time  
is 4 minutes earlier than the standard time  
for every degree of longitude; for locations  
to the west of 15° = 4 minutes later than  
the standard tirne per degree. In London,  
specifically in Greenwich at oo longitude,  
the local time is therefore 60 minutes later  
than the standard time.  
# Duration of insolation  
The possible duration of insolation during  
the days from 21 May to 21 July = 16-  
16% hours, and from 21 November to 21  
January = 8\:4-7% hours. In the months  
between these ranges, the duration of  
insolation changes by almost 2 hours per  
month. The actual amount of insolation  
is scarcely 40% of the above figures on  
account of clouds and mist. The actual  
degree of insolation is highly variable  
according to location. Berlin has relatively  
favourable conditions \(in July almost  
50%, Stuttgart 35%\). Exact details can be  
obtained from the official weather services  
covering the particular area.  
# Sun and warmth  
The natural warmth in the open air depends  
on the position of the sun and the release  
of heat by the ground. The warmth curve  
is delayed by about 1 month compared to  
the solar elevation curve, which means that  
the warmest days are not around 21 June  
but rather the later days of July, and the  
coldest days are not around 21 December  
but in the later part of January. Naturally  
the conditions at any specific location can  
vary widely in this respect as well. N

The correct alignment of a building and its windows to the sun,  
in order to exploit its beneficial effects or to provide protection  
against its excessive heat, is decisive for the practicality of a  
building. Sunshine entering all rooms in the autumn and winter,  
and in the morning, is desirable. Sunshine at midday and in the  
afternoon in June to August is not desirable. Correct alignment of  
the building """"' \~  
- **0** and the appropriate construction measures  
""""' **G\) - 4D** can fulfil these requirements. The form of window  
reveals and glazing bar profiles should not unduly impair the entry  
of sunlight. High windows allow the sun to shine deeply into a

Shadow  
# Sun position, shadow, aids  
The following equipment is available for the determination and  
checking of the actual sunshine or shadowing inside and outside a  
building according to geographical location, time of day and year,  
construction details and local conditions\:  
# Graphical shadow construction  
The determination of the shadow thrown by a building can be  
constructed using the projected path of the sun \~ p. 489 **e** +  
**0** on plan and in elevation. For example, the shadowing of a  
courtyard in Brighton, UK, latitude 51 o north, is to be constructed  
for 21 March at 16\:00. The sun is shining at this time at an  
azimuth angle \(o\:81 \) of 245° and an elevation \(y81 \) of 20° \~ p. 489  
**0.** The layout plan is aligned with north. The shadow direction  
is determined by the horizontal building edges and a parallel  
displacement of the sunshine direction \(o\:81 = 245°\) through the  
corners of the building. The length of the shadow is determined  
by the vertical building edges, so the actual building height \(h\)  
is constructed folded down onto the plan and with the elevation  
angle of 20°. The intersection with the shadow direction gives  
the shadow length.  
# Panorama mask  
In many countries, a representation of the path of the sun is  
available for various geographical areas with details of azimuth  
and elevation, day and time of year. These panorama masks  
are copied onto transparent film and used at the location  
under investigation by holding them in the direction the sun  
will come from \~ **f\).** Looking through the panorama template,  
any shadowing from the surroundings, including overhead  
shadows, can be transferred at 1 \:1 onto the copied path of  
the sun \~ **E\).** The film can therefore be used to determine  
shadowing and sunshine on fagades or in building recesses to  
the correct scale.  
# Horizontoscope  
This is a tool to determine the real sun and shadow conditions on  
the building site, on or in a building. The horizontoscope consists  
of a transparent dome representing the sky, a compass, a base  
and exchangeable curve sheets, which can be laid underneath for  
light, radiation or heat as required.  
The principle of the horizontoscope is to construct the prev.  
ailing light and shadow conditions, e.g. for a room \~ **e.** At  
a particular point in the room, the projection of a window  
opening on the sky dome, and at the same time the curve sheet  
beneath it, can be used to show the actual opening section  
and the incoming light. This makes it possible to determine the  
sunshine conditions and also the lighting effects for any point  
in the room, depending on the alignment of the building, for any  
time of day and year\~ **e.**  
# Model and computer simulation  
In order to be able to establish the exact annual shadowing  
or sunshine around, in and on a building, it is recommended  
to construct a scale model under an artificial sun and also to  
test the design with a computer simulation. The model gives  
an immediate idea of the rooms and the effect of the lighting.  
Because the parallel sunlight is modelled with a 60-100 em  
concave mirror, the model cannot be larger. Computer  
simulations can be used to determine exact daylight quotients,  
illuminances and distributions of luminance, but normally do  
not give information about the mood and effect of lighting in  
the room.

DAYLIGHT  
Radiation Energy  
Meteorological conditions  
The heat radiation and the intensity of daylight reaching the  
earth's surface over the course of a year is determined by  
the geographical latitude, the weather and various states  
of the sky \(clear, clouded, hazy, partially clouded etc.\) \~  
**e.** The following facts are relevant to typical daylight and  
sunshine duration\:  
The year has 8760 hours. The duration of 'bright daylight'  
averages approx. 4300 hours per year.  
The number of hours of sunshine in Germany varies between  
1300 and 1900 hours per year\~ **0,** of which at least % are  
in the summer half of the year\~ European Sun Atlas.  
For most of the year, that is about 2/3 of the daylight hours,  
only more or less diffuse sunlight reaches the earth on  
account of the local weather conditions.  
Global radiation  
Direct and indirect solar radiation on the earth's surface  
\(global radiation\) creates a locally variable climate and  
light environment on the surface \~ **0 - f\).** The global  
radiation creates 'heat and light' simultaneously, i.e. the  
short-wave solar radiation is converted into long-wave  
radiation \{heat\) at the surface - the greenhouse effect.  
This heat should be exploited passively and actively in  
architecture, and also the simultaneous daylight.  
The locally specific light and heat conditions therefore  
require a precise analysis in order to exploit them for optimal  
daylight in and around a building.  
Radiation\: physical basics  
Solar radiation is a very 'fickle' source of light and heat.  
Only a small part of the sun's energy is transferred to the  
ground as heat because the earth's atmosphere weakens  
the solar radiation or makes it seem irregular in intensity. This  
reduction is essentially due to various diffusion processes  
like scattering, reflection and absorption of the radiation by  
dust and mist particles \{the cause of diffused daylight\) and  
the water vapour, carbon dioxide and ozone content in the  
air\~e.  
Distribution of the total energy at the surface\: about 6% of  
ultra violet radiation in the wavelength range 0.2-0.38 lJ.m,  
about 50% of visible radiation in the wavelength range 0.38-  
0.78 lJ.m \{the maximum lies at 0.5 f.!m in the visible range\)  
and about 40% infra red radiation in the wavelength range  
0.78-3.0 lJ.m.  
Solar radiation reaching the ground is shown in \~ **e.** The  
solar constant to be applied in the central European region is  
about 1300 W/m2 on a vertically radiated area.  
Lighting and radiation strength  
The power of the radiation is reduced by very thick cloud  
cover to about 200 W/m2 and with only diffused radiation  
\{cloudy sky with completely covered sun\) to about 50-  
200 W/m2  
\~ **e.** This also applies analogously to the  
strength of the daylight in lux\~ **e.** \_\_W-12

even a window width of 100% may not be sufficient.  
Daylight inside buildings with window lighting  
The daylight inside buildings can be evaluated according  
to the following quality criteria and scales\: illuminance  
and brightness; uniformity, Dmin/Dma\~; reflection; colour  
rendering; glare; room lines, shadowing; view out.  
Basics  
The evaluation of the daylight inside buildings is always based  
on the illuminance of the clouded sky \(i.e. diffuse radiation\).  
Daylight entering an interior through a window at the side is  
measured by the daylight factor D. This describes the ratio of  
the interior illuminance \(Ei\) to the illuminance outside at the  
same time \(Ea\)\: D = Ei \: Ea x 100%. The daylight in interiors  
is always given in per cent, for example outside illuminance  
5000 lx and inside illuminance 500 lx gives D = 10%. The  
daylight factor is always constant, and the interior illuminance  
alters only in relationship to the outside illuminance at the  
same time. The outside illuminance of the clouded sky varies  
according to the time of day and year\: 5000 lx in the winter,  
and up to 20,000 lx in the summer\~ 0.  
Daylight distribution in interiors  
The daylight factor at a point \(P\) is a combination of many  
influential factors\: D = \(DH + DV +DR\) x 1\: x k1 x k2 x k3 \~f\).  
where\:  
1. DH =component of light from sky- daylight incidence \< a0  
2. DV =building component  
3. DR= interior reflection component  
4. 1\: = light transmittance of glazing  
5. k1 = glazing bars and window construction component  
6. k2 =glazing bars  
7. k3 = angle of incidence of daylight  
8. window position and size\~ f\).  
The reference plane for the horizontal illuminance of  
window lighting is provided in DIN 5034 \~ f\). The level  
of the windowsill is assumed at 0.85 m and the distance  
to the surrounding surfaces of the room is 1 m. On this  
reference plane, the points \(EP\) to be named for the  
horizontal illuminance are determined. The corresponding  
DAYLIGHT  
\(to be determined\) daylight factors can then be displayed

as a curve of daylight factors \~ 8 + e. The shape of this

Basics  
The lighting of interiors with daylight from above is subject *to*  
the same basic principles and conditions as for windows at the  
sides, that is natural lighting under a cloudy sky. Whereas light  
from the sides creates relatively poor uniformity, this is different  
with lighting from above. In interiors the quality of daylight  
coming from rooflights is mainly determined or influenced by the  
following factors\: light density at the zenith, room proportions,  
room reflection, rooflight opening and reduction factors. The  
work area --\> **0** in a room is placed precisely as far from a  
window as from the rooflight above. If the same illuminance  
is to be produced on the reference plane \(0.85 m above sill  
level\) through the side window as through the rooflight, then  
the window area would have to be 5.5 times larger than the  
roof opening.  
Reason\: light from above is brighter. The zenith illuminance is  
three times that at the horizon. So 100% of the light from the sky  
reaches the rooflight, whereas only 33.3% of the light from the sky  
reaches the windows at the sides. The lighting of a room 'from  
above' \(light incidence\) depends on the room proportions, i.e.  
the length, width and height. The 'cave effect' should be avoided

The maximum illuminance through a side window, in contrast,  
is achieved only near the window. With a vertical rooflight, the  
lowest illuminance is on the reference plane. There is therefore a  
reduction factor \(ky\) for the amount of light entering, depending  
on the different pitches of the roof openings. In --\> **Q** \(b\), the  
corresponding reduction factors \(ky\) are shown for sheds with  
various pitches.  
The diffused radiation falling on the rooflight is, however, also  
affected by its construction and installation depth before it  
supplies the interior with daylight. --\> **e** demonstrates the  
different amounts of light entering through various proportions  
of the shaft below the rooflight cover. Excessively high and  
massive shaft construction or installation depths should  
therefore be avoided. A delicate, highly reflective construction  
is recommended.

Quality Criteria  
# Illuminance, degree of reflection and colour rendering  
The interaction of these parameters of daylight has a great  
influence on the brightness inside a room. In order to fulfil certain  
visual tasks, various levels of illuminance are required, according  
to the type of activity --7 **0.**  
So the specification of the degree of reflection for the surrounding  
surfaces of the interior has to be appropriate for the visual tasks  
to be carried out. The different structuring of brightness in a room  
is directly dependent on the degree of reflection of the surfaces  
and the different arrangements of windows in the fagade --7 **f\)** --7  
p. 496 **e.**  
The uniformity \(G\) of the daylight in the interior should beG *E* Dminl  
Dmax 1 \:6 for lighting from windows --7 **8,** and G *E* 1 \:2 --7 **0** for  
lighting from above. This generally determines the characteristics  
of light distribution in the interior. Rooflight lighting is more uniform  
because the light density at the zenith is three times greater than  
at the horizon.  
The uniformity can be influenced by variation of the following  
factors\:  
- degree of reflection \(if very high\)  
- deflecting the light with shades  
- arrangement of the windows.  
# Glare  
Glare is caused by direct and indirect reflection from surfaces and  
by unfavourable contrasts of light density. Measures to avoid glare  
are\:  
- external sun protection \(shades\)  
- glare protection inside and outside in combination with sun  
protection  
- matt surfaces  
- correct positioning of daylight-enhancing lighting  
# Shadow formation  
Shadow formation is beneficial to some extent in order to  
be able to differentiate objects in the room --7 **0.** Measures  
to increase three-dimensional shadow formation under side  
lighting are\:  
- sun protection  
- glare protection \(even in the north\)  
balanced daylight distribution  
no direct glare  
multi-layered or staggered fagade.  
Measures for such shadow formation with rooflights\:  
- --7 **0.** Filter incoming daylight at the underside of the light  
opening with translucent materials, light grating or similar.  
- daylight-enhancing lighting  
bright, matt surfaces combined with coloured differentiation  
\(e.g. supporting structure\).  
# Summary\: quality criteria for daylight from side windows  
It is generally best to implement the above daylight quality  
criteria so as to create spatial identity. The distribution of  
daylight in interiors and the possibilities of seeing out are mainly  
determined by the design of the fagade at the transition from  
inside to outside. A staggered, multi-layered and at the same  
time transparent transition from interior to exterior can cope  
with the various requirements for daylight during the changing  
seasons. 1---;s14.0 -----1

# Systems  
The following systems are  
available for light direction\:  
1. **Reflection** of undesirable  
heat radiation with special  
coatings \(combi-glass\).  
Different types of coating  
and sequences of panes  
can be used to determine  
the energy transmittance  
\(g-value \), the light  
transmittance \(LT-value\),  
the light reflectance  
\(mirror effect\) and the  
colour rendering.  
2. **Shading** of direct  
sunshine and exploitation  
of diffused zenith light.  
Mainly rigid systems,  
which reflect the direct  
sunshine's light. Mirrors,  
prisms, or other light-  
directing components are  
integrated permanently  
into the window or glass  
construction. They must  
be selected according to  
their alignment to the sun.  
3. **Direction and scattering**  
of direct sunlight, normally  
reflection onto the ceiling  
in order to avoid glare.  
Movable systems, which  
can be adapted to the  
current angle of the sun,  
are necessary for this  
purpose.  
4. **Collection and**  
**forwarding** of direct  
sunlight. Heliostats collect  
suniight and transport it  
to the intended location  
by mirroring. The  
necessary precision of  
these systems requires  
expensive production  
and maintenance. In  
particular, the wide  
dimensional tolerances  
in the building have to be  
taken into account.

# Natural sun protection  
Deciduous trees offer natural  
sun protection in summer. In  
winter, the leafless trees allow  
warmth and light into the  
room.  
# Systems  
System selection depends  
mainly on the compass direc-  
tion of the window to be pro-  
tected. On north sides, direct  
sunshine can only be expected  
in the mornings in June and July  
and simple internal systems are  
sufficient. If the alignment is  
largely west or east, movable  
systems should shade the low  
sun.  
South windows need effective  
shading above all in the early  
year and autumn, with low  
sun. In the high summer, slight  
roof overhangs are sufficient to  
avoid direct sunshine.  
If external closed shading  
components \(awnings, shut-  
ters\) are used, it must be  
possible for the heat build-up  
behind the component to es-  
cape. Such systems are not  
suitable for rooms with natural  
ventilation.

LIGHTING  
Artificial Lighting  
Lighting parameters  
The radiated power perceived by the eye is described as luminous  
flux F. The luminous flux radiated per solid angle in a defined  
direction is the luminous intensity I. The luminous intensity of a  
lamp in all directions of radiation gives its distribution, generally  
displayed as a luminous intensity distribution curve \(LIDC\) \~  
p. 503 **f\).** The LIDC describes the radiation of a lamp as narrow,  
medium or wide beam and as symmetrical or asymmetrical. The  
luminous flux reaching a unit of area is the illuminance E. Typical  
values are\:  
Global radiation \(clear sky\)  
max. 100,000 lx  
Global radiation \(cloudy sky\)  
max. 20,000 lx  
Optimal for seeing  
2000 lx  
Minimum at workplace  
200 lx  
Orientation lighting  
20 lx  
Street lighting  
10 lx  
Moonlight  
0.21x  
Luminance L is a measure of the perceived brightness. The  
luminance of lamps is relatively high and can lead to glare. This  
results in the requirement for shading of lamps in interiors. The  
luminance of surfaces in a room is a function of the illuminance E  
and the reflectance \(L = E x r/p\). Lamps convert electrical power  
\(W\) into luminous power \(lumen, lm\). A further measure is luminous  
efficacy \(lm/W\).  
Lamps  
Artificial lighting sources consist of lamp and fitting. The part  
producing the light is described as the lamp. Fittings serve to hold  
the lamp and distribute the light \(scattering, glare shading\). Lamps  
are differentiated, according to the principle of light production,  
into filament lamps and discharge lamps \~ **0.**  
1. Filament lamps  
Filament lamps are temperature radiators, in which a filament is  
made to glow to produce light. A large part of the energy produced  
is therefore heat radiation \(infra red\) and a relatively small part is  
visible light \(approx. 15-20%\). Typical features of filament lamps\:  
light warm white colour, can be dimmed without limitation, *very*  
good colour rendering, operation without flickering. Further  
characteristics\: low luminous efficacy \(approx. 6-12 lm!W\), short  
lifetime of lamps at about 1000 hours.  
Halogen filament lamps achieve high luminance with their  
compact construction. The bulb contains a halogen gas, which  
prevents tungsten from the glowing filament being deposited  
on the inside of the bulb and reducing the luminous efficacy.  
The small dimensions of the lamps enable compact fittings with  
*very* good bundling properties, thus making them *very* suitable  
for narrow beam spotlights. Halogen lamps produce brilliant  
light, further properties\: better luminous efficacy \(up to 24 lm/W\)  
than simple light bulbs; lamp lifetime approx. 4000-6000 hours  
\(for low-voltage halogen lamps\). For lamp power ratings of up to  
75 W, low-voltage 12 V lamps are mostly used, which require a  
transformer for connection to mains power. For power ratings of  
75-2000 W, 220 V mains lamps are suitable.

# LIGHTING  
Lamps  
# 2\. Discharge lamps\:  
Light bulbs or tubes contain a gas, which is made to glow by  
the application of a voltage. Typical characteristics of discharge  
lamps\: operation generally with ballast and in some cases starter  
device; high luminous efficacy and relatively long lamp lifetime,  
5000-20,000 h; little heat production; light colour, according to  
the type of lamp\: warm white, neutral white or daylight white;  
colour rendering moderate to very good; lamps cannot always be  
dimmed. Flicker-free operation is only possible with the use of an  
electronic ballast. Discharge lamps are differentiated according to  
the type of gas used and the gas pressure in the tube.  
# Fluorescent lamps  
Also known as fluorescent tubes, these are the commonest  
discharge lamp. The discharge causes mostly UV radiation inside  
the tube and this is converted into visible radiation by a coating  
inside the tube. Luminous efficacy 104 lm/W. In the description,  
the number after the **T** gives the diameter of the tube in mm *\(T* 16  
= 16 mm diameter\) or in 1Ja in *\(T* 5 = 5 x Va in - 16 mm\). Smaller  
diameters enable more precise direction of light in the lamps. The  
ballast is nowadays normally controlled electronically.  
Fluorescent lamps are used in offices and commercial buildings in  
**ceiling grids.** The light mostly shines directly downwards ---7 **0** or  
**in light bands** and **linear luminaires** \(shining directly or indirectly\).  
This enables uniform overall lighting, similar to daylight, with mild  
shadow formation.  
# Compact fluorescent lamps  
These have been developed as a replacement for filament light  
bulbs. The ballast is normally integrated into the screw base. Their  
luminous efficacy is not as good as that of fluorescent tubes.  
# Fluorescent tubes for advertising displays  
Glass tubes filled with inert gas \(e.g. neon, thus the common name  
neon lighting\) are subjected to a voltage. The tubes then light up  
in various colours according to the gas. The tubes can be curved  
as required before filling with gas, so that writing, ornaments and  
depictions of figures are possible. They are easily controllable  
using regulating resistors or transformers and are often used in  
cinemas, theatres, sales outlets and advertising.  
# Mercury vapour and sodium vapour high-pressure lamps  
In high-pressure lamps, an arc between electrodes creates the  
light. They have a long lifetime and high luminous efficacy, but  
poor colour rendering \(mercury\: blue, sodium\: yellow\). They are  
therefore mostly used for the lighting of factories, works sheds,  
stores and street lighting. Coated mercury high-pressure lamps  
have improved colour rendering.  
# Metal vapour and halogen high-pressure lamps  
These produce a light with good colour rendering values \(the light  
colours white, warm tone, and daylight are possible\) and high  
luminous efficacy. The compact point light source enables precise  
direction of the light. The high luminance and a high UV share  
of the light must be taken into account in the selection of lamps  
to avoid glare, reflection and the fading of objects susceptible to  
UV radiation. If fitted with ceramic burners, these lamps are more  
colour-stable over their lifetime.  
# Light-emitting diode \(LED\) lamps  
A solid-body crystal is made to glow by the application of direct  
current \(recombination of electrons in a semi-conductor\). The colour  
is determined by the choice of crystal. White light is produced by a  
combination of coloured LEOs or through luminescent phosphors,  
which convert the originally coloured light into white. The luminance  
values today are similar to low-voltage halogen lamps, but will be  
improved further in the future. Advantages\: small size of the light  
source, little degradation of the lighting performance over the  
lifetime, no infra red or ultra violet radiation, no impact susceptibility,  
long lifetime \(approx. 25,000-50,000 h\) LIGHTING

# LIGHTING  
Types of interior lighting Types of Lighting  
Direct, symmetrical lighting -\> **0** is preferred for the general  
lighting of workrooms, meeting rooms, rooms with public access  
and traffic zones. Relatively little electrical power is required to  
achieve a specified lighting level. Guideline values for specific  
mains consumption -\> p. 508 **0.** The shading angle of the light  
fittings in work and meeting rooms is 30°, in conditions of very  
high visual comfort 40° and more. For the design of a lighting  
system, a radiation angle of between 70° and goo should be the  
first assumption.  
Downlight wallwasher, ceiling grid wallwasher -\> **f\).** For use  
near the wall for uniform wall illumination. The effect in the room  
is of indirect lighting.  
Wallwasher on power supply rail -\> **8.** Uniform illumination of  
the wall with a part also lighting the room. According to the chosen  
spacing of the light fittings, illuminance of up to 500 lx \(vertical\)  
can be achieved. The use of fluorescent or halogen filament lamps  
is also possible \(see below also and **-\>G\).**  
Wallwasher for ceiling installation -\> **G.** With no room  
component, this only illuminates the wall, using halogen filament  
or fluorescent lamps.  
Downlight directional spotlight -\> **0.** Regular arrangement  
of light fittings in the ceiling can achieve spatially differentiated  
lighting. The relatively closely bundled reflectors can be rotated  
vertically up to 40° and horizontally through 360°. Halogen filament  
lamps can be used, particularly low-voltage.  
Indirect lighting -\> **0.** This approach to lighting can produce a  
bright impression in the room, even at a low level of lighting and  
without reflected glare. Sufficient room height is a precondition.  
Careful matching of the lighting and the ceiling architecture is  
necessary. For the lighting of workplaces, an upper limit to ceiling  
luminance of 1000 cd/m2 \(above the radiation angle of 65°\) should  
be observed. Indirect lighting requires up to three times the energy  
consumption of direct.  
Direct/indirect lighting-\> **f\).** On account of the bright impression in  
the room and the reasonable energy consumption \(70% direct, 30%  
indirect\), direct/indirect lighting is preferred as long as the ceiling  
height is sufficient \(h \~ 3 m\). Fluorescent tubes are mostly used, or  
in combination with halogen filament and filament lamps \(seldom\).  
Ceiling uplighter, floor downlighter -\> **0 - 0** are used for  
the area lighting of ceilings or floors. The lamps can be halogen  
filaments, fluorescent tubes or high-pressure discharge lamps.  
Wall light -\> **\{D\).** Predominantly for decorative wall lighting - also  
light effects, e.g. colour filters and prisms. There is also some  
limited lighting of the ceiling and floor.  
Wallwasher on power supply rail -\> **4D** does not light the room  
and is used particularly for exhibitions and in museums. Vertical  
lighting level from 50 lx, 150 lx and 300 lx can be produced for the  
lighting of displays.  
Narrow beam on power supply rail -\> **0.** Preferred radiation  
angles\: 1 oo \('spot'\), 30° \('flood'\), goo \('washer'\). The light cone  
from narrow beam lights can be altered with lenses \(sculpture  
lenses and Fresnel lenses\); the spectrum can be altered with ultra  
violet or infra red filters \(in museums, exhibitions, shops\) or colour  
filters. Glare protection is through louvres or anti-glare flaps.

LIGHTING  
Quality Criteria  
Quality criteria for lighting  
A good lighting design must satisfy functional and ergonomic  
requirements while taking cost-effectiveness into account. In  
addition to these quantitative demands, qualitative, above all  
architectural, criteria must be observed.  
Quantitative criteria  
Lighting level  
In contrast to former standards, DIN EN 12464 no longer specifies  
an average illuminance, but an illuminance at locations where  
visual work is carried out. In such places, the uniformity must be  
0.7, and 0.5 in comparison with the surroundings.  
Light direction ---7 **0**  
The light should preferably fall sideways onto the work area; the  
precondition for this is a wing-shaped LIDC ---7 p. 503 **f\).**  
Glare limitation ---7 **0 - 0**  
The glare to be limited includes direct glare, reflection glare and  
mirroring on monitor screens. Limitation of direct glare is achieved  
by the use of luminaires with shading angles of \~30°.  
The formation of reflections is prevented by the light falling  
sideways onto the work area in connection with using matt surfaces  
around the working environment ---7 **0 + 0.** Mirror reflections on  
screens can be limited through appropriate screen positioning.  
Lights which could nonetheless cause screen reflections must  
have a luminance of \~200 cd/m2 \(use of high-gloss reflectors\).  
Distribution of luminance  
The harmonic distribution of luminance is the result of a careful  
matching of all reflectances in the room ---7 **f\).** The luminance of  
indirect lighting should not exceed 400 cd/m2•  
Colour of light and colour rendering ---7 p. 505 @\)  
The colour of the light is determined by the choice of lamps. There  
are three light colour groups\: warm white light \(colour temperature  
under 3300 K\), neutral white light \(3300 K-5000 K\) and daylight  
white light \(over 5000 K\). In offices, lighting is normally chosen  
to produce warm white and neutral white. The colour rendering,  
which is determined by the spectral composition of the light,  
should generally be 1 \(very good colour rendering\).  
Calculation of point illuminance levels ---7 **0 - 0**  
Illuminances \(horizontal Eh and vertical Ev\) produced by individual  
lights can be determined from the luminous intensity and the  
spatial geometry using the law of photometric distance \(height h,  
distance d and lighting angle a\).

Illuminance  
**Calculation of mean illuminance**  
In practice, it is often necessary to make a rough determination of  
mean illuminance values \(Enl for a given amount of electrical power  
used by lights, or to determine the use by the lights of electrical power  
P for a required illuminance level. En and P can be approximately  
determined by using the formula -7 **0.** The required mains power P\*  
depends on the type of lights used -7 **0,** referring to direct lighting.  
The correction factor k depends on the size of the room and the  
reflectance of the walls, ceiling and floor -7 **f\).** If calculations have  
to be made for rooms containing various types of lighting then the  
components are calculated singly and added together -7 **e.**  
The calculation of illuminance using the specific mains power is  
also applicable to office spaces. A two-axis room with an area  
of 24 m2 is in this example -7 **0** fitted with four lights. With an.  
assembly of 2 x 36 W \(mains power including ballast 90 W\), then  
according to -7 **e** the illuminance is approx. 375 lx.  
In offices, in addition to conventional mirrored ceiling grid fittings,  
square ceiling luminaires with compact fluorescent lamps -7 **0** or  
light structures -7 **e** are often installed. Light structures enable  
the combination with bus bars for the mounting of spotlights.  
# Floodlighting buildings  
The luminous flux required for floodlighting can be calculated  
using the formula -7 **Ci\).** The luminance levels are between 3 cd/  
m2 \(free-standing buildings\) and 16 cd/m2 \(buildings in very bright  
surroundings\).

# FIRE PROTECTION  
Basics  
Buildings must be constructed so that the **start of fire,** and  
the **spread of fire and smoke,** are prevented, and **rescue of**  
**people** and animals and **effective fire fighting** are possible.  
Consequently there are requirements concerning flammability of  
building materials, building components' duration of fire resistance  
\(fire resistance rating\), the sealing of closures to openings and the  
provision of escape routes.  
There are basically three categories of preventative fire protection  
measures ---7 **0\:**  
**Construction measures** apply to the design \(e.g. escape routes,  
number and construction of stairwells and the formation of fire  
compartments\). They also apply to all construction solutions for  
the building and its components \(e.g. minimum cross-sections,  
envelope, claddings and coatings, provision of riser pipes,  
installation of fire protection doors and glazing etc.\). **Technical**  
**fire protection measures** include all technical precautions,  
which activate automatically in case of fire \(e.g. smoke and fire  
detector systems, sprinkler systems, smoke and heat extraction  
systems\). **Organisational fire protection measures** describe the  
appointment of a fire protection representative and the creation of  
a fire safety organisation and plans.  
The general construction requirements for preventative fire  
protection are based on the state building regulations \(LBO\) or  
the **model building regulations \(MBO\)** that they are derived from\:  
For buildings in **building classes 1-5,** the MBO include, in  
addition to fire protection requirements, the provision of clearance  
or setback areas ---7 p. 64 and regulations for the detailing of load-  
bearing walls, columns, external walls, partitions, fire compartment  
walls, slabs and roofs ---7 p. 514-516 and requirements for the  
provision of escape routes.  
**Special buildings** are subject to special fire protection  
requirements, which are laid down in additional regulations  
and provisions. **At the design phase of such a building, a**  
# fire protection expert must be appointed to produce a fire  
# protection plan.  
For a selection of significant technical rules for fire protection  
---7 **e.**  
# Escape routes  
Residential or commercial units with at least one occupied room  
must have at least **two independent escape routes leading to**  
**the open air** on each storey. \(If the units are not at ground level,  
the first escape route must be via a **legally essential staircase, if**  
**required in its own \{legally essential\) stairwell,** and the second  
escape route via a second essential staircase or a single unified  
location which is accessible with the rescue equipment of the  
local fire brigade ---7 **8.** From every location in an occupied room,  
there must be within max. 35 m at least one exit into a legally  
essential stairwell or into the open air ---7 **0.** A second escape  
route is not required if escape is via a **safety stairwell ---7 0,** into  
which fire and smoke cannot penetrate due to the provision of 'fire  
balconies' or safety vestibules with forced ventilation ---7 p. 246  
High-rise buildings.  
The material and construction of legally essential staircases and the  
location, construction, surfaces and openings of legally essential  
stairwells are subject to special fire protection requirements. For  
**legally essential corridors,** through which the escape routes from  
occupied rooms or units lead to legally essential stairwells or to  
the open air, there are also particular fire protection requirements.

# FIRE PROTECTION  
Classification  
The model building regulations \(MBO\) differentiate requirements  
for fire resistance into\: fire-resistant, highly fire-retarding and  
fire-retarding **building components** made of completely non-  
flammable materials or with just the structural parts made of non-  
flammable materials; special building components \(with special  
fire protection requirements\); and associated **building materials,**  
divided, according to their fire behaviour, into non-combustible,  
flame-resistant, normally flammable and readily flammable.  
Building components and materials are categorised into classes  
according to their fire behaviour. For purposes of classification, the  
state building regulations \(LBO\) differentiate between **regulated,**  
**non-regulated** and other building products. Regulated building  
products essentially comply with the standards and other  
technical regulations included in the **construction products**  
**lists** of the German Institute for Building Technology \(DiBt\). The  
permissibility of using non-regulated products must be verified by  
a national technical test certificate, a national technical approval  
or a single-case approval.  
**Classification** is according to DIN 4102 or DIN EN 13501\. These  
standards classify building materials according to building material  
classes --7 **0** and building components according to fire resistance  
classes --7 **0 - f\). Classifications are applicable according to**  
**either DIN 4102 or DIN EN 13501 for the verification of the fire**

Fire Compartment Walls  
According to the MBO, **fire compartment walls** are to be  
constructed in the following locations\: the **external walls**  
of buildings, when the wall is less than 2.50 m from the plot  
boundary; between terraced buildings on the same plot boundary;  
and to **sub-divide** larger buildings into fire compartments of not  
more than **40 m.**  
Fire compartment walls must be fireproof, structurally stable when  
exposed to fire and consist of non-combustible materials **\(F 90A\).**  
They must normally extend continuously from the foundations to  
**min. 30 em above the roof** \(min. 50 em for a soft roof covering and  
in industrial buildings\) or be capped with a projecting slab -\> **0.**  
For low buildings, they must continue to immediately under the roof  
covering. **Cables and pipes** which penetrate fire compartment  
walls must have a 90 min fire resistance class. **Openings in fire**  
**compartment walls** are generally **impermissible.They** can be  
allowed through fire compartment walls within buildings and then  
have to be provided with fireproof self-closing doors **\(T 90 door**

FIRE PROTECTION  
Building Components  
Walls, columns  
The MBO lay down requirements for walls and columns, of which  
the essential features are\:  
Load-bearing and bracing walls and columns must be  
constructed fireproof in buildings of class 5, highly fire-retarding  
in buildings of class 4 and fire-retarding in buildings of classes  
1 and 2\). This does not apply to the uppermost storeys of roof  
spaces without occupied rooms above them and balconies. In  
cellars, they have to be constructed fireproof and, in buildings of  
classes 1 and 2, fire-retarding.  
Non-load-bearing external walls and non-load-bearing parts of  
load-bearing external walls are \(except for buildings of building  
classes 1-3\) to be constructed of non-combustible \(at least fire-  
retarding\) materials. External wall claddings, including insulation  
and support construction, have to be made of flame-resistant  
materials. For buildings of classes 1 and 2, external wall claddings  
of normally flammable materials are permissible, if the spread of  
fire to neighbouring buildings is effectively prevented.

applicable standards. The verification is normally through a test certificate.  
- building materials of classes A and 81, for which approval marks have been issued;  
these are normally issued to the manufacturer.  
e Combustibility of construction materials \(selection\)  
Separating walls  
The fire resistance duration of separating walls between residential  
or commercial units \(or units and rooms used otherwise\) must  
correspond to the quality of the load-bearing components of the  
storey. These must extend to the structural slab \(in roof spaces up  
to the roof cladding\). Openings are limited to the size and number  
required for their use and must be closed by components which  
are at least fire-retarding, sealed and self-closing.  
Construction  
Classified materials for the construction of conventional massive  
load-bearing or non-load-bearing walls are shown in --7 0. Steel  
columns and steel supporting beams are today normally fitted with  
box-shaped claddings of fire protection boards, whose thickness  
depends on the profile dimensions and the required fire resistance  
class --7 0 - 0. There are also non-foaming coatings \(to F 90\)  
and composite constructions with concrete filling, if necessary  
with additional reinforcement \(F 60\). Non-load-bearing separating  
walls can be constructed as stud partitions of various qualities --7

FIRE PROTECTION  
Building Components  
Slabs and ceilings  
The MBO contain fire protection requirements for ceilings, floor  
slabs acting as ceilings, slabs over cellars and openings through  
these, of which the most important aspects are described here\:  
Ceilings must be fireproof, or at least fire-retarding, and slabs  
over cellars must be fireproof. Openings in ceilings and  
floor slabs for which a fire resistance duration is necessary are  
prohibited. If openings are required, they must be fitted with fire  
protection closures \(doors, etc.\) constructed with a fire resistance  
duration corresponding to that of the slab.  
Exceptions apply for buildings of classes 1 and 2, slabs and  
ceilings above roof spaces, and balconies, slabs and ceilings  
within residential dwellings.  
Construction  
The following constructional types of slab and ceiling are  
differentiated for purposes of fire protection\:  
Solid slabs \(e.g. reinforced concrete slabs.\_\_\_\_. 0. hollow pot floors\)  
have sufficient fire resistance under certain conditions without  
additional protection measures. Numerous construction types are  
classified in DIN 4102 .\_\_\_\_. 0. Floors consisting of timber joists,  
steel joists or concrete slabs on profiled metal decking must  
be protected against fire from below \(suspended ceiling .\_\_\_\_. 0\) and  
above \(covering, screed\), in which case the connections at walls  
and any inserts in the floor have to be taken into account. The  
fire resistance achieved is normally verified with a test certificate  
.\_\_\_\_. p. 512. In this case, the entire construction is included in  
the evaluation. Also usual is the installation of self-supporting  
suspended ceilings with their own fire resistance class \(e.g. to FIRE  
protect the installations in the ceiling void\). PROTECTION

Roofs  
The MBO also include fire protection requirements for roofs. The  
essential requirements are\:  
The roofing must generally consist of 'hard covering' and be  
resistant against airborne spread of fire and radiated heat. Roof  
overhangs, cornices, roof projections, rooflights, transparent  
roofing, etc. must have a minimum spacing from fire compartment  
walls.  
There are additional fire protection requirements for buildings in  
rows \(e.g. terraced houses\) joined at the eaves. The roofs of  
extensions or components projecting from external walls with  
openings or without fire resistance must, including any load-  
bearing and bracing building components within a safety distance  
\(5 m\), have the fire resistance of the slabs of the connecting  
building component.  
For buildings in classes 1-3 and partial roof areas, exceptions to  
these requirements are possible.

**C\)** Fire resistance classes ofF- and G-glazing, DIN EN 13501-2 and DIN 4102-2, -5  
**G-glazing -\> 0**  
Fire-resistant glazing of fire resistance class G \(G-glazing\) is  
defined as transparent building components arranged vertically,  
inclined or horizontally, which, corresponding to their fire  
resistance duration, can **prevent the spread of fire and smoke,**  
# but not the transmission of thermal radiation.  
# Construction  
The manufacture of G-glazing is possible in the following forms\:  
-glass bricks, DIN 18175  
-wired glass with a spot-welded mesh.  
-expensive, special toughened glass combination in a double-  
glazed unit.  
-pre-stressed borosilicate glass, e.g. Pyran.  
# Scope of application  
Under building regulations, G-glazing may be installed only where  
there are no higher requirements for fire protection reasons. A  
typical area of application for G-glazing is the openings for lighting  
installed in corridor walls, which have to be constructed fire-  
retarding \(F 30\) as the side walls of escape routes. The lower edge  
of the glass must in this case be at least 1.80 m above floor level,  
so that in case of fire the corridor remains usable in the radiation  
shadow.  
G-glazing is also used in the fagades of **high-rise buildings,**  
which are divided into horizontal fire compartments in order  
to prevent flames leaping from storey to storey -\> p. 246\. For  
buildings with internal corners, however, the unhindered spread  
of fire at the window area can be prevented only through the use  
ofF-glazing.  
Fire-resistant glazing units are transparent building components  
consisting of special glass types \(single pane size up to  
approx. 1.20 x 2.40 m\) in special thermally separated frame  
# 516  
# FIRE PROTECTION  
Fire-Resistant Glazing  
constructions and, when installed in solid building components,  
can resist fire for 30, 60, 90 or 120 min., corresponding to their  
classification.  
Fire-resistant glazing units are **building components**  
**requiring approvals.** The approvals are normally obtained  
by the manufacturers as part of a general technical approval  
under building regulations for defined system constructions -\>  
p. 512.  
Many types of fire-resistant glazing units are not UV-resistant,  
which should be noted for external applications.  
Fire-resistant glazing units are divided into **fire-resistance**  
**classes** under DIN EN 13501-2 and DIN 4102-13-\> **0\:**  
# F-glazing  
Fire-resistant glazing units with fire resistance class F \(F-glazing\)  
are defined as transparent building components arranged  
vertically, inclined or horizontally, which, corresponding to  
their fire resistance duration, can **prevent the spread of fire**  
# and smoke, and also the transmission of thermal radiation.  
There must be thermal isolation for the entire duration, which  
means that the surface of the F-glazing toward the fire may not  
heat up by more than a certain value \(140 K\) on average during  
this time. Additionally, the structural safety must be verified  
with a strength test under self-load. F-glazing units become  
opaque in case of fire and behave like walls for purposes of  
fire protection.  
# Construction  
The manufacture of F-glazing is possible in the following forms\:  
-pre-stressed glass panes constructed as double-glazed units  
with the space filled with an organic substance \(gel\) which  
contains water  
-multi-pane units of three or four float glass panes, between  
which are placed layers of inorganic composition \(e.g. sodium  
silicate\), which produce the fire-retarding effect.  
The units are installed, in accordance with the general technical  
approval, in dry-wall partitions, masonry, reinforced concrete etc.  
In the case of a fire, the pane on the fire side bursts and the  
sodium silicate foams, or the gel resists the heat of the fire by  
releasing water. \(The gel itself consists of a polymer, in which  
an inorganic salt solution with a high water content is bedded;  
in the presence of fire, a thermally insulating isolation layer is  
formed and considerable quantities of energy are consumed.  
This process repeats itself layer by layer until the gel-type  
substance has been used up over the entire space between  
the panes.\) The combustion process at the surface of the fire  
protection layer also colours the glass and makes it impervious  
to radiation.  
# Scope of application  
F-glazing units are mostly used indoors, but there are also  
special developments and constructions for outdoor use.  
Because the panes on the side away from the fire remain at  
temperatures below the burning through limit for the duration in  
the fire resistance classification, hardwood can be used for the  
frame in addition to steel profiles. For fire resistance class T \(=  
doors\), the same requirements apply to the glazing as with fire  
resistance class F. door closer in accordance with regulations

FIRE PROTECTION  
Fire-resistant Door Sets  
Fire-resistant door sets \(or closures\) serve to provide resistance  
to the spread of fire in walls or slabs which form rooms and  
are subject to fire resistance .requirements, according to their  
classification --7 e.  
Application \(selection\)  
If the provision of openings in fire compartment walls inside  
buildings is permitted under building regulations, then these have  
to be provided with closures which are self-closing, sealed and  
fireproof \(e.g. T 90 door\). Openings in fireproof separating walls  
have to be provided with at least fire-retarding closures \(e.g. T 30  
door\).  
Cellars, unoccupied roof spaces, workshops, shops, etc. must  
have self-closing, smoke-proof and fire-retardant closures \(e.g.  
T 30 door\) into the stairs.  
Closures between stairways and corridors legally essential  
as escape routes and also for the division of legally essential  
corridors more than 30 m long must be self-closing and smoke-  
proof --7 p. 511.  
Components  
A fire-resistant door set is a unit comprising\: door leaf or leaves,  
glazing \(if present\), metal frame and fixings for the frame, heavy-  
duty steel hinges, self-closing device in the form of spring  
hinges or door closer, selector for double-leaf door sets, specific  
equipment for sliding, lifting or roller doors, hold-open device  
with automatic closing for doors which have to be held open for  
operational reasons and closed in case of fire, and electrical and  
other actuators.  
Construction forms  
Fire-resistant door sets can be single-leaf hatches in the size  
range up to 62.5 X 175 em, single- or multi-leaf hinged or sliding  
doors \(also as hollow tube frame constructions, sometimes with  
large-area glazing, timber or timber-derived construction and  
all-glass doors of special glass\) in the size range up to approx.  
250 x 250 em or as large sliding, lifting or roller doors in sizes  
over 250 X 250 em --7 e.  
Certification of suitability  
Steel doors which comply with the requirements of DIN 18082-1  
or 18082-3 count as T 30 doors without specific certification,  
according to DIN 4102--7 0.  
For all other fire-resisting closures, certification of suitability is  
necessary within the framework of a technical approval process  
under building regulations and classification according to DIN  
4102 or DIN EN 13501 --7 p. 512\. Because there is an interaction  
between wall and door set, fire-resistant door sets are always  
tested with the type of wall construction for which they are to be  
approved.  
Details of the required certification of suitability are contained  
in the construction products list of the German Institute for  
Building Technology \(DiBt\)--? p. 512.  
Smoke control doors  
In certain situations, the authorities demand smoke control doors  
\(DIN 18095\), which prevent the penetration of smoke when  
installed and closed \(see above\). Smoke control doors also require  
certification of suitability \(see above\). Fire-resistant doors are  
normally also smoke control doors.

# FIRE PROTECTION  
Fire Fighting Installations  
**Extinguisher water pipelines** are those installed in buildings  
with connections to unlockable fire hoses at water outlet  
locations. They serve to transport water in sufficient quantities  
to each storey or fire compartment of a building to extinguish  
fires. Extinguisher water pipelines are required under building  
regulations and can be required by the authorities for various  
types of buildings.  
# Systems  
The following systems are differentiated according to the method  
of water supply\:  
Systems with permanently installed **dry riser** vertical pipes ---+ **f\),**  
into which water is pumped by the fire service when required. The  
water is normally supplied from a hydrant connected to the public  
water supply network. Dry risers are **not** directly connected to the  
drinking water network. They must have a nominal diameter of  
at least 80 mm, be capable of being drained and be fitted with  
automatic vent valves at their ends.  
Systems with permanently installed **wet riser** vertical pipes  
---+ **8** are pipelines for extinguisher water which are constantly  
under water pressure and therefore immediately available. They  
are equipped at the outlet locations on each storey with wall  
hydrants ---+ **0,** with hoses, installed in niches, built-in or in wall  
cupboards, already coupled and ready for use. Standing water  
is forbidden in these pipes on account of possible microbial  
contamination!  
Wet risers are therefore normally supplied by a **combined**  
**system\:** together with the drinking water system of a building  
through a common supply pipe. This should be sized so that the  
withdrawal of drinking water can never endanger fire fighting; in  
larger complexes this may make several water supply connections  
necessary. In combined systems, **constant renewal of the water**  
in the riser pipes is necessary in order to guarantee the quality of  
drinking water at all locations. There must be constant abstraction  
of water at the upper end of the riser or an \(automatic\) flushing  
system.  
Systems with permanently installed **wet/dry riser** vertical pipes  
---+ **0** are extinguisher water pipelines which are normally empty  
of water but when required can be supplied with water from the  
mains by remote activation of a valve. The water in this case is also  
available for fire fighting **with little delay,** while the disadvantages  
of the combined system \(standing water in the riser pipe, danger  
of freezing\) are avoided.  
All extinguisher water pipework must be laid with downward  
gradient towards the emptying location. The minimum nominal  
diameters laid down in the relevant standards must be complied  
with. The fixed coupling of the supply connection, according to  
DIN 14461-2, must be 800 + 200 mm above ground level ---+ **0.**  
When riser pipes are installed in slots in walls, the minimum  
thicknesses according to fire safety regulations must be  
observed. FIRE PROTECTION

area \(example\)- EG\: evaluation group  
The basis of the design of a naturally ventilated smoke extraction system is the  
calculation of the required \(aerodynamically effective\) opening area of the smoke  
extractor \(smoke extraction area\)  
First, it is necessary to determine the evaluation group of the relevant use of the  
room independent of the assumed fire spread speed with the relevant fire hazard, the  
thickness of the calculated smoke layer \(min. 2.50 m\), dimensions and installation  
height \(top edge as a distance from the calculated smoke layer\) and area of the supply  
air openings \(supply area generally 1.5 times smoke extraction area\).  
Considering the calculated room height and calculated smoke layer thickness, the  
required opening area for each smoke compartment can be taken from the table and  
the appropriate smoke and heat extractor can be selected.  
The smoke and heat extractors should be arranged as regularly as possible within the  
roof compartment.  
At least one smoke and heat extractor should be installed per 200m2  
.  
In addition, the spacing of the extractors between each other and to the edges of the  
roof areas \(5 m \< a \< 20 m\) and to fire compartment walls \(5 m\) should be obseiVed in  
order to avoid the danger of fire spreading by flash-over.  
In pitched roof surfaces, smoke extractors must be installed as high as possible and  
must be specially certified in steep roofs \(e.g. northlight roofs\).  
The individual smoke extractors must have minimum dimensions \(I= b *=* 1.0 m\) and  
must not exceed certain maximum dimensions. This makes it practical to specify a  
larger number of openings, each with a smaller opening area.  
f\) Design of a naturally ventilated smoke extraction system, DIN 18232 and VdS  
CEA 4001 \(principle\)  
Smoke and heat extraction systems consist of the smoke and  
heat extractor and also activation and control components,  
opening actuators, power supply wiring, air supply ducts, smoke  
curtains if required and the appropriate accessories. Smoke and  
heat extraction systems are intended to remove smoke and heat  
in the event of a fire. They serve to keep escape, rescue and fire  
fighting routes free of smoke, make fire fighting easier by creating  
a low-smoke layer, delay or avoid flash-over and thus the start  
of a full fire, protect installations, reduce the damage caused by  
combustion gases and thermal decomposition products and  
reduce fire damage to building components.  
There are various systems\:  
Naturally ventilated smoke extraction systems are based on the  
principle that hot air rises \(e.g. via skylight domes\). Their function  
depends on\:  
- an aerodynamically effective opening area  
-the influence of wind  
-the size of air supply openings  
-timing of their opening  
-installation situation \(e.g. arrangement and building dimensions\).  
Mechanically operated smoke extraction systems have motors  
\(e.g. with fans\) to extract the fumes. Heat extractors are openings  
in wall or roof surfaces which open automatically in case of fire  
\(e.g. through the melting of a thermal link\) and allow the heat of  
the fire to escape.  
Scope of application and sizing  
The MBO require the general use of smoke extractors for certain  
areas\:  
In buildings with internal stairwells and in buildings with more than  
five storeys above ground, a smoke extraction device \(size at least  
1 rn2\) must be installed at the top of the stairwell, which must be  
capable of being opened from the ground floor and from the top  
landing of the stairs. Smoke extraction equipment must also be  
installed in lift shafts \(size 2.5% of the floor area of the lift shaft  
but at least 0.10 m2\).  
For special buildings \(places of assembly, industrial plants, etc.\)  
the applicable regulations can also demand additional installations  
---7 0 - f\). Smoke extraction systems must be installed, for  
example, in\:  
-\(single-storey\) sales areas, over-sized production and storage rooms  
- buildings with excessively long rescue and escape routes, if  
these cannot be kept smoke-free for a sufficiently long time by  
other means  
- buildings where special protection of assets is required in a  
particular case by relevant regulations  
-buildings containing materials or equipment which are particularly  
valuable or susceptible to damage by smoke or facilities where  
there is a particular reason for increased protection of assets.  
Smoke extraction systems are normally designed by the  
determination of a desired low-smoke layer and the calculation  
of the aerodynamically effective opening area required to  
ensure it ---7 8 \(as percentage ratio of the floor area of where  
smoke is to be removed from to the effective area of the smoke  
extraction opening\).  
The required values differ according to the application and are laid  
down in the relevant regulations.

Design of sprinkler systems  
The design of a sprinkler system is based on the fire hazard in the  
area to be protected. This is defined in the VdS CEA Guidelines  
\~ p. 511 and areas to be protected by sprinklers are divided into  
fire hazard classes \(LH, OH, HHP, HHS\).  
Further factors significant for the design of sprinkler systems  
are\: the effective area, which according to calculations can be  
covered by the quantity of water; the maximum protected area  
per sprinkler, depending on sprinkler type and fire hazard; the  
water quantity, i.e. how much is to be sprinkled per minute onto  
the effective area; and the operating time, how long the water  
quantity must be available

FIRE PROTECTION  
Sprinkler Systems  
Sprinkler systems are technical, automatically actuated fire  
fighting systems. They consist of a network of permanently  
installed pipework under water pressure, to which closed jets  
called sprinklers are connected at a regular spacing. The pipework  
should be exposed or only concealed by a suspended ceiling to  
enable repair and maintenance and is normally connected through  
an intermediate tank to the drinking water mains.  
If the air temperature increases as the result of a fire and exceeds  
the operating temperature set for the sprinkler \(approx. 30°C  
above the highest normally expected air temperature\), then the  
sprinkler opens and the pressurised water flows out of the pipe  
through the sprinkler and is sprayed *over* the protected area by  
the deflector. Each sprinkler system also has a mechanical-  
acoustic alarm.  
Scope of application  
The use of sprinkler systems is necessary in many cases when the  
fire safety requirements or the escape route requirements in the  
building regulations cannot be complied with.  
For many special projects \(e.g. stores, hotels, high-rise buildings,  
hospitals, shopping centres, etc.\) the installation of sprinkler  
systems is generally required. Details for the design are given in the  
relevant regulations and guidelines.  
Systems  
Wet sprinkler systems \~ 0 are the most common type. The  
pipework behind the wet alarm valve is constantly filled with  
water. When a sprinkler is activated, water sprays out without  
delay.  
In dry sprinkler systems \~ 0, the pipework behind the alarm  
valve is filled with compressed air, which stops water flowing into  
the sprinkler pipework. If a sprinkler is opened, this preventative  
air pressure is released and the water sprays out after a delay.  
Dry sprinklers are mostly installed in areas subject to frost.  
Rapid reaction dry sprinkler systems are dry sprinkler  
systems, which operate with little delay because the alarm  
*valve* is opened by additional smoke or flame detectors before  
a sprinkler opens.  
Tandem systems are dry sprinkler systems \(e.g. in areas of a  
building at risk of frost\) which are connected to the pipework of a  
wet system installed elsewhere in the building.  
Pre-action sprinkler systems are dry systems designed so that  
water is sprayed only when a fire is detected and a sprinkler is  
opened \(in order to *avoid* accidental activation, e.g. if a sprinkler  
is damaged\).  
Sprinklers  
The most common types are the glass bulb sprinkler, with a  
glass bulb as temperature-dependent activation component, and  
the fusible link sprinkler, with a soldered link that opens when  
heated. Different types according to the type of spraying pattern  
are\: normal sprinkler\~ 8, with a ball-shaped water distribution  
directed to the floor and the ceiling. They can be used in the  
upright or pendant position. Umbrella sprinklers \~ 8 feature a  
parabolic-shaped distribution of water towards the floor. They can  
be used in the upright or pendant position. Side wall sprinklers  
and further special versions \(e.g. long-throw sprinklers\) are also  
available.  
C\) Water quantity and effective area for LH, OH and HHP fire hazard classes, *VdS*  
CEA Guidelines 4001  
520 Water spray extinguisher systems  
Water spray extinguisher systems are water distribution systems  
with permanently installed pipework, on which open nozzles  
are mounted at regular intervals. When the system is on standby,  
the pipework is not filled with water. When the system is activated,  
this immediately releases the peak flow from the water supply  
into the pipework.  
The water spray pattern is based on the shape and dimensions of  
the room to be protected, the type of building, type and quantity  
of goods to be protected, height and type of storage, and wind  
influence, and must spray at a rate of 5-60 l/m2/min.  
Systems arranged into groups normally protect an area of 100-  
400 m2 per group. The total effective area for rooms ;\:;;200 m2  
,  
which are divided into group effective areas, is normally the sum of  
the two effective areas with the largest water requirement. For the  
determination of the total effective area, a fire breaking out at the  
intersection of the group effective areas is assumed. This means  
that all group effective areas which are within a radius of 7 m of the  
location at most risk for the outbreak of fire can be supplied with  
water simultaneously.  
Water spray extinguisher systems are used, for example, in  
aircraft hangars, waste bunkers and incineration plants, stages,  
transformers, tanks and systems with flammable liquids, cable  
ducts, chipping silos, chipboard works, power stations, hydraulic  
rooms, and firework and munitions factories.  
Oxygen-reducing extinguisher systems  
These fire fighting systems work by reducing the content of  
oxygen in the air to a level at which the combustion process no  
longer continues.  
C02 is commonly used as a gaseous fire-fighting agent. C02  
systems are intended to extinguish fires as they are developing  
and maintain an effectively high C02 concentration for so long  
that there is no danger of reignition. C02 floods the relevant area  
rapidly and uniformly, to provide protection in whole rooms. A C02  
system essentially consists of C02 bottles containing a supply of  
gas, the necessary valves and permanently installed pipework  
with open nozzles in an appropriate arrangement in the area to be  
protected and equipment for fire detection, control, alarm and  
activation. For systems intended to protect rooms, one nozzle  
may supply at most 30 m2 of floor area. If the room is more than 5  
m high, the nozzles are installed not only in the ceiling but also at  
approx. Ys of room height.  
C02 is a suitable agent against fires affecting the following substances  
and equipment\: combustible liquids and other substances which  
behave like combustible liquids in a fire; combustible gases, in  
which case it must be ensured that no combustible gas-air mixture  
can form after the fire has been extinguished; electrical and  
electronic equipment, and combustible solid materials like wood,  
paper and textiles, although fires involving these materials require  
a higher C02 concentration and a longer action time. C02 is not  
suitable for some types of fire, for example\: deeply seated fires of  
wood, paper and textiles, etc.; materials and chemicals containing  
oxygen; materials and chemicals which react with C02, e.g. alkali  
metals and metal hybrids.  
Particular attention must be paid to safety in the design of  
C02 systems, because concentrations of over 5% are lethal  
and strongly corrosive. Systems should therefore be installed  
only by officially accredited firms. \(VdS Guidelines 2093\)  
FIRE PROTECTION  
Other Extinguisher Systems  
Powder extinguisher systems  
Fire extinguisher powders are homogenous mixtures of  
chemicals which are suitable for fighting fires. The main  
ingredients are sodium/potassium bicarbonate, potassium  
sulphate, potassium/sodium chloride and ammonium phosphate/  
sulphate.  
Because the extinguisher powder can be used under normal  
conditions at temperatures from -20 to +60°C, it is employed in  
buildings, enclosed rooms and also in open-air areas of industrial  
plants.  
Powder is suitable for extinguishing fires involving the  
following substances and equipment\: combustible solid  
materials like wood, paper and textiles, in which case the  
appropriate powder must be used; combustible liquids and  
· other substances which behave like combustible liquids in a  
fire; combustible gases; combustible metals like aluminium,  
magnesium and their alloys, for which only suitable special  
powder should be used.  
Examples of areas of industry where powder systems are often  
installed are\: chemical and process plants, oil cellars, sumps,  
filling stations, compressor stations, pumping stations, transfer  
stations for oil and gas. Powder is not suitable for extinguishing  
fires involving certain plant, equipment and areas, for example\:  
machinery, plant and equipment susceptible to dust; low-voltage  
electrical equipment \(telephone, IT, measurement and regulation  
systems, distribution cabinets with trips and relays etc.\); areas or  
installations where there is a danger of chemical reaction with the  
powder. \(VdS Guidelines 3038\)  
Foam extinguisher  
Foam for fire extinguishing is made by foaming a mixture of  
water and foaming agent with air. Foaming agents consist of  
water-soluble protein detergents and may also contain fluorinated  
agents. Multi-purpose foaming agents are suitable for the  
production of heavy, medium and light foam. Protein and fluoro-  
protein foaming agents are suitable for the production of heavy  
foam.  
Foam extinguisher systems are used to extinguish fires in  
buildings, rooms and the open air. They can also be used for  
the precautionary coverage of areas. Particular measures are  
necessary in the case of liquids which destroy foam, e.g. alcohol,  
ester, ketone etc. A foam extinguisher system should be designed  
so that in the case of fire sufficient foam can reach the area to be  
protected or the area is effectively covered.  
The essential parameters of a foam extinguisher system are\:  
water quantity, foaming agent consumption, foam ratio \(ratio of  
foam to water-foaming agent mixture\) and minimum operating  
time. When systems with medium and heavy foam are used, the  
foam must be able to cover the entire area to be foamed, taking  
into account the flowing and throwing range, any obstacles, and  
the distance and type of object to be protected. When systems  
with light foam are used, the foam must be able to effectively fill  
the room or building.  
If a number of separate objects are to be protected by the same  
foam extinguisher system, the water supply requirement is  
designed for the largest single object. The water supply must be  
designed for operation for at least 120 min for heavy foam and  
60 min for medium foam. \(VdS Guidelines 2108\)

Drainage systems for buildings and sites  
Drainage systems for buildings are constructed to work under  
gravity wherever possible. The European standard DIN EN 12056  
applies to all drainage systems operating under gravity inside  
residential, business, institutional or industrial buildings. Additional  
requirements for Germany are given in DIN 1986-100. Outside the  
building, DIN EN 752 and further regulations apply\~ **0.**  
Calculation  
Calculations are based on the assumed flow in the pipework, which  
depends on the type of use and of drainage. A basic distinction  
is made between wastewater and rainwater, and it needs to be  
decided whether collected wastewater and rainwater are drained  
into a combined system or have to remain separated according to  
local by-laws\~ **f\).**  
Description of drainage pipes  
A downpipe is the vertical pipe in a building carrying wastewater or  
rainwater down to a horizontal pipe and is ventilated above the roof.  
A ground pipe is the inaccessible pipe laid underground or under  
a floor slab, carrying groundwater from down pipes, branch waste  
pipes and floor drains.  
A vent pipe is the downpipe's extension above the roof to provide  
pressure balance above unpressurised drainage by means of  
ventilation.  
Collector pipes have the same function as ground pipes, but they  
are suspended below the cellar ceiling or on cellar walls.  
Branch waste pipes connect the odour trap in the sanitary  
appliance to the further pipework. The sewer connection is the  
pipe connecting the last shaft on the plot to the public sewer.

# Rainwater drainage  
Rainwater falling on a roof is drained away via a pipe system. The  
most important objective is that the rainwater from built-up areas  
should soak away into suitable percolation systems, on the same  
plot if possible. If this is not feasible, the rainwater is drained,  
either separated from the soil drain, or combined. Where the water  
is drained into a sewer connection, to comply with a discharge  
limit, rainwater retention may have to be provided in the form of  
an oversized pipe network or a structure. Each roof surface must  
have at least one downpipe and one emergency overflow with  
free discharge. Rainwater must not be fed into soil stacks, even  
from small roof surfaces. Pipework is designed for average rainfall.  
Because heavy rainfall has to be expected, however, overloading  
of the pipework should be countered by suitable measures  
\(emergency overflows, pressure relief for unpressurised pipes\) to  
avoid resulting damage.  
Rainwater discharge is calculated according to DIN EN 12056-3 or  
DIN 1986-1 00 with the formula\:  
# 1  
**Q** r 0 m · **C ·A·** --- where\:

C discharge factor  
A precipitation area projected on the plot \(m2\)  
The duration of rain for design purposes is D = 5 min. Down pipes,  
collector and ground pipes are to be designed for the local 5  
minute rainfall, which is anticipated once in 2 years *\(r512;\)* \(applies  
without planned retention measures\).  
The limits of the application examples according to DIN EN 12056,  
DIN 1986-100 and DIN EN 725-4 are as follows\: overloading  
or overflowing is to be limited by the provision of emergency  
overflows, and pressure relief for unpressurised pipes. Discharge  
factor C for determination of rainwater discharge is shown in -7 **f\)**  
\(DIN 1986-100, Table 6\). The design is to be based on the chosen  
rain duration of D = 5 minutes. The repeat interval in years \(T\) is  
determined by the particular project and must be determined  
according to the type and use of the building.  
# Unpressurised drainage  
Downpipes must have at least the nominal diameter of the  
connected roof outlet. The degree of filling can be up to F = 0.33.  
Collector and ground pipes are to be designed for a degree of  
filling of 0.7 and a minimum fall of 0.5 cm/m within the building.  
Outside the building, a maximum velocity of 2.5 m/s should be  
assumed. The maximum degree of filling here is 0.7.

without over-pressure can be assumed. The minimum fall is up to

Roof drainage with pressurised flow  
For this system, hydraulic certification should be produced  
for each individual project. The backing-up at the outlet  
required for the function does not count as flooding of  
the roof surface, as long as the requirements of outlets  
according to DIN 19599 are not exceeded.  
Roof surfaces with, for example, regular flooding are to be  
waterproofed up to the flooding level and appropriately  
structurally designed. At the most the difference in level  
between the roof outlet and the backing-up level should  
be assumed for the rainwater pressure drainage system.  
If a pressure drainage system is fed into an unpressurised  
system of pipework, conversion of the high kinetic energy  
should be ensured by the reduction of the flow velocity to  
\<2.5 m/s.  
Backing-up  
Discharge locations below the sewer backing-up level are to  
be protected against backing-up in the sewer by automatic  
wastewater lifting pumps with backing-up loop or backflow  
prevention device \(DIN EN 12056-4\). Backflow prevention  
devices have a limited scope of application --; **0.**  
Wastewater lifting pumps, in which the flow of wastewater  
must not be interrupted, are to be installed as double lifting  
systems --; **f\).** These pumps should also be provided for  
precipitation water, which is to be drained below the sewer  
backing-up level. These should be designed so that the  
occurrence of a hundred-year event r51100 ; cannot cause  
damage \(to surfaces like house entrances, cellar entrances,  
garage access drives, internal courtyards\).  
A flooding certification, required by DIN EN 752-4, assuming  
rainfall of r15130 ;, is to be produced for larger areas below the  
sewer backing-up level, which do not endanger buildings  
or assets. The wastewater lifting pump should be designed  
for at least r *512;.*  
For roof surfaces which can be drained without the provision  
of an emergency overflow, the planned flooding level must  
be discussed with and checked by the structural engineer.  
Furthermore, an overloading certification is to be obtained  
for internally routed drainage systems as far as a pressure  
relief point. Flooding and overloading certifications are to be  
obtained for a 1 00-year rainstorm r51100 ;.  
Special wastewater  
Wastewater of commercial and industrial origin is generally  
to be treated so that it is permissible to feed it into a public  
foul sewer. This may require the installation of separation or  
treatment facilities such as grease separators, separators  
for volatile liquids, starch separators or emulsion splitting  
plant. For mineral oil or volatile liquids, separators are to  
be dimensioned according to DIN 1999\. These devices  
normally consist of a silt trap, separator and chamber for  
taking samples. In particular, areas on which vehicles are  
washed, maintained or fuelled should be connected to the  
drains through a separator for volatile liquids.

# Natural ventilation  
The air quality in rooms or buildings is one of the significant user  
pleasure criteria and an essential factor in personal comfort. If a  
building is operated without mechanical ventilation equipment,  
this is called natural ventilation. This is the exchange of air through  
window ventilation, additional shafts in the building or other  
openings. Natural ventilation is produced by wind pressure on and  
around the building, which depends on numerous other factors.  
The air exchange within a building is also influenced by thermal  
effects around and in the building. The air exchange within each  
room is significant for the evaluation of natural ventilation.  
If a building is to be predominantly naturally ventilated, then its  
limitations have to be taken into account. These limitations are  
determined by\:  
the location of the building in a town planning context  
-the wind speeds occurring at the building's location  
- noise nuisance at the building's location  
- building structure, room depths, internal rooms, pressure  
resistances at the building  
-thermal effect in the building and in the rooms  
The flow conditions for window ventilation differ in summer and  
winter according to the temperature difference between inside and  
outside \~ **0.** For workrooms, Workplace Guidelines 5 \(October  
1979 edition\) require natural \(free\) ventilation.  
A differentiation is also made here between\:  
-window ventilation  
- shaft ventilation  
-supplementary roof ventilation  
-ventilation through other air openings  
Air quality is defined as adequate when sufficient healthy air for  
breathing is available in the workrooms and when the air quality  
essentially corresponds to that of outside air, unless the outdoor  
air does not have the required quality because of exceptional  
circumstances \(C02 concentration, nitrous oxide etc.\).  
There are four systems of free ventilation\: \~ **f\).** The systems  
apply for a reference area of 6 m21worker.  
Working rooms are categorised into A, B, C \~ **8.**  
The **ventilation cross-sections** for free ventilation can be  
determined from \~ **8** \(excerpt from Workplace Guidelines 5\).  
It must be possible to reduce ventilation cross-sections through  
adjustment \(shutters\). The minimum outside air flows required  
in the Workplace Guideline correspond approximately to the  
recommended outside air flows for the maintenance of maximum  
C02 concentrations.  
The recommendation\:  
for predominantly sedentary activities\: 20-40 m3 *I* h x no. people  
for predominantly standing activities\: 40-60 m31h x no. people  
for heavy physical work\: 65 m3 *I* h x no. people  
For the first group \(predominantly sedentary activities\), a  
more precise consideration in line with holistic concepts is  
recommended. The necessary volume flow can be determined  
through the C02 impairment of the outside air and the user  
frequency of the rooms. 0 Centralised ventilation of a house with heat recovery. The outside air fed in to  
renew the inside air is filtered, then passed through a cross-flow heat exchanger,  
where it receives warmth from the extract air. The warmed air normally flows  
through a number of rooms before being extracted again. Air from kitchens and  
bathrooms should not be able to flow into other rooms \(Well pot!, Bohne --\> refs\)

Controlled ventilation of homes  
For reasons of hygiene and building physics, it is necessary to  
remove air enriched with odours, water vapour and C02 from  
occupied rooms and replace it with unused oxygen-rich air. There  
is a difference between background ventilation \(for building physics  
reasons\) and demand-controlled ventilation \(for hygienic reasons\).  
Background ventilation\: An air exchange at least 0.5-1.0 times  
per hour can ensure that no damage occurs to a building through  
normal use. High internal air humidity caused by too little air  
exchange \(airtight joints\) can lead to mildew and mould formation.  
This phenomenon is particularly apparent when new windows with  
draught seals have been installed without improving the thermal  
insulation of the external walls of the building.  
Demand-controlled ventilation\: Bodily odours, cigarette smoke,  
kitchen and toilet odours pollute the air and make air exchanges  
necessary.  
Air changes recommended for hygienic reasons\: 0.5-1.0 times  
per hour in residential, occupied and bedrooms, 4-5 times per  
hour in internal sanitary rooms, 0.5-25 times per hour in kitchens  
\(intermittent requirement\).  
Mechanical ventilation of homes  
Mechanical ventilation without heat recovery should have the  
effect of renewing the inside air sufficiently often and also keeping  
the heat loss through air extraction within reasonable bounds.  
Mechanical ventilation with heat recovery---'\> 0 brings the extract  
air into thermal contact with the intake air. At least 80% of the  
waste heat \(degree of temperature exchange\) can be recovered  
from the extract air.  
Central air extract system with heat recovery  
In extract systems, outside air flows through openings and joints  
into the rooms. The required heat energy must be supplied by  
the heating system \(normally static radiators or surface heating  
systems\). The thermal energy transported out of the building with the  
extract air is lost without additional measures. The low temperature  
level \(approx. 20-24°\) prevents heat recovery in the heating system.  
One way of recovering the heat is to use the temperature level of  
the extract air as a heat source for a heat pump. The energy can  
then, for example, be saved in a domestic hot water cylinder---'\> f\).  
Single ventilation systems with common extract duct \(main  
duct\)---'\> e  
These require only a single vertical extract duct \(DIN 18017-3\).  
This can be, according to the manufacturer, up to 20 storeys high  
with one or two fans connected on each storey \(which can also  
be from two adjacent living areas\). The main extract duct is of  
10-35 em diameter and can be located in an installation shaft with  
sufficient fire resistance. The box-form radial fans are installed on  
the plaster or flush and have a capacity of 50 or 90 m3/h. Airtight  
backflow flaps prevent heat loss or odour nuisance while the fan is  
not running and provide fire protection \(up to fire resistance class  
L 90\) in case of fire.  
Controlled domestic ventilation with ground-source heat  
exchanger \~ e  
The ground-source heat exchanger provides air cooling in summer.  
Warm outside air can be cooled from +30°C to +20°C by passing it  
through one. The heat exchanger is used in the winter to pre-warm  
the outside air \(from -1 ooc to +2°C\). Further heating of the air can  
heat a well-insulated building on mild winter days.

Ventilation  
Purposes of ventilation  
In occupied rooms, the air should be in a condition to meet our  
comfort requirements. The following comfort-relevant parameters  
can be influenced by ventilation systems\:  
-cleanliness of air/odour level  
- room air temperature  
-air movement, draughts  
-air humidity.  
Construction of ventilation systems  
A room ventilation system normally consists of an outside air intake  
with fan, the central processing device, air distribution ductwork  
and air outlets \~ f\). There are various systems, according to  
the intended purposes. Another consideration is whether the  
ventilation system can fulfil the intended purpose solely through  
the transported and processed air, or in combination with a water  
circulation system.  
The first categorisation of air handling systems is whether they  
have a ventilation function or not. Systems with a ventilation  
function must be provided with a sufficient supply of outside air. In  
addition to ventilation, such systems can also perform functions  
like heating, cooling, humidification or dehumidification. Systems  
without a ventilation function fulfil the same conditions, but cannot  
exchange used air from rooms.  
A further categorisation of air handling systems is according  
to the type and method of air processing, fundamentally  
the thermodynamic processing functions\: heating, cooling,  
humidifying and dehumidifying. A system which only transports  
air and filters it if required is a ventilation system. If no outside air  
is used, then it is a closed ventilation system.  
Air-water systems  
Air-water systems are air handling systems operated in  
combination with additional water-circulation heating or cooling.  
These include, for example\:  
Chilled ceilings \~ 8 - 0  
Chilled ceilings have a passive cooling effect. Instead of mechanical  
air circulation, there is a radiation exchange between ceiling  
components with cold water flowing through them and the room.  
Air exchange can remain at the minimum hygienically required level.  
In office rooms, the internal cooling load, i.e. the heat produced by  
people, devices and lighting that has to be removed, is normally  
greater than the heat loss though the external envelope of the  
building. In order to deal with this cooling load, normally about 40-  
80 W/m2  
, conventional air conditioning requires high air exchange  
rates, large ducts and expensive central air handling units. These  
are increasingly being replaced by chilled ceilings, also referred to  
as 'silent cooling', because no noise-producing mechanical devices  
like fans are used. Water is used as transport medium instead of air.  
Advantages of chilled ceilings  
Little space required for ductwork, shafts and service rooms. Low  
energy costs, energy saving. High acceptance due to less noise  
from air movement and less room air velocity. Chilled ceiling systems  
are available for up to 100 W/m2 of cooling. A further variant of  
'silent cooling' \(cooling system with radiation or free convection\) is  
suspended chilled beams \~ 0 \(which, however, offer less cooling  
capacity than full-surface systems due to their limited area\), plus  
combinations of ceiling beam with convection component \(e.g.  
convection component increased through perforated plates\), storage  
chilled ceilings and various combinations of the above systems. Waste air

Arrangement for air handling equipment According to a sample  
design by the expert Building Supervision \(RbAL\), air handling  
equipment must have a dedicated service room \(air conditioning  
plant room\) in buildings of more than three storeys, if the connecting  
ductwork leads into more than one storey or fire compartment.  
Ventilation and air conditioning systems mostly have their services  
rooms on a services floor, near the heating plant room \(heating room  
with distribution\) and the cooling plant \(chiller\). The combination of  
air conditioning plant and heating plant in one room is not allowed  
\(fire protection\). Spatial connection of plant rooms to the building  
cores with their vertical installation shafts is an important design  
consideration. The horizontal and vertical distances to the main  
areas of demand \(e.g. large kitchens, canteens or server rooms\)  
from the air conditioning plant room should also be considered.  
The formal integration of a services floor into the body of a building  
can considerably influence its appearance. Placed on one of the  
upper storeys, a dedicated services floor will have almost no windows  
or none at all \(noise emission\), but will need intake and extract louvres  
and will also contrast with other floors with its different storey height.  
Room sizes  
An approximate estimation of the size of an air conditioning  
plant room can be undertaken using the VOl Guideline 2052,  
working from the assumed volume flow and the type of air  
handling. Example calculations for the size of the plant room in an  
administration building \~ **e -e .**  
Fagade ventilation systems \~ **0 - 0**  
These are also referred to as decentralised ventilation systems.  
The units are placed near the fagades with a direct duct connection.  
In contrast to fan convectors with recirculation, the flow of outside  
air is fed directly from the fagade to the unit. This means that  
no more air conditioning installation is required in the building.  
Fagade ventilation units can be designed in various forms such as  
underfloor air supply units, combined air supply and extract units  
or with a central extract air plant.  
It is important to consider the influence of wind pressure on the  
volume flow. The temperature boundary layer at the fagade can  
also affect the air supply temperature, depending on the layout  
and design of the building.

Heating  
Heating systems  
Heating systems for buildings normally use water as the  
heat distribution medium, less often air \(steam is used as a  
heating medium only for industrial purposes\). The necessary  
temperature of the heat distribution medium \(water, air, steam\)  
depends on the temperature chosen and the type of heating  
surface in the rooms. A heat generator provides the necessary  
temperature. Most existing heating systems use gas or oil as  
the primary energy source. The heating gas or oil is normally  
burnt in boilers with a combustion temperature of about 1 ooooc  
and the heat is transferred to the distribution medium in a heat  
exchanger.  
Because a temperature of 70°C is typically sufficient for the  
heat distribution medium, a holistic design will attempt to avoid  
the burning of fossil fuels. Methods of exploiting renewable  
energy are\: \(ground-source\) geothermal energy --\> p. 469 in  
connection with a heat pump system; combination of heat and  
power generation \(CHP\); or perhaps falling back on a C02-  
neutral energy source like wood. It can also be possible to store  
seasonal sources of energy from the environment \(thermal solar  
energy\) during the summer months and make it available in the  
winter.  
Heat distribution  
Much the most common system is warm water central heating.  
This transfers the heat produced in the heat generator into water  
as distribution medium to the radiators, which emit heat. The  
cooled water returns to the heat generator to be warmed up  
again \(flow and return\). Warm water central heating systems  
have a max. flow temperature of approx. 1 00°C, but 45-70°C  
is normally preferred today, described as the low temperature  
range. Heating systems with flow temperatures of over 120°C  
count as hot water heating and are more often used with district  
heating systems.  
The heat distribution is normally circulated as warm water  
pumped heating. There are various pipework layouts --\> 0-0.  
Heat generation with gas or heating oil  
Gas firing\: gas has become prevalent in recent years. Advantages\:  
no storage costs, low maintenance costs, payment after use,  
can be used in groundwater protection zones, easily regulated,  
high annual efficiency, can be used for the heating of individual  
flats or rooms \(compact gas boilers\), little environmental impact.  
Disadvantages\: dependent on public utility network, higher energy  
costs. A conversion from oil to gas usually makes a new chimney  
necessary.  
Oil firing\: is also common today using light heating oil as fuel.  
Advantages\: requires no public utility network, easily controllable.  
Disadvantages\: high cost of storage and tank installation, rent  
income losses in rented houses due to the oil storage room, only  
possible under stringent regulations in areas at risk of flooding  
or groundwater protection zones, payment before use, high  
environmental impact.  
Solid fuel firing  
Coal, brown coal and wood are now used less often for heating  
buildings. Depending on the fuel, large quantities of environmental  
pollutants can be released, which are subject to stringent controls  
under the Federal Anti-Emissions Law. Advantages\: independent  
of fuel imports, low fuel costs. Disadvantages\: more work for the  
operator, larger storeroom necessary, high emission of pollutants,  
poor controllability. *\)*

Heating surfaces in rooms  
Arrangement of heating surfaces and resulting air circulation --\>  
**0-0** Radiators placed below windows can prevent draughts near  
the windows. The air cooled by the glass surface is intercepted by  
the air rising from the radiator--\> **0.**  
Located on internal walls, radiators can provoke air circulation  
with the effect of producing cool air near the floor and warm air  
near the ceiling. Such relatively large temperature differences  
between floor and ceiling are not comfortable -\> **f\).**  
Surface heating \(underfloor, ceiling and wall heating\) is operated  
in room perimeter areas with low temperatures. The heat output is  
uniform and solely through radiation. The low heating demand of  
buildings built according to the Energy Saving Regulations \(EnEV\)  
means that surface heating systems are ideal in this respect, yet  
provide a comfortable temperature --7 **e.**  
Convectors transfer heat not by radiation, but by direct heat  
transfer to the air molecules. For this reason, convectors can  
be clad or built in without reducing their heating capability. The  
performance of a convector depends on the recess height above  
the heater--\> **e,** see alsop. 534.  
Types of heating surfaces  
Sectional radiators include steel tube, cast-iron and steel  
radiators. They release 40% of their heat as radiation.  
Steel tube radiators are available as 2-6-row tubular radiators,  
have no sharp edges and provide good performance in relationship  
to their length -\> **0.**  
Steel radiators --\> **0** are welded out of a number of components  
into a block and have connections between the blocks at the  
ends. Until a few years ago, these were the standard radiators  
for warm water heating, but panel radiators are now more usual.  
Cast-iron radiators have a small market share. They react slowly  
to control inputs but are very corrosion-resistant--\> **e.**  
Panel radiators consist of flat and profiled steel plate double  
panels with water flowing through. The front gives out heat mostly  
as radiation, the back mostly by convection into the air. If a number  
of panels are arranged in front of each other, then the proportion of  
convection increases accordingly. In practice, up to three panels  
are used.  
Because of their shallow constructional depth \(2-5 em\), panel  
radiators require only very shallow window niches. They can  
emit up to 40% of their heat as radiation and can be operated  
with relatively low flow temperatures \(making them suitable for  
operation with ground-source heat pumps\). In order to improve  
the heating performance, vertical folded fins \(convector plates\)  
can be mounted between the panels -\> **0.**

# DOMESTIC INSTALLATION  
Heating  
When **cement screed** ZE 20 is laid on heating pipes, which are laid  
directly on thermal insulation, a minimum cover to the pipes of 45  
mm is specified, which results in a total construction thickness of  
min. 75 mm without floor construction. Screed expands during the  
operation of the heating, with temperature differences between top  
and bottom. This differential expansion leads to tension stresses  
under ceramic flooring, which can only be resisted by an upper  
reinforcement layer. Reinforcement is not necessary when the  
floor is covered with carpet or parquet, because the temperature  
gradient between top and bottom of the screed is less than with  
ceramic flooring.  
DIN 4725 gives the maximum permissible floor surface  
temperatures\: 29°C for permanently occupied areas, and for the  
edge zone \(no wider than 1 m\) 35°C. The maximum permissible  
floor temperature for bathrooms is goc above standard room  
temperature. Underfloor heating is possible under these conditions  
in normal circumstances,because the heating demand is seldom  
above 90 W/m2.  
**Storage of heating oil\:** the quantity of heating oil should last  
for at least three months and at the most for one heating period  
\(winter\). No more than 5000 I may be stored in the heating room.  
The tanks must be inside a collecting tank with a volume sufficient  
to take the entire oil quantity \(secondary containment\). If the  
tanks are underground, equipment must be installed to protect  
against leakage, like double-walled tanks or plastic inner lining. In  
groundwater protection zones, maximum quantities and additional  
protection measures are prescribed.  
Inside buildings\: either plastic battery tanks each containing  
500-2000 I or steel tanks welded together on site, which can  
be any size. The tank storage room must be accessible and the  
tanks must be regularly checked for leaks. An internal tank room  
must also be able to contain the entire volume of oil in case of a  
leak. Tank installations must have filling and venting equipment,  
and also protection against overfilling. According to the type  
of storage, leak-warning systems may be required \(e.g. with  
underground tanks\).

Small Sewage Treatment Plants  
**0** Basic layouts of multi-chamber sedimentation tanks  
**f\) Small sewage treatment plants** are facilities for the cleaning of  
wastewater, which are used when the disposal of wastewater in  
municipal treatment works is not possible for technical, regulatory  
or financial reasons\: maybe there is no public sewer network  
available, or as a temporary measure. They are only permissible  
for the treatment of wastewater from, for example, kitchens,  
laundries, bathrooms, toilets and wash rooms.  
**Principle** of a small-scale sewage treatment plant\:  
1. Mechanical cleaning, i.e. sludge removal from a multi-chamber  
sedimentation tank --7 **0 - f\).**  
2. Biological cleaning in a filter trench or trickle filter or through  
underground filtration.  
The construction of a small-scale sewage treatment system  
consists of\: multi-chamber sedimentation tank, distribution shaft,  
filter trench \(trickle filter or underground filtration\), collection shaft,  
discharge into waterway.  
# Treatment process  
The residential wastewater is first fed into a sedimentation  
tank \(mechanical cleaning\), where solid matter settles to the  
bottom. It then flows into a distribution shaft, from where it is fed  
intermittently into a filter trench \(with perforated pipes\) or into a  
trickle filter \(biological cleaning\). The outflow pipes from the filter  
trench drain via a collection shaft into a waterway or soakaway.  
The mechanical process of wastewater treatment takes place  
in a **multi-chamber sedimentation tank.** Undissolved solids  
and solids capable of settling are sedimented \(sludge removal\)  
--7 **0- f\).**  
Biological cleaning \(secondary treatment\) of the wastewater  
takes place in a **filter trench.** The wastewater percolates from  
a perforated pipe into a layer of fine gravel \(2-8 mm\), the filter  
layer, into a deeper perforated pipe \(depth min. 1.25 m\). This then  
transports the water for discharge into a waterway --7 **e.**

# CHIMNEYS AND VENTILATION SHAFTS  
Chimneys  
Chimneys are shafts, within or next to buildings, intended to carry  
flue gases from fireplaces \(including ovens and appliances\) into  
the open air above the roof. The following must be connected to  
their **own chimney\:** each fireplace with a nominal heat output  
of more than 20 kW \(for gas fires and appliances, more than 30  
kW\), each fireplace in buildings of more than five full storeys, each  
open fireplace, each fireplace with burner and blower. **Shared**  
**chimneys** may connect up to three fireplaces for solid or liquid  
fuel with a nominal heating capacity of up to 20 kW or three gas  
fireplaces with nominal heating capacity of up to 30 kW.  
# Cross-sections  
Chimneys must have a circular or rectangular clear cross-section.  
The **minimum cross-sectional area** for chimneys made of  
shaped bricks is 100 cm2  
, the minimum side length 10 em \(for  
masonry chimneys 140 cm2  
, 13.5 em\). The longer side may not be  
more than 1.5 times the shorter.  
The cross-section can be calculated or taken from the approved  
tables produced by manufacturers of prefabricated chimneys *----1*  
**0 - 4D\).** In order to prevent condensation, a chimney should be  
fully utilised.  
# Fire protection  
The external surfaces of chimneys must be \~5 em from both  
combustible and flame-resistant building materials. Non-  
combustible building materials may be in direct contact or be  
separated by a 2 em wide insulated gap.

CHIMNEYS AND VENTILATION SHAFTS  
Open Fireplaces  
Open fireplaces must be structurally stable and made of non-  
combustible building materials. They can be built of fireclay  
blocks or slabs, bricks or blocks suitable for chimney construction,  
fireproof concrete or grey cast iron. Smoke hoods can be made of  
steel, brass or copper sheet.  
Each fireplace must be connected to its own chimney with a  
cross-section suitable for the fire -7 0-0. Fireplace and chimney  
should be built next to each other. The effective chimney height  
from smoke flue connection to chimney top \~4.5 m. The flue pipe  
is connected to the chimney at an angle of 45° -7 e - e.  
Open fireplaces must not be installed in rooms of less than  
12 m2 floor area. Sufficient air supply must be ensured\: air ducts,  
which introduce air near to the combustion chamber opening \(e.g .  
installed under the fireplace\), are suitable -7 0. There must be at  
least 80 em clear space from the combustion chamber \(to the  
front, sides and upwards\) to combustible building components  
and objects -7 0-0.

Ventilation Shafts  
Internal bathrooms and toilets must have air supplied and  
extracted through shafts or ducts. Traditionally, such shafts were  
built similarly to chimneys, but today they are more often installed  
in services shafts as part of the services.  
# Ventilation systems without fans  
Masonry ventilation shafts without fans *--7* **0- f\)** are practically  
maintenance-free but take up a lot of space. Their function  
**\(thermal up-draught\)** is highly dependent on the climatic  
conditions at the time and can often be deficient during high-  
pressure weather conditions. Because of the sound transfer  
and heat losses, ventilation systems without fans are now  
considered out of date and will therefore be found only in older  
buildings.  
A shaft is provided for each room with an extension above  
the roof, in accordance with the regulations for chimney tops  
\(--7 p. 537\), and a minimum cross-section of 140 cm2• An air  
supply duct from the open air must be installed at the lower

**8** Dimensions for collector shaft ventilation with thermal up-draught  
# Ventilation systems with fans  
For the on-demand ventilation of sanitary facilities in residential  
and commercial buildings like schools, hotels, pubs etc., to  
ventilate one or more rooms with one shaft *--7* **8 - 0.** Extraction  
systems should be designed for at least 4 air changes per hour in  
the rooms. A sufficient flow of air for bathrooms, including those  
with WC, is 60m3/hand for toilets per WC 30m3/h. Each internal  
room to be ventilated must also have an air supply opening,  
which cannot be closed, with a cross-section of 10 cm2 per m3  
room volume. The air leakage of the door can be assumed to be  
25 cm2  
•  
In bathrooms, a mm1mum temperature of 22°C must be  
maintained during operation of the fan. Airflow speeds in  
occupied zone \~0.2 m/s. The air should be extracted into the  
open air, or for single extraction systems into permanently well-  
ventilated roof spaces. Each single extraction system must have  
its own main riser duct. Central extraction systems have common  
extract ducts for a number of occupied areas *--7* **e.**  
# Fire protection  
According to building regulations, ventilation ducts including  
cladding and insulation must be of non-combustible materials.  
Ventilation systems in buildings of more than two full storeys  
or more than two residential units or systems, which cross fire  
compartments, must be constructed so that fire and smoke  
cannot be carried into other storeys or fire compartments.
