Loop Branch, Mobile, AL 36606, Preface  
The title "Pedestrian Planning and Design", may be  
considered by some to be a misnomer, since only the  
Good Lord can plan or design a pedestrian. The intent  
of the book, however, is to help fill the broad gap that  
exists in the planning and design of building and street  
spaces for comfortable and convenient human use.  
Much of this book is based on the author's dissertation,  
"Designing for Pedestrians", but this title was not used  
because it did not fully convey the objective and scope  
intended.  
The beginning of the book establishes the impor-  
tance of walking in urban design, and the problems  
of pedestrians in today's cities. There is a brief insight  
into some of the human physiological and psychologi-  
cal factors that affect the planning and design of  
pedestrian spaces. The traffic and space characteristics  
of pedestrians are developed in sufficient detail for an  
understanding of pedestrian traffic relationships. Sup-  
plementarywritten and pictorial descriptions of pedes-  
trian traffic interactions at various human space oc-  
cupancies provide a useful supplement for evaluating  
the environmental design quality of pedestrian build-  
ing and street spaces.  
The objectives of pedestrian planning programs,  
study procedures and methods of plan implementation  
are illustrated, and the design discussion is supple-  
mented by illustrative examples. The book closes with  
a short review of some of the programs that are in  
progress for the improvement of the pedestrian en-  
vironment.

Hamlet\> Act Two, Scene Two Walking is one of man's most magnificent abilities, a vital factor  
in his long journey up the evolutionary ladder and his progress  
towards civilization. Walking abilities shaped the first rudimen"  
tary human settlements and early cities. Because these cities were  
structured upon the convenience and comfort of the pedestrian,  
many of them were characterized by their human qualities of  
design. But the advent of machine transportation has caused  
a drastic restructuring of urban form, interposing the scale 6£ the  
vehicle into urban design. The conflict of man and auto has  
created an unbalanced competition for urban space. The auto  
has pervaded all phases of urban structure, causing a dilution of  
the human environment. The auto kills and maims the pedestrian,  
it causes noise, dust and fumes, and is detrimental in its socioH  
economic impacts. It threatens the very quality and viability of  
urban life.  
Long Walk  
About a million years ago, the antecedents of pedestrian man  
took the first steps on a journey to the stars. Fossil evidence sug-  
gests it was at about this time that the legH and foot\~bone developH  
ment of the early hominid began to make upright walking possible.  
One can visualize this primitive human lifting his gaze to the  
heavens, and reaching up to grasp the moon as if picking fruit  
from a tree. It must have given him a new exhilaration to pull  
himself erect to his full height, but it must have also filled him  
with a burning curiosity about the inaccessibility of the moon  
and stars,  
Darwin postulated that man's dominance of his environment  
began only after he gained the ability to walk erect, freeing his  
hands for the use of weapons and tools. Upright walking was a  
specialized human adaptation which was gradually evolved into  
the most efficient means of animal locomotion. It enabled man  
to cover long distances economically, opening up an entirely new  
spectrum of experience that became vital to his survival and de\~  
velopment. Efficient locomotion allowed him to flee from danger  
or to leave limited and hostile environments, It made him a pro-  
ficient hunter and food gatherer. The ever-widening ranges of  
the hunt moved him into encounters with the new and unexpected,  
forcing him to develop new skills and attitudes. The ever-increas-  
1 ing prospects of new horizons contributed to insatiable human  
desires for exploration, discovery and knowledge.  
About thirty-five thousand years ago, early man had completed  
his monumental evolutionary struggles and emerged as our more  
familiar species, pedestrian man. His range had extended from  
his first dependence on a tropical woodland savanna for protec-  
tion and survival, to habitation of the mountain, prairie, desert and  
tundra. Still pondering the mysteries of the heavens, he turned  
his attention to the mastery and shaping of his environment. His  
walking ability had brought him to this point, and he was con-  
scious of its importance to his continuing progress.  
The Pedestrian and the City of the Past  
Man's locomotive capabilities shaped the first primitive en\~  
campments and rudimentary cities. Walking distances determined  
their location, shape and size. The camp keepers required a pro-  
tected enclave that could be reached quickly on foot at the first  
threat of danger. The food gatherers had to be within walking dis-  
tance of edible wild plants, potable water and reliable hunting  
grounds. The bountifulness of the countryside would determine  
the number of inhabitants that could be supported. The hours of  
daylight limited the effective range of these primitive develop-  
ments to about a ten- to fifteen-mile walk in any direction. The  
most efficient walkers, the hunters, were the leaders of these early  
communities. Because the hunter was aware of the use of natural  
features of topography for defensive advantage, he determined  
the location and form of the settlement. The success or failure of  
the hunt was a central theme of early religious cults, and the  
proficient hunter grew to be one to be respected and served. Be-  
cause of their aggressiveness, their skills in the use of weapons  
and tactics, their strength and sharpened senses, the hunters be-  
came the first ruling class, dominating much of the early history  
of'man.  
About five thousand years ago, the first truly organized cities  
were founded around religion-oriented monarchies supported by  
a large subservient population. The advent of organized agricul-  
ture and domestication of animals allowed an expansion of city  
size because it provided larger and more reliable sources of food,  
Usually, the inner city was walled, and the temple, storehouse  
and palace were situated behind the wall. The general populace  
camped outside. The hunter became the pedestrian soldier, pro-  
tecting the ruler, administering and maintaining his justice and  
extending his influence.  
*2* In time, the institutional city gave way to a broader, more  
diversified type of development centered on collective defense.  
The walls of the city were \~xtended, and a much larger popula-  
tion was housed within the perimeter. Careful attention was given  
to selecting locations that could be defended easily. Hilltops,  
peninsulas and islands became prime sites. Where natural topog-  
raphy was lacking, artificial defensive features were constmcted.  
In some cases, the outer defensive wall became a physical re-  
straint to city development, forcing denser clusters of dwellings  
and the first examples of multi-story buildings.  
The great cities of history were built both to serve pedestrian  
man and to inspire him with social and religious cohesiveness.  
The placement and arrangement of the buildings and monuments  
of the Acropolis is said to have been based on human lines of  
sight and visual capabilities. When the Greek\$ entered the Acrop-  
olis, they wanted to view it as a unified whole, but with each build-  
ing and statue individually discernible and not interfering with  
the other. Building shape, location and natural topography were  
used to attain this objective. The Acropolis is an example of the  
design of a space for human scale, without introducing the dis\~  
continuity of conflicting visual or physical elements.  
The Parthenon of the ancient Acropolis \{ the "upper cHy"\), overlooking modern  
Athens.  
3 The ancient Romans and Hebrews recognized the disruption to  
scale caused by vehicular intrusion. Julius Caesar decreed that  
heavy wagons were forbidden within the central city after dusk.  
The Forum of Pompeii was an extensive pedestrian precinct com-  
prised of seven culs-de-sac. La-rge slab-like stone barriers were  
placed at all entrance points to prevent intrusion by vehicles. The  
Talmud; the Hebraic book of laws, decreed that special areas  
should be set aside along main thoroughfares for pedestrians to  
unload their burdens and rest. These areas were to be clearly  
marked and separated from vehicular intrusion by a perimeter of  
metal spikes or stone bollards.  
The need for human communication and interaction was rec-  
ognized by medieval city planners by providing a central pedes-  
trian plaza. It was designed as an open space to serve and visual-  
ly complement the Cathedral and other important buildings lo-  
cated around its perimeter. The plaza was the market place, a  
place for public pronouncements, religious and festive occasions,  
and recreation. The size of the plaza was a function of the number  
of people who might come together for these purposes.  
The human comfort and convenience of pedestrians was also  
not overlooked by medieval planners. Pedestrians were protected  
from the elements by gallerias, canopies, colonnades and· porticos.  
The old city of Bologna has a twenty-mile network of sidewalks  
covered by porticos which provides a cool, dry, pedestrian way  
in the summer and one that is free from snow in winter. This  
latter aspect is significant in a mountain town that has its quota  
of snowstorms, Bologna's system of covered sidewalks has been  
admired by many famous writers and philosophers for its pleasur-  
able strolling and the native sociability that it encourages. The  
covered, elevated sidewalk, a feature of some recent pedestrian  
proposals, also makes an occasional appearance in medieval  
architecture.  
The great Leonardo da Vinci, master of. all arts and sciences,  
recognized the value of grade-separated systems for pedestrian  
and vehicular traffic. He planned a city with a double network  
of streets, one elevated for pedestrians, the other at ground level  
to serve vehicles. Da Vinci, the engineer, recognized that the  
most efficient traffic system for both pedestrians and vehicles  
required separate, continuous networks for each. Da Vinci, the  
artist, recognized that the requirements of visual aesthetics could  
best be satisfied by a distinctive human perspective set above the  
city's milieu.  
4 The medieval plaza was a place for human communication **and** interaction-Piazza  
San Marco, Venice.  
The portico covered sidewalks of Bologna, Italy, protect pedestrians from the  
elements.  
5 There also appears to have been at least some recognition by  
medieval planners that building floor area should be a function of  
street width. Medieval cities limited building heights to two times  
the width of the street. Da Vinci was of the opinion that a ratio  
of one to one was more desirable. This contrasts with some  
modem cities where pavement and sidewalk widths have re-  
mained constant for a centmy or more, while building heights  
have been extended by hundreds of feet. In many of. these in-  
stances, sidewalk space has actually been reduced during this time  
to facilitate the movement of vehicles. The artisans of the past  
were not above adorning the sidewalks and· streets with textured  
pavements and mosaics for both practical and aesthetic purposes.  
The cobblestone streets of old Milan were paved in such a way that  
carriage wheels were guided away from the walkway\> thus pre-  
venting vehicles from swerving and hitting pedestrians. There is  
little evidence of this concern for the pedestrian in today's cities.  
Leonardo Da Vinci's Man-the master's studies of' human anatomy were reflected  
in his works of art and architecture.  
6 The Pedestrian and the City of Today  
Transportation, whether by walking or other means, has always  
been a significant determinant of the structure of the city. Be-  
cause the intemal transportation of the cities of the past \\Vas based  
on the convenience of walking, these cities were characterized by  
more attention to the human qualities of design. The advent of  
machine transportation has changed this perspective, forcing man  
into an unbalanced competition for urban space. The rni1roacl made  
the first great incursions into the city, bringing tracks, noise,  
smoke and cinders. In some places the railroads virtually oblit\~  
crated large sections of the city, paving them with ribbons of  
steel. But the railroad is confined to its tracks, which can *be* hid-  
den underground if necessary. The ubiquity of the auto has in-  
troduced much broader demands for space, pervading every part  
of the urban structure, confronting man at every tum, causing a  
vast dichotomy in the goals of city planning and design.  
Despite its advantages of personal mobility, the auto is re-  
sponsible for a great many negative changes h1 our society. It is  
a force that has imposed itself on every aspect of urban life,  
destroying many of the clements that made cities cohesive units  
dedicated to the social and cultural advancement of their inhab-  
itants. The auto's fumes contaminate the air, and its noise and  
vibration disturb sleep, conversation or contemplation. It kills and  
maims pedestrian man, forcing him to remain constantly alert  
and vigilant lest their paths cross. It imposes its *scale* upon urban  
design, requiring the allocation of vast amounts of space for its  
movement and storage. It isolates pedestrian man in a limited,  
ever-narrowing sidewalk environment, reducing opportunities for  
human social interaction and visual enjoyment. It has produced  
a visual clutter of traffic signals and signs. It is a source of frus-  
tration and humiliation to the pedestrian, v.rho is not only forced  
to wait in the rain and snow while the autoist in his climatized  
capsule environment enjoys traffic priority, but who may even  
be honked at or splashed if he docs not react quickly enough.  
The street and building spaces of the Urban Core or Central  
Business District magnify these problems because of their in-  
tensive concentration of pedestrians. The Central Business Dis-  
trict \(CED\) is usually comprised of variable land uses\: office  
buildings, government centers, shopping and entertainment cen-  
ters, restaurants, historical sites, and, in some cases, high-rise  
7 residential developments. The CBD is the focal point of the  
regional transportation network, and the center of confluence of  
transit and highways. Because of its infinite diversity, walking  
is the only means of transportation that can satisfy the many  
short, dispersed trip linkages required within the Central Busi-  
ness District. Downtown origin and destination surveys show  
that, in most *cities,* about ninety per cent of all internal trips  
within the CBD are walking trips.  
The traditional urban core is usually superimposed on an  
archaic street system surviving from the land use and functional  
scale of the past. The street system of the downtown financial  
district of Manhattan, for example, is a survivor from colonial  
times, when the tallest structure was of two or three stories.  
Now these same streets serve buildings that rise 50 to 100 stories  
in the air, representing millions of square feet of office sp?-ce.  
Thousands of ,vorkers and visitors enter and leave these build-  
ings each day, exceeding the capacity of the sidewalk and spilling  
over into the roadway. In a situation like this, maximum use of  
sidewalk area and flow capacity is a necessity.  
# The advent of machine transportation has forced man into an unbalanced competi-  
# tion for urban space.  
8 In many high-density Central Business Districts, the sidewalk  
width has actually been reduced to facilitate vehicular traffic  
movement. This results in a reduction of pedestrian traffic capa-  
city, but does not always produce a commensurate increase in  
vehicular capacity. The wider streets increase the probabilities  
of pedestrian-vehicle crosswalk conflicts, which limit the vehic-  
ular capacity of the intersection. The potential pedestrian capa-  
city of the CBD sidewalks is reduced further by the intrusion  
of various sidewalk impedimenta. Refuse cans, fire hydrants,  
fire alarm boxes, parking meters, traffic signals and poles, news-  
stands, telephone booths, kiosks, mail boxes, planters, sewer  
and ventilation gratings and similar devices detract from side-  
walk capacity. In addition, building-service operations, such as  
the unloading or loading of trucks inconvenience, and sometimes  
endanger, the pedestrian. In many instances, no control has been  
exercised over the location of fixed sidewalk paraphernalia, and  
they often appear in clusters at corner intersections, the most  
critical points in the pedestrian circulation network. Space is  
# A conglomeration of sidewalk paraphernafia blocking a pedestrian crosswalk.  
9 needed at intersection comers for accumulations of pedestrians  
waiting for traffic signals and for the weaving of intersecting  
sidewalk flows. Because of its concentrations of traffic, the corner  
is the ideal location for newsstands, telephone booths and mail  
boxes. It is also the most common location for transit-bus stops  
and rapid transit entrances. The pedestrian is further harassed  
at the corner by vehicles stopped in the crosswalk, or turning  
into crossing pedestrians. vVhen a rapid transit entrance is situ-  
ated within a narrow sidewalk near an intersection, it is an out-  
standing example of compounded insensitivity to the pedestrian.  
Because the sidewalk itself is narrow, excessively narrow sub-  
way stairs are provided, causing pedestrian queues both in the  
transit station below and on the surface above at the point where  
pedestrian space is already critically deficient. All these factors  
add up to inconvenience and delay for the pedestrian. But  
despite the fact that the total amount *of* pedestrian delay time  
may far exceed driver delay time within the CBD, traffic signal-  
ization is invariably desi6 \:rned to facilitate vehicular flow.  
**A narrow subway stair placed within a narrow city sidewalk.** The rectangular grid pattern of the typical CBD provides a  
good directional image and space delineation, but it is not  
conducive to the characteristically short pedestrian trips that  
occur there. In some instances, the grid pattern of \~·fanhattan's  
streets require a time-and energy-consuming 1000 foot walk  
for a straight-line trip distance of only 200 feet. Larger mid-  
block buildings with frontages on adjacent streets are often used  
as through-routes, so that the pedestrian can shorten trip dis-  
tances. This practice is more common in inclement weather. De-  
pending on city location, one day in four may be too windy, cold  
or wet for the pedestrian's comfort. Protection of the pedestrian  
from the clements js an almost forgotten amenity in most cities.  
Intense vehicular utilization of city streets is causing significant  
socio-economic impacts on urban life which are only now begin-  
ning to be recognized. A sociological study of nearby residential  
streets in the same neighborhood in San Francisco, subjected  
to light and heavy traffic, gives a partial insight into this problem.  
The streets were physically alike in almost all respects excz'.pt  
that the sidcwa1k on the heavy-traffic street had been narrowed  
to facilitate vehicular movement. In addition, sound-meter  
samples on the heavy-traffic street showed that sound levels were  
above 65 decibels at the sidewalk 4,5 per cent of the time, as  
contrasted to 5 per cent for the light-traffic street. Despite the  
ph\:·sical similarities of the streets, drastic differences in social  
atlitucks and neighborhood identity were noted between the  
two streets.  
The light-traffic street was predominantly a family street, with  
incliviclually owned homes and an average length of residence  
of 16 years. The heavy-traffic street was comprised of nearly all  
renters, with fow children and an average length of residence of  
8 years. Social interaction and neighborhood identity and in-  
terest differed widely on the two streets. Residents on the light-  
traffic street were found to have three times as many local  
friends as those on the heavy-traffic street. Residents on the  
light-traffic street were found to have a greater sense of ncighbor-  
hoocl and territorial identity, striving more to maintain and im-  
prove their homes. The heavy-traffic street residents stressed  
their concern for safety, and the continual invasions of privacy  
caused by the passing autos. They also indicated greater concern  
over noise, dust, fumes and vibration. Elclcrlv residents of this  
street exhibited more emotional stress than those of the light-  
traffic street.  
11 Pedestrian Safety  
In 1969, 56,400 people were killed by motor vehicle accidents  
in the United States. Of this total, 9,800, or 17.4 per cent, were  
pedestrians. In addition, 150,000 pedestrians were injured by  
motor vehicles. This loss of human life and the suffering caused  
by these accidents is a serious national problem. The economic  
cost in salary loss and medical expenses exceeds one-half billion  
dollars annually.  
The majority of adult pedestrian fatality victims are persons  
who have not been licensed to drive. The pedestrian who has  
never driven faces special hazards, because he is unfamiliar with  
the limitations of the vehicle or driver. He is not aware of the  
driver's limited vision, particularly at night, nor is he capable  
of estimating a car's minimum stopping distance at various  
speeds. The child pedestrian is an especially vulnerable accident  
victim because of gaps in language, perception, and visual and  
auditory comprehension. Many aspects of human perception,  
such as peripheral vision, depth perception, judgement of speed  
and direction, and sound recognition, are attained through ex-  
perience, which the child pedestrian has not yet acquired. This  
lack of experience causes not only perceptual difficulties, but  
uncertain reactions under the stress of frightening or unusual  
confrontations with moving traffic. In addition, children do not  
comprehend mad signs, or if they do, they do not fully under-  
stand their responsibilities to obey these signs.  
The stratification of accident statistics by age also shows a  
disproportionate involvement risk for the young, and a higher  
severity risk for the elderly. In the United States, more than one-  
half of the pedestrians injured came from the one-third of the  
population that is under 14 years of age. One-quarter of the fatal-  
ities occurred in the less than ten per cent of the population over  
age 65. Surprisingly, male pedestrians comprise more than two-  
thirds of all pedestrian accident victims, including fatalities.  
Weather and darkness significantly affect pedestrian accident  
rates. Pedestrian casualties have been found to trip1e with darkness,  
with a similar three-fold increase on rainy versus clear days. The  
combination of rainfall and darkness increases the pedestrian  
accident risk factor by more than nine. It is not commonly known,  
but alcohol is a contributing factor in about one-quarter of all  
pedestrian deaths. Alcohol dulls the pedestrian's sense of judge-  
ment, and gives him a false feeling of confidence that is con-  
ducive to greater risk-taking.  
12 Pedestrian fatalities are primarily an urban problem, with  
two-thirds of all deaths occurring in urban areas. However, ac-  
cident studies of eleven major cities show that despite the heavy  
concentrations of pedestrians in central business districts, they  
were found to account for only about 14 per cent of all city pe-  
destrian casualities. This is due to lower allowable speeds in the  
central business district and greater driver awareness of heavier  
pedestrian traffic. About two-thirds of all pedestrian accidents  
in the central business district occur at intersections, suggesting  
that special attention must be given to these points. Although it  
is generally believed that turning vehicles represent the greatest  
hazard to the pedestrians at !\~1tersections, about two-thirds of  
intersection accidents involve cars that are moving straight ahead.  
Of this total, more than half occur after the vehicle has left the  
near crosswalk. Left-turning vehicles are involved in about twice  
as many accidents as right-turning vehicles. Crossing between  
intersections has a higher severity risk, accounting for more than  
one-third of all urban pedestrian deaths.  
Reduction of the pedestrian accident toll is a national problem  
which is being treated at the local level with varying degrees of  
concern. Although *some* standardization of pedestrian signs and  
signals has been recommended in the Manual of Uniform Traffic  
Control Devices, the manual itself has two standards for pe-  
destrian signals, one for neon tube signs with a green WALK and  
a red DON'T WALK indication, and the other for incandescent  
signals with white WALK and orange DON'T WALK indication. A  
survey, comprised of questionnaire returns from more than 1600  
cities, illustrated the confusion arising from the lack of a uniform  
method of pedestrian signalization. Based on survey returns, 38  
per cent of the cities used the orange DON'T WALK indication, 56  
per cent used red, and the remaining 6 per cent used white or  
other colors. The white WALK standard was used by 49 per cent  
of the cities, green 44 per cent, with the remaining 7 per cent  
using other colors. More than one-third of the respondents to the  
survey were not using the flashing DON'T WALK indication for the  
end of the walk cycle. Similar confusion exists in pedestrian  
signing and traffic laws. Some states have strong pedestrian right-  
of-way laws, while others do not. Motorists and pedestrians ac.,  
customed to signs, signals, and rules in one part of the country  
may be confronted by significant differences in another. The lack  
of a uniform national approach to pedestrian safety causes con-  
fusion for both motorist and pedestrian, and undoubtedly results  
14 in unnecessary pedestrian casualties. Pedestrian safety is a prob-  
lem that crosses all state lines. This requires the establishment  
of a national system of traffic laws, traffic signalization and signs,  
implemented uniformly throughout the country, with Federal as-  
sistance if necessary.  
Handicapped Pedestrian  
An estimated 12 million persons in the United States have  
serious physical disabilities which limit their mobility and the  
activities and work that they may do. The seriously handicapped  
include 250,000 in wheel chairs, 2 million orthopedically impaired  
children and 5 million cardiac cases. Each year, 100,000 children  
are born with birth defects that will force them to use crutches,  
braces or wheel chairs for the rest of their lives. In addition to  
these serious disabilities, many millions have minor sight defici-  
encies or other physical impairments which limit their locomotive  
capabilities. Added to the ranks of perrnanently handicapped pe-  
destrians are the aged, whose motor capabilities have slowed  
down, persons temporarily disabled due to accidents and persons  
encumbered with baby carriages, heavy baggage or packages.  
The ranks of the physically handicapped have been expanding  
much faster than the general population growth because\:  
• medical advances have decreased the number of accidental  
deaths, thus increasing the ni1mber of disabled;  
longer average life spans have increased the number of aged  
and infirm; and  
@ more leisure time, greater personal mobility, and expanded  
opportunities for recreation have increased accident exposure  
for all persons.  
Because of thoughtless architectural barriers, many of these  
persons have been denied opportunities for education, employ\~  
ment and recreation. Although they comprise a large segment  
of the public, they have been denied access to many "public"  
buildings and transit systems. This has relegated many of the  
aged and handicapped to the status of disenfranchised citizens,  
denied free access to the courts, polling places or public edu\~  
cational and cultural institutions. There are instances where  
handicapped citizens have been unable to attend court to defend  
their own interests. At best, they are often required to use freight  
elevator facilities, commonly used for refuse removal.  
15 High curbs and sewer gratings cause difficulties for all pedestrians, but particularly  
the handicapped.  
Long flights of stairs present a formidable obstacle to the handicapped pedestrian.  
16 The common barriers to the aged and handicapped include\:  
steps or curbs that are too high; long flights of stairs; inaccessible  
elevators; steep and narrow walks; gratings in walkways; doors  
that are too narrow, revolve, or are hard to open; too-narrow  
aisles in theatres, stadiums and other public gathering places;  
and lack of accommodations for wheelchairs. In addition, little  
if any consideration has been given to improving the mobility  
and safety of the blind and partially sighted, by supplementary  
auditory or tactile means. Needless to say, every eff01t should  
be made to improve the personal mobility and quality of life  
for these persons subjected to the daily hardships connected with  
their disabilities. Furthermore, improvements made for the aged  
and the handicapped are improvements which ease the mobility  
of all.

The qualitative design of a pedestrian environment requires  
a basic understanding of related human characteristics and capa-  
bilities. The physical dimensions of the body determine working  
widths of doorways and passageways, and affect the practical  
capacity of moving stairs and walkways. Psychological prefer-  
ences of avoiding bodily contact with others is a determinant of  
inter-person spacing in queues and other crowded pedestrian  
environments. Normal human locomotion involves many complex  
characteristics of balance, timing and even human sight, which  
are often taken for granted by all but the handicapped. Natural,  
free-speed locomotion requires spacial components for pacing  
and for human sensing and reaction. Human locomotion exhibits  
different characteristics on level surfaces and on stairs, with the  
latter requiring much more attention to design because of safety  
and energy expenditure. The perception of urban space is related  
to its coherence of expression. Confused spacial design lowers  
human receptivity to aesthetics and other secondary visual inputs.  
Human Body 1mens1cms - The Body Ellipse  
Body depth and shoulder breadth are the primary human  
measurements used by designers of pedestrian spaces and facili-  
ties. Shoulder breadth is a factor affecting the practical capacity  
of doorways, passageways, stairways and mechanical devices such  
as escalators and moving walks. Many of these facilities are os-  
tensibly designed to allow two or more persons to pass through  
abreast, but actually have insufficient portal width for this pur-  
pose, limiting their convenience and capacity. For example, a  
moving-walk manufacturer offers a "double width" unit with a  
tread width of only 36 inches. This is insufficient to accommodate  
the normal space requirements of two persons standing abreast  
or walking parallel to each other. Observations of the use of  
this type of moving walk reveals that a single pedestrian with  
baggage or parcels can restrict both the boarding of other pedestri-  
ans and their potential locomotion on the walk after boarding.  
A compilation of body dimensions from a large number of  
human-factors studies shows a shoµlder breadth of 20.7 inches  
for the 99th percentile \( 99 per cent are less than this\) of civilian  
19 men, with a recommended ad-  
dition of rn inches for heavy  
clothing. A similar study of ful-  
# BODY ELLIPSE  
ly clothed male laborers gave  
a body depth dimension of 13.0  
18" BODY DEPTH  
inches, and a shoulder breadth  
of 22.8 inches, for the 95th per-  
centile. The larger male body  
dimensions have been quot-  
ed because, generally, a larger  
body ellipse has been used in  
most design applications.  
The plan view of the aver-

occupies an area of about rn  
square feet. An 18 by 24 inch  
body ellipse, equivalent to· an area of 2.3 square feet, has been  
used to determine the practical standing capacity of New York  
City· subway cars. A U.S. Army human factors design manual  
also recommends the use of these dimensions. The larger design  
ellipse allows for the fact that many pedestrians are carrying  
personal articles, natural psychological preferences to avoid bodily  
contact with others, and body sway. Body sway may be observed  
during both human locomotion and while standing. Although  
standing is generally considered a static activity, body sway and  
foot-shifting are required to aid in the return of blood to the  
brain and the resting of leg muscles.  
The elliptical body template, drawn to scale, provides a simple  
and convenient method of visualizing many situations involving  
confined pedestrians. A 45-degree elliptical template, with various  
size ellipses, will give the designer sufficient range for a number  
of different scale applications. The body template technique is  
used to dev\~lop standards for queuing in Chapter Three.  
The Perception of Personal Space - The Body Buffer Zone  
Humans value personal space. As they acquire status and  
wealth they select larger offices, automobiles and homes. The  
pedestrian has his own personal space preferences which are  
related to his .sense of "territory" and body image. If freedom of  
choice exists, pedestrians will adopt personal spacing which avoids  
contact with others, except in special circumstances such as a  
crowded elevator, where this unwritten law may be temporarily  
suspended.  
20 Pedestrian conduct on sidewalks and other walkways is gov-  
erned by personal body buffer zone concepts and hierarchical pri-  
orities of age, status, sex and handicaps. The average pedestrian has  
been found to yield the right of way to more aggressive or fonni-  
dable-looking pedestrians, couples or other identifiable groups,  
and the aged and handicapped. In dense tr'affic streams this  
requires a deferential step-and-slide movement, by which the  
yielding pedestrian turns sideways to reduce his bodily projec-  
tion in the walkway space. In more crowded conditions, both ap-  
proaching pedestrians may yield and tum to avoid contact with  
each other. All these territorial mles of conduct go on quite rm-  
noticed by most pedestrians, but personal space preferences are  
of interest to the designer because inter-person spacing of pedestri-  
ans affects the practical and comfortable environmental capacity  
of such facilities as theatre lobbies, elevators and escalators.  
Hall, an anthropologist, has observed that there are different  
cultural attitudes towards personal space throughout the world.  
I\\fany eastern and mideastem societies accept much closer spac-  
ing and a greater degree of personal contact than is normally  
tolerated by Americans. The larger inter-person spacing preferred  
by Americans is often interpreted as aloofness in these countries,  
producing an unintentioned communication gap. Hall's studies  
led him to the classification of spacial distances based on human  
sensory characteristics. \( appendix reference\) He established four  
general categories; public distance, social distance, personal dis-  
tance, and intimate distance, with close and far phases in each  
category. These classifications are based on sensory shifts due to  
the changing characteristics of sight, smell, thermal receptivity,  
hearing and capabilities of touch at varying distances.  
At public distances beyond hventy-five feet, there is limited  
sensory involvement, since verv little of the personal detail of  
othen,' can *be* detected. Oral c\~mmunication is characterized by  
loudness and more exaggerated and stylized enunciation. Most  
actors know that at this distance the non-verbal elements of com-  
munication must be emphasized, including body stance, gestures  
and movement. At pub!ic distances of from t\\vclvc to twenty-  
five feet, the voice remains stylized, but volume is decreased and  
there is less emphasis on gesture and stance. Facial expressions,  
such as a frown or a srniie, mav be detected, but not facial details  
such as eye color, skjn text\:u;.e and the condition of the teeth.  
This is the probable range of the humm1 "flight" zone, wherein  
an alert subject can take evasive or defensive action if threatened.  
21 At twelve feet, social distance, or the circle of personal involve-  
ment and potential vulnerability, begins. In the historical context\:  
it might be compared to the circle within which two combatants  
with foncing foils would parry and thrust *\("en garde!"\).* Most formal  
business and conversation is conducted at the social distance of  
seven to twelve feet. By extending the body and stretching the  
arms, objects may be passed from one person to another. The  
finest details of the face are not yet discernible, but the condition  
of the clothes and other aspects of personal grooming may be  
detected. Heat or odor from another person's body is not likely  
to *be* perceived. The full length of the human figure, with some  
space around it, is encompassed by a level 60-degree gaze. Per-  
sonal involvrnent is increased at a social distance of between  
four and seven feet. Physical contact between subjects can be  
made with comparative ease with outstretched arms, but it is  
not possible to seize or strike the other person. It is conver-  
sational distance for casual social gatherings, for people who work  
together and for impersonal business. Considerable facial detail  
may be detected, including skin texture and hair condition. It is  
normally out- of the range of breath odors or other body odors  
and body heat.  
The personal distance, of between two-and-one-half and four  
feet, is within easy hand-shaking distance for two persons, or  
touching distance with the outstretched arm of one person. It is  
within a "circle of trust" because it is possible to seize or strike the  
other person. The fine details of complexion, teeth condition and  
personal cleanliness can be detected at this distance. Occasionally,  
breath odor and the use of colognes may also be perceived. At  
personal distances of one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half feet, bodily  
contact with others can be avoided, but contact can easily be  
made by minor extension of the extremities, This is the spacing  
likely to be adopted by a person waiting on a queue line to pur-  
chase a theatre ticket. Personal details of cleanliness and groom-  
ing may be readily detected, and some body and breath o·dors  
perceived.  
Intimate \<lis\_tance, eighteen inches or less, is within the whole  
range of hcjghtened sensory involvement. The sounds, heat and  
sme1l of the other person arc all perceived and involuntary body  
contact may be difficult to avoid. In crowded environments this  
requires special codes of conduct to signal that there is no intent  
of unwanted intimacy. In crowded elevators, women may be  
observed folding their arms and men keeping their hands against  
22 Human Body Buffer Zones  
Social distance, or the circle of personal involvement, begins at an inter-person  
spacing of twelve feet.  
Left-The close phase of social distance, between four to seven feet, is conversa-  
tional spacing for casual social gatherings and impersonal business.  
Right-Personal distance, or the "circle of trust" begins at a spacing of four fee+. their sides. Sight is often distorted, making this distance visually  
uncomfortable for some persons. Involuntary confrontation and  
contact at this distance is psychologically disturbing for many  
persons.  
Human buffer zone experiments by psychologists and psy-  
chiatrists have confirmed these evaluations of personal space. In  
one series of experiments, natural personal approach distances  
were measured between various participants and male and female  
subjects, both ·with and without emphasis on personal comfort.  
In the experiment where the personal comfort criterion was em-  
phasized, participants were instructed that their distance to the  
subject was to be· regulated to the point at which some personal  
discomfort about the proximity to the subject was experienced.  
In each of these experiments, approaches from different aspects  
of the compass were measured, and the resultant buffer zones  
delineated. In the case where the personal comfoit criterion was  
not emphasized, the buffer zones ranged between 2.4 and 2.8  
square feet in area, a slightly larger area than the design ellipse  
recommended earlier.  
Where personal comfort was emphasized, a wider variation in  
body buffer zones was discovered, with both male and female  
participants selecting larger inter-person separations from male  
subjects. The buffer zone around the female subjects ranged be-  
tween four and five square feet in area, and around male subjects  
eight to nine square feet. The larger buffer zones selected around  
the male subjects by both the male and female participants in the  
experiment were interpreted by psychiatrists as the inherent rec-  
ognition of potential male aggressiveness. This is in keeping with  
an "arms reach" separation. As a point of reference, an opened  
women's umbrella, 30 inches in diameter, covers an area of about  
five square feet, and an opened men's umbrella, 43 inches in di-  
ameter, an area of about ten square feet.  
Similar experiments, conducted in a prison, revealed that nor-  
mal male prisoners would allow an experimenter to approach  
them up to an approximate radius of 18 inches, or the equivalent  
of an area zone of seven square feet. Potentially violent, schizo-  
phrenic types of prisoners preferred up to four times this area.  
The larger personal buffer zones selected by abnormal subjects  
suggests some mental health relationships with crowding. En-  
vironmental studies of lower animals have shown detrimental ef-  
fects due to crowding, but potential human effects remain un-  
known.  
24 The concept of buffer zones also extends into other human  
activities. The motorist on the highway establishes a large buffer  
zone, comprised of his mental image of the extremities of his  
vehicle, plus the amount of space required for safe stopping of  
the auto. Penetration of this zone by the cutting in of other motor\~  
ists is strongly resented. Similarly, normal human locomotion re-  
quires larger zones than were observed for the less dynamic  
situations described in the previous section. This characteristic  
was aptly described by one of the astronauts, when he stated that  
the lunar walk still required him to "think two paces ahead, just  
like walking on Earth."  
The space required for locomotion may be divided into a  
pacing zone, the area required for foot placement, and the sensoffl  
\:ry zone, the area required by the pedestrian for perception, evalu-  
ation and reaction. The length of the pacing zone is dependent  
on the age, sex and physical condition of the pedestrian, and has  
been shown to have a direct linear relationship with speed. Both  
the pacing and sensory zones can be affected by external influ-  
ences such as terrain and traffic conditions. Pedestrian pacing  
lengths may be physically measured, but sensory zone require-  
.ments are comprised of many human perceptual and psycho-  
.logical factors.  
For reasons of personal safety, or social conventions of avoiding  
brushing others, or just the joy of sightseeing, the pedestrian is  
constantly monitoring a whole range of sensory stimuli. His hear-  
ing may alert him to a warning automobile horn, his touch to  
slippery or irregular terrain, his sight to a myriad of visual infor-  
mation, including signs and traffic signals, or collision courses with  
other pedestrians. These sensory stimuli must be evaluated, and  
the pedestrian must react in time to avoid danger.  
The capabilities of human vision and distance judgement can  
have a significant effect on ped€strian activities. Gibson, \( ap-  
pendix reference\) uses the term "locomotor vision" to describe a  
whole series of specialized visual characteristics connected with  
requirements of judging the velocity, distance and direction of  
others during walking. Somehow pedestrians, through use of  
vision and their own specialized mental computer, are able to  
keep track of the varying speeds and angles of oncoming *pe-*  
destrians and to accurately adjust their pace and speed to avoid  
collision.  
25 Observations of pedestrians with poorer sight confirms the  
importance of vision to locomotion. These visually handicapped  
pedestrians walk more slowly, negotiate stairs more cautiously,  
and often stop momentarily to get their bearings. The limitations  
of human vision can even restrict the locomotion of normally  
sighted persons in some situations. The human eye is capable of  
detecting very sharp detail within the very small, cone-shaped  
range of only 3 to 5 degrees. The less acute aspects of detailed  
vision are possible up to a conical range of about 12 degrees, but,  
beyond this, vision becomes less detailed, and the comfortable  
range of general vision is a cone of from 60 to 70 degrees. Pe-  
destrians use the smaller acute cones of vision when caution is  
required, such as in stair locomotion or when boarding an esca-  
lator. In the more general range of comfortable sight capability,  
it is necessary to be at least seven feet away from another person  
to observe him from head to toe. This spacing is likely to be  
adopted in human locomotion at normal walking speeds to avoid  
stepping on the heels of the person in front.  
Reaction time, or time elapsing between visual stimulation and  
subsequent physical reaction, is an element of the human sensory  
zone. In controlled studies of automobile braking, it was found  
that four- to five-tenths of a second elapsed between a visual signal  
and foot pressure on the brake pedal. This eye-to-foot reaction  
time increased with age. Reaction times would come into play in  
human locomotion, and also in the boarding of mechanical aids,  
such as escalators and moving walks. The slower reaction times of  
the elderly account in part for their longer boarding times on  
escalators, which results in reductions in effective escalator ca-  
pacity. In normal free-speed locomotion, the pedestrian will pro-  
ject a clear zone ahead of him to allow sufficient reaction time to  
take evasive action.  
# Walking  
Biped walking is a uniquely hurnan skill, which man has  
evolved into the most efficient means of animal locomotion. Walk-  
ing has been likened to the human counterpart of the wheel, be-  
cause of the rolling action of the body's center of gravity and the  
rotary application of propulsive and supportive forces by the legs  
and feet. ·walking is one of man's most invigorating exercises,  
stimulating the mind and virtually every muscle of the body,  
while consuming very little energy. The caloric consumption at  
normal speed is less than 100 calorics per mile, or the equivalent

27 of a 35-mile walk for the weight loss of one pound. Despite its  
efficiency and apparent ease, walking is a compJex mental and  
kinesthetic activity, taken for granted by all but the handicapped.  
Walking requires constant shifts in the body's center of gravity to  
maintain balance, adjustments in the application of foot forces for  
differences in terrain friction and slope, and adjustments of pacing  
length and timing to alter speed and direction.  
There are a number of distinctive phases in the walking cycle.  
The stride begins with the body swaying forward to overcome its  
inertia. To keep the body balance, one of the walker's feet must  
swing forward to widen the body's pedestal support. The leg still  
to the rear of the body then provides the propulsive force that  
drives the body forward. After the push-off by the rear foot, it  
is swung forward, clearing the ground because the leg is bent  
at the hip, knee and ankle. The leg is straightened at the end of  
the swing phase, but the ankle remains bent, resulting in the heel  
striking the ground first. This heel strike concludes the swing  
phase, and the body continues to move forward with the weight  
rolling about the ball of the foot until another push-off is delivered  
by the rear foot. Ground friction is a factor in locomotion because  
the force of the push-off is dependent on sufficient opposing  
frictional force. The horizontal component of foot force at the  
push-off is about 20 per cent of the body weight, and the heel  
strike 15 per cent. However, ground friction plays a more im-  
portant role at the heel strike, because this is the point in the  
walkmg cycle when a person is most likely to slip.  
The timing and pacing sequence of the walking cycle is thought  
to be a deeply engraved neurological pattern which is relatively  
fixed through the greater part of the individual's life span. Ex-  
periments based on electrical measurements of the time spacing  
between foot contacts, and contact duration in the normal human  
walking pace, have shown a remarkable consistency of gait timing  
between all ages and sexes. There are differences in other aspects  
of human walking based on the age and sex of the individual. A  
familiar feature of the way women walk arises from anatomical  
differences in the proportions of the male and female pelvis. The  
smaller range through which the female hip can move backwards  
and forwards results in a greater pelvic rotation- by females for a  
given length of stride. This aspect of female locomotion has not  
gone unnoticed by male observers of the passing scene. Aging has  
the effect of reducing the degree of pelvic rotation for both male  
and female walkers, reducing the length of stride and thus reduc\~  
28 The Human Walking Cycle

of the leading foot; tho rear foot provides the push off and is then lifted, with the  
body-weight moving forward over the leading foot\: the rear foot is swung forward

29 ing normal walking speed. Length of stride and pacing rate are  
determinants of speed, with faster walking characteristically re-  
quiring an alteration in the body's center of gravity by effecting a  
forward stance similar *to* leaning into the wind.  
Detailed photographic observations of male walking patterns  
have shown a body sway of 4 centimeters \( rn inches\) to the left  
and right during normal locomotion. This sway has not been ac-  
curately measured in dense crowds, where human locomotion is  
restricted to shuffling, but photographic observations show that it  
is more pronounced, in the range of almost 4 inches *to* either side.  
This swaying requirement during restricted locomotion is one of  
the annoying aspects of walking in a dense crowd, since contact  
with another pedestrian during the sway causes a momentary loss  
of balance. Sway measurements have not been made of pedestri-  
ans on stairs, but photographic observations indicate a swaying  
pattern similar to the more restricted locomotion in crowds. Most  
building codes have assumed working widths of stairs based only  
on multiples of human shoulder dimensions, without allowance  
for this swaying factor.  
locomotion on Stairs  
Stair climbing and descent is quite different from walking. Loco-  
motion on stairs is necessarily more restricted because of safety  
considerations, and the restraints imposed by the stair tread and  
riser configurations. Human energy consumption for climbing  
stairs is about ten to fifteen times the energy needed for walking  
the equivalent horizontal distance, and surprisingly, about one-  
third greater for descent.  
When climbing stairs the body's center of gravity is shifted  
forward, and the front leg is lifted and placed on the first step  
to support the body and to prevent it from falling forward. Both  
the front and rear legs provide the push-off, so that the lifting  
action of both legs is coordinated to provide combined power for  
ascent. The rear leg is then lifted and swung forward and placed  
on the second step, and the cycle is repeated. In descending, the  
center of gravity must be held backward because of the increased  
danger of falling. Although less energy is required for descent,  
and speeds of descent are about one-third greater than needed for  
climbing, greater concentration is required to control the rate by  
which gravity acts on the body. This requires a careful lowering  
of the weight to the supporting foot on the step below.  
30 Human locomotion on Stairs  
During ascent, the body's center of gravity is shifted forward and the front foot is  
placed on the first step. Both front and rear legs provide the push-off to raise the  
body. The rear leg is lifted, swung forward and the foot is placed on the next step.  
During descent, the body's center of gravity is held backward and the waighi' is  
carefully lowered onto the front foot. The rear leg is then lifl-ed, swung forward, and  
the foot lowered to the next step.  
31 A body sway of about 4 inches occurs as the weight is shifted  
from foot to foot. As mentioned in the previous section, most  
building codes have not taken body sway into consideration, speci-  
fying stairway widths in multiples of 22 inches, equivalent to the  
human shoulder breadth. Based on stair locomotion characteristics  
and observed use of stairs, a 30-inch lane width standard would  
be more applicable to the dimensioning of narrow stairs.  
There are definite shifts in the pacing and sensory ·character-  
istics of locomotion on stairs. Instead of selecting a natural pacing  
distance, the width of the tread determines the pacing distance  
for all, regardless of physical ability or desired speed. Faster  
walking is accomplished by increasing the pacing rate and dis-  
tance, but increased pacing rate is the only way of increasing  
stair speeds unless stairs are taken two at once, a dangerous and  
tiring action. Sensory shifts occur on stairs due to the need to use  
the smaller, more acute cone of vision for more accurate foot  
placement, and to avoid tripping.  
Stair tread, riser, and nosing configurations produce other ef-  
fects on stair locomotion as well. Many persons with normal walk-  
ing skill are inconvenienced by stair designs that are incompatible  
with the bending capabilities of the knee and foot. Handicapped  
persons experience great difficulty on stairs. Individuals with  
knee, ankle or hip restrictions, artificial legs, leg braces or crutches  
are painfully inconvenienced by high riser heights and stairs with  
projecting nosings which catch the foot. For this reason, the Amer-  
ican Standards Specifications for barrier-free building design  
\(All7.1, 1961\) recommends a maximum riser height of 7 inches  
and a rounded nosing flush with the riser, rather than the pro-  
jecting nosing in common use.  
Human energy consumption in stair locomotion has also been  
found to be related to riser height. A medical research study of  
energy expenditures using variable treadmill stairs set at angles  
of 27, 38 and 40 degrees, showed that energy 'COnsumption on  
stairs was more closely correlated with riser height than with  
tread length, run, diagonal distance or any other single dimension  
of stair design. In these experiments, a riser height increase of  
37.5 per cent, from 6 inches to 8.25 inches, resulted in an increase  
in energy cost of 96 per cent in ascending, and 58 per cent in  
descending. Significant increases in pulse rate and blood pres-  
sure were also noted with the greater stair angles; From this  
human factors standpoint, there are many examples of poorly  
designed stairs. Based on current architectural practice, the range  
32 of permissible stair angle design is between 20 and 50 degrees,  
with the preferred range \( by convention\) between 30 and 35  
degrees. Stair angles below 20 degrees and above 50 degrees are  
considered dangerous. Structural designers are usually concerned  
more with designing stairs that fit into the normal bay spacing  
than with providing a more human design which would require  
changes in framing dimensions. The survey of stair climbing  
speeds reported in Chapter Three found that a stair with a 6-inch  
riser, a 12-inch tread, and a stair angle of 26.5 degrees had more  
favorable locomotion characteristics and faster pedestrian climb-  
ing speeds even though this stair angle is outside the "preferred"  
architectural range. Additional research is required to determine  
principles of stair design from the standpoints of the normal  
human locomotion characteristics, energy consumption, and traf-  
fic efficiency.  
Perception Urban Space  
The human perception of large-scale space is a complex process  
because of the increased role of mental imagery and selectivity.  
The pedestrian would be helplessly overwhelmed with useless  
information if every detail of a large space had to be precisely  
recognized, mentally cataloged, and separately evaluated. A pro-  
cess of selectivity occurs in which secondary visual information  
is shunted to a level of sub-receptivity, with a concurrent height\~  
ening of receptivity to the visual input which is most needed. *As*  
an illustration\> gas station signs along the highway receive little  
attention from the driver unless the gas gauge is near empty. Then  
the receptivity to this particular visual input is increased. If the  
gas stations are closely spaced, the resulting sense of confidence  
allows a further increase in receptivity, so that the driver's visual  
input and selectivity can be expanded to include only stations on  
the near side of the road, or those selling specific brands. In this  
limited example, the driver's identification of the visual statement  
of closely spaced stations increased his confidence and the range  
of receptivity to added supplementary or secondary information.  
In a similar manner, the full perception of a large space is closely  
related to its legibility and clarity of expression. If the visual ele-  
ments that define the space convey purpose and orientation to the  
pedestrian, then a wider range of receptivity to other visual inputs  
is possible. If the visual elements that comprise a space are poorly  
defined, then a greater degree of concentration is required by the  
pedestrian to obtain orientation and direction. The required con\~  
33 centration on the specifics of identity and orientation within a  
poorly defined space, is likely to reduce receptivity and aware-  
ness of the aesthetic elements of that space, since aesthetics be-  
come a secondary rather than primary information input.  
Many of the elements that comprise the human perception of  
urban \_space have been defined by Kevin Lynch. \( appendix refer-  
ence\) These elements were determined by cataloging the physical  
compositions of three distinctly different cities, and then ques-  
ti\~ning the inhabitants about their subjective place images. The  
components that define urban space were then classified into five  
broad categories; paths, nodes, landmarks, edges and districts.  
The **path,** or linkage between nodes, is considered to be the most  
dominant visual element of space because it is the unifying force  
upon which the other elements depend. The path provides co-  
hesiveness, identity and the means of expression. While moving  
along the path, the observer is exposed to the kinesthesia of con-  
stantly changing relationships with all the visual elements that  
comprise the space. Movement enhances the sensory gradients of  
variations in smell, heat, light, color, texture and gravity, that all  
combine to produce the total human perception of a space. Nodes  
are the focal points and intersecting junctions of paths and sup-  
porting systems such as transit. Direct connections to node points  
would be a characteristic of a well-defined system. Landmarks  
are statements or points of reference that provide the observer  
with a continual sense of orientation and relationship· with the  
space. The edges are the linear descriptors that define an urban  
space or district. Edges may be natural linear features, such as a  
river or lake, or man-made, such as a highway cut or railroad  
embankment. The configuration of these edges may describe an  
easily identifiable space entity or district, or it may be so disrup-  
tive that no space identity exists. A district is an identifiable space  
entity or precinct with a common identifying character.  
The financial district of lower Manhattan derives its identity  
from the edge elements of the two intersecting rivers on the east  
and west, and from its many tall buildings. However, the street  
system of this area causes orientation and identification diffi-  
culties for most New Yorkers. The high buildings also limit the  
use of landmarks for orientation. A clear human identification  
and image of a space enables one *to* move freely and confidently  
through it, in a relaxed manner, with the senses devoted *to* the  
full enjoyment of the space. A part of the tourist's visual enjoy-  
ment of Paris is obtained from the sense of orientation conveyed  
34 by the landmark dominance of the Eiffel Tower supplemented  
by the juxtaposition of the River Seine.  
The sense of orientation conveyed by the Eiffel Tower and the River Seine contribute  
to the tourist's visual enjoyment of Paris.

**TRAFFIC** AND **SPACE** CHARACTERISTICS  
# OF PEDESTRIANS  
There are many examples of poor, and even hazardous, human  
environments resulting from a lack of understanding of the traffic-  
flow relationships and space requirements of pedestrians. A num-  
ber of authorities have been using maximum pedestrian capacity  
as a basis for design. Yet, analysis of time-lapse photography of  
pedestrian b·affic flow on walkways and stairs has shown that  
capacity is reached when there is a dense crowding of pedestrians,  
causing restricted and uncomfortable locomotion. Insufficient  
consideration of human space requirements has resulted in inad-  
equate design of many areas where pedestrians may be required  
to accumulate in large groups. In some instances, overcrowding  
of these areas has resulted in injury and loss of life.  
To meet these inadequacies, this chapter discusses pedestrian  
traffic volumes and queuing relationships on the basis of average  
pedestrian area occupancy, providing easily understood measures  
for design. The chapter also serves as an introduction to the prin-  
ciples used to develop the Level-of-Service Design Standards in  
Chapter Four, and the illustrative design problems of Chapter  
Seven.  
**Some Fundamentals of** Traffic Design  
Since this text is intended for wide application by members of  
various design disciplines, a brief discussion of some simple traffic  
engineering terms and fundamentals is in order. The reader should  
find sufficient detail in this discussion, and the subsequent illus-  
trative examples of Chapter Seven, to deal with most pedestrian-  
design problems.  
In general, the traffic terms most often used in this text are\:  
Flow Volume-the number of traffic units passing a point in a  
unit of time. In pedestrian design, flow is expressed as pedestrians  
per foot width of the walkway or stairway per minute \(PFM\).  
Flow is the most important traffic characteristic, because it  
determines the width of the pedestrian way \(pedway\). An inade-  
quate width restricts flow, resulting in pedestrian inconvenience.  
Volume has been designated as P.  
37 Speed-locomotion speed, expressed in distance per unit of time,  
generally in feet per minute. ·when related to design of a pedway  
section, speed is the average speed of all pedestrians passing  
through the section during the design interval. Speed is desig-  
nated as S.  
Density-the number of traffic units per unit of area. In pedes-  
trian design, density would be expressed in tenths of a pedestrian  
per square foot, a difficult unit to visualize. A more manageable  
unit, the reciprocal of density, or the square feet of area per  
pedestrian, is used consistently in this text. The reciprocal of  
density has been designated as M, the Pedestrian Area Module.  
Headway-the time and distance separation between traffic units.  
For example, a two-second headway is the equivalent of one  
traffic unit passing a point each two seconds, or a flow volume of  
30 traffic units per minute. Headway has not been commonly  
refc\~rred to in the design of pedestrian facilities, but it has some  
useful applications.  
Queue-one or more traffic units waiting for service. If the ped-  
way section or service facility has insufficient capacity, a pedes-  
trian queue will develop. Queue lengths and durations will vary  
according to traffic flow characteristics. In crowded systems,  
queues may be generated intermittently, due to random variations  
in traffic intensity.  
The flow equation, the classic relationship of traffic design,  
derived from an analogy to fluid flow in channels, is expressed  
as follmvs\:  
Flow Volume\:\:\:\:\:\: Average Speed x Average Density  
**or,** P\:\:\:\:\:\: S x D  
As mentioned in the definition of terms, application of the tenn  
"density" to pedestrian traffic results in the unwieldy unit of tenths  
of a pedestrian per square foot, so that the reciprocal of density,  
square feet area per pedestrian, \(M\), is more useful. This unit  
also enables us to relate pedestrian flow space *to* the human  
factors discussions of the previous chapter, thus producing a  
clearer concept of design quality. The equation for pedestrian  
flow volume, \(P\), in pedestrians per foot width of pedway section,  
per minute? \(PFM\) is expressed as follows\:  
38 Average Ped Speed, feet per minute  
Ped Volume == ---------------  
Average Ped Area, Square feet per ped  
P- S  
or, - M  
In this form the designer has a clearer concept of relative  
design quality, since the units are easier to understand and ma-  
nipulate. For example, the next section will show that a nearly  
normal average walking speed of 250 feet per minute is attained  
with an approximate average pedestrian area of 25 square feet  
per person, so that the simple division of area occupancy into  
average speed gives an equivalent design volume of 10 pedes-  
trians per foot width of walkway, per minute.  
Time and distance headways can be detennined from flow  
volumes by assuming a specific pedestrian lane width. For exam-  
ple, if a 3-foot pedestrian lane width has a flow volume of 10  
PFM, as cited above, this is equal to a pedestrian volume per lane  
of \:lO persons per minute, or the equivalent of an average time-  
spacing of two seconds between pedestrians. This time-spacing is  
translated into an average distance-spacing of about 8 feet be-  
tween following pedestrians, by multiplying by the 250-foot-per-  
minute walking speed. This time and distance headway separa-  
tion gives some further visualization of pcdway design quality,  
and is useful for a dearer understanding of the design of en-  
trances.  
Walking s11eee1s  
When unimpeded by crowd density or other traffic frictions,  
pedestrians may vary their walking speeds over a wide range.  
Figure 3.1 illustrates the distribution of free-flow walking speeds  
obtained in surveys of about 1000 non-baggage-carrying pedes-  
trians inside the Port Authority Bus Terminal and Pennsylvania  
Station in New York City. On the basis of these surveys, average  
f.tee-flow walking speed for all males, females, and the combina-  
tion of all pedestrians in the surveys, were 270, 254, and 265 feet  
per minute, respectively. Average speeds were found to decline  
with age, but individual slow and fast walkers were observed in  
all age groups.

**WALKING SPEED** - **FEET PER MINUTE**  
Figure 3.1  
Assuming the results of the two pedestrian surveys were repre-  
sentative of the normal population distribution, a statistical infer-  
ence may be drawn that almost all pedestrians have free-flow  
walking speeds faster than 145 feet per minute, and that speeds  
below this level constitute restricted, shuffling human locomotion,  
and not normal walking. Conversely, the same statistical inference  
would indicate that walking speeds above 470 feet per minute  
could be construed as running. *As* a point of interest, the four-  
minute mile, near the limit of human performance, equals a speed  
of 1320 feet per minute.  
A controlled study of walking speeds for men, ranging in age  
from 20 to 87, revealed that normal walking speed declined with  
age, but that by increasing pacing rates and stride lengths, all  
participants in the study were capable of exceeding their normal  
relaxed walking speeds by about forty per cent. This vvould in-  
dicate that a healthy octogenarian in a hurry could exceed the  
normal relaxed walking speed of a 20-year-old. Normal walking  
speeds declined from 274 feet per minute for the 20-to-25 age  
group, to 215 feet per minute for the 81-fo-87 group, with most of  
40 the speed decline occurring after age 65. Fast walking speeds  
declined, respectively, from 140 feet per minute to 292 feet per  
minute, with a similar more pronounced decline after age 65.  
Another study of walking speeds in the Pittsburgh Central Busi-  
ness District, showed variances in pedestrian speeds which were  
correlated with the time of the day, outside temperatures and trip  
purpose. Pedestrians with restaurant trip purposes were found  
to have significantly higher speeds than those with business or  
shopping trip purposes. These studies confirm that there is a  
great· deal of potential variability in individual free-flow walking  
speeds. Psychological factors, reaction to environment, traffic  
composition, and trip purpose could all contribute to each pe\~  
destrian's selection of his unimpeded free-flow speed.  
Surprisingly, such factors as grade, and the presence of baggage  
or packages, have been found to have no appreciable effect on free-  
flow walking speed. There were no statistically significant differ-  
ences in walking speeds due to grades of up to six per cent, accord-  
ing to a survey of walking speeds by age, sex, and grade categories,  
in the Central Business District of Washington, D. C. Other stu-  
dies confirm that there is no measurable effect on walking speeds  
due to grades up to 5 per cent, but that there is a gradual linear  
decline in speed for steeper grades. A controlled study of soldiers  
walking on a variable-grade treadmill revealed that an increase  
in positive treadmill grade, from 5 to 10 per cent, decreased aver-  
age walking speeds by 11.5 per cent. A further increase in grade  
to 20 per cent, a slope not normally encountered in most urban  
areas, decreased normal walking speeds by only 25 per cent. And  
no statistically significant difference from normal pedestrian walk-  
ing speeds was shown by a walking speed survey of baggage-  
carrying pedestrians at the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The lack  
of effect which hand baggage had on walking speed is confirmed  
by other research, which found that knapsack weights of up to  
25 pounds produced no statistically significant difference in gait.  
The remaining, and most significant, determinant of pedestrian  
walking speed is traffic density. *As* discussed in the previous  
chapter, normal walking requires sufficient area for unrestricted  
pacing, and for· sensory recognition and reaction to potential  
obstacles. As traffic density increases, pedestrian speed is de-  
creased, because of the reduction in available clear area for loco-  
motion. As a result\> all pedestrian speeds tend to have less vari-  
ability as increased crowd density restricts the ability to bypass  
slower-moving pedestrians, and to select their desired ,valking

speed. Psychological studies of pedestrian behavior have shown  
that pedestrian interactions, such as eye contact, speed and direc-  
tion tracking, and evasive maneuvering, occur at inter-person  
distances of up to 25 feet, with average pedestrian area occu-  
pancies as high as 250 square feet per person. However, traffic  
density has relatively little impact on individual walking speed  
until an average pedestrian area occupancy of about 40 square  
feet per pedestrian. The results of a time-lapse photography  
analysis of pedestrian flow, illustrated in Figure 3.2, shows the  
effect of increased traffic density, or decreasing area occupancy,  
on pedestrian walking speeds for one-directional commuter traffic  
flow. Similar studies of two-directional commuter and multi-direc-  
tional shoppers' flows resulted in only small variations from this  
curve, confirming its more general applicability.  
The walking-speed curve indicates that mean speeds for dense  
pedestrian flows are approximately normal, up to an average pe-  
destrian area occupancy of 25 square feet. After this point, walk-  
ing speed declines rapidly as the available clear area for loco-  
motion decreases. The limit of normal walking speed, established  
somewhere in the range of 140 to 150 feet per minute, is reached  
42 at an area occupancy of about 7 square feet per person. Beyond  
this point, pedestrians are forced into a restricted and uncom-  
fortable shuffling gait. Walking speed approaches zero at an area  
occupancy of slightly less than 3 square feet, representative of a  
crowded, immobile queue.  
Traffic Flows on Walkways  
Pedestrian volume, or the number of persons passing a given  
point in a unit of time, is the most important walkway design  
parameter. If traffic demand exceeds the capacity of a walkway  
section, crowding, uncomfortable shuffling locomotion and delay  
will result, producing a poor pedestrian environment. A favorable  
environment is created if the walkway section is sufficiently wide  
to allow for normal walking convenience and avoidance of con-  
flicts during all the expected fluctuations in traffic demand.  
The previous section showed that normal free walking speed  
increases as more area is available for locomotion. Average pe-  
destrian areas beyond 25 square feet per person were required be-  
fore near-normal, free-flow walking speeds could be attained. Pe-  
destrian traffic volume, on the other hand, is inversely propor-  
tional to pedestrian area occupancy. Flow volume increases as  
pedestrian area decreases, until reaching a critical point where  
locomotion becomes *so* restricted due to lack of space, that flow  
volumes begin to decline. Many designers have been using this  
maximum flow volume, which occurs at or near this critical pe-  
destrian area occupancy, as a basis for design. This produces a  
limited walkway section that restricts normal locomotion, one  
which is susceptible to intermittent interruptions and stoppages  
'with normal fluctuations in traffic demand.  
Time-lapse photography studies of pedestrian traffic flow on  
walkways have established flow-volume relationships for the  
three categories of pedestrian traffic shown in Figure 3.3. These  
relationships, representing the average conditions of three dis-  
tinctive types of pedestrian traffic, show a relatively small range  
of variation, which strongly suggests that reverse and cross-flow  
traffic conflicts do not drastically reduce either pedestrian traffic  
volume or speed. This characteristic makes these curves ap-  
plicable to a wider range of different design conditions.  
The adaptability of the pedestrian to minor traffic friction has  
been noted in other research. A minor traffic flow proportion of  
10 per cent of the total flow resulted in only a 14.5 per cent re-

duction in potential sidewalk capacity, in a photographic study of  
university student traffic on sidewalks. As the minor traffic flow  
proportion increased, its detrimental effect on capacity was actually  
reduced. With a 50/50 traffic-flow mix, the two-way traffic capac-  
ity of the sidewalk was about equal to its one-way capacity. This  
equalizing effect is due to the fact that smaller-volume reverse-  
traffic flows are dominated by the larger major flows, forcing the  
pedestrian moving up-stream to dodge and weave through the on-  
coming horde. This reduces the traffic efficiency of the section. But  
as the minor upstream flow gets larger, this one-way domination is  
reduced, and the walkway section receives more balanced usage.  
The ease of reverse-flow movement for the minor traffic direc-  
tion is one measure of the environmental quality of a walkway  
section. A finding worth noting in the sidewalk study is that pe-  
destrians tend to keep 1- to rn-foot lateral clear distance between  
themselves and the curbline. Other observers have noted this pe-  
destrian spacing characteristic adjacent to building lines and  
along the edges of passageways. This suggests that this lateral  
distance should be deducted from the walkway dimension when  
determining effective walkway width. \~  
44 The maximum aven\~ge peak flow volumes of 26.2, 24.7 and  
23.3 persons per foot of walkway width per minute \(PFM\), shown  
in Figure 3.3, are representative of design values in use by a  
number of authorities. Studies of pedestrian flows conducted to  
determine recommended design standards for civil defense shel-  
ter entrances concluded that flows of 20 PFM were attainable  
under a wide variety of conditions, 25 PFM was attainable under  
favorable conditions, and that 30 PFM was attainable only under  
the most favorable walkway conditions and traffic composition.  
Favorable walkway conditions were defined as a level, paved  
walkway, whose upstream width was greater than the shelter  
entrance. Favorable traffic requirements included no interference  
from conflicting pedestrian or vehicular flovvs, a minimum num-  
ber of disabled or infirm persons, only lightweight, lmnd-cnrried  
items of small bulk, and the exercise of control to preclude dis-  
order and panic. Reportedly, marching soldiers in precise military  
formation, each occupying about *6* square feet, can attain flows of  
48 pedestrians per foot per minute for the width of the formation.  
However, normal pedestrian flows cannot maintain the precise  
cadence and area occupancy required to attain this flow on a  
sustained basis. A number of researchers have recorded high  
surge flows for short periods, under special flow conditions. The  
civil defense shelter entrance study recorded · a 15-second surge  
flow of 44.7 PFM, within one 5-minute period that averaged  
about 32 PFM. These high surge rates were observed after a  
matinee performance at an auditorium, and were attributed to  
both the greater youth of most of the pedestrians and a sense of  
urgency to "beat the crowd" to the parkii1g lot.  
The extraordinary surge flow of 80 PFM occurred for a short  
period during a series of experiments conducted in Germany to  
determine the "ultimate" capacity of a walkway. During this  
series of experiments, pedestrians flowed through a funnel-like  
corridor under pressure from the rear, to create dense crowding  
combined with fast walking speeds. The extraordinary peak per-  
fonnance was obtained after the pedestrians became acclimated  
to the dense conditions, and adopted a practice of placing their  
hands on the shoulders of the pedestrian in front. This practice  
established a uniform space between pedestrians, and allowed  
the following pedestrian to sense the correct speed and pace from  
his tactile contact with the pedestrian in front, rather than relying  
on the normal but slo,ver vision-and-foot reaction process. During  
the experiment, walking speeds ranged from 2,50 to 270 feet per  
45 minute; at area occupancies as low as 3 square feet per person.  
Locomotion was observed to be quite abnormal, and it was  
characterized as a fast ''tripping" gait.  
While this extreme experiment would appear to have little  
value for the design of pedestrian spaces, it does suggest that in  
emergency situations greater pedestrian capacities could be ob-  
tained by having following pedestrians placing their hands on the  
shoulders of the person in front. In times of potential panic, such  
as might exist when evacuating a building or filling a defense  
shelter, this procedure would not only produce more efficient  
flow, but would appear also to establish a b\~tter psychological  
climate. The procedure is recommended for fire drills in schools,  
to reduce the time needed to evacuate the building in emergencies.  
All these extreme variations in flow can be attributed to the  
infinite flexibility of the human animal, and to his ability to adapt  
his locomotive skills · to a large number of situations. Since the  
designer is more concerned with the qualitative aspects of the  
design of walkways, his attention should be directed to the human  
requirements for space, not only in terms of the area available  
for normal locomoti\~m, but in terms of the pedestrian's visual and  
psychological interaction with his environment. All the extreme  
values of "capacity" which have been cited were obtained at very  
low personal area occupancies, under psychological pressures and  
anxiety of varying degrees. The maximum average capacities  
shown in Figure 3.3 were attained at average pedestrian area  
occupancies of about 5 square feet per person. This is insufficient  
area for normal locomotion, and is hardly enough to allow the  
pedestrian to interact with the surrounding environment. At this  
close spacing the pedestrian's full sensory awareness must be  
devoted to the task of restrained locomotion and the avoidance  
of the pedestrian ahead. 'fhis requires complete concentration on  
pace timii1g and foot placement, and tl\~e use of the smaller and  
more confined acute range of human vision. The acute range of  
vision limits visual perceptions to short lines of sight and rnagnified  
detail. The perceptive differences in this sensory shift may be  
compared to vimving a painting *so* closely that the brush marks  
destroy the composition and visual impressions intended by the  
artist. The desirable pedestrian environment allows sufficient space  
for the pedestrian to choose, independently, his own relaxed walk-  
ing speed, to bypass slower pedestrians if desired, to avoid conflicts  
with oncoming or crossing pedestrians, and to interact visually with  
his surroundings, using the full range of his visual capabilities.  
*46* Pedestrian Spacing and Conflicts  
The previous two sections have established the relationships of  
walking speed and flow volumes to average pedestrian area occu-  
pancy. The ability to select near-normal walking speed, a qualita-  
tive measure of pedestrian flow, was found to require average  
areas of 25 square feet per person or more. However, other  
measures are required in order to obtain a clearer understanding  
of walkway quality. Pedestrians must leave additional space for  
maneuvering within the traffic stream to bypass slower-moving  
pedestrians, and to avoid oncoming and crossing pedestrians. This  
additional space is required to sense the speed and direction of  
others, and to react ,v'ithout conflict or hesitation.  
The spacing of pedestrians in a traffic stream is naturally a  
function of density. *As* density increases, pedestrians are forced  
to maintain constrained spacing patterns to allow for pacing room,  
and to avoid brushing against others.  
Figure 3.4 is a graphic representation of longitudinal and lateral  
spacings of pedestrians, compiled from analysis of a series of time-  
lapse photographs. These measurements were restricted some-  
what by the dimensional limitations of the photographic field, but  
it was found that beyond an average area occupancy of 25 square  
feet per person, spacing patterns were less regular and susceptible  
to curve fitting. The curves show that in denser traffic conditions  
pedestrians are more likely to close their ranks by reducing their  
longitudinal spacing, rather than lateral spacing, ,vhich might  
bring brushing contact with other pedestrians. Contact can cause  
loss of balance. There are times during the walking cycle when  
the pedestrian has been said to be "teetering on the brink of  
falling flat on his face," and any disruption of the center of  
gravity at these times can quite easily upset the sense of balance.  
The spacing measurements suggest that average pedestrian areas  
greater than 25 square feet per person are needed before there is  
enough lateral space to freely bypass slower-moving pedestrians.  
Although restricted passing could be accomplished at areas lower  
than this, it would require the passing pedestrian to turn his body  
sideways in the minimum profile position described in Chapter  
Two.  
Another aspect of typical pedestrian interaction on walkways is  
the possibility of conflicts with pedestrians crossing the main-stream  
of flow. An investigation of pedestrian crossing conflicts was con-  
ducted by positioning a time-lapse camera above a location where

pedestrians occasionally cross a main traffic stream at right angles.  
Crossing movements at various levels of traffic density were ob-  
served\> and conflicts were recorded. For the purposes of the in-  
vestigation, a conflict was defined as any stopping and shuffling\>  
or breaking of the normal walking pace, due to a too-close con-  
frontation with another pedestrian. These confrontations required  
immediate adjustments in speed and direction to avoid collisions.  
Pedestrian conflicts are obviously a function of walking speed  
and pedestrian spacing in the traffic stream. Although wider pe-  
destrian spacings provide larger crossing gaps, the corresponding  
increase in pedestrian speed tends to continue to make crossing  
the main-stream difficult. The study results shown in Figure 3.5  
indicate that the probability of conflicts due to crossing main-  
stream traffic exist over a wide range of pedestrian densities. The  
probability of pedestrian conflict is 100 per cent at 15 square feet

per person, representing the absence of acceptable crossing gaps  
in the main-stream traffic flow. This area occupancy also corre-  
sponds with the region of restricted walking speeds and closing of  
ranks shown by the pedestrian speed and spacing studies. Beyond  
a pedestrian area of 1.5 square feet, there is sharp drop in the  
probabflity of conflict, as pedestrian ranks open up. However,  
there is also a concomitant increase in main-stream walking speed,  
keeping the probability of conflict above ,50 per cent until an area  
of 35 square feet per pedestrian. At this point, the probability of  
conflict drops sharply, to the zero level. At the 35-square-foot  
area, sufficient space is available for main-stream and cross-stream  
pedestrians to react in time to avoid conflicts with each other.  
The lower probabilities of conflict associated 'With higher pedes-  
trian areas would be consistent with higher levels-of-service and  
convenience,  
49 Some interesting photographs illustrating pedestrian crossing  
interactions at various traffic densities were obtained from this  
investigation \( Figure 3.6\). They illustrate the phenomena of  
tracking speed and direction that occurs between individual pe-  
destrians. The upper photo represents the relatively free traffic  
flow at 40 square feet per pedestrian, where conflicts can be  
avoided by minor adjustments in pace or direction. Note the  
angle of the head of the pedestrian in the center of this photo,  
indicative of his tracking the crossing pedestrian. In the middle  
photo, taken at a concentration of 20 square feet per person, this  
same tracking position of the head can be observed on the crossing  
pedestrian approaching from the right. The greater probability  
of potential conflict is also more obvious in this photo. The bottom  
photo, taken at an area of about 1.5 square feet per pedestrian,  
illustrates the greater difficulty and inevitable conflict involved in  
crossing a traffic stream at this density.  
In the next chapter, the qualitative characteristics of pedestrian  
flow at various traffic concentrations is evaluated and developed  
into a series of "level-of-service" design standards. The qualitative  
evaluation includes the ability to select normal walking speed, the  
freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream and bypass slower  
pedestrians, and the ability to avoid conflicts with reVfffSe-flow  
and cross-flow traffic movements.  
Entrances  
Entrances are, in effect, walkway sections in which pedestrians  
have been channelized into equal, door-width traffic lanes. In  
addition to imposing restricted lateral spacing in the traffic  
stream, entrances may require the pedestrian to perform some  
time-consuming function such as opening a door or turnstile. The  
earlier discussion of headways introduced the concept that pedes-  
trians have different average time and distance separations in a  
traffic stream, dependent on the flow-volume through the design  
section. This concept is a useful one for evaluating the design of  
doors, turnstiles and other entrance devices. When a pedestrian  
opens a door, there must be a sufficient time-headway separation  
between that pedestrian and the following pedestrian, to allow  
for the performance of this function. If the time-headway is too  
close, the following pedestrian reaches the door before the door-  
opening function is completed, and a growing pedestrian queue  
will develop. *As* with walkway flow, doorway systems designed

51 at or near maximum capacity are likely to generate frequent  
queuing and offer a poor level-of-service. Because of the added  
time required for the door-opening function, entrances will be the  
weak links in the pedway system, and therefore require added  
design consideration.  
By assuming a traffic lane equal to the entrance width, \( see  
Fundamentals of Traffic Design\), the designer can translate pe-  
destrian traffic volumes into time-headway separations. These  
headways can then be compared with pedestrian performance  
times for using similar. entrance devices. Naturally, different en•  
trance devices have different opening times, and each person will  
have varying degrees of sknI in using these devices. The elderly,  
the physically handicapped, or those encumbered by packages or  
baggage, will require longer door opening times.

aged to examine entrance design problems from the standpoint  
of traffic headways. This provides a more qualitative insight into  
system adequacy and level-of-service.  
53 Speed of Locomotion on Stairs  
Locomotion on stairs is much more stvlized and restricted than  
walking\) because the dimensions of the, stairs themselves tend to  
determine many of the aspc.'cts of locomotion that the pedestrian  
may more freely choose on a level surface. The pacing distance  
is imposed by the length of the stair tread. The pacing rate may  
be freely adjusted, but because of greater energy requirements  
and concerns for safety connected ,vith stair locon10tion, this is  
also limited. The increased attention required for foot placement  
and maintenance of balance also requires the use of the more  
acute cones of vision, and for some persons, the supplementary  
assistance of railings. Stair dimensioning and configuration are  
important elements of building design which have received very  
little attention, despite the greater demands on human energy,  
concerns for safety, and more unusual traffic characteristics of  
stairs. Speeds of locomotion on stairs have a close relationship to  
riser height, with the faster speeds, in both ascending and descend-  
ing directions, occurring on stairs with lower riser heights. As  
with walking speeds on a level surface, pedestrian speeds on  
stairs vary with age mid sex, but certain characteristics of the  
distribution of stair speeds, particularly in the down direction,  
point toward the greater concerns for safety and the influence  
of handicaps. Figures 3.7 and 3.8 illustrate the results of two  
stair-speed surveys, one conducted *\(\\t* a stair with a 7-inch riser,  
11.25-inch tread, and 32-degree angle, and the other at a stair with  
a 6-inch riser, 12-inch tread, and 27-degree angle. The figures  
show the slope, or hypothenuse speed. The clown speed distribu-  
tion exhibits a bi-modality that suggests the presence of two  
distinctive types of stair users in the descending category, one  
generally slower than the other. This slo\\ver group would be  
characterized as having a greater concern for safety, and is repre-  
sentative of the segment of the population that has handicaps in  
varying degrees. The faster group would be, in general, less hand-  
icapped, and willing to take chances by using the extra influence  
of gravity in the descending direction. A summation of the results  
of two surveys, which involved almost 700 pedestrians, is tabu\~  
lated by differences in direction, stair angle, sex, and age, in

The speeds shown in this tabulation are based on the horizontal  
component, or the level equivalent speed, to provide a basis for  
comparison with walking speeds. More importantly, this equiva-  
lent level, or horizontal speed, is required mathematically to make  
the pedestrian flow-density equation applicable to the design of  
stair widths. You will note that age appears to have a more pro-  
56 nounced effect on stair locomotion speeds, producing a one-third  
decline in speed within the age groups surveyed. A more signifi-  
cant difference in the speeds of the *sexes* may also *be* noted,  
related to the greater energy requirements of locomotion on stairs.  
In addition, the lower riser height is seen to result in faster speeds,  
suggesting that this type of stair would be more efficient from a  
traffic-flow standpoint as well as being a more "human" stair,  
because of the greater tread area for foot placement, and the  
smaller energy consumption of the lower riser height. Surprising-  
ly, the more efficient 27-clegrec-angle stair i!i outside the "pre-  
ferred" range of from 30 to 35 degrees, recommended by architec-  
tural handbooks. This is indicative of a need for more understand-  
ing of stair design, and its relationship to the human characteristics  
of locomotion. Based on the population variations discovered in  
these hvo studies, a statistical inference may be drawn that vir-  
tually all pedestrians climb stairs foster than the horizontal speed  
of about 40 feet per minute, and that stair ascent speeds in *excess*  
of an approximate horizontal speed of about 165 feet per minute  
are representative of a running type of ascent. This range is  
representative of the comfortable, and possibly safe, limit of  
human locomotion speed on stairs.  
Because of the many specialized characteristics of human loco-  
motion on stairs, increased traffic density has less of an *effect* on  
pedestrian speed. *As* long as the pedestrian is assured sufficient  
lateral spacing for his shoulder-breadth and body-sway require-  
ments, and there are at least two vacant stair-treads ahead, he  
has about all the space that is needed for normal stair locomotion.  
This translates to the rather small pedestrian area occupancy of  
about 7 to 8 square feet per person. However, traffic density  
produces other *effects* which bring about a reduction in the  
average speed of the traffic stream. The more agile pedestrian  
becomes confined and restricted, and unable to bypass the slower,  
and often handicapped, pedestrian, thus reducing the total aver-  
age speed of the group. This restriction is psychologically more  
frustrating than the comparable situation on walkways, because  
of the more confined environment of the stair and the need for  
greater concentration on balance, close vision, and foot place-  
ment. Figures 3JJ and .3.10 illustrate the results of time-lapse  
photography studies of the relationship of pedestrian area oc-  
cupancy on speed. The photographic stucli'es confirm that ap-  
proximately· normal stair locomotion speeds are attained at an  
average area occupancy of about ten square feet per person. The

45 50 ascending direction is of greater interest to the designer, because  
the slower speeds and lowc'r volumes of ascent are the controlling  
design factor. The plot of the ascending direction data shows  
increasing variability beyond an average area occupancy of 20  
square feet per person. This area occupancy can be roughly as-  
sociated with a lateral spacing of at least four feet between  
pedestrians, and a longitudinal spacing of at least 5 tread lengths.  
This would give the pedestrian sufficient area to select his own  
stair speed, and to bypass slower-moving pedestrians.  
Traffic Flow on Stairways  
Although greater emphasis on stair dimensioning, and the hu-  
man aspects of safety and energy consumption, are recommended  
as part of the qualitative design of stairways, stairway volumes  
remain as the most significant design parameter. The results of  
time-lapse photography studies of pedestrian flow on stairs are  
shown in Figure 3.11 and 3.12. The lower flow volumes of the  
upward direction are the determinant of stairway width and  
design quality, and all references to capacity in this section will  
be confined to the up direction, unless otherwise stated.  
*As* with walkway volumes, maximum stairway flow occurs in  
the region of minimum pedestrian area occupancy, about at the  
point of a two-tread length and one shoulder breadth area, or  
approximately three square feet per person. In this confined area,  
forward progress is determined by movement of the pedestrian  
ahead. Ascent speeds at this area occupancy are at the lower  
limit of the normal range shmvn in the speed studies of the previ-  
ous section, indicative of an inconvenient and unnatural pace for  
all pedestrians. The maximum flow volume of 18.9 pedestrians per  
minute per foot of stainvay width is representative of design  
values used by many authorities. These stairway design values in  
the capacity region create the most crowded pedestrian environ-  
ment, with restricted locomotion speeds for almost all persons,  
and a high probability of developing intermittent stoppages and  
queuing, with even normal fluctuations in traffic. Studies con-  
ducted by the Regional Plan Association of New York disclosed  
that stair use ,vns reasonably fluid, without queuing, up to about  
12 PFM, but beyond this point queuing developed as pedestrian  
spacing and speed were reduced. This value corresponds roughly  
to the level of normal average stair locomotion speed developed  
in the previous section. It is also compatible with the area oc-

60 cupancy of about 7 to 8 square feet per person suggested as the  
minimum area required for normal stair locomotion. vVhile this  
provides some minimum space and maximum volume criteria, it  
is not a freeMflowjng traffic stream where passing and selection  
of individual speed is possible.  
Because of the critical aspects of pedestrian balance in stair  
locomotion, and the generally narrow widths of stairs, they are  
*less* flexible traffic movers than walkways. The deferential side\~  
stepping and maneuvering that occurs on walkways, which tends  
to make them less sensitive to opposing traffic, does not exist to  
the same degree on stairs. In addition, because they are generally  
narrower, or divided by railings, stairway widths are more critical  
than walkwavs ·widths. Unlike walkwavs, a minor traffic flow on  
a narrow stai;. can effectively cut stain\~ay capacity in half, *so* the  
designer is cautioned to adjust for directionality of flow in stair\~  
way dimensioning. Level-of-service design standards for stair-  
ways, based on a qualitative evaluation of stairway flow, are  
contained in the next chapter.  
# Minor reverse flows detract significantly from stairway capacity because stairs are  
**not as flexible as walkways.**  
61 Pedestrian Queuing  
Queuing may be broadly defined as any form of pedestrian  
waiting that requires standing in a relatively stationary position  
for some pniod of time. Queues may be of two general types\: n  
**lineal** or **ordered** queue, with conventional first-come, first-served  
priority, or a **bulk** c111euc, which ,vould be unordered, and without  
an estnblishccl queue discipline. **Bulk** queuing areas may be di-  
vided into those devoted only to standing and waiting, with  
limited movement within the queuing area, or those devoted to  
waiting combined with some ne\('d for reasonably free internal  
circulation through the queuing area. Examples of the respective  
types are illustrated by the photos in Figure 3.13. These photos  
illustrate a ticket line with an ordered lineal queue; a bulk queue  
without established order at the foot of a motorstnir, and bulk  
queuing with requirements for internal circulation on a subway  
platform. There are no known standards for the design of queuing  
spaces, and this aspect of pedestrian design is often overlooked.  
i\\fost pedestrian facilities are designed adequately for moving  
pedestrians who 1nay have larger, a1though transient, space de-  
mands, but the pohmtial dangers of serious crowding due to  
temporary disruptions of service, or loss of crowd control, are  
rarely considered. Crowd pressure has been the cause of a num-  
ber of fatalities at sports stadiums in Europe and South America,  
and unless they have personally experienced it, most designers,  
or even those persons rosponsiblc for crmvd control, cannot realize  
the body-crushing forces and potential for panic that can occur .  
. The author was subjected to one such experience, which left a  
lasting impression and conviction that greater emphasis must be  
placed on the maximum allowable human occupancy of certah1  
areas. This experience occurred at a major suburban railroad  
terminal after a snowstorm had disrupted outbound train service.  
Thousands of stranded passengers gathered in a large but restricted  
area, at a common entrance to train platforms. The average pedes-  
trian area occupancy was probably about one-and-one-half square  
feet per person. "Shock" waves ran through the crowd ns if it were  
a single unified mass, literally lifting people off their *feet.* Police  
attempting to control the crowd were thrown back by surges  
which they coul\<l not stop, even though they had locked their  
arms. Although some trains arrived during this period they were  
inaccessible, because it was impossible for passengers to move  
through the dense crowd to platform entrances that were as little

6,3 as twenty feet away. Fortunately no panic occurred in the situa-  
tion, but if the scene had been duplicated on the railroad plat-  
form, many pedestrians would have been unavoidably forced onto  
the tracks.  
Accumulations of waiting pedestrians, caused by service stop-  
pages or capacity restrictions of any type, are an aspect of design  
quality that should be carefully evaluated. The pedestrian holding  
capacity of all public spaces should be known. If potential exists  
for crowding approaching the limits of human convenience, corn\:.\:.  
fort or safety, alternative designs or,, operating procedures must  
be considered. Queuing spaces must be evaluated from the stand-  
point of their varying degrees of mobility, with consideration of  
the psychological factors discussed in Chapter Two.  
The approximate limit of human occupancy of a confined space  
is illustrated by the two photos in Figure 3.14, taken during *ex-*  
periments conducted by the Otis Elevator Company to determine  
the practical capacity of elevators. The upper photo shows all-  
female occupancy on an elevator at about 1.5 square feet per  
person, and the lower, mixed occupancy at about 1.8 square feet  
per person. The persons involved in the experiment are wearing  
lightweight summer clothing, and are not carrying packages or  
personal accessories. The lower photograph shows that in a  
crowded, mixed-occupancy elevator, women will fold their arms,  
enlarging their area requirements. The photos show clearly that  
unavoidable bodily contact is experienced by all pedestrians, and  
that mobility within the confines of the area would be impossible.  
A survey of persons using an office-building elevator revealed  
that unavoidable contact with other pedestrians was experienced  
at an average area of about 2\~.i square feet per person. Approxi-  
mately 3J\~ square feet per person was required before the elevator  
was considered,, to be uncrowded. Elevators represent a special  
circumstance in which pedestrians are willing to submit to closer  
spacing than they would normally accept in a free-standii1g  
situation, surrounded by strangers. Observations of dense bulk  
queues, at escalators or crosswalks, show that pedestrian area  
occupancies will average about 5 square feet per person in these  
less confined circumstances.  
Linear ordered queues, such as those which occur on ticket  
lines, are remarkably consistent with the spacing observed in  
psychological experiments. Bus commuters have been found to  
select inter-person spacings at about 19 to 20 inches, with very little  
variation, for both ticket. purchase and bus waiting lines. Ticket

6,5 line measurements of inter-city bus pnssl'ngers with baggage  
showed a very small increase in this spacing, since most of these  
pedestrians placed their baggage between their feet or at their  
sides. Based on a normal ticket-selling position spacing of 5 feet,  
the persons observed in this type of queue occupied 8 to 9 square  
f\~et per person. "Movement,, thro\~1gh the queuing area was pos-  
sible, but on an excuse me basis.  
The body ellipse discussed in Chapter Two provides a useful  
method for illustrating queuing densities and synthesizing pedes-  
trian mobility in queuing areas. Figures 3.15, 3.16, 3.17 and 3.18,  
illustrate various levels of pedestrian area occupancy, assuming  
uniform inter-person spacing and circular body buffer zones. The  
assumption of equal inter-person spacing is, a rather generous one,  
and considered valid for the limited range of conditions examined.  
Figure 3.15 is a simulation of a group of pedestrians equally  
spaced in individual 2-foot-diameter buffer zones. This assump-  
tion results in a queuing area of 3 square feet per person, and  
could be called the boundary of the touch-zone, because below  
this area occupancy, frequent unavoidable contact between pe-  
destrians is likely to occur. There is no possibility for circulation  
within this zone, and movement would be restricted to shuffling  
forward in sequence with those in front. This area occupancy is  
representative of a slightly crowded elevator, or of the front  
ranks of a dense escalator or crosswalk queue.  
In Figure 3.14, the body buffer zone has been expanded to an  
.inter-person spacing of 3 feet, and a 7-squarc-foot area. This  
might be called the boundary of the **no-touch zone,** because con-  
tact with others can be avoided between 3 to 7 square feet per  
person, as long as move1nent within the queuing area is not  
necessary. However, movement would be possible as a group,  
and this restricted spacing is actually within the range of pedes-  
trian area occupancy that produces maximum flow capacity on  
walkways and stairs.  
Figure 3.17 illustrates the expansion of the body buffer zone  
*to* a ,3\)f-foot diameter and a 10-sqnare-foot area. This might be  
termed the boundary of the **personal comfol't zone,** since a 7- *to*  
JO-square-foot area is within the range of spacial separation and  
area occupancy that people have selected in experiments em-  
phasizing the comfort criterion. At this spadng, a full body depth  
separates standees, al1owing limited lateral circulation by moving  
sideways between standing pedestrians. In Figure 3.18, the body

circulation zone, since circulation within a queuing area with an  
average area occupancy of 10 to 13 square feet per person would  
be possible without disturbing others. The synthesis of queuing  
space occupancy is the basis of the queuing level-of-service design  
standards that appear in the next chapter.  
Some Notes on Arrival Processes  
Arrival processes are an important determinant of the charac-  
teristics of use of all pedestrian facilities. The arrival process  
should be clearly understood by the designer before qualitative  
design standards are applied. There are two basic types of pedes-  
trian arrival processes\: bu\]k process and intermittent process ar-  
rivals. An example of a bulk process arrival pattern occurs after  
a sporting event, when there *is* an immediate mass exodus of  
spectators, or at a railroad terminal platform, when a fully loaded  
passenger·train discharges in a few minutes. Bulk process arrivals  
temporarily exceed the capacity of pedestrian facilities by the  
impact of their excessive short-tern\:i demands. Facilities subjected  
to a bulk process arrival pattern always function at the limit of  
their practical working capacity, regardless of the design assump-  
tion, until all arrivals are serviced. The qualitative evaluation of  
bulk process facilties is based on pedestrian service times and the  
queuing adequacy of their approach sections. For example, mini-  
mum design criteria for a raill'oad platform subjected to bulk  
process train arrivals should be cleanmco of the platform before  
the next train arrival. Chapter Seven contains an illustrative  
problem of this type.  
Intermittent arrival patterns are characteristic of a typical  
pedestrian facility such as a large transportation terminal, or  
office building, served by multiple sources of demand. IntermitM  
tent arrival facilities tend to have more regular overall traffic  
patterns, but are subject to short-term surges, or "micropcaks\\ of  
traffic volume considerably higher than the average, or short-term  
gaps in which traffic volume falls far below the average.  
The distinction in arrival processes can be important to the  
designer, since the assumption of an "average" design period,  
which is not truly representative of the actual arrival pattern,  
may produce an inadequate and inconvenient facility.  
69 Four  
Level-of-Service Design Standards  
The dimensional design of pedestrian spaces involves the ap-  
plication of traffic engineering principles plus the consideration  
of human convenience and the design environment. Different  
environments logically require the application of different quali-  
tative, as well as quantitative, design standards. The\_ pedestrian  
design rationale for shopping areas would not apply to trans-  
portation terminals, and it follows that airport terminal standards  
would not directly apply to rapid transit facilities. Each has its  
own traffic patterns, physical restraints, and individual environ-  
mental requirements.  
The previous chapter emphasized the fact that many authori-  
ties are using maximum capacity ratings for dimensioning pe-  
destrian space. No evaluation or consideration of human conveni-  
ence has been made in developing these design standards. The  
flow curves of the previous chapter demonstrated that the maxi-  
mum capacity of a pedestrian traffic stream is attained only when  
there is a dense crO\\vding of pedestrians. The crowding results in  
significant reductions in pedestrian convenience as normal human  
locomotion speeds are restricted, due to a loss of freedom to  
maneuver within the traffic stream. Shlcc human convenience  
is a primary consideration in environmental design, pedestrian  
design standards must be based on a relative scale of this factor.  
The Level-of-Service Concept  
The Level-of-Service Concept was first developed in the field  
of traffic engineering in recognition of the fact that capacity  
design was, in effect, resulting in planned congestion.  
The *Highway Capacity Manual,* the most authoritative refer-  
ence on highway design practice, develops standards for six levels  
of design, based on service volumes and a qualitative evaluation  
of driver convenience. This qualitative evaluation includes the  
freedom to choose desired vehicle operating speed, the ability to  
overtake and pass other vehicles, and the freedom to change  
lanes. The Level-of-Service concept provides a useful model for  
the design of pedestrian spaces as well. Pedestrian service standards  
should, similarly, be based on the freedom to select normal loco-  
motion speed, the ability to bypass slow-moving pedestrians, and  
the relative ease of cross-and reverse-flow 1novements at various  
pedestrian traffic concentrations,  
71 Level-of-Service standards provide the designer with a useful  
means of determining the environmental quality of a pedestrian  
space, but they are no substitute. for judgement. The designer  
must examine a11 elements of pedway design, including such traf-  
fic characteristics as the magnitude and duration of peaks, surging  
or platooning caused by traffic light cycles or transit arrivals, and  
all the economic ramifications of space utilization. vVhen design-  
ing for extreme peak demands of short duration, the designer may  
apply a lower quality level-of-service standard to obtain a more  
economical design. However, caution must be exercised in select-  
ing design standards near maximum capacity levels, since the  
critical pedestrian density at these levels is likely to be exceeded  
intermittently. This would cause flow volumes to actually fall  
belO\\v the specified design level, resulting in pedestrian delay  
and crowding. When the designer is required to use maximum  
capacity volumes, such as in sports stadium design, he must  
examine the adequacy of holding areas at the approaches to the  
critical section. In such situations, pedestrian waiting and system-  
clearance times should form the basis for the qualitative evalu-  
ation of the design.  
The level-of-service standards in the remainder of the chapter  
are based on a range of pedestrian area occupancies. Design  
volumes for walkways and stairways are also presented as a range.  
If traffic is comprised of commuters or workers, then the higher  
design volumes in a given range may be assumed. The lower  
range of design volumes would be recommended if traffic is  
comprised largely of shoppers, persons carrying baggage, or if  
there are conflicting traffic movements. Walkway and stairway  
levels-of-service are illustrated by photographs of one-directional  
flow at the approximate pedestrian area occupancy representing  
that service level. The photographs arc supplemented by a written  
description of the qualitative aspects of each level-of-service.  
Design applications for the various service standards are pre-  
sented in Chapter Seven.  
Walkway Standards  
The breakpoints that determine the various levels-of-service  
have been determined on the basis of the walking speed, pe-  
destrian spacing, and the probabilities of conflict at various traffic  
concentrations developed in the previous chapter. The standards  
provide the means of determining the design quality of corridors,  
sidewalks and entranceways. The effective width of corridors must  
72 be reduced by 18 inches on each corridor side, to take into acM  
count the human propensity to maintain this separation from  
stationary objects and walls, except under the most crowded  
conditions. \\Vhere there is a tendency for window shopping, net  
width should be reduced by an additional 18 inches, to allO\\v \_for  
standing pedestrians. \\Vhen designing sidewalks, the effective  
walkway width must be reduced by an additional 2 feet, or more,  
to take into account the constricting effects of street impedimenta  
such as parking meters, light standards, fire hydrants and refuse  
cans. The effects of larger individual obstructions, such as news-  
stands or subway stairs, should also be evaluated, particularly  
when they are placed at the critical crosswalk section. Traffic  
signal cycles, or transit arrivals, have a tendency to concentrate  
flow into platoons and surges of denser traffic, and this effect  
should also be considered when applying the service standards.  
The walkway standards are operative within a definitive range  
of flow for which meaningful relationships have been observed.  
Beyond this range, pedestrian flow tends to become slightly  
erratic and less defined. This docs not detract from the value of  
the standards. While they are a substantial departure from previ-  
ous design- assumptions, they are still representative of a "busy"  
situation. For example, when used on an hourly basis, the highest  
service standard may equal a flow of as many as 4000 persons per  
hour on a 15-foot sidevvalk, with a net effective ·walkway width  
of 10 feet. Tho designer is therefore encouraged to deal \\Vith  
shorter peak periods, and surges within the peak, to determine  
representative walkway quality. VVhen· designing sidewalks, the  
designer should particularly address himself to the adequacy of  
the critical crosswalk area, with ·its multi-directional flows, con-  
flicts with turning vehicles, and space requirements for standing  
pedestrians. This area is also a prime location for walkway im-  
pedimenta.

73 LEVEL-OF-SERVICE DESCRIPTIONS FOR WALKWAYS  
Level of Service A  
Average Pedestrian Area ·Occupancy\: 35 square feet per person,  
or greater.  
Average Flow Volume\: 7 PFM, or less. *\<i-*  
At walkway level-of-service A, sufficient area is provided for  
pedestrians to freely select their own walking speed, to bypass  
slower pedestrians, and to avoid crossing conflicts with others.  
Designs consistent with this level-of-service would include public  
buildings or plazas without severe peaking characteristics or  
space restrictions.  
Level of Service B  
Average Pedestrian Area Occupancy\: 25-35 square feet per  
person.  
Average Flow Volume\: 7-10 PFM.  
At walkway level-of-service B, sufficient space is available to  
select normal walking speed, and to bypass other pedestrians in  
primarily one-directional flows. ·where reverse-direction or pe-  
destrian crossing movements exist, minor conflicts will occur,  
slightly lowering mean pedestrian speeds and potential volumes.  
Designs consistent with this level-of-service would be of reason-  
ably high type, for transportation terminals and buildings in which  
recurrent, but not severe, peaks are likely to occur.  
level of Service C  
Average Pedestrian Area Occupancy\: 15-25 square feet per  
person.  
Average Flow Volume\: 10-1,5 Pfl.,.1.  
At walkway level-of-service C, freedom to select individual  
walking speed and freely pass other pedestrians is restricted.  
\\Vhere pedestrian cross movements and reverse flows exist, there  
is a high probability of conflict requiring frequent adjustment of  
speed and direction to avoid contact. Designs consistent with this  
level-of-service would repn'sent reasonably fluid flow; however,  
considerable friction and interaction between pedestrim1s is likely  
to occur, particularly h1 multi-directional flow situations. Ex-  
amples of this type of design would be heavily used transpor-  
tation tenninals, public buildings, or open spaces vvhere severe  
peaking, combined with space restrictions, limit design flexibility.

Average Pedestrian Area Occupancy\: 10-15 square feet per

Average Flow Volume\: 15-20 PFM.  
At walkway level-of-service D, the majority of persons would  
have their normal walking speeds restricted and reduced\) dtie to  
difficulties in bypassing slower-moving pedestrians nnd avoiding  
conflicts. Pedestrians involved in reverse-flow and crossing move-  
ments would be severely restricted, with the occurrence of multi-  
ple conflicts with other\~. Designs at this level-of-service would be  
representative of the most crowded public areas, where it is  
necessary to continually alter walking stride and direction to main-  
tain reasonable forward progress. At this level-of-service there  
is some probability of inte,1mittently reaching critical density,  
causing momentary stoppages of flow. Designs consistent with  
this level-of-service would represent only the most crowded public  
areas.  
Level of Service E  
Average Pedestrian Area Occupancy\: 5-10 square feet per person.  
Average Flow Volume\: 20-25 PFM.  
At walkway level-of-service E, virtually all pedestrians would  
have their normal walking speeds restricted, requiring frequent  
adjustments of gait. At the lower end of the range, forward pro-  
gress would only be made by shuffling. Insufficient area would  
be available to bypass slower-moving pedestrians. Extreme dif-  
ficulties would be experienced by pedestrians attempting reverse-  
flow and cross-flow movements. The design volume approaches  
the maximum attainable capacity of the walkway, with resulting  
frequent stoppages and interruptions of flow. This design range  
should only be employed for short peaks in the most crowded  
areas. This design level would occur naturally with a bulk arrival  
traffic pattern that immediately exceeds available capacity, and  
this is the only design situation for which it would be recom-  
mended. Examples would include sports-stadium design, or rail  
transit facilities where there may be a large but short-term exiting  
of passengers from a train. When this level-of-service is assumed  
for these design conditions, the adequacy of pedestrian holding  
areas at critical design sections., and all supplementary pedestrian  
facilities, must be carefully evaluated.

Average Pedestrian Area Occupancy\: 5 square feet per person,

Average Flow Volume\: Variable, up to 25 PFM.  
At walkway level-of-service F, all pedestrian walking speeds  
are extremely restricted, and forward progress can only be made  
by shuffling. There would be frequen!, unavoidable contact with  
other pedestrians, and reverse or crossing movements would be  
virtually impossible. Traffic flow would be sporadic, with forward  
progress based on the movement of those in front. This level-of-  
service is representative of a loss of control, and a complete break-  
down in traffic flow. Pedestrian areas below 5 square feet are  
more representative of a queuing, rather than a traffic-flow situ-  
ation, and this level-of.,service is not recommended for walkway  
design.

78 Stairway Standards  
When designing stairs, increased consideration must be given  
to the role of human characteristics, because of the greater safety  
hazards and energy expenditure required in locomotion on stairs.  
In addition to the exercise of designer judgement in evaluating  
the traffic patterns and peaking characteristics recommended for  
use of \\Valkway Standards, the follmving factors should be con-  
sidered in stairway design\:  
@ Stairs should be located so as to be readily visible and identi-  
fiable as a means of direct access to the levels they are design-  
ed to in terconncct;  
\(e Clear areas large enough to allow for queuing pedestrians  
should be provided at the approaches to all stairways;  
Stairs should be well lighted;  
\~ Stair nosing, riser, tread, and railing configurations should be  
designed to assist human locomotion, particularly for the  
handicapped;  
Riset heights should be kept below 7 inches, to reduce energy  
expenditure and to increase traffic efficiency;  
\\Vhen a stairway is placed directly within a corridor, the lower  
capacity of the stairway is the controlling factor in the  
design of the pedway section;  
e 'Where minor, reverse-flow traffic volumes frequently occur  
on a stair, the effective width of the stair for the major-  
direction ·design flow should be reduced by a minimum of  
one traffic lane, or 30 inches.

level of Service A  
Average Pedestrian Area Occupancy\: 20 square feet per person,

Average Flow Volume\: 5 PFM, or less.\~  
At stairway level-of-service A, sufficient area is provided to  
freely select locomotion speed, and to bypass other slower-moving  
pedestrians. No serious difficulties would be experienced with  
reverse traffic flows. Designs at this level-of-service would be  
consistent with public buildings or plazas that have no severe  
traffic peaks or space limitations.  
Level of Service B  
Average Pedestrian Area Occupancy\: 15-20 square feet per

At stairway level-of-service B, representing a space approxi-  
mately 5 treads long and 3 to 4 feet wide, virtually all persons  
may freely select locomotion speeds. However, in the lower range  
of area occupancy, some difficulties would be experienced in  
passing slower-moving pedestrians. Reverse flows would cause  
minor traffic conflicts. Designs at this level-of-service would be  
consistent with transportation terminals, and public buildings  
that have recurrent peak demands and no serious space limit-  
ations.  
Level of Service C  
Average Pedestrian Area Occupancy\: 10-15 square feet per  
person.  
Average Flow Volume\: 7-10 PFM.  
At stairway level-of-service C, representing a space approxi-  
mately 4 to 5 treads long and about 3 feet wide, locomotion  
speeds would *be* restricted slightly, due to an inability to pass  
slower-moving pedestrians. Minor reverse-traffic flows would  
encounter some difficulties. Design at this level-of-service would  
be consistent with transportation terminals, and public buildings  
with recurrent peak demands and some space restrictions.

At stairway level-of-service D, representing a space approxi-  
mately 3 to 4 treads long and 2 to 3 feet wide, locornotion speeds  
are restricted for the majority of persons, due to the limited open  
tread space and an inability to bypass slower-moving pedestrians.  
Reverse flows would encounter significant difficulties and traffic  
conflicts. Designs at this level-of-service would be consistent with  
the more crowded public buildings and transportation terminals,  
subjected to relatively severe peak demands.  
Level of Service E  
Average Pedestrian Area Occupancy\: 4-7 square feet per person.  
Average Flow Volume\: 13-17 PFM.  
At stairway level-of-service E, representing a space approxi-  
mately 2 to 4 tread lengths long and 2 feet wide, the minimum  
possible area for locomotion on stairs, virtually all persons would  
have their normal locomotion speeds reduced, because of the  
minimum tread length space and inability to bypass others. Inter-  
mittent stoppages are likely to occur, as the critical pedestrian  
density is exceeded. Reverse-traffic flows would experience se-  
rious conflicts. This level-of-service would only occur naturally  
with a bulk arrival traffic pattern that immediately exceeds avail-  
able capacity, and this is the only design situation for which it  
would *be* recommended. Examples would include sports stadiums,  
or transit facilities where there is a large uncontrolled, short-term  
exodus of pedestrians.

At stairway level-of-service F, representing a space approxi-  
mately 1 to 2 tread lengths long and 2 feet wide, there is a com-  
plete breakdown in traffic flow, with many stoppages. Forward  
progress would depend on movement of those in front. This level  
of service is not recommended for design.

# Queuing Standards  
Queuing level-of-service standards are based on the human  
body dimensions and personal space preferences discussed in  
Chapter Two, and the synthesis of pedestrian mobility contained  
in Chapter Three. The designer should not only apply queuing  
standards in areas designed primarily for pedestrian waiting, such  
as elevator and theater lobbies, but in other areas in which queu-  
ing is likely to result from service stoppages or inadequate  
capacity of pedestrian service facilities. Pedestrian holding areas  
on the approaches to stairs, or other critical sections, should also  
be adequately designed to hold waiting pedestrians. Areas such  
as railway and bus platforms have critical pedestrian holding  
capacities, which, if exceeded, can cause persons to be injured by  
being pushed onto tracks or roadways. In addition to their ability  
to hold standees, queuing areas have different internal circulation  
requirements, based on their type of use. For example, an airport  
baggage claim area must *be* capable of holding persons waiting  
for baggage, as well as those moving out of the area with baggage.  
Photographic illustrations and descriptions of queuing levels-  
of-service are shown on the following pages.

87 IAN M ED MOVERS"  
T\~is chapter has been titled "Pedestrian Movers" to differentiate  
mechanical systems, designed to carry persons on foot, from the  
many new forms of "people movers" that employ vehicles. The  
chapter's main focus is on elevators, motorstairs and 111oving walks,  
with a brief discussion of "people-mover" systems at the end of  
the chapter. The mechanical principles of moving people and  
goods on elevators have been in use for thousands of years. Effi-  
cient, safe elevator transportation has made possible the concen-  
trated, multi-story development of our modem urban centers.  
Escalators are a comparatively recent innovation in this long  
history, but wide public acceptance of escalators has made their  
use almost mandatory for many low-rise applications. Moving  
walks have been used to shorten walking distances, but they may  
be advantageously substituted for escalators in certain circum-  
stances.  
There is a traffic-flow distinction between the use of elevators,  
which provide on-dernand service, and escalators and moving  
walks, which constantly offer service ·which may, or may not, be  
constantly utilized. The practical capacity of these constant-  
service devices has created problems for some designers, because  
of an incomplete understanding of traffic and human character-  
istics of their use. Similar misconceptions have led to overstated  
claims of capacity for some recently proposed people-mover  
systems.  
The elevator is the most universally accepted mechanical pe-  
destrian mover. Elevators represent one of the earliest forms of  
mechanical aids for the movement of people and goods. Un-  
doubtedly, the Egyptians devised various types of elevator sys-  
tems to move the massive stone blocks of the pyramids. Archi-  
medes is credited with building the first elevator, using large  
wheels for its mechanical advantage, in 236 B.C. Shaftways de-  
signed to accommodate guided elevator platforms have been  
discovered in Roman ruins. The palace of the Emperor Nero  
reportedly contained three elevators. Elevators were used to lift  
animals to the arena level of the ancient Roman Coliseum. The  
89 French fortress of Mont St. Michel contains an example of an  
elevator hoist dating from the eleventh century. All of these early  
lifting devices had serious safety deficiencies, because the hoisting  
rope was made of fiber, \\vhich often broke without warning.  
Modern elevators date from 1853, when Elisha Otis invented the  
first sqfety device designed to prevent the lift platform from  
falling freely due to a broken hoisting rope. The technical advance  
of elevators was aided further by the development of more re-  
liable steel-cable rope, and the steam engine. Safe, efficient, ele-  
vator systems have made the dense, high-rise development of our  
modern cities possible. Recent technical innovations in elevator  
engineering include shaft speeds as high as 1600 to 1800 feet per  
minute, automatic operation to meet variations in traffic demand,  
and the double-deck elevator.  
The traffic design of elevator systems has been developed to  
a rather exact science, using techniques of analysis based on the  
operating characteristics of the elevator, boarding characteristics  
of the users, and user traffic patte.rns. Elevator operating charac-  
teristics would include lobby configurations, cab configurations  
and their practical standing capacity, shaft acceleration and de-  
celeration speeds, and door opening and closing speeds. The  
standing capacity of an elevator is based on the assumption of an  
average area occupancy of about 2 square feet per person. Eleva-  
tors may be crowded to area occupancies of as low as 1.5 square  
feet per person, but this is undesirable, and unlikely under most  
normal conditions. Rules of human conduct vary in elevators,  
affecting their standing capacity. If traffic is composed of groups  
of persons known to each other, lower per-person area occupan-  
cies are tolerated. In more formal situations, as in a hotel elevator,  
close crowding of elevator occupants is not readily accepted. As  
discussed in Chapter Three, unavoidable contact between stand-  
ing pedestrians is likely to occur at area occupancies below 2%  
square feet per person. Heavier winter clothing, and the presence  
of baggage of packages, increases the area needed for the avoid-  
ance of contact. Most persons require 3 square feet or more to  
feel comfortable in an elevator.  
The key element of a well-designed elevator system is an  
understanding of the traffic demand patterns of the users. A high-  
rise building will naturally have peaks that are tied to the work  
schedules of its employees. Office workers generally will have  
different working hours than industrial workers and maintenance  
staff. The presence or absence of in-house eating facilities will

92 affect the severity of the lunch peak. Staggering of work schedules  
can produce a more balanced use of elevator facilities, and higher  
levels-ofservice. The quality of service of an elevator system is  
usually based on average waiting time. The tolerance level for an  
acceptable waiting time for elevator service has been established  
at about 30 seconds for commercial buildings, and 60 seconds for  
residential buildings.  
Computer simulation is being used increasingly to determine  
the passenger service levels of larger systems. Simulation inputs  
include building traffic patterns, and elevator shaft speeds, door  
opening speeds, and dwell times. The dwell time is the time taken  
to load and unload the elevator. Dwell times are one of the more  
complex simulation inputs, because they are a function of  
the number of persons in the elevator, as well as the number  
getting on and off. Dwell times are very often the most time\~  
consuming element of elevator use and, axe therefore, a significant  
determinant of capacity. The computer simulation technique has  
been used to evaluate elevator passenger service levels for the  
world's tallest building complex, the 9-million-square-foot World  
Trade Center in New York City. Each of the two 110-story tower  
buildings has 104 local and express elevators, to accommodate the  
Center's 50,000 employees and estimated 80,000 daily visitors.  
Large buildings require optimization of elevator service be-  
cause elevator shafts reduce net usable \(and rentable\) floor area.  
In very tall buildings, such as the John Hancock building in  
Chicago, the World Trade Center in New York, and Sears Tower  
in Chicago, conventional single-shaft elevator systems would con-  
sume considerable amounts of usable building space on lower floors.  
Space savings were realized in these projects by using "sky lobby"  
concepts, which, in effect, divide the building into two or three  
buildings stacked one upon the other. Passengers destined for the  
upper floors of the building take high-speed elevators to an in-  
termediate sky lobby, where they transfer to upper-floor elevators.  
Vertical shafts for upper and lower segments of the building are  
used in common, by two to three elevators stacked above each other.  
\(See Figure 5.1\). The sky lobby system at the Trade Center resulted  
in an estimated 13 per cent increase in gross rentable floor area,  
over conventional elevator arrangements.  
The accepted innovation for increasing elevator capacity is the  
double-deck elevator. The system is installed in the Time-Life  
Building in Chicago, and the John Hancock Tower in Boston and  
93 as shuttle elevators to the Skylobbies in the Sears Tower. Double-  
deck elevators are two stories high, with upper and lower compart-  
ments. Passengers enter these elevators from two entrance lobbies,  
a lower lobby serving odd floors, and an upper lobby serving even  
floors. \(See Figures 5.2 and 5.3\). This has the advantage of reduc-  
ing pedestrian traffic concentrations in entrance lobby areas.  
Double-deck elevators operate in the conventional way in response  
to passenger calls in both compartments. In peaks, when this  
system is most efficient, stops would be made in response to calls  
in both upper and lower compartments. At other times, persons  
in one compartment might be required to wait momentarily while  
a call is answered in the other, or the one compartment can be  
re-programmed to serve all floors. Under typical conditions, double-  
decking is estimated to increase elevator capacity by one hundred  
per cent, reducing the required number of elevator shafts in half.  
Double-deck elevators can also be combined with the sky lobby con-  
cept, to produce even greater space savings \(See Figure 5.3\).

95 Escalators  
An escalator is a combined vertical and horizontal pedestrian  
mover, which provides a continuous series of individual pallets\>  
or treads, for standing pedestrians. The origin of the escalator  
can be traced to 1859, when Nathan Ames obtained a patent for  
"Revolving Stairs", a device consisting of steps linked together to  
form a continuous, moving stairway driven by rollers. In 1892,  
Jesse Reno patented a device called an "Endless Conveyor", de-  
scribed as a sliding mechanical incline. The "steps" of this con-  
veyor were actually flat, grooved sections, following the angle of  
incline. In 1900, the first practical moving stair based on Reno's  
patent was installed in the 59th street station of the Third Avenue  
Manhattan elevated line. This first unit had a rise of 24 feet, was  
18 inches wide, and inclined about 25 degrees. In this same year,  
the Otis Elevator Company installed a similar escalator, based on  
an 1899 patent by Charles D. Seeberger, at the Paris Exhibition.  
About 1910, the Otis Elevator Company acquired the patent  
rights of Reno, Seeberger and another inventor named Wheeler,  
combining each inventor's best design features into a unit resem-  
bling today's installations.  
The normal angle of incline of escalators is 30 degrees. Operat-  
ing speeds in the United States are usually either 90 or 120 feet  
per minute, measured along the incline. This is within the range  
of the average stair-climbing speeds reported in Chapter Three.  
Some escalators incorporate dual-speed features, *so* that they can  
be run at both speeds, with the higher speed being used during  
periods of peak demand. Operating speeds, angles, and widths,  
of both escalators and moving walks, are established by the  
American Standard Safety Code for elevators. The angle and  
speed of escalators are more variable in Europe. An escalator  
angle of 35 degrees is used for units at the Montpamasse Station  
of the Paris Metro transit system. A speed of about 180 feet  
per minute has been reported in the Leningrad, Russia, sub-  
way system. Several studies have been made of the effect of  
speed on escalator capacity, including a study by the London  
Transport system of escalator speeds varying from 100 to 185 feet  
per minute. This study revealed that the optimum speed and  
capacity of a 48-inch-wide escalator was 145 feet per minute, and  
150 persons per minute. Comparison of this result with American  
use is difficult, because of the well-established English practice  
of standees keeping to the right, to allow moving pedestrians to  
96 pass on the left. Signs adjacent to escalators also state this rule.  
It is interesting to note that the practice of walking on a moving  
escalator probably produces little if any gain in escalator capacity,  
because the moving pedestrian must occupy two steps at a time  
during stair locomotion, cancelling out much of the capacity ad-  
vantage that may be gained through the faster combined speed.  
The practice has the advantage of shortening pedestrian trip  
times for those who choose to walk. This is important in. deep  
subway systems, with long, high-rise escalators, as in London. A  
study of dual-speed escalators in this country found that a one\~  
third increase in the speed of the unit, from 90 to 120 feet per  
minute, resulted in approximately a 12 per cent increase in pedes-  
trian use, under the constant pressure of heavy traffic volumes  
and frequent queuing.  
Escalator manufacturers rate the theoretical capacity of their  
units on the basis of speed, assumed occupancy per step, and  
100 per cent step utilization. Numerous observations have shown  
that 100 per cent step utilization is never obtained, even with  
the heaviest traffic pressure and use by the most knowledgeable  
and agile pedestrians, including commuters. For this reason, a  
Proposed inclined elevator for the handicapped, using fhe same space as a conven-  
tional escalator.  
97 nominal, or practical, design capacity is often suggested for  
escalator design. The manufacturer's theoretical capacity is bas-  
ed on 5 persons for each 4 steps on a 32 inch-wide escalator, and  
2 persons per step for a 48 inch-wide escalator, The nominal  
capacities are observed averages reported by Strakosch in the  
book\: *Vertical Transportation* - *Elevators and Escalators,* John  
Wiley Publishers, 1983 edition. Actual capacity is considerably  
lower as shown below and is generally one person every other step  
on a 32 inch-wide escalator and one person per step on a 48 inch-  
wide escalator. NOTE\: Recent changes in designations now refer  
to step width rather than hip width, 48" therefore is now 40"  
\(1000 mm\) and 32" is now 24" \(600 mm\).

\(1\) incline· speed 90 feet per minute, 68 steps per minute.  
\(2\) incline speed 120 feet per minute, 89 steps per minute.  
Although these nominal capacity ratings provide a useful  
guideline for comparing escalator sizes and speeds, they do not  
explain the phenomenon of empty steps that are often seen when  
escalators are under heavy use, nor the wide variations in capacity  
that have been reported by various agencies. Escalator capacities  
should be determined on the same rational basis that is followed  
in elevator capacity analysis. The real determinants of this use  
are the arrival process, and boarding characteristics, of the users.  
An intermittent arrival process, such as that described in Chapter  
Three, can result in gaps during which escalator steps go by  
unused. In addition, a transit arrival pattern with scheduled  
98 ILLUSTRATION OF VACANT  
ON HEAVY TRAFFIC ESCALATOR  
99 spacing between trains can produce gaps of unused escalator  
capacity. Unused escalator steps can also be caused by the user's  
inability to board the unit quickly enough, or be a simple per-  
sonal desire for a more comfortable human space.  
A comparison of the standing areas provided for pedestrians  
on escalator treads illustrates the potential for personal space  
interaction. The 32-inch escalator \(hip width\), has a 15-inch pro-  
jected tread length and a 24-inch tread width, which provides an  
average standing area of 2.7 square feet per pedestrian, at the  
manufacturer's assumed ocupancy of 1 ¼ persons per step. The  
48-inch escalator, with a 40-inch tread width, allows only 2.1  
square feet standing area per person at the manufacturer's  
theoretical assumption of double step occupancy. These standing  
areas are within the zone of unavoidable contact between  
pedestrians, established in Chapter Three. At the observed  
nominal capacities, standing areas are above 4 square feet per  
pedestrian\: which is greater than the "touch zone" noted in  
studies of elevator loading and occupancy. Personal area  
preference, therefore, provides a partial explanation of the  
phenomenon of vacant steps on escalators in heavy traffic. When  
boarding an escalator, a person has the option of choosing a step  
position directly behind and beside another person, with the risk  
of brushing against him or her, or letting that step go by, thus  
obtaining a more comfortable personal space. This prospect of leav-  
ing a gap would depend on the individual's own buffer zone im-  
age, the physical size of adjacent persons, or the presence of bag-  
gage or packages. Tending to confirm this premise, average peak  
volume use of escalators at one large transportation terminal has  
been observed to be slightly lower in winter, which has been at-  
tributed to bulkier clothing.  
A slow-motion picture study of persons boarding escalators  
offers a further insight into the vacant-step phenomenon.  
Pedestrians were photographed as they passed through the en-  
trance section of the espalator, comprised of the comb plate length  
and first tread length, which were readily identifiable in  
photographs. \(See illustration\). An editing device was used to  
determine boarding times, by counting the number of  
photographic frames required for a pedestrian to pass through  
the entrance section, and translating the number of frames into  
an equivalent boarding time. The accuracy of the technique was  
confirmed by counts of peak volumes obtained while the escalator  
was under constant queuing pressure.

The average headway of 1.17 seconds, observed under constant  
heavy-traffic conditions, is equivalent to a escalator use of 103  
pedestrians per minute, approximately equal to the observed  
nominal capacity.  
The study showed some other interesting results. Figure 5.4  
shows frequency distributions of pedestrian boarding times under  
light traffic conditions, with and without baggage, and under heavy  
traffic, with baggage. Baggage was also found to cause slight, but  
measurable, increases in heavy traffic boarding times. If a line is  
drawn on these distributions equivalent to the common 90- and  
120-foot-per-minute speeds of escalators, it can be seen that the  
normal boarding times of some pedestrians are not fast enough  
for boarding the first escalator step at the higher speed. This  
accounts for the observed lower percentage of tread occupancies

103 on the faster units. The photographic study indicates that the  
nominal capacity is a reasonable estimate of use under constant  
demand, but the reductions in this nominal capacity can be ex-  
pected if traffic is intermittent, composed of persons with baggage  
or packages, and if the escalator speed is increased,  
The pedestrian boarding time distributions developed in the  
photographic study were put to use in another way. They were  
introduced into a General Purpose Simulation System \(GPSS/360\)  
computer program and escalator utilization was simulated for vary-  
ing traffic demands. The computer program selected pedestrian  
inter-arrival times at the escalator, assigned boarding times ac-  
cording to the proportion of male and female users and traffic den-  
sity, and determined average utilization, queue lengths, and  
pedestrian waiting times. The computer simulation program pro-  
duced an accurate picture of observed queuing lengths and waiting  
times that are known to occur, typically, at this escalator. The  
significance of this computer simulation technique is in its ver-  
satility, which affords the designer a means of evaluating the im-  
pact of specific traffic patterns and user characteristics on escalator  
utilization, producing reasonable predictions of actual escalator use,  
pedestrian queue size, and waiting times.  
The possibility that escalators can generate large queues, even  
at traffic levels below the capacity of the unit, is often overlooked  
by designers. On the basis of probabilities, a surge in flow and a  
group of slower-boarding pedestrians can reasonably be expected  
to occur at the same time, causing a long, but temporary, queue,  
which can cause crowding or disrupt other nearby traffic  
movements. For example, in the computer simulation run described  
above, a maximum queue of 98 persons occurred at one point,  
even though the average arrival rate was slightly below the  
nominal capacity of the unit. On the basis of an average area of  
5 square feet per person area occupancy observed for escalator  
queues, a 500-square-foot clear area would be required at the  
ei;,calator approaches to accommodate this surge of queuing  
pedestrians. If the nominal capacity of the escalator is exceeded,  
much larger backup spaces are needed. The discharge end of an  
escalator also must provide sufficient space to accommodate  
pedestrians being *mechanically* fed off the escalator, and to  
avoid conflicts with other traffic streams. Mechanically is em\~  
phasized because an escalator discharges pedestrians into an area  
regardless of whether the area has sufficient space to accept them  
104 or not. If the space at the outlet end happens to be a railroad  
platform, the potential exists for persons to be pushed off the  
platform by the continuously delivered pedestrians coming off the  
escalator. In these situations, controls must be established to avoid  
crowding the escalator outlet area beyond its capacity to accom-  
modate queuing pedestrians.  
The impact of escalator stoppages for maintenance and repair  
should also be given consideration in design. Adequate supple-  
mentary stationary stairs should be situated close to the escalator.  
Provisions should also be made for performing routine preventive  
maintenance without stopping the escalator. Where possible, the  
New York City Transit Authority locates machine rooms inside  
the upper supporting truss of its escalators, *so* that a maintenance  
man can lubricate and inspect the unit without interrupting its  
operation.  
Escalator landing areas must be carefully designed to avoid traffic conflicts and  
to provide sufficient area for queuing pedestrians.  
105 Moving Walks  
A moving walk is a conveyance that provides a flat, con-  
tinuous, moving stµface, of pallets or a rubber belt, on which  
the pedestrian may stand or walk. Moving walks are installed on  
level surfaces, to shorten walking distances, or on inclines of up  
to 12 degrees, to provide both horizontal and vertical move-  
ment. The earliest escalators resembled the moving walk, because  
the individual treads were not stepped, but followed the  
incline of the escalator. Moving sidewalks were advocated as early  
as 187 4, when there was a proposal for an elevated moving  
sidewalk and people-mover system in Manhattan. The proposed  
loop system was to be comprised of a continuous, moving sidewalk,  
running parallel to a faster conveyor carrying passenger cars. In  
1893, a system of this type was installed at the Chicago  
Columbian Exposition. The system, which carried 2. 7 million pas-  
sengers, was comprised of a boarding stage of a continuous series  
of pallets moving at 3 miles per hour, and a second stage of a con-  
tinuous series of cars with seats moving at 6 miles per hour. Similar  
systems were installed at the Berlin Exposition of 1896, and the  
Paris Exposition of 1900. The Paris installation carried 8 million  
passengers. These innovative systems captured the imagination of  
the public at that time in much the same way that monorail has  
today.  
In the early 1900's formal recommendations were made to the  
New York State Public Service Commission for combined moving-  
walk and people-mover systems for the Brooklyn and Williamsburg  
bridges in Manhattan. A subway line was also proposed between  
10th and 42nd streets. This line was to have the more ambitious  
seated-stage speed of 12 miles per hour, reached in progressive  
moving-walk stages of 3, 6 and 9 miles per hour. The Continuous  
Transit Corporation, advocates of the moving-walk and  
people-mover subway, estimated that the system would provide a  
seated capacity far in excess of any conventional rail subway.  
In 1909, the New York City Board of Estimate authorized  
a formal study of such a system under 34th Street, extending from  
Second to Ninth Avenues. In the 1920's, the Continuous Transit  
Corporation again proposed a shuttle system under 42nd Street,  
between Grand Central 'Thrminal and Times Square, with the  
seated-stage speed of 9 miles per hour. At that time, a large-scale  
experimental model was built in Jersey City, New Jersey. The  
system was said to have a seated capacity of 35,640 persons per  
106 hour, compared to the 4,400 seats and 17,600 passengers provided  
by the then existing Times Square shuttle operation. Little infor-  
mation is available to explain why these systems were never built.  
However, one disadvantage of large-sca1e, continuous moving  
systems is their "weak-link" vulnerability. \\Vhen a system is com-  
prised of a passive roadbed and multiple, individually powered  
units, such as with conventional transit, disabled units can easily  
be removed from the system for repair. \\ Vith larger, continuous  
moving systems, the entire system must be shut clown for repair.  
The loss of service due to system down-times cnn be lessened by  
installation of parallel systems, and by designing for syskm re-  
dundancy and preventive maintenance efficiency. Preventive  
maintenance efficiency, or maintainability, is enhanced in the  
initial design by assu,ring convenient mdintenance access, and  
machine design that allows for quick replacement of working  
parts, particularly those parts that arc subject to greater probabil-  
ities of failure. It would also include provision for storage of a  
supply of replacement parts close to the system.  
There are two basic categories of moving walks, the **pallet** type,  
a continuous system of flat, grooved trends, using virtually the  
same machinery parts as an escalator, and the **belt** type, a con-  
tinuous, conveyor-like, grooved rubber belt, supported by rollers.  
The steel pallet systems are not as common as the continuous  
belt. The Bank Station of the London Underground transit system  
has two, heavily used, 48-inch-widc, 300-foot-long, 42-fookise,  
steel-treaded pallet type units, capable of speeds of up to 180  
feet per minute. The capacity of each of these units has been  
rated by London Transport at 10,000 passengers per hour. There  
are numerous examples of the belt-type system. One of the longest  
and most notable is at the \:tv1ontparnasse Station of the Paris \:tvletro.  
This installation is comprised of three, 44-inch-wide, 607-foot-long  
units, running at speeds of 164 feet per minute. Two of the units  
operate in the direction of peak flow. The Paris Metro also has  
two 430-foot-long units in operation at the Chatelet Station. The  
riding characteristics of the pallet and belt types are similar,  
except that the undulations of the supporting rollers on the belt  
type are usually sensed through the feet of the pedestrian. This  
presents no serious problern if belt tension is maintained at a  
satisfactory level.  
Moving belts are generally run at faster speeds than escalators,  
but slower speeds are often used for installations that are patron-  
ized by larger percentages of slower-reacting shoppers and oldn  
107 persons. Where pedestrians are likely to be distracted, such as in  
amusement areas, slower speeds have also been found to be more  
desirable. Level moving walks can easily be used by persons with  
shopping'carts or baby carriages, and by handicapped persons in  
wheelchairs. However, these uses are limited on sloped units. Some  
shopping centers have provided special shopping carts with wheels  
that intermesh with the grooves of the rubber belt, to facilitate  
their use on sloped units.  
The capacity of moving walks is rated in much the same way  
as escalators, by an assumed pedestrian occupancy, and the  
operating speed of the unit. The rated capacities supplied by one  
manufacturer are shown in Thble 5-C.

The theoretical capacity of these units is based on a spacing  
of 2 feet between pedestrians and single occupancy on  
the 24-inch unit, and double occupancy on the 42-inch  
unit. The maximum observed use of a 44-inch wide walkway  
is 100 persons per minute after a perlormance at the Holly-  
wood Bowl, California. The double-width unit has the  
deficiency that it does not allow sufficient shoulder width for  
two persons to stand abreast, or to pass each other comfortably.  
Observations of the use of a unit of this type confirmed that  
on occasion, a single, standing pedestrian, particularly one with  
baggage, would stop or hinder by-passing pedestrians. The lack of  
108 Moving walks are adaptable for use by the handicapped.  
A cut-away view of a moving walk illustrating the drive unit, belt support rollers  
and comb plate.  
109 sufficient shoulder width was also observed to cause difficulties  
at the entrance of the unit when two persons approached it  
simultaneously. A slow-motion photography study of boarding  
times showed slightly slower average boarding times for a double-  
width moving belt, as compared to a 48-inch escalator. The esca-  
lator provides 4 inches more width at. the tread.  
The capacity of moving walks is based on the assumption of  
standing pedestrians. It has often been stated that when pedes-  
trians walk on a moving belt the capacity of the unit is increased,  
even doubled. This is not correct. As discussed previously, the  
average pedestrian requires an area of about 25 square feet for a  
near-normal walking speed of 250 feet per minute, about twice  
the speed of the belt. Although the pedestrian's relative speed  
when walking on a belt is about three times the belt speed, the  
pedestrian actually requires more than three times the area for  
walking than the manufacturer's capacity assumption. This actually  
results in a slight decrease in capacity if all pedestrians walk on  
a moving belt. However, the practice of walking on moving belts  
is to be encouraged, because of the pedestrian's own time savings.  
There is a significant amount of research currently underway  
on the development of variable-speed moving walks. These units  
would be boarded at conventional 90- or 120-foot-per-minute  
speeds, and then would accelerate the standing pedestrian to  
speeds of up to 10 miles per hour. The philosophy behind the  
development of these systems is that there is a speed gap between  
walking speed \( 3 MPH\) and the speed of most rapid transit  
systems \( 15 MPH+ \) . This speed gap becomes more significant  
for trips within airports or central business districts, where rapid  
transit cannot satisfactorily satisfy internal trip demands. The  
Battelle Institute of Geneva is investigating the feasibility of the  
Integrator, a continuous feeder system used as a boarding stage  
for a "Speedaway" transporter belt, travelling at 10 miles per  
hour. Pedestrians would board the Integrator in a direction trans-  
verse to the Speedaway transporter, and then be angularly ac-  
celerated by the Integrator until it is running parallel and at the  
same speed as the transporter. Pedestrians would then board the  
10 MPH transporter. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University's  
Applied Physics Laboratory are working on a linear accelerator  
with much the same configuration as a pallet-type moving walk,  
but capable of accelerating from 1.7 MPH to 5 MPH through  
changing tread geometry. All these systems are being designed  
with attention to human acceleration and deceleration tolerances.  
110 People Movers  
"People Ivfovcrs" is a rather broad, generic term which could  
encompass any type of vehicle or mechanical movement system  
used by man. This discussion is limited to some of the smaller  
system;, which might be typically used by pedestrians for internal  
transportation within an airport or central business district. The  
basic prerequisites of such systems are that they have ready ac-  
cess for boarding and discharge, and that acceleration and decel-  
eration be accomplished within short distances. The systems may  
be classified either as passive vehicle types, in which propulsion  
is provided by the roadbed, or tractive vehicle types, in which  
the roadbed is passive but may supply power and guidance to  
the vehicle. The Carveyor and the Disneyland People \:Mover are  
examples of the first category, and Starrcar is an example of  
the latter.  
The Carveyor is a continuous service system, employing a  
passenger car with facing seats placed on a moving belt. At  
stations and terminals the passenger car is decelerated to 1.5  
MPH, and passengers board the car by means of a parallel moving  
walk running at this speed. After passengers board the car, it is  
accelerated to 1.5 MPH, by a series of rollers. The Disneyland  
People Mover, which has been in active use for some years, re\~  
sernbles the Carveyor with the exception that instead of the car  
being accelerated onto a moving belt, car traction is supplied by  
a continuous series of rotating rollers, placed in the roadbed.  
Operating difficulties are sometimes experienced in wet weather,  
due to loss of traction on the rollers. The people-mover makes use  
of attendants at its terminal ends to assist persons on and off cars.  
The Starrcar would be typical of systems in which individual  
vehicles are provided with guidance and power from the road-  
way, and operate under computer control. Starrcar can also be  
designed to operate over conventional road\\vay systems, with  
entrance into the guideway system at selected points. The Starrcar  
could also operate in a closed system, providing on-demand serv..,  
ice similar to an elevator. The advantages of individual powered  
vehicles is that in the event of a vehicle malfunction, they can be  
taken off the line, This lessens the probability of a system-wide  
breakdovm,  
It is perhaps worth repeating that the true capadty of continu-  
ous moving systems is not a function of the number of seats or  
total standing area provided. Arrival characteristics and human  
lll capabilities will detennine the practical or working capacity of  
these systems. If a person hesitates, or finds difficulty in board-  
ing such a system, then unused capacity will pass by. There are  
many persons who balk at using mechanical systems, or who,  
under some circumstances, may refuse to use them altogether.  
Conditions that exist at amusement areas or expositions do not  
necessarily represent a true picture of a system in daily use by  
the general population. Attendants are very often provided at  
these places to encourage and assist the balking pedestrian. In  
addition, many handicapped persons avoid these places because  
of expected difficulties. In developing the capacity of such sys-  
tems, it is recommended that the boarding characteristics of a  
true sample of the user population be closely examined. The only  
satisfactory way of collecting such data in a meaningful manner  
is through slow-motion moving picture analysis. Each movement  
may be accurately timed and evaluated, and, if necessary, the  
films can be run over and over again, until the human processes  
are dearly understood. These user boarding characteristics, com-  
bined with the expected traffic patterns and demand character-  
istics of the particular application, are the only true determinants  
of capacity and actual use,

113 Chapter Six  
E OF IAN NING  
The pedestrian planning process follows the classic sequence  
of problem definition, identification of restraints, determination  
of program objectives, establishment of study scope and proce-  
dures, collection and analysis of data, devdopment of alternative  
solutions, final design, and program implementation. A planning  
program for pedestrians may involve one building, a small group  
of b1iildings, a downtown core network, or even larger systems  
of interlocking networks. Project scope may range from a basic  
low-budget improvement program, gradually implemented over  
a long time period, to a large capital project with accel.erated  
priorities. This chapter deals with the general objectives of pedes-  
trian improvement programs, study procedures and techniques,  
and some methods of plan implementation. The discussion gen-  
erally follows the schematic illustration shown in Figure 6.1.  
and Objectives  
The primary goals and objectives of an improvement program  
for pedestrians are\: safety, security, convenience, continuity,  
comfort, system coherence and attractiveness. All goals are inter-  
related and overlapping. Improvements in one objective general-  
ly result in opportunities for improvements in the others. The  
basic concern of pedestrian safety is the reduction of the pedes-  
trian-vehicle conflict. The two fundamental means of attaining  
this objective are\: by space separation, either horizontal or ver-  
tical, or by time separation. Traffic signalization represents an  
example of separati011 of pedestrians and vehicles in time, but  
with most conventional signalization methods the pedestrian is  
still exposed to conflicts with turning vehicles. There have been  
attempts to reduce or eliminate these conflicts by using an ad-  
vanced, or delayed, green indication for turning vehicles, allowing  
them to tum outside the pedestrian walk cycle. An exclusive pe-  
destrian signal phase, called the "all-walk," or "scramble" system,  
is used at busy downtown intersections in some cities. During  
this signal phase, pedestrians are given exclusive crossing rights,  
and may even cross diagonally within the intersection. Time  
separation of vehicles and pedestrians by traffic signalization has  
115 the disadvantage of inducing greater concentrations of pedestrians  
at comers and on sidewalks. Corner concentrations are caused  
by accumulations of pedestrians waiting to cross the streets. Side-  
walk concentrations are induced by the alternating imposition of  
the signal cycle on pedestrian flow, causing denser flow platoons  
than would occur with a normal free-flow pattern, unrestrained  
by signal interruptions.  
Imperial Rome's restrictions against heavy vehicular traffic in  
the central city during daylight hours represent another form of  
time separation. A more recent example is the closing of streets in  
New York's crowded financial district during lunch hours, to fa-  
cilitate the movement of extremely dense pedestrian traffic. Other  
New York streets have been temporarily closed for recreational,  
sightseeing and shopping purposes during weekends. New York  
has also instituted a staggered vvork hours program, a time separa-  
tion plan with broad implications. The program has reduced  
pedestrian congestion in buildings, streets and in transit stations  
and trains. This program· hopes to balance the distribution of *em-*  
ployee work schedules to reduce peaking effects.

117 The horizontal or vertical separation of pedestrians and vehicles  
is a means of satisfying almost all pedestrian improvement objec-  
tives. Horizontal separation can be accomplished by establish-  
ment of a pedestrian precinct, or mall, where vehicular intrusion  
is restricted or eliminated. This concept has been used in the de-  
velopment of many suburban shopping centers, and is also a  
feature of many new town designs. Exclusive pedestrian malls  
are also being created in some central city areas by closing se-  
lected city streets. Vertical separation of pedestrians and vehicles  
is attained through the use of underpasses or overpasses.  
There are many examples of independent overpass or underpass  
structures built at locations where an active pedestrian traffic  
linkage crosses a busy highway. These grade separations are very  
often installed in reaction to a heavy pedestrian accident ex-  
perience. There have been discouraging results where these in-  
stallations were located off the route of pedestrian trip desire  
lines, or where their use causes increased time and energy ex-  
penditures to climb stairs. Studies conducted by the Road Re-  
search Laboratory in England showed that even when the time  
required to use the safer underpass or overpass is equal to the  
level walking time, only 80 per cent of those observed made use  
of it. The proportion of use of these safer facilities dropped sharp\~  
ly when this time was greater than the equivalent level walk.  
This clearly indicates that pedestrian grade separations cannot  
be considered as isolated safety improvements, but m.ust be  
incorporated into a larger pedestrian convenience network.  
Pedestrian security has become an important objective in build-  
ing and street design. Building and street configmations should  
be arranged to enhance clear observation by other pedestrians  
and the police. High lighting levels, unobstructed lines of sight,  
and avoidance of building or landscaping configurations that  
provide concealment will assist in attaining this objective. Televi-  
sion surveillance is being increasingly used in buildings, transit  
stations, and at some street locations, and the possibilities for  
locating these devices should receive attention in design.  
Pedestrian convenience may he enhanced on most city streets  
at relatively little capital expense. Sidewalk obstructions, such as  
mailboxes\) telephone booths, ne\\.vsstands, refuse cans, and plant-  
ers, may be relocated to improve pedestrian flow at practically  
no cost. Other more stationary items, such as traffic light stand-  
ards, fire hydrants, and fire alarm boxes, could be moved under  
118 normal replacement schedules. Zoning bonus prov1s10ns can be  
used as a means of encouraging developers to provide improved  
pedestrian circulation, access to transportation facilities, and other  
pedestrian amenities. Traffic control systems may be modified to  
facilitate pedestrian, rather than vehicular, flow. Circuitous pe-  
destrian trip linkages around large-block street configurations  
can be shortened by the use of rnidblock connectors. Municipal  
ordinances can control across-thc-sidevvalk freight operations  
during certain times of the day. Staggered work hours, exclusive  
pedestrian streets during busy hours, and other time-separation  
programs, can also be promoted at very little cost. Ramped curb  
cuts provide convenience for handicapped pedestrians in wheel-  
chairs, persons wheeling baby carriages, and for others who have  
difficulties with high curbs. Tactile trails for the blind can be  
installed in and around buildings that are frequented by these  
persons.  
Continuity, convenience and comfort are the primary objectives  
of the new grade-separated pedestrian networks being built or  
planned for the future. \( *See* Chapter Eight\). These nehvorks arc  
either above or below street level, with both having their advan-  
tages and disadvantages. Underground systems need only be about  
ten feet belO\\v street level, provide full weather protection, more  
efficient climate control, and are easily connected to subway transit  
stations. Disadvantages of underground systems are in their high  
excavation costs, possible conflicts with sub-surface utilities, and  
loss of visual identity with the cityscape above. Above-ground pe-  
destrian convenience networks have the advantage of lower con-  
struction costs and greater opportunities for integration and identi-  
fication with the cityscape. The primary disadvantage of above-  
ground networks is their greater height above street level, required  
to provide vehicle clearances\) making these *systems* difficult to re-  
late to below-ground transit. Most of the underground pedestrian  
systems have evolved by connecting an existing patchwork of  
passages built to serve below-grade transit stations. The above-  
ground networks are all new developments.  
The importance of system continuity cannot be overempha-  
sized. The developers of Chase ivfanhattan Plaza, in the down-  
town financial district of fvfanhattan, have built well-designed  
pedestrian-oriented building service facilities, consisting of an  
elevated, attractively landscaped plaza, and generous below-  
ground connections to the suhway. This development serves, with  
119 great efficiency, the two large office buildings abutting the plaza.  
However, the plaza is an island without linkage connections to  
other buildings or transit stations in the area. The complex there-  
fore provides little contribution to the system-wide deficiencies  
that exist in this crowded district.  
System coherence is related to the concepts of the perception  
of urban space outlined in Chapter Two. Coherence is a necessary  
element of urban space design if the full utility of the space is  
to be realized. A confused pedestrian searching for orientation  
has limited receptivity to secondary visual inputs such as aesthet\~  
ics. All elements of the urban core, including street systems,  
transit facilities, office buildings, civic center and theater com-  
plexes, and shopping areas, should have clear visual statements  
that convey their direction, function and purpose. This does not  
limit opportunities for variety and interest, but actually enhances  
it. When the pedestrian is assured of his primary concern of  
orientation and direction, his level of receptivity to sensory gra-  
dients, such as changes in color, light, ground slope, smells, sounds  
and textures, is increased. The requirements of system coherence  
do not limit the use of small cul-de-sac areas for special interest,  
if their association with the parent network is clearly demon-  
strated by landmarks or path orientation. System coherence is  
also an important element of building design, particularly for  
transportation terminals. An incoherent passenger terminal con-  
figuration multiplies the number of directional signs, thus de-  
creasing individual sign effectiveness. Directional signing will  
not satisfactorily alleviate incoherence in building design. Signs  
should be considered as a supplementary message to confirm the  
visual statements expressed by the legibility of the building de-  
sign itself.  
The objective of attractiveness encompasses not only aesthetic  
design, but the sense of excitement that should be created by an  
urban space. Landscaping, pavement color and texture, well-  
designed street furniture components, fountains, and plazas in-  
crease the visual variety of the cityscape. Opportunities for in-  
troducing elements of surprise, through suddenly revealed vistas  
and panoramic views, should not be overlooked. Special street  
events, such as concerts, change-of-season festivals, amateur art  
sales and contests, and seasonal flower exhibits, increase the in-  
terest and vitality of any urban space. Properly managed, these  
events can be conducted at very little cost through the auspices  
of local garden and art clubs, schools and merchants.  
120 Inventory and Data Collection  
The inventory phase of the planning process requires the col\~  
lection of basic data about the study area, including its physical  
features, land use, and the characteristics of its daily pedestrian  
population. The potential adaptability to change is an important  
underlying objective of these initial land-use studies. This adapta-  
bility may be reflected in the value, condition and type of land  
use, or more importantly, in the interest and enthusiasm of local  
business and property owners. As an illustration of adaptive de-  
velopment, a department store might build a pedestrian con\~  
nection to a transit station, to encourage market exposure to the  
station's pedestrian traffic. Since adaptive development of this  
*type* requires the cooperation of business interests, an active  
liaison with the business community should be developed in the  
earliest stages of all pedestrian planning programs. This liaison  
can provide valuable assistance with the collection of building  
population and employee data. It can also result in valuable sup-  
port for the final implementation of the pedestrian improvement  
program.  
Accurate classification of land use is important because of the  
extreme variability of pedestrian demand and design treatment.  
For example, retail stores have a much different traffic pattern  
and design rationale than do office buildings. Similarly, the de-  
sign treatment of the walkways surrounding a historical site will  
be quite different from that of any other land use. The inventory  
of land use should include the location and classification of all  
buildings, streets, and transportation services. Building classifica\~  
tion includes type of use, total square feet of net usable area,  
estimated building value, building condition, and employee and  
daily transient populations. Hourly transit patronage, and auto  
parking accumulations on streets and in garages, should also be  
determined for the study area. Bus transit cash\~recording tapes,  
turnstile counts, and parking garage check stubs provide tho  
source for much of this data.  
The physical inventory of the study area includes the configura-  
tion and dimensions of each street and sidewalk. Street inventories  
should note all traffic regulations, signs, signal locations and their  
cycle lengths, and vehicular traffic volumes. The sidewalk in\~  
ventory should show the location and dimensions of building and  
transit system entrances, bus stops, and the location of sidewalk  
furniture and other impedimenta that restrict sidewalk efficiency.  
121 Ideally, all pedestrian walking trips, including their origins and  
destinations, trip purposes, time of day, and volumes, should be  
determined. In larger pedestrian networks this information is  
difficult, if not impossible, to obtain, so that combinations of  
various sampling and analytic techniques are used to develop  
this data. These methods include cordon counts, origin and  
destination surveys, pedestrian density surveys by aerial photo-  
graphy, and mathematical modeling.  
**Cordon counts** of pedestrians cannot be obtained with the  
same facility as the classic vehicular surveys, where license plate  
checks, automatic vehicle-counting devices, and street parking and  
garage counts can be used to determine area-wide traffic volumes  
and characteristics. Pedestrian cordon counts generally cover  
smaller areas, and are usually obtained by manual field counting,  
or more recently, by aerial time-lapse photography. The manual  
field count is a simple procedure that can provide much useful  
data. An experienced traffic counter can record one-directional  
flows of up to 10,000, and two-directional flows of up to 2,000,  
pedestrians per hour in each direction if traffic is uniform and  
not severely peaked. With lighter flows under 1,000 pedestrians  
per hour, supplementary information, such as pedestrian age, sex,  
and the origin and destination of nearby trips, may be observed  
and recorded. During light, off-hour pedestrian traffic, observers  
may be stationed on the roof of a tall building, to record pedes-  
trian activity for several buildings or streets.  
Counts should be made on "typical" days, free from the distor-  
tions of weather and other seasonal effects. Unusually hot, cold,  
windy or rainy weather keeps people off the streets, or defers trips  
into the survey area. Special events, holidays, and parades should  
be avoided. Unusual happenings, such as accidents or fires, may  
affect the validity of counts, requiring their postponement. Survey  
personnel should be instructed to record street or sidewalk re-  
pairs, new construction, or any incidents that may temporarily  
divert pedestrians into, or away from, the counting section. ·when  
an area-wide survey is conducted at a series of locations on dif-  
ferent days, it is advisable to set up a control station that is  
counted on each day of the survey. The control station should be  
located at a high-volume section that is a typical barometer of  
activity for the survey area. This allows for some adjustment to  
the station counts for weekday variations.  
Manual field count procedures usually consist of stationing  
survey personnel at approximate mid-block locations, away from  
122 any large traffic generators. Intersection counts are not generally  
conducted in heavy pedestrian traffic areas, because of manpower  
requirements and the difficulties connected with segregating  
heavy comer flows by direction. Standard hand tally recorders  
are used for the count, with the observer tallying passing pedes-  
trians by direction, and then recording the running totals for  
each time interval, usually every five or ten minutes. If significant  
platooning or surging of ped\<;strian flow is observed, due to traffic  
light cycles or transit arrival patterns, shorter counting intervals  
may be desirable to reflect this peaking. Pedestrian totals on the  
hand tally and data sheet are maintained on a cumulative basis,  
with later subtraction to obtain "splits", or time interval counts.  
Short-count methods may be used to reduce the number of field  
personnel required for a large, area-wide survey, particularly dur-  
ing lower volume, off-hour periods. An example of a short counting  
procedure would be counting 12 minutes on one side of the street,  
then 12 minutes on the other, with a 3 minute break to allow for  
movement between counting stations. The short counts are then  
expanded to full half-hour and hourly counts. This system is  
satisfactory where no extreme short peaks are likely to occur. At  
heavy traffic locations it is more desirable to collect more com-  
plete peak-period data.  
Special entrance counts may be made at large traffic generators,  
such as office buildings, theaters and department stores. These  
generator counts may be correlated to net floor area by classifica-  
tion type, and used to develop a pedestrian trip-generation model.  
Field counting a \\vide, heavy-volume section is difficult for a  
single observer, and several strategically placed personnel may be  
required. In these instances chalk markings, sidewalk joints, or  
some other channelizing features of the survey area must be used  
to delineate the counting lanes assigned to the respective person-  
nel. Columns, poles or other vertical separations have been found  
to be most effective for this purpose. vVhere possible, temporary  
stanchions may be erected in heavy counting sections to help  
delineate counting lanes. Recording heavy pedestrian volumes  
is much easier if pedestrians are counted mentally in groups of  
five persons, with one tally recorded for each five. The tally  
count is then expanded afterwards in the data summary.  
There has been some investigation of the possibility of develop-  
ing automatic pedestrian-counting devices, similar to those avail-  
able for vehicular surveys. Electric eyes have been used with  
reasonable effectiveness where pedestrians pass through a single  
123 lane, such as a narrow doorway, but where there are multiple  
pedestrian traffic lanes this system is not practical. A pneumatic  
rubber mat, such as those used to open supermarket doors, has  
been suggested as a means of measuring foot contacts, but this  
method would only provide approximate traffic density ratings,  
which would require calibration into volume data. Ultrasonic and  
radar detection methods have also been suggested.  
Time-lapse photography has been effectively used for pedes-  
trian counting, but usually when detailed study data is required,  
Time-lapse photography has a number of significant advantages\:  
it provides a permanent record that can be referred to again and  
again, to obtain additional data or to illustrate specific conditions  
to other interested parties; it allows a microscopic analysis of flow  
characteristics and direction, often giving insights into unsus-  
pected traffic flow conditions; when used for street surveys, it  
can supply a variety of supplementary data 1 such as vehicle  
counts, pedestrian vehicle interactions, pedestrian accumulations  
at crosswalks, average pedestrian walking speeds at different  
traffic concentrations, effects of weather or other transient con-  
ditions; with a camera speed of one frame each ten seconds, an  
unattended camera can provide a ten-hour sample of traffic condi-  
tions; in some instances, photographic data collection can be done  
using fewer personnel.  
Time-lapse photography requires a movie camera capable of  
single-frame advance, an intervaiometer, the timing device that  
determines the frame interval, and a single-frame advance, or  
"analyst" type of projector. At one time, only relatively expensive  
16 mm and 35 mm time-lapse cameras and projector combinations  
were available. The time intervalometer controlling these cameras  
required either standard electrical current or heavy battery packs  
with electrical convertors. All film had to be hand threaded into  
the camera, preferably in a dark room. Much less expensive, and  
more adaptable, Super-8 mm systems are now available. These  
systems use simple film-cassette loading, and allow camera. re-  
loading in a few seconds. The intervalometer feature has been  
miniaturized, and designed to operate off a few small batteries.  
Inexpensive home movie cameras with the single-frame advance  
feature have also been modified for time-lapse use. These modifi-  
cations are based on the use of a capacitor, or a small synchronous  
motor, to give the time interval, with a connection to a solenoid  
to actuate the single-frame shutter release.  
124 The desirable features of a time-lapse camera for traffic studies  
include\: shutter speed fast enough to stop pedestrian action with-  
out blurring \( 1/30 second or faster\); wide-angle lens to maximize  
dimensions of the study field of view; through-the-lens viewing  
and focusing; frame intervals of one to two frames per second  
for accurate pedestrian counting, and up to one frame each ten  
seconds for traffic surveillance; and provision for supplementary  
film magazine capacity for extended studies.  
Field procedure for time-lapse photography surveys is de-  
pendent on the availability of vantage points high enough to  
provide a view of the study area. In order to conduct a complete  
study of a typical intersection, a vantage point of six stories or  
more in height may be required. It is a worthwhile practice to  
shoot preliminary film footage at prospective survey locations to  
check camera angles and site coverage. Care must be taken to  
establish definitive reference points within the camera's field of  
view, to establish the boundary dimensions and counting lines  
for the survey. These reference points should be of a type that  
will not be obscured when pedestrian traffic fills the study area.  
The selection of the frame interval will depend on the length of  
the camera's field of view, and the type and amount of detail  
required. For detailed studies, or dense pedestrian flow, short  
frame intervals of approximately two frames per second may be  
required. If less detailed low-volume cordon counts are sought,  
the frame interval would be determined by camera field length  
and the time the pedestrian would be in view. For example, with  
a 50-foot field length, a walking pedestrian would be in view for  
about 10 seconds, so that a pedestrian would appear on 4 to 5  
photographic frames with a 2-second frame interval. The time  
interval of the camera should be periodically checked, using a  
stop watch, for possible time variations caused by battery drain.  
A safe practice is to replace batteries frequently, since they arc  
inexpensive. A clock is sometimes placed within the camera's  
field of view to assist in time recording. An outdoor clock may  
be located in the study area, and this can be included in the  
photos.  
Data take-off from time-lapse photography is quite simple,  
and can be done with a minimum of training. However, it is a  
tedious process, and frequent rest periods are advisable. Desk-  
top projection is desirable to simplify data take-off and recording.  
A wall screen projection is adequate, but it requires up-and-down  
125 head movements that disrupt the data take-off. The desk projec-  
tion allows the drawing of guide lines, use of overlays, and other  
aids to define the study area. Desk-top projection can be obtained  
by using a reflecting rear-projection screen or by lens arrange-  
ments. A microfilm viewer has also been used to provide satisfac-  
tory desk-top projection.  
Pedestrian volume counts may be taken off projected photo-  
graphs quickly by establishing a cordon line on the projected  
picture, and advancing the film in single-frame sequences. A hand  
tally is useful for the counting process. The number .. of pedestrians  
crossing the cordon, say in ten frame sequences, is recorded and  
translated into volumes by dividing by the time it took to take  
the original photography. Counting pedestrian accumulations at  
crosswalks is aided by projection on a control grid, the use of  
overlays, and a check-off system.  
Sky Count is an aerial photography data collection method  
adapted from the aerial intelligence techniques used by the  
armed services. It can be used to collect, and permanently record,  
a considerable variety of important transportation and land-use  
data. For example, a single data collection flight over an airport  
can determine parking lot occupancy, length of checkout lines,  
roadway traffic volume, speed and composition, aircraft apron  
occupancy and other incidental data. Sky-Count techniques have  
been used for pedestrian studies in both midtown and downtown  
Manhattan. In addition to supplying data on the concentrations  
of pedestrians on sidewalks, the Sky Count photos included vehic-  
ular traffic density and composition. This data is useful for de-  
termining pedestrian/vehicle interactions. Sky Count data may be  
collected from either a helicopter or a light plane. The operating  
cost of the light plane is smaller, but tall buildings or other flight  
restrictions often curtail its use. A flight pattern is established  
by data requirements and the capabilities of the camera. A series  
of timed, sequentially overlapping photographs is taken over the  
study area. After processing, the photographs are highly magni-  
fied, and the instantaneous pedestrian and vehicle counts are  
obtained. Successive flights show changes in traffic concentra-  
tions during the survey period.  
Figure 6.2 presents a contour plot of pedestrian densities ob-  
tained in a downtown Manhattan Sky-Count survey. In order to  
develop these contours,' data cells were established at the sixty-  
four intersections in the survey area. The population of each of  
these intersections was obtained by counting pedestrians within  
126 a half-block of the intersection on each street. The population  
counts of each intersection were then assigned as point values  
to their respective data cells. Pedestrian populations were segre-  
gated in levels of fifty, and each level was plotted as contours  
on the survey map. The contour analysis map gives the location,  
duration, and magnitude of pedestrian demand in the entire study  
area. The Regional Plan Association of New York has used similar  
Sky-Count data, combined with observed pedestrian trip-genera-  
tion rates\> to develop a mathematical model to predict street  
concentrations of pedestrians, based on land use and other  
variables.  
The Origin and Destination survey is the classic method of  
obtaining transportation trip data. Depending on methodology  
and scope, the survey can determine the socio-economic charac\~  
teristics of the trip maker, his trip frequency, route and purpose.  
It also provides information on modal choice and the location and  
trip-attraction rates of traffic generating centers. Origin and des-  
tination surveys may be conducted by home interview \( either  
in-person or telephone\), by mailed questionnaires, by field dis-  
tribution of questionnaires, with collection at terminal points or  
by postcard mailback, or by selective distribution to controlled  
populations, such as groups of employees at specific buildings.  
Home-interview methods are generally more costly, and are not  
commonly used.  
The postcard mailback survey is the most popular form of  
Origin and Destination survey, because it is convenient and gives  
a reasonably good return if properly publicized by the news  
media. Dimensional control of the sampling populations and  
questionnaire distribution is important since the sample data will  
be expanded and treated as representative of the whole trip  
population. This requires that the total number of persons enter-  
ing the study zone by each transportation mode be accurately  
determined, and that the survey be conducted on a "typical"  
weekday with favorable weather conditions.  
The design of the questionnaire is an important aspect of the  
survey, because it will determine the amount and credibility of  
the returns. Attractive graphic design, with a cheerful, concise,  
and simple explanation of the survey purpose and method, are  
necessary. Questions should be kept to a minimum, and should  
be made simple and direct without ambiguity. The temptation  
to try to obtain large amounts of data vvith a long questionnaire  
should be avoided, since it discourages the completion of the

128 questions and, furthermore, adds to data summarization and com-  
puter coding problems. Since origin and destination returns can  
only be coded for tabulation by the computer into a limited  
number of columns and group classifications, this must be given  
consideration in the questionnaire design.  
Origin and Destination surveys may be supplemented by a selec-  
tive sampling of in-depth interviews, to obtain more specific de-  
tail on the trip maker. As an illustrntion, the Cleveland Downtown  
Agency for Transportation Action, \(DATA\), conducted a series  
of special interviews to determine user perception of the image  
of various districts within the city. The rationale behind these  
interviews was to determine if pe&\~strians were rcluctan t to walk  
in certain areas of the city because of negative image factors.  
Another technique, which is used to increase the scope of the  
data obtained without increasing the number of questions asked,  
is to distribute different types of questionnaires. All primary data  
requests, trip origin and destination, purpose, *etc.* are· the same,  
but the remaining questions on the survey form are varied. Care  
must be taken to maintain dimensional control by recording the  
exact number of each type of questionnaire distributed and re-  
turned. At times, origin and destination surveys may involve only  
specific segments of pedestrian demand. For example, if the  
specific interest was in journey-to-work trips, only persons work-  
ing in the study area might be surveyed. The advantage with this  
procedure is that it can be conducted with the cooperation of  
local businesses, and usually results in very high questionnaire re-  
tum rates.  
The Cleveland DATA origin and destination survey quesiionnairo illustrated on the  
following pages was designed to fold into an envelope size mail-back. Different  
questionnaires, with distinguishing colors, wore issued to auto, bus and transii·  
users, Questionnaires in each group were consecutively numbered to maintain  
dimensional control of survey populations. The questionnaire is unusually extensive  
for this type of survey.

131 Analytical Modeling and Computer Simulation is being in-  
creasingly used in transportation studies because of the com-  
puters capability of handling rapidly, multiple iterations of large  
amounts of data. Standard computer programs are available for  
most of the common techniques. Their application is reasonably  
routine for the experienced programmer, if the proper base data  
is available. The computer synthesis of transportation systems is  
used to\:  
• determine the relative value of the various elements of the  
system, and to test the impact of changes in these values;  
• forecast future system use; and to  
• synthesize existing or theoretical future systems where it is  
not practical or possible to collect sample data.  
A basic axiom of both modeling and forecasting is that large,  
less sensitive, conglomerate inputs generally produce more re-  
liable results. When the inputs are more detailed, and comprised  
of a larger number of more sensitive variables, the results may  
become inconsistent for combinations of reasons that are difficult  
to determine. The model synthesis of transportation systems is  
aided by the fact that transit fares, routes, and trip times arc  
readily determined. Auto trips are more flexible, and operating  
costs less obvious, so the auto trip frequently becomes the most  
difficult to synthesize.  
Pedestrian trips are also likely to show considerable variation  
because of the large number of trip variables. \( See Figure 6.3\).  
During a discussion on the mathematical modeling of pedestrian  
trips, one analyst jokingly stated that the difficulty with the  
pedestrian is that at any instant he may sit down and become a  
non-pedestrian, or leap up suddenly and either walk or run toward  
any point of the compass. This may be a slight exaggeration, but  
it is illustrative of some of the problems connected with modeling  
pedestrian trips. Definitive pedestrian trip linkages, such as jour-  
ney-to-work trips, are more susceptible to synthesis than lunch  
trips, which might also combine shopping, recreation, exercise and  
interest motivations.  
The transient nature of pedestrian trip node and linkage  
combinations also tends to cause problems with some of the  
assumptions that are typically made in mathematical modeling.  
For instance, an office building is a pedestrian trip attractor  
during the morning journey to work, but becomes a trip genera\~  
tor during lunch hours.

133 The base data required for the modeling process will depend  
on the required information output, and the modeling technique  
that is selected. The basic function of the model is to generate  
the proper number and character of pedestrian trips, and to  
assign these trips to the appropriate linkages in the pedestrian  
network. The types of data that have been used as inputs for  
pedestrian model synthesis include\:  
• Total square feet of land use by type and location, and typical  
pedestrian trip generation rates for each classification;  
• Pedestrian income and employment categories;  
• Locations of transit stops, transportation terminals, activity  
centers and points of interest;  
• Sidewalk network distances, topographical configuration and  
traffic impedances;  
• The volume of employee and transient populations in the  
study area by time of day;  
• Typical pedestrian trip purpose, frequency and distance; and  
• Evaluations of user perceptions of interest, security and image  
of various districts ,within the network.  
Techniques that have been used for pedestrian studies include\:  
Gravity Models-based on the respective trip attraction and gen-  
eration rates of specific districts or nodes, allocated according to  
an inverse square relationship with the separation of these dis-  
tricts in time, distance and other impedance factors.  
Multiple Correlation-an empirical equation derived by the  
statistical fitting of a number of significant variables.  
Computer Simulation-based on computer-generated trips of spe-  
cific characteristics assigned to a computer-defined network.  
The Gravity Model technique has been used in a study of the  
Central Business District of Toronto, Canada, to predict journey-  
to-work and lunch-hour pedestrian circulation demands. The  
data input for the model was obtained by means of an office-  
based questionnaire survey, using a street map of the CBD as a  
guide. The CBD pedestrian ways were coded into a network of  
centroids, comprised of transportation and office space nodes.  
The inputs to the gravity model were the generation and attrac-  
tion rates of office and transportation zones, friction factor rat-  
ings, and minimum-path walking trees between nodes. Minimum  
paths were calibrated on the basis of walking time, waiting time  
at street intersections, street attractiveness, and a turn penalty.  
The model showed reasonable agreement with observed pedes-  
trian demands at counting lines in the network.  
134 The Multiple Correlation technique has been used by the  
Regional Plan Association of New York and the Cleveland DAT A  
study. The Regional Plan Association studies developed equations  
for predicting the number of pedestrians in any block sector based  
on the area in thousands of square feet of walkway, office, retail,  
and restaurant space in that sector, and the distance from the  
sector node to the nearest transit entrance in feet. RPA derived  
different equations for streets and avenues, and for midday and  
evening pedestrian concentrations. The data input for the mul-  
tiple correlation was based on counts of pedestrian generation  
rates at selected office, retail and restaurant activity centers, in-  
ventories of area-wide pedestrian concentrations based on an  
aerial photography Sky-Count survey, and classification of land  
use in each block sector.  
The Cleveland DAT A study used information obtained from  
an origin-and-destination survey and user perception interviews.  
The user perception interviews determined individual subjective  
evaluations of such factors as cleanliness, interest value, and image  
identification, of different sections of the city, The DATA model  
incorporated measures of satisfying trip needs at one destination  
as opposed to another, relative costs of different modes and com-  
binations of modes, the numbers of different personal trip types  
between node points, and the spacial separation and impedances  
between nodes. One of the values of the multiple correlation  
technique is that it provides a method of testing the sensitivity of  
pedestrian activity to changes in one or any combination of these  
variables. The Cleveland model for example, allows for an evalua-  
tion of the impact of improving the user image of various districts  
within the CBD. This would be useful in a cost-benefit analysis  
to determine the relative value of such improvements.  
Computer Simulation has been used for a number of small-  
.scale pedestrian study applications, such as planning elevator  
service for an office building, estimating pedestrian facility de-  
mands caused by the landing of a Boeing 747, and for trip assign-  
ment to small pedestrian networks. Larger network applications  
have not been attempted, primari1y because more complicated  
systems involving many trips may consume significant amounts  
of computer time. However, the simulation method is a simple  
and straightforward technique which is easily understood. Trip-  
maker characteristics, such as trip purpose, frequency and length,  
along with network characteristics, are stored in the computer.  
135 The computer is then programmed to select a trip randomly,  
assigning specific characteristics to the trip maker on a proba-  
bilistic basis. The trip maker is then put into the trip network,  
advancing through it until all trip requirements are satisfied.  
Improvement Programs for Pedestrians  
Improvement programs may range from a basic program with  
very little capital expenditure, to a major program involving a  
complex and costly grade-separated network. Regardless of the  
type of program, community involvement and definitive govern-  
ment action is a prerequisite for success. Guidelines for different  
types of programs are provided in this section, but the final pro-  
gram for any community will depend on its own individual needs  
and resources. For purposes of discussion, improvement programs  
have been classified under separate headings, but each could be  
developed in varying degrees or combined with each other. The  
general program classifications include\: Basic Improvement Pro-  
grams, Pedestrian Malls, Staggered Work Hours, Bonus Zoning,  
and finally the Major System Program. The Elements of a Basic  
Improvement Program would be the upgrading of pedestrian  
safety, street lighting, pedestrian circulation, area image, and  
pedestrian amenities. Pedestrian safety programs concentrate  
on the three "E's"; Education, Engineering and Enforcement.  
Safety education is especially directed towards the most accident  
prone segments of the public, the old and the young. Special  
educational programs are instituted at schools and church and  
senior citizens' group meetings. Local news media will usually  
cooperate by providing advertising space, special feature stories,  
or television and radio spots. The American Automobile Associa-  
tion provides advice and special educational materials for such  
programs.  
Engineering for pedestrian safety involves the provision of  
physical improvements to reduce pedestrian accident exposure.  
This would include standardization of signs and signals, distinc-  
tive crosswalk delineation particularly aimed at driver recognition  
of crosswalk zones, improving motorist lines of sight, upgraded  
street lighting\> and any other physical features that contribute  
to pedestrian safety. Enforcement involves the development and  
implementation of legislation that protects the pedestrian, and  
that is uniformly recognized by both pedestrian and motorist  
alike.  
136 Street lighting is an important aspect of urban design contrib-  
uting to pedestrian security, safety and favorable perception of  
the urban image. The three-fold increase in the incidence rate of  
pedestrian accidents at night cited in Chapter One, is directly  
attributable to reduced visibility after dark. Accident and crime  
rates invariably decline following the installation of improved  
street lighting. Surveys of a number of cities instituting street-  
lighting improvements showed a 10 to 44 per cent reduction in  
all types of highway accidents and a much larger 30 to 80 per  
cent reduction in pedestrian accidents. In a recent survey of l,.'300  
police officials, 8,5 per cent reported a drop in local crime rates  
after street-lighting improvements. Half of this group described  
decreases of as much as 50 per cent. In one reported instance, a  
new street-lighting system resulted in a 70 per cent drop in crimi-  
nal assaults, and a 60 per cent drop in robberies. One small town,  
with a population of 9,000 estimated that its better lighting wns  
equal to the crime-deterrent value of adding four new police of-  
ficers.  
In addition to its safety and security value, lighting can he used  
to improve the pedestrian's perception of an urban space. Build-  
ing facades, fountains and other attractive natural or architectural  
features may be floodlit to improve their appearance at night.  
Colored lighting can provide added visual variety. In recognition  
of the value of lighting, many cities have been upgrading their  
standards. Recommended minimums for downtown areas have  
been between 3 and 4 average horizontal foot-candles, \( lumens  
per square foot\). 'Washington, D.C., installed a high-intensity  
system in a high crime rate section, raising light levels to eleven  
foot-candles. Cleveland, Ohio quadrupled lighting levels to 8 foot-  
candles on two miles of its downtown streets in a program to  
improve their irnage and security. \\Vilmington, Delaware, up-  
graded a 96-block section of its downtown area to 10 foot-candles  
average, and the program ,vas wholeheartedly accepted by the  
public and business community.  
Pedestrian Circulation can be improved by sidewalk widen-  
ings, building setbacks and arcades, pedestrian connectors bisect-  
ing long blocks, proper location of street furniture, restrictions on  
cross-sidewalk freight operations, and traffic signalization timed  
for pedestrians rather than for auto traffic. The circulation irn-  
provement program begins with an inventory of sidewalk condi-•  
tions in the project area, including the dimensions and locations  
of all permanent and movable sidewalk fixtures. The inventory  
137 may be supplemented by pedestrian volume counts to pinpoint  
critical sidewalk sections. \:tvlovable items, such as newsstands,  
telephone booths, mail boxes, and planters, should be relocated  
immediately if they are found to be constricting flow. Permanent  
fixtures, such as traffic signals and hydrants, may be moved on  
a long-term replacement program. An important aspect of the  
implementation of this program is to control the future location  
of these items through municipal standards and permit pro-  
cedures.  
**Area Image ancl Aesthetics** are important objectives of a basic  
improvement program. !\\fodular design of municipal street furni-  
ture and street signs can provide significant improvements in  
the downtown image. A number of towns have instituted new  
ordinances to control the size and location of advertising signs  
to reduce the sign clutter that plagues many cities. ,vhether  
by municipal ordinances or on a voluntary basis, downtown  
merchants should *be* convinced that the general image of the  
CBD is a more important business factor than large garish signs.  
An aesthetic audit by a selected group of local artists and archi-  
tects will pinpoint many of the more glaring violations of aesthetic  
design. Such a group can develop guidelines for aesthetic im-  
provements within the framework of the existing urban structure.  
Aesthetic improvements may also involve restoration of buildings  
with distinctive architectural features or historical significance,  
additions of landscaping, creating small parks or plazas on unused  
lots, variations in sidewalk pavement colors and textures, varia-  
tions in lighting, and cultural innovations such ns downtown art  
exhibits or concerts.  
**Pedestrian amenities** include the provision of bus shelters,  
covered arcades, benches and special design features for the  
handicapped. Ramped curbs assist the elderly, women with baby  
carriages and persons in wheel chairs. The elderly are specially  
appreciative of small "vest pocket" parks containing benches ar-  
ranged in a way that is conducive to conversation. If possible,  
the orientation of these small parks should be based on wind  
protection and maximum exposure to the sun. "'here possible,  
tactile trails should be instituted to assist the blind. The Botanical  
Gardens in Brooklyn, New York, maintains special "touch and  
smell" flower exhibits for the blind, with plant descriptions in  
braille. All public buildings and park facilities should be made  
completely accessible to the handicapped, to avoid disenfran-  
138 Street lighting improvements upgrade area image and result in reductions in crime  
and pedestrian accidents.  
Improved pedestrian circulation can be obtained at very little capital expense by  
relocating movable sidewalk impedimenta.  
139 chising them from their citizens' rights of equal access to these  
facilities.  
Pedestrian Malls are special street-grade pedestrian precincts,  
in which vehicular intrusion has either been reduced or elimi-  
nated. In many respects, the pedestrian mall is the modern equiv-  
alent of the medieval plaza, with the most successful malls  
duplicating the qualities of human interest, interaction and com-  
munication provided by the plaza. Because of the simplicity and  
small expense of closing streets, many cities have been experi-  
menting with the creation of downtown pedestrian malls. The  
most successful of these experiments have concentrated on adding  
new features for human interest and convenience. Attractive land-  
scaping, colorful pavement, statuary, children's play areas, and  
even aquariums and aviaries have been used to generate excite-  
ment and an improved image. City, state and federal assistance  
has partially funded many of these developments, with abutting  
property O\\vners assessed for the balance. Successful malls have  
returned the assessment in the form of increased sales. Their  
most important impacts have been the revitalization of the city  
center, the halting of urban deterioration, and the revival of the  
core as a place of human interest and interaction.  
The least successful n1all experiments have not concentrated on  
providing human interest within the mall tlrea, but have just  
blocked out traffic. Others have tried malls on a halfway basis,  
only partially blocking traffic, or not supplying adequate and  
convenient parking or transit access. The successful mall program  
must be conceived as a total system improvement which focludes\:  
• complete exclusion of all but emergency vehicles from the  
mall area;  
• development of an adequate perimeter street system to re-  
place street circulation and capacity lost by the closing;  
• provision of adequate peripheral access for transit, private  
autos, emergency and service vehicles;  
0 provision of adequate nearby parking, sufficient to replace  
all spaces lost by the street closing, plus additional parking  
generated by the mall;  
• clcvrloprncnt of a cooperative promotional program based on  
building improvements, aesthetic landscaping, increased  
lighting, pedestrian amenities, coordinated advertising and  
special evrnts.  
140 The famous Lijnbaan, Rotterdam, Holland, a pedestrian mall that includes shopping,  
office and residential developments, with auto parking around its perimeter.  
A proposal for a continuous pedestrian mall and people-mover system.  
141 The types of pedestrian precincts which have been classified  
as malls are the following\:  
• **Service street or** transitway-limited-access street where cross-  
street traffic is allowed, but through traffic is limited to transit  
buses and emergency vehicles only. If service cannot be provided  
through rear lots, commercial vehicles must enter and leave the  
system by the nearest cross street. Sidewalk widening, crosswalk  
improvements, increased lighting levels and other amenities are  
added to improve the pedestrian environment. This is not a true  
mall, but it results in improvements in transit running times and  
Teduced pedestrian conflicts.  
• Interrupted mall-exclusive pedestrian street sections where  
cross traffic is allowed, but no vehicles are permitted on the mall  
sections except for emergencies. Sidewalks may be eliminated and  
exclusive pedestrian plazas are provided between cross streets.  
Service by commercial vehicles is through rear lots, or by cross-  
street access only.  
• Continuous mall-an exclusive pedestrian street with no cross-  
street traffic, and provision for only emergency vehicles on the  
mall. Service is by commercial vehicles through rear lots or side  
streets only.  
Staggered work hours-This is a concept that has evolved from  
the desire to reduce the severe travel peaking that occurs in  
central business districts due to the common work schedules of  
their daytime populations. Through the simple expedient of vary-  
ing starting and quitting times, severe peaks are diminished,  
reducing pedestrian crowding in buildings, on streets, and in  
transit facilities. The reduction of these severe peaks not only  
relieves pedestrian crowding, but results in more balanced utiliza-  
tion of transit equipment. Business activities, such as printing, also  
1·eport increased productivity, due to the longer machine-time  
resulting from overlapping work schedules. The most extensive  
staggered work hours program was instituted in the Financial  
District of downtown Manhattan, New York. Sponsored by the  
Downtown Lower Manhattan Association and the Port of New  
York Authority, the one-square-mile area involved in the program  
has a daytime employee population of about 450,000 persons.  
Almost all of these employees were on a 9-to-5 work schedule,  
with approximately two-thirds of them arriving during the peak  
15-minute period of 9\:00 to 9\: 14 A.M., and leaving between  
,5\:00 and 5\: 14 P.M. In the spring of 1970, 50,000 ernployees of  
142 some 50 public and private organizations voluntarily changed to  
an earlier work schedule. A previous pilot study had revealed  
that no serious employee objections would be raised with a half-  
hour earlier or later change in work schedules, but that the  
earlier schedule had proved more acceptable to both staff and  
supervisory personnel. The earlier work schedules produced imme-  
diate results, with perceivable reductions in crowding in elevators,  
building lobbies and on rapid transit trains. \( See Figure 6.4\). A  
staggered work *week* has been suggested by some planners as a  
means of reducing urban congestion and improving the quality  
of life. The staggered work week would not only relieve crowding  
on streets, highways and transit facilities, but in over-burdened  
recreational areas as well.

143 Bonus zoning-a number of cities in the United States have  
instituted bonus provisions in their zoning ordinances, which  
trade added development rights in exchange for the construction  
of desirable pedestrian improvements which otherwise might not  
be economically feasible for the developer. Because bonus provi-  
sions are not mandatory, they must *be* conceived to provide an  
incentive system which is fair, and conducive to coordination  
of combined public and private interests. The bonus generally  
offered the developer consists of adding a specific number of  
square feet to the allowable building area for each pedestrian im-  
provement unit, such as an added building or subway entrance.  
Another method is to increase the floor area ratios by enlarging  
the effective lot size, or F.A.R. coverage, in some direct propor-  
tion to the area in square feet of the pedestrian plaza, mall or  
arcade. New York City is using a broad bonus zoning concept to  
preserve and promote its famous theater district. A special theater  
zone has been defined with the goals of protection and promotion  
of the character of the theater district; improving its pedestrian  
traffic circulation; fostering development of business and employ-  
ment; providing freedom of architectural design; and providing  
more economic, multi-purpose construction.  
The types of amenities for which development bonuses are be-  
ing awarded include special uses, such as theater and historical  
districts, pedestrian traffic and circulation improvements and open  
space, and aesthetic enhancement. Pedestrian traffic and circula-  
tion improvements include sidewalk widening, multiple building  
entrances, access to transit or parking garages, sub-surface con-  
*course* or overhead bridge connections to other buildings or transit  
facilities, arcades, malls, plazas, off-street taxi and bus passenger  
loading areas, off-street truck berths, and shortening walking  
distance by mid-block connectors. The disadvantage of the bonus  
system stems from the lack of mandatory compliance, which re-  
sults in spot, rather than continuous, system-wide improvements,  
and that sometimes they result in developments with questionable  
utility. For example, some pedestrian plazas are raised or enclosed  
in such a way as to limit their use for pedestrian circulation. The  
successful implementation of a bonus program that provides sys-  
tem-wide, rather than isolated spot benefits, is dependent on a  
well-planned and administered "carrot and stick" policy by local  
government.  
144 The Major System Program represents a substantial commit-  
ment by the community and local planning and development  
agencies to promote a comprehensive pedestrian improvement  
system involving substantial capital investment. Examples of these  
developments, such as the elevated systems in London, Cincin-  
nati, and Minneapolis, and the underground systems in Montreal  
and Toronto, are discussed in greater detail in Chapter Eight. In  
most instances, these developments started on a modest, localized  
basis, but spread rapidly as system advantages were realized. The  
Montreal complex began in 1962, with construction of the Place  
Ville-Marie shopping center. Initially, an underground linkage  
was provided from a below-grade shopping mall to an office  
building and railway station. Subsequent additions to the two-  
mile system were made as new building and transit stations were  
developed.  
The London Barbican, adjacent to the heart of London's fi-  
nancial district, began with the redevelopment of a site that was  
devasted by World War II bombing. The important aspects of  
all these major system programs are\:  
0 recognition of the importance of pedestrian circulation and  
amenities;  
alertness to every possible form of development opportunity;  
concentration on all the planning improvement objectives  
and goals discussed in this chapter;  
@ commitment to implement a substantial and continuing pro\~  
gram.  
145 Chapter  
DESIGN  
The design of pedestrian spaces involves the attainment of the  
qualitative goals and objectives established in the preliminary  
plan, through the application of the service standards, pedestrian  
traffic relationships, and human characteristics contained in pre-  
ceding chapters. A schematic of the clements of the pedestrian  
design process is given in Figure 7.1. The discussion will follow  
this schematic with varying degrees of amplification. The service  
standards and observations of the human characteristics of pedes-  
trians contained in the previous chapters may be applied to a  
wide range of design situations. The purpose of this chapter is  
to introduce the designer to a number of these potential applica-  
tions through the discussion, and by several numerical examples.  
Pedestrian Demand  
The ultimate design quality of a pedestrian space will depend  
upon its suitability and adaptability to the demands placed upon  
it. Demand is comprised of estimates of user traffic volumes,  
traffic patterns, and composition. These factors will vary accord-  
ing to land use, and each type may require different estimating  
procedures. The building and visitor populations of commercial  
buildings are estimated on the basis of the net usable square feet  
of building space. The population estimate is derived from the  
observed use of comparable types of space in the building locale.  
In large developments, where tenants may have lease commit-  
ments far in advance of final design, they will usually cooperate  
by providing estimates of building space occupancy, and also in  
conducting detailed surveys of the typical traffic patterns of their  
staff and visitors. Different types of commercial building uses  
necessarily produce different employee and visitor space ratios  
and traffic patterns. The main executive offices of a large corpora-  
tion would have high per-person area occupancies, low visitor  
ratios, and less definitive traffic peaks. A service business may  
have low area occupancies for employee working stations, and  
a high visitor ratio. Retail stores would be characterized by large  
per-employee building areas, and very high visitor ratios. Traffic  
patterns also vary in different commercial building uses. A diversi-  
fied-usage commercial building will have a 5-rninute starting,  
147 quitting and lunch-time peak of 10 to 12 per cent of the building  
population. In a single-purpose commercial building, the 5-minute  
peak at these times may be as high as 15 to 20 per cent of the  
building population. Staggered work schedules, and the presence  
of in-house eating facilities, can lessen the severity of the peaks  
and provide more favorable levels-of-service.  
User populations for theater and sports stadiums are directly  
related to the number of seats provided. Other factors involved  
in the design of these facilities include the adequacy of waiting  
areas, overlapping traffic pattems due to consecutive perform-  
ances, and crowd control and dispersal. The traffic pattem of  
these facilities is unique, in that virtually all of the users wish  
*to* depart the instant the performance or event is completed. This  
immediately taxes most pedestrian facilities beyond their capacity,  
causing delay and inconvenience. However, the tolerance level of  
pedestrians in such situations has been observed to be high. In  
designing the ancient coliseums, the Romans provided wide, open  
areas, or "vomitoriums," outside the Coliseum gates to absorb  
crowd impact and to act as an aid in the dispersal of the departing  
throngs. This systems approach is often overlooked in the design  
of modem pedestrian facilities.  
The user volumes and traffic patterns of transportation facilities  
is usually based on a traffic forecast for some future design year.  
Forecasting the future of any activity is naturally beset with many  
potential pitfalls. The designer is encouraged to make his plans as  
flexible as possible to accommodate unforeseen variations in traf-  
fic or for unexpected demands and potential expansion beyond  
the initial design requirements. The typical traffic forecast is  
determined by a projection of past growth trends, extrapolated  
into the future. The designer must have a complete understanding  
of all the components that comprise the forecast, to assure that  
his design provides a high standard of service for all traffic varia-  
tions that are likely to occur.  
Some transportation facilities are subjected to high seasonal  
peak demands. For example, a long-haul bus terminal in a metro-  
politan region will have its peak traffic demands concentrated on  
summer Fridays. Fourth of July and Labor Day weekends cause  
unprecedented demands on this type of facility, taxing it to the  
limit of human comfort and convenience. This peak seasonality  
might not be apparent from a forecast based entirely on annual  
growth rates. It is also possible for the peak design period to grow  
at a different rate than that shown by the annual forecast. The

149 prospects for changing demand characteristics due to technolog-  
ical or regional changes must also be considered. The advent of  
the Boeing 747, with its transit-like volumes of deplaning pas-  
sengers, is an obvious example of technological change. A not-so-  
obvious example is the changing operating characteristics of sub-  
urban bus routes, as the routes are extended into less dense com-  
munities. These longer routes characteristically have longer bus  
loading times, and therefore will usually require increased bus  
# berth space.  
Traffic composition is an important demand characteristic. Com-  
muters that are repetitive users of the same transportation facility  
are likely to be more knowledgeable, younger in average age,  
and more agile, than the general population. They are also  
more likely to accept lower standards of service- for short-term  
periods. Long-distance bus and air travellers, on the average, will  
be composed of less knowledgeable pedestrians, with greater  
proportions of the very young, the very old and the handicapped.  
Similar comparisons may be drawn between office-building and  
shopping-center populations. When traffic is composed of pe-  
destrians that are likely to have orientation difficulties, higher  
standards of design, plus increased attention to system coherence\>  
are dictated.  
Application of Service Standards  
The service standards in Chapter Five represent definitive verbal  
and pictorial descriptions of the qualitative aspects of various  
levels of pedestrian concentrations on walkways, stairways and  
queuing spaces. The service standards provide a means of either  
evaluating the design quality of existing facilities, or of forming  
the basis for the qualitative design of new facilities. The designer  
was cautioned that the standards are no substitute for judgement.  
To apply the standards intelligently, the type of facility must be  
established, its particular traffic characteristics fully understood,  
and all economic and space restraints determined. For example,  
it is not realistic *to* assume a level-of-service "A" design for a  
stadium exit when it is known that this exit will be instantly  
subjected to capacity, or "E", service levels in actual use. System  
clearance times, developed arithmetically, or graphically through  
the time-space diagram technique, are the desired measure of  
service in such situations.  
The designer must also adjust the design section's effective  
width and effective traffic flow, in such a way that they are truly

151 representative of the type of situation depicted by the standard.  
This involves subtracting space for such disruptive elements as  
columns and sidewalk furniture, or making adjustments for inter-  
ruptions of flow caused by traffic light signals or transit arrival  
patterns. As an illustration, it is possible that service-level area  
requirements may be expanded by as much as four times the  
established standard, to account for sidewalk width adjustments  
for walkway impediments and flow adjustments for traffic light  
cycles. The designer is also directed to look carefully for the  
potential weak links in the system, as the true test of design  
quality. Crosswalk conditions provide a more significant test of  
street network quality than a midblock location where traffic is  
stretched out and relatively free-flowing.  
Economic and space restraints must receive due consideration.  
It is unrealistic to insist upon the highest service standards if  
the available physical space or financial resources are not suf-  
ficient to accommodate the design. A much better approach is to  
recognize the difficulties enforced by such restraints, and to seek  
alternative design solutions or operating procedures that will  
alleviate them. The one overriding consideration that precludes  
acceptance of economic or space restraints is pedestrian safety.  
System Requirements  
An optimal space design may be described as the best func-  
tional space envelope that most economically and efficiently ac-  
commodates the process or processes that occur within it. This  
relationship of function to design has sometimes been called  
"systems design", or the "systems approach". Its fundamental  
premise is that a thorough, detailed knowledge of system require-  
ments leads to the most productive design. There is a good deal  
of logic to this premise, and, therefore, the systems approach is  
recommended for all pedestrian design problems. The approach  
begins with a detailed description of the system process in the  
form of a schematic diagram, or flow chart. The flow chart is  
supplemented with as much detail as possible that is relevant to  
the design decision process. If the system is· 1arge, it should be  
broken down into smaller sub-systems. Properly done, the system  
diagram becomes an invaluable reference throughout the project.  
It becomes the designer's checklist, and a constant reminder of  
the interrelationship of the various functional elements of the  
project. It also establishes a common understanding and rationale  
for all design disciplines, helping to reduce counter-productive  
effort.  
152 Traffi.c light cycles concentrate pedestrian flow into denser platoons.  
Deductions of disruptive traffic elements are required to determine effective side-  
walk width.  
153 Figure 7.2 is a system diagram for the design of a subway  
transit platform. This type of system may be considered rather  
small and limited, and not worth detailing in this manner. How-  
ever, it should be remembered that a facility of this type is used  
by thousands of persons each day, and is expected to have a  
useful life of fifty years or more. It is worth the few hours required  
to think the system through, to determine the important elements  
of its design, and their individual relationship with each other.  
An illustrative example applying some of the factors detailed on  
this diagram is also contained in this chapter.  
After system requirements have been described schematically,  
they should be described quantitatively. Often this can be done  
following the same basic format and sequence as the system de-  
scription. Pedestrian volumes can be scaled to size and plotted  
graphically, to illustrate volume and direction. Pedestrian walking  
times, distances, and waiting and service times can also be en-  
tered on this diagram. The quantitative data, combined with  
directional and time relationships, is used to develop preliminary  
size and space configurations. At this stage of design, the plan  
may be ve1y flexible, due to relatively few restraints, or it may be  
locked in by a more rigid set of restraints. If there are few re-  
straints, then a large number of alternative plans may be de-  
veloped. Projects with rigid restraints naturally produce fewer  
viable alternatives, which sometimes simplifies and shortens the  
design process. At times, restraints may be artificially set up on  
an administrative level, in an attempt to attain this objective. If  
these restraints are well thought out, and developed with the full  
knowledge and consent of the designer, they may be justified.  
OthGrwise, they may act as a deterrent to creative and inno-  
vative solutions. The plan evaluation process must be a systematic  
process in which the advantages and disadvantages of each alter-  
native is carefully assessed. This assessment is considered an im-  
portant element of the creative process. The critique of even a  
bad plan can lead to the determination of the desirable features  
of a good plan. The development apd evaluation process of alter-  
native plans can be aided by various shortcuts.  
One technique that is useful in plan synthesis and evaluation  
is to draw all stationary physical restraints, say building lines, on  
a base plan, and to cut out color-coded templates of all movable  
elements, say escalators, and shift them around the plan until a  
workable combination is developed. This process can be aided  
by mounting the base plan on a magnetic board, and affixing

on a screen and critiqued by the inter-disciplinary interest group.  
The most promising plans are formally drafted. Computer-aided  
design is being used increasingly to optimize plans based on pre-  
progrnmmed restraints, the space requirements of various plan-  
ning elements, and a weighting of desirable plan features and  
functional interrelationships. The computer will then develop an  
optimal machine solution based on these weights. Varying the  
weights produces alternative solutions.  
Functional Elements of Building Space Design  
The functional elements of the pedestrian traffic design of  
buildings are entrances, corridors, stairs, pedmovers, waiting spaces  
and directional signs. The system coherence of these elements  
is an important aspect of building design. Negotiating a building  
system is very much like a learning process. The repetitive user  
comprehends its configuration after a few trials, but the first-time,  
or infrequent, user will face difficulties if the visual components  
of the space are incoherent. Building configuration should be  
logical, containing simple, direct architectural statements that  
visually convey direction, orientation, and purpose to the user.  
A confused visual design statement cannot be solved by the addi-  
tion of directional signing. Signing should be conceived as a  
supplementary visual aid that confirms the architectural state-  
ment rather than deciphers it.  
Poor visual design statements are particularly undesirable in  
transportation terminal environments, where pedestrians are likely  
to be anxious to meet train or plane schedules, and thus are more  
easily confused and disoriented. Figure 7.3 is a somewhat exag-  
gerated comparison of confused and simplified visual design, but  
it illustrates how incoherent design increases the need for ex-  
planatory signing, further confusing the pedestrian with multiple  
visual inputs, and lessening individual sign effectiveness. Simpli\~  
fied visual design statements do not reduce the potential for  
architectural variety. Variety can be obtained through variations  
in shapes, colors, textures, and other sensory inputs. It is worth  
reiterating that a pedestrian who is confused by incoherent space  
design is not receptive to supplementary aesthetic visual inputs.  
When the main concern is orientation, aesthetic input is relegated  
to a lower level of receptivity.

157 Entrances separate and control the use of building space. Doors  
are used for security and to provide climate control. Doors may  
also be used as traffic control devices, to meter\> directionalize, or  
channelize pedestrian flow. The Paris *Metro* has an installation  
of this type at its Montparnasse Station. Automatically actuated,  
one-way swinging doors separate entering and exiting pedestrians,  
to prevent conflicts between opposing traffic streams, Turnstiles  
are used as pedestrian-registering and revenue-control devices.  
The air curtain represents a departure from the control aspect of  
entranceways. Air curtains are used to visually integrate, rather  
than separate, adjoining spaces. Air curtains have the advantage  
that they provide for the free movement of the physically handi-  
capped, or pedestrians with packages and other encumbrances.  
The inconveniences of door opening can also be eliminated by  
the use of mechanical door-opening devices actuated by pneu-  
matic mats, treadles, or other types of switches. The speed of  
response of these automatic doors should be taken into considera-  
tion when they are used at heavy traffic locations. Also, the  
automatically actuated door should be capable of manual open-  
ing, in case of mechanical failure.  
As discussed in Chapter Three, the design of doorways and tum-  
stiles is based on the time needed to perform the activity of  
opening of the door or the registering of the turnstile, combined  
with an evaluation of the traffic composition and headways, or  
time separations, between approaching pedestrians. When traffic  
is composed of a large percentage of slower-reacting older pedes-  
trians, or shoppers encumbered by packages, longer door-opening  
times must be assumed. If possible, doors should be set back from  
the walkway for both pedestrian traffic and safety purposes. A  
door that opens onto an active walkway is a potential accident  
hazard. Queuing space should be provided at the approaches to  
doorways\> since even well-designed entranceways are likely to  
generate occasional queuing.  
Sample Problem-Building Entrance Design  
An office building developer desires to maintain level-of-service B  
design quality during peak pedestrian traffic periods. On the basis of  
net usable building area, space occupancy factors, and comparable  
building traffic patterns, the expected 5-minute peak exiting flow is 500  
pedestrians. The architect has selected a balanced, free-swinging door  
that requires little effort to open. Maximum door opening and clearance  
time by an elderly pedestrian with packages has been observed to be  
2.1 seconds. Find the number of doors, and the approach corridor width,  
to maintain an average level of service B design quality.  
158 Solution  
Level of service *B* is defined as a flow range of 4 to 7 pedestrians per  
foot width per minute \(PFM\). The upper level of the range is selected  
as representative of office worker traffic, because such persons are likely  
to be repeat users, generally younger, and more agile. The distance  
between door jambs is 3 feet, 6 inches, and this will be assumed to be  
equivalent to a pedestrian lane width.  
1. Pedestrian flow per door at service level B\:  
3.5 Ft. x 7 PFM = 25 Peds/min

\(\) Add 2-foot-wide standing and door-opening lane, each side of  
corridor  
17.5 + 4 = 21.5 feet; use 22-foot Minimum Corridor Width  
Corridors and Stairs-corridors and stairs are two of the primary  
traffic elements of building design. The corridor dominates the  
space configuration because it is the axis of pedestrian movement  
and communication. The corridor is the unifying traffic and visual  
linkage between the various functional elements comprising the  
space, providing the pedestrian with his sense of orientation and  
direction. Corridor widths are determined on the basis of traffic  
density, and the types of activity that will occur within the cor-  
ridor space, along the edges that define it, or at its end-points, or  
nodes. Narrow, light-traffic service corridors may be dimensioned  
simply on the basis of human shoulder widths, and door opening  
requirements.  
Some designers become intrigued with the visual impact of  
large-scale spaces, and may attempt to obtain this objective  
through the use of a wide corridor. This tends to reduce the unify-  
ing effects of a corridor, reducing visual impact and the definition  
of its edge clements, making the pedestrian path less definitive  
and communicative. Although minimum corridor widths may be  
determined by building codes, or pedestrian traffic volumes, no  
guidelines have been established for the maximum widths of cor-  
ridors. A corridor that requires a high amount of visual communi-  
159 cation and interaction with its edge elements, such as in a shopping  
center, should have its maximum width dictated by human sight  
characteristics. As discussed in Chapter Two, beyond a distance of  
25 feet the ability to distinguish detail is significantly diminished.  
This suggests that the maximum corridor width for shopping  
center applications should be in the 30- to 40-foot range, assuming  
the pedestrian walks 5 to 10 feet from the edge. A corridor this  
wide has a large pedestrian traffic capability, it can comfortably  
accommodate 10,000 bi-directional pedestrians an hour, and it  
could handle up to 4 to 5 times this volume if required.  
The determination of the traffic capacity of corridors should be  
based on the net effective width, with appropriate deductions for  
window shopping space, column projections and other traffic  
obstructions. Although a corridor may be adequate for free-flow  
traffic, it is sometimes called upon to act as a large pedestrian  
holding area, or queuing space. This can occur in a transportation  
terminal when there is a disruption of service. Corridors that have  
the potential for this type of demand should be evaluated in terms  
of their maximum safe, and comfortable levels of pedestrian hold-  
ing capacity.  
As repeatedly emphasized in this text, stairs require sp.ecial  
attention from the designer. The effectiveness of narrow stairs  
is very closely related to human shoulder width, and body  
sway requirements. Even a low-volume traffic movement in the  
opposite direction \~an reduce the effective traffic capacity of a  
narrow stair by half. Stairs should preferably be designed in  
lane-width multiples of 30 inches. Their traffic demand should be  
carefully analyzed in terms of direction and volume.  
Because of their visual and traffic characteristics, stairs must  
be carefully located. The vertical projection of a flight of stairs  
may obstruct lines of sight to other visual elements of the space.  
Stairs should not be bidden for this reason. A stair represents a  
traffic node, and must be located in a manner that communicates  
direction to the pedestrian seeking an upper or lower floor. Stair  
location and approaches should also be designed to allow for  
pedestrian queuing, and to avoid conflict vvith other traffic streams  
or pedestrian facilities.  
Sample Problem-Terminal Concourse Design  
Based on forecasts of future passenger demand and traffic patterns,  
a commuter transportation terminal is estimated to have a 15-minute  
design peak of 5,000 passengers. During the peak 15 minutes, a short,  
5-minute micro-peak, or "peak-within-the-peak", is expected to occur,  
160 which is estimated to be 50 per cent higher than the average for the  
design period.  
Based on the estimated demand, determine the number of entrance  
doors, the dimensions of the main access corridor, and the number and  
size of stairwavs to serve a second concourse level. In addition, evalu-  
ate both the impact of a complete service stoppage during the design  
period, and the effect of the micro-peak on level of service.  
# Solution  
Commuter transportation terminals are subject to recurrent peaks  
of severe, but rather short, duration. Generally they are designed for  
the recurring 15-minute peak, but the consequences of surges within  
the peak should be considered. Because the peaks are of high volumes,  
space is usually restricted, but their short duration and the fact that  
the users have knovv1Iedge of the facility justify the assumption of lower  
levels-of-service.  
Level-of-Service C would be representative of reasonable design for a  
facility of this type. Traffic flows for this design level are\: \(see Chapter  
Four\)  
Entrances and corridors\: 10-15 PFM  
Stairs .............. \: 7-10 PFM  
Because the users are commuters, the higher value of the range will  
be applied.  
1. Entrance Doors  
Assuming a 3-foot-wide door, the traffic volume at Level C would  
be\:  
3 ft. x 15 Pmv1 = 45 Pcds/ minute  
this *is* equivalent to a headway of\:  
60 secs/min  
----- - 1.33 se\('.s/Ped  
45 Peds/min  
and a distance between Peds of\:  
1.3,3 *secs* x 4.5 fps \(walking speed\) = 5 feet  
This is rather close, but compares with observed use of free-swinging  
doors. Also, during heavy traffic, pedestrians may be observed holding  
the door for the following pedestrian, reducing clearence times slightly.  
5000 Peds Number of doors=\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 7.4 or 8 doors, \:Major flow only

8 doors + 2 for minor direction flow, use 10 doors  
!\\-1inimum corridor width = 10 doors x 3 feet/ door  
30 feet  
2. Corridor Width  
Based on building code requirements, minimum corridor width  
must be equal to the entrance width. However, the net corridor width,  
with deductions for obstructions, should be used in calculations\:  
5000 Peds  
Net corridor width --------- = 22.2 feet  
15 min x 15 PFivl  
161 Add 2 feet each side of corridor for door openings and \:Vindow shoppers;  
also add 4 feet for column obstructions.  
22.2 + 4 + 4 = 30.2 Use 30 feet  
3\. Stairway Width  
Stair width = \_\_\_ 5\_0\_0\_0 \_Pi\_eds \_\_  
= 33.3 feet  
15 min x 10 PFM  
In most modern terminals, escalators would be provided to supplement  
stairs. On the assumption that cost limitations allowed the installation  
of only three escalators operating up, required stair width could be  
significantly reduced. Based on the observed capacities of 'Thble 5-A, vir-  
tually all pedestrians could be accommodated by the escalators. However,  
becauBe this is a Transportation 'Thrminal, the designer should consider  
that a power failure might put all the escalators out of service. Some agen-  
cies do not permit pedestrians to walk on stopped escalators.  
On the a,c,sumption that stationary stairs will supplement the escala-  
tors, and would be used totally only during a power failure, maximum stair  
capacity, or level-of service "E" \(17 PFM\), can be assumed. The width of  
the supplementary stairs is\:  
Stair width= \_\_\_ 5\_0\_0\_0\_B\_e\_ds \_\_ = 19.5 feet; Use 20 feet  
15 minx 17 PFM  
4\. Evaluation of the micro peak\:  
The five-minute surge in traffic, 50 per cent greater than the 15-minute  
average, will cause temporary reductions in service levels and result  
in queuing at some service facilities.  
# Entrances\:  
The micro peak is the equivalent of a surge flow of 500 peds  
per minute, and the doors have been designed for a flow of\:  
8 x 45 PPM = 360 PPM  
The headway equivalent of the surge flow on the 8 doors is\:  
60 sec/min = 0.96 secs/Ped  
500 PPM/8 doors  
the door opening and clearance time is at the maximum. A close  
examination of the minor flow traffic characteristics might allow for  
partial use of the other two doors, otherwise more doors, or alternative  
entrance locations, are required. The use of an air curtain entrance, the  
width of the cooridor, would satisfy all design assumptions.  
# Corridor\:  
The surge flow in the corridor is equal to\:  
5000 Peels x 1.5 surge factor = 22.7 PFM  
15 min x 22 ft. Effective  
162 This flow is the equivalent of level-of-service E, which is below critical  
density flow, and could be tolerated for short periods without generat-  
ing serious backups.  
Service Stoppage\:  
If a complete service stoppage should occur during the 15-minute  
design peak, pedestrian holding space for 5,000 persons would be  
required on the passenger concourse. Because the waiting period is of  
longer duration, a minimum of 7 square feet per person, in the lower  
range of the human comfort zone, is recommended for evaluation of  
concourse adequacy.  
Concourse area for service stoppage\:  
5,000 persons x 7 sq ft/person = 35,000 square feet  
Sufficient area should be provided for this contingency in all the public  
open space in the terminal. If this *is* not possib\]e, alternative operating  
procedures should be developed to prevent dangerous overcrowding.  
Pedmovers create difficult design-quality decisions because of  
their great cost, both in initial installation and subsequent life-  
long operation and maintenance expense. In addition, pedmovers  
are large consumers of space, reducing the net area available for  
rental and other purposes. For example, although escalators are  
a desirable pedestrian convenience on a railroad platform, the  
penetration of the platform space by the escalator tends to disrupt  
queuing and flow configurations on that platform. Pcdmovers act  
as ho.th visual and traffic focal points for pedestrians. As a visual  
statement, they should be located in a way that conveys their  
purpose and direction. Retail stores use the pedestrian traffic  
channelization features of escalators and moving walks as a  
marketing advantage. Displays of impulse-sale items are usually  
located along the traHic routes linking these facilities.  
Pedmovers should be related to, and integrated into, the build-  
ing system to provide smooth and logical traffic flow. Clear areas  
must be provided at the approaches of these facilities to allow for  
traffic circulation, traffic mixing, and queuing. For example,  
banks of more than two escalators grouped side by side have  
been found to have lower peak capacity use because of the flow  
inefficiency caused by traffic conflicts at the approach section.  
Where space permits, banks of two or more escalators should be  
separated, to allow for a smooth approach transition. The designer  
should be familiar \\vith traffic processes that serve the pedmover,  
as well as the exiting t\~affic process that is created by the ped-  
mover itself. Pedestrians board an elevator individually, on dif-  
ferent floors, but are discharged collectively, as a group, on the  
ground floor. After they are boarded, escalators continuously  
163 force-feed pedestrians into the landing area, whether or not that  
landing has the capacity or freedom of circulation to accommo-  
date them. Readers may have observed this problem, when the  
leading pedestrian fails to clear the exit of an escalator or moving  
walk, and the following pedestrian is forced against him by the  
momentum of the unit.  
A well-known indoor sports arena exhibits a design deficiency  
related to the continuous-discharge characteristic of escalators.  
This facility installed a multi-story system of escalators to serve  
several levels of the arena. At each level there is a small landing  
area, that must serve pedestrians leaving that level as well as  
pedestrians being force-fed into the area by the es.calator from  
the floors above. When the facility first opened, dangerous crowd-  
ing was experienced on the landings, and it was feared that pedes-  
trians would be pushed through the glass walls that surround the  
restricted landing areas. It became necessary to institute a traffic  
control system using attendants, whereby flow from upper levels  
is periodically interrupted to allow only a limited number of  
pedestrians on the landing at any time. Had the arena designer  
properly understood the continuous, force-feed characteristics of  
escalators, this problem could have been anticipated. Ideally,  
alternative self-policing exit systems should have been provided  
from each level, rather than force-feeding pedestrian traffic from  
upper levels into lower-level traffic. Because of the significant  
expense of mechanical pedmovers, it is difficult to recommend  
a level-of-service approach. The nominal capacity ratings cited  
in Chapter Five represent the normal expected capacity of these.  
units under backup queuing conditions. The designer should  
therefore make a detailed study of his traffic patterns, to deter-  
mine maximum queue size and average and maximum pedestrian  
waiting times. The analytical techniques of queuing theory can  
be used to develop these statistics, but average values for these  
factors can be developed by simple arithmetic, or by use of the  
time clearance diagram technique illustrated in the following  
problem.  
# Sample problem-Escalator Addition  
It is desired to install an **up** direction escalator at the center of a sub-  
way platform. Field counts of passengers discharged by the subway  
trains show that maximum traffic occurs during a short micro-peak,  
when two trains arrive within two minutes of each other, carrying 225  
and 275 passengers, respectively. The remaining trains in the peak  
period are on a 4-minute headway. The platform is 900 feet long, and  
164 15 feet wide. Evaluate pedestrian queuing and delay for the proposed  
installation.  
Solution  
1. Escalator Capacities\:  
'Thble 5-A, Chapter Five, contains the nominal capacities of various  
sizes and speeds of escalators. A maximum escalator capacity of 100  
pedestrians per minute is assumed for the 120 FPM, 48 inch-wide,  
escalators in this example because it is a transit application with  
heavy arrival traffic.  
2\. Construction of Time Clearance Diagram \(see Figure 7.4\)  
a. A graph is constructed, with time, in minutes, as the horizontal axis,  
and pedestrians as the vertical axis.  
b. The escalator capacity of 100 pedestrians per minute is then drawn  
in. \(The dashed sloped line\).  
c. The arrival rate at the escalator is a function of the train discharge  
time and walking time required to reach the escalator. If it is  
assumed that pedestrians are discharged uniformly along the length  
of the platfonn, and the escalator is located in the center of the plat-  
form, this can be approximately represented on the clearance  
diagram by determining the time required to walk half the plat-  
form length. A "commuter" walking speed of 300 FPM is used in  
this example.  
Total Arrival Time = \(½ platform length\) 450 ft. = 1.5 min  
\(average walking speed\) 300 FPM  
The two train arrivals, of 225 and 275 pedestrians, are plotted as solid  
lines on the time clearance diagram.  
3\. Maximum Queue Size and Maximum Wait  
Assuming all the passengers will use the escalator and not the  
stairs, the clearance diagram illustrates a number of significant facts. The  
stippled area between the pedestrian arrival rate \(solid line\), and the  
escalator service rate \(dashed line\), represents total waiting time. Divi-  
sion of the waiting time area by the number of arriving pedestrians gives  
average pedestrian waiting time. The maximum vertical intercept be-  
tween these two lines represents maximum pedestrian queue length.  
The maximum horizontal intercept represents the clearance interval of  
the platform.  
The clearance diagram shows that a maximwn queue size of 75  
persons would be generated by the first train arrival, if all persons seek  
escalator service. It also shows that 25 persons will still be waiting  
for the escalator service when the next train arrives. Maximum wait-  
ing time for escalator service after the first train arrival is  
one minute. The average pedestrian waiting time is 15 seconds. After the  
second train arrival, the maximum waiting and maximum queue size  
builds up to 1.5 minutes and 150 pedestrians, respectively. If it is assumed  
that pedestrians will divert to the stairs if the maximum escalator wait  
exceeds one minute, a one-minute-wide horizontal intercept on the graph  
shows that maximwn queue size will not likely get larger than 50 pedes-  
165 trians. This is about the limit observed for low-rise escalators of this  
type, where alternative stationary stairs are conveniently available.  
4\. Waiting Area and Platform Level of Service  
At a jam area occupancy of about 5 square feet per person, 100  
pedestrians in a queue require 500 square feet of waiting area. For the  
15-foot-wide platform of this example, this queue would occupy about  
30 to 40 lineal feet on the platform, temporarily blocking movement  
along this section of the platform. If the platform is the one-side-  
loading type, the escalator should be offset to minimize this queue  
interference.  
The mass diagram indicates that with one train unloading, there  
will be a maximum of about 315 pedestrians walking along the plat-  
form and waiting for the escalator. This is an average gross area of\:  
900 feet \(Length\) x 15 feet \(Width\) = 43 square feet gross platform  
315 Pedestrians area per pedestrian  
which is Level of Service A. The various levels of pedestrian queuing  
capacity on the platform are\:  
\(E\) Danger Level\:  
**900 ft. X 15 ft.**  
-------- = 4500 persons  
3 sq.ft./Ped  
**900 ft. X 15 ft.**  
\(D\) Jam Capacity\:  
= 2700 persons  
5 sq.ft./Ped  
**900 ft. X 15 ft.**  
**\(B\)** Desirable Maximum\: -  
= 1350 persons  
10 sq.ft./Ped  
Based on the approximate headways and passenger loads used in  
this problem, it appears likely that a full hour delay would be required  
· before dangerous crowding conditions would occur on this platform.  
However, the preferred maximum could be reached within approxi-  
mately a 15-minute delay, which would not be an unusual occurrence.  
Waiting Spaces include platforms, lobbies, ticket-selling areas,  
baggage claim areas, or any space where the pedestrian is re-  
quired to queue or wait for some service. As previously described,  
the amount of area required by a waiting pedestrian is a function  
of human space preferences and the degree of mobility or circula-  
tion required in the waiting area. Passenger platforms, or confined  
spaces, crowded below an occupancy of 2 square feet per person,  
are potentially unsafe. At this area occupancy, pedestrians can be  
forced through railings and other barriers, or off platforms onto  
tracks or roadways. A moving, but restricted queue, such as at the  
foot of an escalator, requires an average pedestrian area of 5  
square feet per person. Where circulation through standing pedes-  
trians is required, 10 or more square feet per person must *be*

*set* up for pedestrians, using stanchions and chaihs or railings,  
the distance between stanchions should be about 24 to 30 inches.  
The capacity of a controlled queue line of this type, with comfort-  
able no-contact standing, would be based on its total length,  
divided by the normal 20-inch queue spacing. Closer spacings  
could be expected in queue that are composed of persons known  
to each other, or where there is a degree of urgency connected  
·with moving through the queue.  
Sample problem-Airport Finger and Baggage Claim Areas  
**A** Boeing 747 is expected to discharge up to 362 passengers in a  
5-minute period. Determine the approximate finger width and baggage  
claim area dimensions. Evaluate the impact of the simultaneous arrival  
of a second such aircraft.  
# Solution  
Assuming Level of Service A, the required minimum finger width for  
a single arrival would be\:  
362 Peels  
Finger Width------- =10.2 ft.  
5 minx 7 PFM  
add 1.5 ft. clearance each side  
= 10.2 + 3.0 = 13.2; Use 15 ft.  
The baggage claim area should be capable of accommodating standing  
and circulating pedestrians. Based on queuing standard Level of Serv-  
ice A, the minimum claim area should be\:  
13 sq. ft./Ped x 362 Peds = 4700 sq. ft.  
The simultaneous arrival of the second aircraft would reduce the  
standard of service through the finger to level C, which is reasonably  
fluid, although somewhat crowded for this type of facility. The addi-  
tion of these passengers to the claim area would introduce severe  
crowding, with extremely limited and restricted circulation. The claim  
area should be enlarged for this contingency.  
**Directional** Signs are visual aids that help confirm the pedes-  
trian's expectations of a space, visually communicating supple-  
mcn tal information and assistance. The elements of good signing  
are more clearly understood if directional signing is recognized  
by the designer as a medium for visual communication with the  
pedestrian. The three basic elements of signing are the person,  
or vie,vcr, the display, or sign itself, and the location of the sign.  
\( *See* Figure 7.5\). When designing signs, the human capabilities of  
the viewer must be considered. Many of the attributes of good

169 signing can be compared to the factors that enhance human  
short-term memory. Short-tenn memory is improved by rehearsal,  
or introduction to the tenns and conventions of the signing sys-  
tem; use of short, familiar, and consistent terms; avoidance of  
the need to translate the sign message into other units, terms or  
meanings, reducing the number of individual terms or bits of  
information to be assimilated; use of repetition to improve con-  
fidence, and continuity and consistency of sign format and means  
of presentation.  
It should be recognized that there are different degrees of  
learning required by signs. Complicated, color-coded signing sys-  
tems can confuse the pedestrian if he has visual deficiencies,  
insufficient time, or lacks the mental ability to learn the meaning  
of the code. An estimated eight per cent of the adult population  
is subject to color confusion, and many others have functional  
illiteracy, or the inability to understand complicated instmctions  
reducing the effectiveness of elaborate signing systems. The dis-  
play or sign itself should be easily recognized by the pedestrian  
as a directional sign. Distinctive graphic design, involving the use  
of modem type faces, easily identified logos or other symbols, and  
consistent format, will help identify directional signing and avoid  
confusion with other types of signs. A rule of thumb for direc-  
tional sign lettering height is a letter-size minimum of *2* inches,  
plus one additional inch of letter height for each 25 feet of view-  
ing distance. In other words, a sign that is to be viewed from a  
distance of 50 feet should have at least a 4-inch letter height.  
Sign location can be a significant communication factor. The  
sign should have clear, unobstructed lines of sight, and good  
viewing angles. A 30-degree viewing angle is considered the  
optimum for reading a sign. Competing visual displays, or a  
confused background, can reduce the effectiveness of signing.  
Similarly, improper backlighting, or reflective glare off the sign  
face, can significantly reduce its communication value.  
The Design of Street Spaces  
The functional components of the traffic design of street  
spaces for pedestrians include sidewalks, street furniture, and  
street lighting. The street network is both the spinal column and  
the circulatory system of urban space, providing it with its struc-  
ture and viability. Streets are linkages behveen the various func-  
tional components of the city, the arteries through which flows  
the city's life-sustaining fluid of people and goods. The mark of  
170 a robust and growing city is a well-defined and functionally  
designed street system.  
Sidewalks are the pedestrian's portion of the street space. The  
pedestrian must share this space with countless pieces of hard-  
ware and furniture, much of which is required for the traffic  
control of vehicles. In addition to this intrusion into the pedes-  
trian's space, the utility and continuity of the sidewalk system  
is reduced further by vooicular conflicts, and signal systems which  
are timed to favor vehicles. When designing or evaluating side-  
walks, deductions must be made for the incursions by street  
furniture and time interruptions by signal cycles. There are other  
considerations involved in the determination of effective pedes-  
trian space on sidC\\valks. Many new buildings have taken ad-  
vantage of zoning bonus provisions, and have provided pedestrian  
plazas. When these plazas are properly integrated with the side-  
walk, they may be positive additions to effective pedestrian space.  
However, there are examples of plaza development where the  
plaza has been segregated from the sidewalk by walls, decorative  
planters, or grade discontinuities, which have negated the potential  
pedestrian space advantages of the plaza. Other design features  
Pedestrian plazas with grade discontinuities do not benefit sidewalk traffic.  
171 limit the effectiveness of sidewalks from the human factors stand-  
point. Curb heights may be set too high for convenient human  
locomotion. Curb height should be no greater than the normal  
stair riser height maximum of 8 inches. Preferably, curbs should  
either be set at 7 inches or less, or ramped, to facilitate use by  
the handicapped. Because of sight limitations, locomotion handi-  
caps, or just convenience, many pedestrians may be observed to  
bypass raised-curb safety islands, walking instead into active  
traffic roadways, to avoid stepping up and down. Walk-through  
islands channelize pedestrian flow, and eliminate this practice.  
Sidewalk gratings similarly inconvenience many pedestrians be-  
cause of their slippery surfaces and the tripping hazards caused  
by openings in the grating.  
Sample problem-Sidewalk Evaluation  
A new office building is expected to add 2000 additional pedestrians  
in a IO-minute period to \(A\) an existing sidewalk, \(B\) a crosswalk hold-  
ing area, and \(C\) an existing subway stair. \(See Figure 7.6\). The traffic  
light cycle at the crosswalk is 60 seconds, with a 25/ 35 split favoring  
the avenue. Evaluate levels of service at points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and the  
crosswalk \(D\).  
# Solution  
\(a\) Sidewalk Section\:  
The effective width of sidewalks must he reduced because of street  
furniture, light standards and other obstructions. Assuming a five-foot  
reduction, the pedestrian volume, **\(P\),** per foot of sidewalk width, per  
minute, is\: ·  
3000 Peds  
P =------ 20 PFM  
10 min x 15 ft.  
From the level-of-service design chart in Chapter Four, the level of  
service at this volume is E, and the approximate effective area per pedes-  
trian is about 10 square feet. At this level of service and area oc-  
cupancy, walking speeds, reverse flows and cross movements would  
be severely restricted.  
\(b\) Crosswalk Hold Area\:  
With the 25/35 traffic signal split, the crosswalk holding area would  
be required to queue, on the average\:  
1500 Peels x 25 sec  
= 63 Pedestrians  
10 min x 60 sec  
The required queuing area for these pedestrians, based on a queuing  
standard of 5 square feet per pedestrian, is 315 square feet, or the  
entire area at the corner of the building. These queuing pedestrians will  
block sidewalk access to the side street.

\(c\) Subway Stair\:  
The existing subway stair will be saturated by the added pedestrians.  
Assuming the absolute maximum design value of 20 PPM per ft. width  
of stairway, a queue of 30 PPM will build up, growing to a length of  
,300 or more pedestrians in the ten-minute design period, completely  
exceeding the small hold area behind the stair.  
The saturation of the existing stair and pedestrian holding spaces  
make it mandatory that the office building developer be required to  
provide supplemental stairway connections to the subway. These con-  
nections should be made directly through the building to minimize  
the increase in sidewalk volumes.  
\(d\) The Crosswalk  
The 1500 pedestrians crossing the street during the ten-minute office  
building peak will actually be concentrated into denser platoons be-  
cause of the interruptions of the traffic light signal. The available green  
time for pedestrians is 35 seconds out of each minute. The pedestrian  
requires an additional 3 seconds for perception and reaction time,  
further reducing his available green time. The average flow approach-  
ing the crosswalk is 150 pedestrians per minute. The concentrated flow  
crossing after the green indication is equivalent to 150 pedestrians in  
32 seconds. The resultant level of service on the crosswalk due to this  
platooning is determined as follows\:  
150 Peels x 60 sec  
P = ------- 32 sec x 15 ft. sidewalk  
= 18.7 PFM  
This is the equivalent of level of service D, in the range of severely  
restricted flow. This does not include traffic volumes that may be  
added from the side street, or conflicts caused by pedestrians standing  
and at the corner waiting to cross the avenue.  
173 Street Furniture is comprised of an endless list of impedimenta  
all deemed to have some proprietary or pre-emptory right over  
the pedestrian's sidewalk domain; parking meters, mail boxes,  
refuse cans, fire hydrants, fire alarm boxes, planters, newsstands,  
subway kiosks, telephone booths, bus shelters, signs, signals, light  
poles, etc., etc. Other sidewalk impedimenta not included in the  
furniture category are house steps, storage cellar entrances, and  
the sidewalk cafe. The latter may contribute to local color, but  
it is invariably located at the corner, in the midst of crosswalk  
confusion.  
There has been little, if any, regulation of the location of these  
sidewalk incursions. The improvement of this sorry picture is  
dependent upon strong municipal action. All supplementary uses  
of sidewalk space must be carefully controlled. Efforts must be  
made to reduce the number of these uses by incorporating dif-  
ferent elements into attractively designed modular units, simpli-  
fying municipal regulations to reduce signs, and restricting private  
uses of public sidewalk space. Sidewalk furniture should be elimi-  
nated entirely at crosswalks that are narrow and subjected to  
heavy traffic demand.  
Street Lighting is one of the most important design compo-  
nents of the pedestrian's environment after dark. High levels of  
illumination have been found to reduce pedestrian accidents, and  
to improve pedestrian security and area image. Minimum recom-  
mended illumination for urban downtown areas is as follows\:  
Roadway Classification  
Major street  
Collector street  
Local or minor  
Minimum Average  
Horizontal Footcandles  
\( Lumens per foot\)  
2.0  
1.2  
0.9  
Many cities have significantly upgraded their illumination  
standards in downtown areas by as much as four to five times  
the recommended minimum. These improvements have been sup-  
ported by the local citizens who have, in many instances, willingly  
paid additional tax assesments to upgrade lighting levels. Lighting  
levels are dependent on the type of luminaire \( the lamp and its  
reflective devices\), its mounting height, and the spacing of sup-  
porting poles. Illumination on the lighted surface decreases in-  
versely as the square of the distance from the light source. Be-  
cause of this inverse square law, the primary problem in lighting  
174 design is to obtain as uniform a distribution of light on the street  
surface as possible.  
This balanced light distribution is based on the use of lumi-  
naires with the most efficient lighting patterns for the particular  
space, and by spacing lighting poles for efficient overlapping of  
lighting patterns. If light poles are spaced without this overlap,  
an uneven brightness occurs. Ideally, light poles should be spaced  
so that the illumination from one complements the other, to  
produce an even brightness level. Street lighting can be enhanced  
with floodlighting of pedestrian crosswalk areas and special in-  
terest features, such as statues, or architecturally attractive build-  
ings. Some area features that appear relatively drab in the day-  
light environment can be considerably enhanced by floodlighting  
them at night.  
Pedestrian Walking Distances  
Walking distances, are important because they are a factor in  
plan configuration, and a measure of design serviceability. Un-  
fortunately, walking distances are a subjective human variable,  
with relatively long walking distances being accepted under some  
circumstances and rejected tinder others. Studies of walking trips  
in downtown CBD's usually reveal a large number of trips which  
total only a few hundred feet. Sometimes this data is used to  
justify moving-sidewalk installations for the longer walking-trip  
distances, say above 1000 feet. It should be noted that many of  
the short walking distances in CBD's are related to its dense  
development, and the increased likelihood that more trip nodes  
will be closer to each other. In addition, the value of time is  
likely to be accentuated more heavily in the CBD, because of the  
requirements of meeting work and lunch schedules, and this re-  
duces the time available for walking. The CBD might he con-  
trasted with an amusement park, or a world's-fair type of situation,  
where walking distances in thousands of feet, and even miles, are  
tolerated,  
An origin-and-destination survey of passengers departing from  
the Port Authority Bus Terminal, in midtown Manhattan, dis-  
closed that one-third of the passengers using the terminal walked  
from their origins, and that the average walking distance for  
these persons was about 3500 feet. This high average walking  
distance can be attributed to a number of factors, including\: \( 1\)  
that the survey was conducted during the spring, in fair weather;  
\( 2\) that the long, rectangular grid pattem of Manhattan streets  
175 increases path lengths; \( 3\) that walking is free; and \( 4\) that  
walking times are more predictable than the combined total of  
waiting, transfer, and trip times of Manhattan bus, taxi, and trans-  
it facilities.  
The origin-and-destination survey results provided the data  
for developing a relationship between walking distance and the  
proportion of Bus Terminal passengers who walk or use other  
transportation modes. The relationship is shown in Figure 7.7.  
The data used to develop this diversion-curve form of relationship  
was found to vary according to transit convenience. Zones with  
poor transit service were found to have a higher proportion of  
walkers. The Terminal passenger diversion curve shows that for  
up to about a 1000 feet from the Terminal virtually all persons  
walked; up to one mile almost 50 per cent walked; and two  
miles was the practical walking limit. The persons in the survey  
were almost all commuters, representing more of the healthy,  
non-handicapped segment of the general population. It is known  
that some of these persons will also walk in pleasant weather, as  
a means of exercise.  
These rather long walking distances compare with the shorter,  
but severely criticized, maximum walking distances at major air-  
ports. Maximum walking distances from curbside to planeside  
have been reported to be 1735 feet at O'Hare Airport, Chicago;  
1730 feet at Atlanta; 1650 feet at Dallas; 1300 feet at San Fran-  
cisco International; and approximately 1100 feet at the Los An-  
geles International, John F. Kennedy International, Miami and  
Detroit Airports. Inter-terminal distances at these airports were  
found to vary from 2000 to almost 8000 feet.  
Ther\~ are indications that the tolerable limit of human walking  
distance is more s'ituation-related than energy-related. The maxi-  
mum curb-to-plane walk distances represent a normal 5- to 7-  
minute walk for most persons, but the anxiety connected with  
meeting schedules, making the trip, and negotiating an unfamiliar  
building, tend to make these distances appear to be much longer.  
The tolerable walking distance for a given design situation is  
related to such factors as the trip purpose of the individual,  
available time, and the walking environment, rather than energy  
consumption. This strongly suggests that improvement of the  
design environment to reduce negative psychological factors is  
as important as reducing pedestrian walking distances.

WALKING DISTANCE - THOUSANDS OF FEET  
Designing for Pedestrians  
The objective of making pedestrian facilities accesible to, and  
usable by1 the physically handicapped, provides direct benefits  
in improved utility and service to all pedestrians as well. Handi\~  
capped pedestrians report that they are apprehensive of the  
dense, irregular, and usually hurried pedestrian traffic in most  
travel situations. One reason for this apprehension is the fear of  
actual physical impact with other pedestrians, who may not be  
aware of their handicaps, and another is their acute awareness  
that their slow pace may be impeding the progress of others.  
177 Higher level-of-service design standards for walkways would help  
to relieve many of the apprehensions of the handicapped, by  
providing sufficient area for all pedestrians to select their desired  
pace. Handicapped persons also experience difficulties with high  
riser heights **on** stairs, and projecting stair nosings. Reduction of  
riser height provides a stair that is negotiated with a greater  
degree of traffic efficiency and convenience. Rounded stair nosings  
reduce tripping hazards for the non-handicapped. Public transpor-  
tation systems and public buildings must devote increased atten-  
tion to accomodating the handicapped to assure them the full  
enjoyment of their citizen's rights to use these facilities.  
Minimum Recommended Design Standards to Make Facilities  
Usable for the Handicapped Pedestrian  
\(Based on ASA Standard All7.l-1961\)  
Walks  
• Walks should be at least 5 feet wide, with a maximum grade  
of 5 per cent. Walks with greater than a 5 per cent grade are  
considered ramps.  
• Walks should be of a continuing, common surface, not inter-  
rupted by steps or abrupt changes in level.  
• Wherever walks or roadways cross, the pavement should be  
cut, and the walk ramped to road level.  
• Where walkway systems are frequented by the blind, or where  
walkways cross streets, changes in pavement texture should  
be used, to provide the blind with tactile signals of route,  
and crossing, locations.  
• Longer walks near the maximum grade should have level  
areas at intervals, for purposes of rest and safety.  
• Walks should have non-slip surfaces.  
# Ramps  
Where mmps are provided, the following minimum standards  
should apply\:  
• Ramp slopes should not exceed a slope greater than 1 inch  
per foot, or 8.33 per cent grade.  
• Ramps should have handrails on at least one side, and  
preferably on both sides, extending at least one foot beyond  
the ends of the ramp. Handrails should be set at a height of  
32 inches, measured from the ramp surface.  
• Ramps should have non-slip surfaces.  
• Ramps should have level platforms at 30-foot intervals, and  
178 Pedestrians are more likely to use convenient walk-through safety islands.  
Ramped curb cuts at cross walh assist the handicapped.  
179 at ramp ends for rest and safety. \\Vhere a door opens on the  
ramp end, minimum platform dimensions must be at least 5  
feet by 5 feet, or sufficient to allow door opening and wheel-  
chair maneuvering.  
Entrances  
• At least one primary entrance to each building should be  
usable by persons in wheelchairs. This entrance should be on  
a level accessible to building elevators.  
• The location of this entrance should be indicated by an ap-  
propriate sign or symbol.  
• Doors should have a clear opening of no less than 32 inches,  
free of protruding hardware. \(See Figure 7.8\).  
• Sharp inclines, or abrupt changes in level, should be avoided  
at doorsills. Floors on the inside and outside of each doorway  
should be level for a distance of 5 feet in the direction of the  
door swing, and for at least one foot of width on each side  
of the door.  
• Doors should be operable with a minimum effort. Door closers  
should be of the type that does not require much effort for  
opening, and which close slowly enough to allow for uninter-  
rupted passage of a wheelchair.  
Stairs  
• Stairs should have plain faces. Open riser stairs, or stairs with  
edges projecting out over the face of closed risers, are not  
recommended. \(See Figure 7.9\).  
• Maximum riser heights should be 7 inches; preferred riser  
heights would be between 5 and 6 inches. Tread width should  
be at least 11 inches.  
• Handrails should be set at 32 inches, measured from the tread  
at the face of the riser, and should extend 18 inches beyond  
the stair ends.  
• All treads should be of non-slip surfaces.  
• Stair lighting should be a minimum of 5 foot-candles on the  
average; preferred lighting levels should be above 10 foot-

NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN PLANN  
IAN ENVI NMENTS  
A new age is dawning for the pedestrian\: a return to the human  
scale of the cities of the past; an awareness of the need for human  
interaction and communication; a realization of the importance  
of the human sense of belonging to, and relating with, the design  
environment. It stems from the recognition that a space should  
serve its users free of the incoherence and confusion of conflict-  
ing purposes. Its evolution in the cities began with the first, small-  
scale pedestrian mall experiments. Its evolution in buildings be-  
gan with some of the more innovative air passenger terminal  
designs. Planners and designers around the world are awakening  
to its promise. The examples cited in this review have been se-  
lected for illustrative purposes.  
The Barbican-Out of the Ashes  
During World War II, bombs devastated a large area adjacent  
to the downtown section of the city of London. Because of its  
proximity to the downtown financial district, the area could have  
been easily reconstructed with high-density office building de-  
velopments. However, the area is rich in historical importance,  
dating back to the days of the early Roman occupation. The  
magnificent dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, designed and built by  
Christopher 'Wren after the great London fire of the late seven-  
teenth century, is the dominating landmark in the area.  
Instead of more office buildings, the Corporation of London  
built the Barbican, a combined cultural and residential complex  
designed to serve the needs of the business district, and to pre-  
serve the historical significance of the area. The Barbican contains  
2,113 flats, maisonettes, and terrace houses, for up to 6,500 resi-  
dents; a 200-room hotel for students and young city workers; the  
new Guildhall School of Music and Drama; a theater; an art  
gallery; a conceit hall; a cinema; a library; shops; restaurants and  
pubs. The development is served by a segregated system of ele-  
vated pedestrian walkways, with roads, truck service bays, and  
parking below, out of sight of the pedestrian level.  
The network of elevated pedestrian ways connects directly  
with the financial district, so that it is possible to live, work and  
183 enjoy all the area's cultural advantages without vehicular conflict.  
The elevated plazas have been attractively landscaped, and par-  
ticular care has been taken to rnaintain and enhance the vistas of  
historic St. Paul's. An ancient Roman wall, perhaps 1,500 years  
old, presents an unusual interest feature at one location. The  
Barbican is an excellent example of human scale design, and the  
preservation and enhancement of the sense of place, or space  
image.

184 185 Montreal and Toronto-Pedestrian Subways  
Both Montreal and Toronto, Canada, have embarked on pro-  
grams to establish pedestrian networks beneath their central  
business districts. The Montreal system began in 1962, with the  
development of the Place Ville-\:Marie shopping mall and its  
associated forty-two-story office tower. Underground linkages  
were built between the Place Ville-Marie complex and the nearby  
Canadian Railway Station and Queen Elizabeth Hotel. The initial  
small-scale network proved so popular thnt subsequent linkages  
were made to other large developments in the area. In 1971, the  
system totaled approximately two miles of connecting pedestrian  
passageways, serving forty acres of prime office, hotel and retail  
stores, including three hundred underground shops, fifty restau-  
rants, and twenty-five-hundred hotel rooms.  
The underground network is completely enclosed, and climate-  
controlled in both summer and winter. This is most appreciated  
during the rigorous Canadian winter, allowing the pedestrian to  
avoid the cold and slush above. A reduction in downtown-district  
pedestrian accidents has also been noted since its inception, which  
has been attributed to the reduction of pedestrian-vehicle con-  
flicts. Montreal's system is largely unplanned, and there is no  
overall master plan. Each developer initiates his own plans, and  
the total network is somewhat deficient because of it. There is  
also a lack of visual relationship with surface elements, which  
affects the irnageability of the system. The City Planning Depart-  
ment has initiated studies and developed concepts for a more  
coherent system for the future.  
Toronto's underground pedestrian circulation system is less  
developed than Montreal's, but a completed downtown network  
is envisioned by 1980. The Toronto concept is similar to that of  
Montreal, linking major generators\> such as shopping centers and  
hotels, with transportation nodes. The Toronto system is also  
dependent upon individual developers, but there has been active  
participation by city planners and partial funding by the City.  
The Toronto Transit Commission which owns and operates the  
Metro system has also taken an active part in the development,  
promoting direct linkages to subway stations and major traffic  
generators in the system. Toronto planners are convinced that the  
total image of the city and its ability to attract new investment  
is dependent in a large measure on the ease, freedom and pleasure  
with which pedestrians can move about. Profiting from Montreal's  
186 Illustration of store front development in Montreal underground podway system,  
Aesthetic treatment of a pedestrian subway in the Montreal system.  
187 experience, they have attempted to increase the imageability of  
the underground network, opening it to the street environment  
above. This has limited opportunities for climate control, but has  
contributed to an increased variety of visual experiences. Plans  
for the proposed Metro center, an air-rights development above  
the National Canadian Pacific Union Station, which would have  
20,000 residents and 40,000 daytime workers, include provision  
for visual relationship with the underground pedestrian network.  
The visual orientation of the pedestrian has been considered in  
the design of the Center's approaches from the underground  
network. Outdoor courtyards, entrances, and building shopping  
ways may all be encompassed in a single gaze.  
Cincinnati and Minneapolis-Pedestrian Skyways  
The cities of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Minneapolis, Minnesota,  
have embarked on programs for aerial walkway networks in their  
downtown central business districts. Unlike Montreal and Toronto,  
the two cities have no underground subway system to integrate  
with, allowing the freedom to choose the less expensive skyway  
alternative. The overhead systems have the advantage that they  
can be built quickly, without conflict with underground utilities  
or surface traffic. Also, the overhead systems allow a clearer  
visual relationship with the elements of the cityscape. However,  
the design of aesthetically attractive bridge connections between  
buildings is a challenge to the architect and structural engineer,  
Elevated street bridges in Minneapolis have been constructed of  
prestressed concrete, with finished steel railings and tinted glass  
paneling enclosures. Maximum use has been made of glass and  
high levels of lighting for security purposes. Although all sky-  
ways have not been climate-controlled, provision has been made  
for this eventuality.  
The Cincinnati system interconnects 10 square blocks in the  
heart of the downtown district. An additional spur serves Cincin-  
natts 56,000-seat lakefront sports stadium. The Cincinnati sky-,  
walk system is being developed with a combination of private,  
municipal and federal fh1ancing. Plans for pedestrian circulation  
within the core recognize the need to walk quickly, and unencum-  
bered by vehicular conflict, between major pedestrian traffic  
generators. The second-level walkway system connects the city's  
retail section, and a showcase concentration consisting of the  
convention hall and hotels on the west, the office building con-  
centration on the east, and the lakefront stadium on the south.

189 An added moving walk linkage to the Stadium has been con-  
sidered because of long walking distances .from the CBD. The  
city's plans iriclude provisions for additional grade-level improve-  
ments for pedestrians, with arcading of building fronts, widening  
of sidewalks and the improvement of street furniture design. A  
pedestrian mall, containing Cincinnati's historic Tyler Davidson  
Fountain, is designed as the central focal point of the develop-  
ment. \(Block "A,, on map\).  
The elevated connection to the lakefront stadium has proven to  
be one of the most valuable links of the system. Originally in-  
tended to make downtown parking available to stadium spectators  
because of a parking capacity deficiency at the stadium itself, it  
brings large numbers of ·these persons into the downtown area  
during sporting events. This has significantly increased downtown  
restaurant and shopping business volumes on these days.  
Minneapolis, Minnesota, has the distinction of being one of the  
most people-oriented cities in the United States. It's famed eight-  
block-long Nicollet mall is an outstanding example of the develop-  
ment of a prime retail street into a visually exciting pedestrian  
precinct, where private vehicles are banned. Although the Nicollet  
mall development is significant by itself, the ambitious skyway  
plan of Minneapolis has received much more attention. It is ex-  
pected that, by 1985, 64 pedestrian bridges will connect 54 blocks  
of the downtown CBD. An additional 13 blocks will be joined  
by underground concourses.  
Minneapolis city officials began studying elevated walkway  
systems as early as 1958, but literally could not get the develop-  
ment "off the ground" because of merchants' concern for potential  
loss of business from street-level stores. Finally, a few private  
developers thought that such a system would be economically  
feasible, and proved their point when the first skyway was built  
in 1962 as part of the Northstar Center development. Property  
values immediately soared ·in the vicinity of the Center, persuad-  
ing a number of businesses to remain downtown instead of moving  
to the suburbs. Five more skyways were privately financed and  
built, linking a total of 16 downtown buildings.  
Instead of decreasing rental values, the skyway and arcade  
system increased the rental receipts of the second level of the  
connecting buildings so significantly that the second-level rates  
now approximate the rates on the street floor, without lowering  
street-floor values. Costs of skyways have been suprisingly low,  
averaging about \$100,0Q0, split between owners on each side

of the street. Remodeling of second-story arcades has proven to  
be more expensive than the skyways themselves, but these costs  
are substantially less when the arcade is included in original  
construction.  
The guidelines for the skyway system development adopted  
by the Minneapolis Planning and Development Department in-  
clude provisions for adequate walkway dimensions, pedestrian  
comfort, security, and imageability. Minimum clear walkway  
widths are set at 12 feet, and preferably 20 feet, for connections  
to major traffic generators. Minimum headroom is set at eight  
feet. Unobtrusive design is recommended for all skyways, and  
arcades. Additional recommendations include climate control, and  
a use of glass and high lighting levels for "openness" and security.  
Pedestrian access and use of the system is to be facilitated by  
good signing, and clearly marked entries from street level. The  
skyways and arcades will make use of multi-level courts and  
open spaces, to visually link the street with the second-level  
system. Every effort to introduce interest and variety along the  
route of the system is advocated. Standardized structural design  
and details are recommended to simplify skyway construction  
and to reduce costs.  
192 os1.ur1\~-11+. Moving Skywalk for Downtown  
The Boston Redevelopment Authority recently completed a  
detailed study of an internal distribution system for its downtown  
area under a \$200,000 technical study grant from the Urban Mass  
Transportation Administration. The extremely thorough study  
included determination of downtown transportation requirements,  
engineering feasibility of various systems, definition of design  
objectives, and an evaluation of legal considerations. The design  
objectives of the system include\: improvements to pedestrian  
mobility and convenience; reduction of crowding at existing  
stations; flexibility and adaptability to change; reliability and  
maintainability of equipment; safety; security and comfort; the  
achievement of a sense of place and community; enhancement  
of property values and encouragement of new development; ac-  
cessibility to the system; creation of a strong, easily identified  
urban structure; and a favorable cost-to-benefit ratio.  
As a result of the study, it is proposed that a weather-protected  
system of elevated moving walks be constructed along two routes,  
2,500 and 1,400 feet in length. Parallel, stationary sidewalks would  
be provided for those who do not choose to use the moving walk.  
Conventional, constant-speed units were recommended for initial  
installation because of commercial availability and demonstrated  
reliability. Variable-speed systems were founl to be mostly experi-  
mental and untested. The moving walks system was selected be-  
cause it combined the advantages of continuous automatic opera-  
tion, low operating costs, high capacity, and safety. In addition,  
moving walks may be reversed, to handle peak demands.  
Another factor that was considered is that moving walks require  
very little space, and their use bears a strong resemblance to walk-  
ing, thus helping the creation of a pedestrian-oriented environ-  
ment. Mini buses were considered for CBD distribution, but  
were rejected because of capacity limitations, high operating  
costs, requirements of street right-of-way, and space for storage  
and repair. Other "people-mover" system, such as Carveyor,  
Dashaveyor, Starrcar and Minirail, were also considered, but were  
judged inappropriate for the particular short-distance application,  
for either low capacity, incompatible operating characteristics,  
high cost, or aesthetics.  
An interesting aspect of the study was a state-of-the-art in-  
vestigation of variable-speed moving walks. Six concepts for  
accelerating walks \\Vere considered and compared with current  
19.3 constant-speed equipment. The concept found to have the best  
potential for this application was a "multiple belts linear array  
system", comprised of a series of constant-speed belts in a linear  
sequence, each belt longer and faster than its predecessor. The  
main, or fastest-speed belt, would be travelling at 4.4 miles per  
hour, approximately 50 per cent faster than normal walking speed,  
and four times faster than current moving-walk speeds. The study  
indicated that if experiments prove the feasibility of this sequential  
acceleration system, it can easily replace the proposed constant-  
speed system.

194 Underground Atlanta-"Hidden Gold"  
Atlanta, Georgia, literally discovered hidden gold beneath its  
doorstep with the development of a small, but unique, high-  
interest pedestrian precinct below its downtown area. The town  
of Atlanta·has always been an important southern rail hub, with  
rail lines converging on its downtm\:vn area. In 1834, a bridge was  
erected over the railroad to facilitate downtown traffic movement.  
This first grade-separation improvement was so successful that  
Atlanta instituted a program to elevate all its downtown streets  
above the railroad terminal area. This undertaking was so ex-  
tensive it took almost a century to complete. After the building  
of the elevated viaducts, the streets below were shut off from com-  
mercial activity, so the merchants boarded up the fronts of the old  
buildings and moved their operations up one level. For approxi-  
mately seventy years, these old store-fronts remained dormant,  
while the city above flourished. However, the forgotten city below  
was the scene of most of Atlanta's early history. In 1967, Under-  
ground Atlanta Incorporated was formed by a group of enter-  
prising Atlantans to bring this historic area back to life. The com-  
pany undertook the restoration of four square blocks of sub-  
surface Atlanta to the period of the late 1800's. The restoration is  
complete with Victorian restaurants, saloons, boutiques, cabaret  
theaters, a musical museum, artist's gallery, tum-of-the-century  
printing shop, period signing and street furniture. The develop-  
ment has created added vitality and interest in downtown Atlanta,  
recreating much of its historic past.  
New  
The South Street Seaport Museum is an ambitious program  
to preserve and restore a small element of the nautical history of  
New York City, in a section of the Manhattan waterfront near  
the historic Brooklyn Bridge. The Seaport Museum will consist  
of a pedestrian precinct formed by five city blocks, and a section  
of the waterfront containing four finger piers. Architecturally,  
the area restoration will save all existing buildings in the area,  
most of which were constructed in the period from 1820 to 1890.  
A major concern of the restoration project is the recreation of the  
streetscapc of the past. This has involved much study of old  
paintings, prints and photos of the area. The four piers will be  
designed as park-like extensions of the streets. Selected ships of  
particular significance in New York's seafaring history will be  
195 docked at the piers and open to the public. In addition to the  
ships, which will be floating museums, the seaport will contain  
other exhibits of New York's past seaport history, including mari-  
time, whaling, fishery, and shipping family museums. Plans for  
the seaport include a working shipyard, to illustrate the ship-  
building trades of the past, and a marina, to accommodate water-  
borne visitors. The seaport museum, which is located a short  
distance from the Manhattan financial district, is an important  
restoration not only in its historical sense, but in the sense of  
bringing back to New Yorkers some pride of identification with  
their city.
