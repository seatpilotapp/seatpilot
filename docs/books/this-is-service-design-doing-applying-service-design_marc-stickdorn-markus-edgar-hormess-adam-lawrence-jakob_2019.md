01 02 03 04 05 06 07 The four editors, Marc, Adam, Markus, and Jakob, are also the main authors and the designers of this book. All text that does not name a  
specific author was written by us. However, we were not alone. More than 300 people helped us to create this book. Besides the co-authors and  
contributors, many others had important roles. Have a look at the end of the book to find all of them.  
The 33 case studies describe how service design is used in various industries. They include many photos and key takeaways. Sometimes, we  
reference a specific case in a footnote as an example of how a specific tool or subject matter is used in practice.  
Detailed hands-on descriptions of all of the service design methods included in this book are freely available online at  
www.thisisservicedesigndoing.com. You’ll also find short descriptions of the methods at the ends of Chapters 5, Research; 6, Ideation, 7; Prototyp-  
ing; and 10, Facilitating workshops.  
Our 96 co-authors contributed 33 case studies and 105 expert comments and tips to this book, often going through several iterations of  
feedback from the editors and reviewers. Their names are always included with their contributions. Make sure to quote the right people when  
you refer to their work! Short bios and photos of all the co-authors can be found at the end of the book.  
We invited service design experts from academia and industry to critically comment on the chapters or to give tips on how to do it. You will  
find these tips and comments alongside the main text, with attributions.  
A total of 205 contributors reviewed the original text written by the editors chapter by chapter through separate Google Docs. They suggested  
changes, added passages and footnotes, and sometimes even had vigorous discussions on various topics. These critical reviews were our crit  
sessions. They helped us to broaden our view and incorporate diverse thoughts and sources. Even though this process was a lot of work and  
took much longer than expected, it vastly improved the quality of the book. Have a look at the Preface to learn more about the process of this  
book and to read the names of all 205 heroes who invested their time into this project.  
There are many footnotes in this book. Why so many? On the one hand, we do not expect that you will read this book cover to cover, so we  
wanted to highlight connections between the different chapters to guide you to other chapters you might be interested in. On the other hand,  
we wanted to show that service design is rooted in extensive academic work spanning many different disciplines. Even though the book is  
intended as a handbook for practitioners, we strove to keep a basic academic standard. As far as possible for a book like this, we have tried to  
mention and quote original texts or give examples for further readings where appropriate.

HELLO THERE!  
# PREFACE  
Where we come from\:  
This book’s predecessor  
Back in 2010, our book This is Service Design Thinking  
captured the state of the art. Marc was looking for a  
comprehensive resource to teach service design to his stu-  
dents, but could only give them URLs and articles spread  
around the web. So he teamed up with Jakob to create  
the resource himself. At the very start, it wasn’t even clear  
that the result would become a book, but it was clear that  
the project should be based on a real service design pro-  
cess – we wanted to practice what we preached.  
So, we invited 23 co-authors and over 150 online  
contributors to create the most complete collection of  
basics, tools, and case studies possible. It soon became  
clear that only printed matter could inspire the percep-  
tion of a standard reference. Even more importantly, it  
would be a snapshot, as we openly acknowledged that  
service design was and is an evolving field.  
No one expected the book to become a best seller,  
but to our surprise it went on to be translated into multi-  
ple languages and even won several design awards. From  
the moment the book was printed, we received thou-  
sands of comments. The community responded to the  
book in an overwhelmingly positive way, but of course  
had plenty of fair criticism. To sum it up in three points\:  
too fragmented, too academic, too theoretical.  
Why this book is necessary  
We heard you. It took us some years out in the field to  
finally produce the book’s sequel. More importantly, we  
were lucky enough to expand the team with two excep-  
tional service design doers\: Adam and Markus. So here  
we are with the logical sequel of thinking → doing.  
One of the reasons why we called our first book  
­ Service Design Thinking was to trigger a discussion in the  
community on whether what we do is service design or  
design thinking or something else – trying to go beyond  
labels. This didn’t really work out as we hoped, and now  
there are agencies and design departments that call what  
they do service design thinking. Yes, we are flattered, and  
we still make jokes about it.  
Service design \(or design thinking, experience  
design, UX, CX, or whatever you might call what we’re  
doing\) is not just about thinking. Design in general is an  
act of doing. The feedback we received for \#TiSDT often  
emphasized that the best part of the book was its second  
part\: the service design toolbox. This book now takes  
that idea of a toolbox further.  
This is Service Design Doing is a handbook of service  
design – a toolbox, a description of methods, a facilita-  
tion guide, packed with cases and examples – giving a  
clear picture of how you can put all those pieces together.  
It is a book for “doers,” for people who want to improve customer experience as well as employee experience  
and the systems that connect all these stakeholders in an  
organization.  
It is also a book that helps you pave the way to doing  
with both business and design audiences. It gives you  
enough theory and examples to explain why this approach  
actually works and how you can tie it into your organization.  
The book you have in your hand concentrates on the  
bigger picture of setting up and running a service design  
initiative, and the details of facilitating both the project  
and the room. Many of the individual methods and tools  
involved – from visualization tools to specific research,  
ideation, or prototyping methods – are well known or al-  
ready described in many other books and online resourc-  
es. Instead of charging you for these “commodities,” we  
have made the best descriptions we can, added plenty of  
expert tips, and put them online for free. If you need them,  
download them from www.thisisservicedesigndoing.com01  
and share the worksheets with your colleagues.  
 We may call it service design, but many organizations we  
work with call it something else. This book is not about  
labels, but about how to get stuff done. How to have an  
impact on employees, customers, citizens, all of us.  
Who should read this book  
This book is for everyone interested in customer experi-  
ence, innovation, and collaborative creation. Put another  
way, if you have picked up this book, it is probably for you.  
01 Or simply www.tisdd.com.  
xvi/xvii  
Perhaps you work in an organization which is trying  
to better help its customers \(or citizens, or employees\),  
and you want to create better or even new offerings that  
people will love to use and talk about. Perhaps your or-  
ganization wants new ways to connect operational silos  
and work together more painlessly, using a “language”  
and toolset that everyone in the organization – and your  
stakeholders outside – can understand.  
It might be that you want to run, lead, or participate  
in co-creative group sessions where people work togeth-  
er more effectively and enjoyably.  
Maybe you have heard the term “service design  
thinking,” or something like it, and want to understand  
more about it and why it works. Or you have already  
learned something about it and need to “connect the  
dots,” moving from simple tool use to successful projects  
and strategy. You might even be a professional designer  
or consultant, looking to add to your knowledge or find  
material to use in your projects and sessions.  
Who we are  
We \(Marc and Jakob\) are the editors of This is Service  
Design Thinking, and we’ve been exploring this field since  
2008, doing design work, design consultancy, teaching,  
and speaking. After working together for many years, we  
finally built two startups around service design\: Smaply  
and ExperienceFellow. We couldn’t be happier to team  
up with service design consultants and trainers Adam  
Lawrence and Markus Hormess from WorkPlayExperi-  
ence – widely known as instigators of the Global Service  
Jam with its famous motto of “Doing, not talking.” This is Service Design Doing  
In 2013, Marc, Adam, and Markus created an exec-  
utive school called – surprise – This is Service Design  
Doing. Since then, hundreds of participants from all over  
the world and from a wide range of organizations have  
taken part, and the conversations with \(future\) service  
designers influenced much of what is contained in this  
book. The schools generated a co-created script that  
inspired us to write a sequel to \#TiSDT.  
Who is allowed to write this kind of book?  
When we were discussing our plans to write a sequel to  
\#TiSDT in 2014, we asked ourselves again\: Who has the  
authority to write such a book? Who can decide which  
tools and methods should \(or should not\) be in the  
book? We came to the same conclusion as in 2009, when  
we wrote \#TiSDT\: it shouldn’t be us, it should be the  
global service design community. We can only suggest,  
write drafts, promote, get a diverse group of people to  
review and to write parts of the book; it should be the  
community that actually decides what should be includ-  
ed and what shouldn’t be. So as with \#TiSDT, we decided  
to co-create \#TiSDD with the community. Thankfully  
we found a publisher that supported us in this idea of  
co-creating a book together with a community\: O’Reilly.  
 We were able to include the service design community  
in the shape of 200+ reviewers, cases from design  
agencies and in-house design departments, and as  
comments from both renowned service design experts  
and people from outside the community.  
How to co-create a book  
The content of this book has been through many itera-  
tions of writing, feedback, and rewriting. It started with  
the co-created handout from our This is Service Design  
Doing Executive Schools. More than 200 participants  
reviewed and added to our co-created script over 3 years,  
refining and reality-proofing it in real-world projects,  
creating the sh!tty first draft of what would turn into this  
book.  
Based on this initial draft, we sketched out the  
content of this book and devised a co-creation strategy  
that led to a series of calls for contribution and co-cre-  
ation. We invited leading service design practitioners  
from various fields and countries to submit case studies  
showing how specific tools and methods are applied in  
context. We asked the wider service design community  
for contributions through an open call on our temporary  
website, tisdd.rocks. Within an hour, 200 people had  
volunteered to review our drafts for the 12 chapters. We  
had intensive discussions and changes, and iterated our  
way forward.  
Our publisher, O’Reilly, offered a pre-release version  
of this book as an ebook. Selected chapters were available  
for download from early 2016 on and we received feed-  
back through the O’Reilly website, by email, and later  
also through tisdd.rocks. Our final draft was then sent  
out to invited experts from the service design communi-  
ty and beyond. They gave feedback on selected chapters  
and were invited to write comments, tips, or counter  
opinions, many of which are published under their own  
names next to the text. Finally, we invited 10 reviewers to xviii/xix  
read the whole manuscript end to end to review how the  
different parts fit together.  
Overall, we tried to practice what we preach and  
used an iterative, co-creative, and “reader”-centered  
design approach to create this book. As you can imagine,  
such a process is time consuming and hard to plan. We  
missed many deadlines and had to postpone the pub-  
lishing date several times. Luckily, we have a publisher  
who believed in these ideas and supported us all the way.  
And even now, this book is not “finished.” It is just the  
beginning. It is a slightly less sh!tty first draft …

CONTRIBUTORS\: WHY THEY CONTRIBUTED  
WE ASKED THE REVIEWERS WHY THEY INVESTED THEIR TIME AND ENERGY TO HELP US  
CREATE THIS BOOK. HERE’S A SELECTION OF THEIR REASONS FOR PARTICIPATING\:  
▷ I think SD rocks. I love doing SD projects, the  
process of gaining insights, the conversations  
along the way and the results you can achieve.  
▷ Collaborate in a team of people which I always  
search for advice in their words. Maybe be-  
come also an inspiration to others and share  
the knowledge that the book has. Saludos!  
From Colombia  
▷ I love the endless potential of SD. How it can  
change the world in small and big ways.  
I think your work is crucial and I would love  
to help shape it.  
▷ I find the method supporting how homosapiens  
evolve brilliantly.  
▷ If we preach design in co-creation, shouldn’t  
we all then practice what we preach?  
\(and it is fun too!\)  
▷ TISDT is a fundamental piece in the evange-  
lization of SD and has contributed a lot to my  
work. I would be honored to review and con-  
tribute to the whole community on how to put  
SD to work. If I can help make the SD practice  
better, why not?  
▷ I consider “this is SD thinking” the bible of SD,  
it really helped me in understanding the SD re-  
ligion. Now I don’t want to miss the chance to  
give my contribution to the New Testament \:\)  
▷ Want to contribute based on my recent  
works in Japan  
▷ As a relative newcomer to the field I can offer  
good perspective with respect to readers who  
are learning about SD for the first time. And  
admittedly I’m curious about the book as well!  
▷ As part of the jam family I feel like contribut-  
ing! This book will help us develop businesses  
in a SD direction.  
▷ Simply because Russian SD wants to contrib-  
ute to this superior book.  
▷ I am doing PhD research in the University of  
Milano-Bicocca and exploring design princi-  
ples and SD tools for the purpose of work-  
place innovation. Developing design capabili-  
ties in organisations is my main focus.  
▷ Collaborate with brilliant minds and help the  
SD community  
▷ I am a convert ...as a developer of 30 years  
over the past 8 years I have learned design  
has little to do with making it look pretty  
▷ I would love to have the opportunity to mod-  
estly contribute to your Opus magnum \:\). I am  
very curious about the book and it would be  
great to be amongst the chosen ones that get  
a first glimpse.  
▷ Because I definitely will be a f\*ck\*\*\* user of  
this book. Why not being a f\*ck\*\*\* contributor  
too? \:\) Plus I have some interesting experienc-  
es in\: SD + Scrum \(I’m also a Scrum Master\) +  
In-house SD. You decide!!  
▷ Because the book\: “This is SD Thinking” is so  
great, and yesterday I listened to a UX pod-  
cast “Breaking down digital media silos!” with  
Donald Norman, where he talked also about  
“SD doing.”  
▷ I’m in the midst of a career transition, throwing  
myself into the world of SD. I’m learning by  
reading \(TISD\) and by doing. I’m also learning  
by relocating my family from the USA to Lon-  
don so I can be closer to the SD community.  
▷ Your first book made me discover SD in the  
first place, and everything after that was pretty  
amazing. So, the least I can do, is help you  
guys review the second one. And who knows  
what can come out of this! P.s. And it would  
also be an honour.  
▷ I believe SD is the present and future of a  
holistic design approach to most if not all  
problems we face. TISDT helped me to grasp  
this and started me down the path of imple-  
menting SD as a practice wherever I go. I’d  
love to help shape this new book.  
▷ I have an innovation consultancy for small  
businesses and every day we are looking  
for new forms of inspiration to help our cus-  
tomers better.  
▷ The first book is amazing and helped me to  
understand the power of SD. I need to return  
this collaborating with this next book.  
▷ I have great passion to spread SD in Asia.  
▷ Having set up two SD businesses operating in  
Asia I want to help represent this part of the  
world and offer a different perspective of our  
practice.  
▷ Because I do design thinking and SD process-  
es on a daily basis. Therefore I believe that I  
have something to contribute with, and at the  
same time I hope to get some learning and  
inspiration out of reading the book. ▷ I’d like to contribute to the creation of something  
that can be really useful for practitioners as well  
as for the people who want to know more about  
the discipline, the approaches and methods.  
▷ I am passionate about moving the SD field  
forward, and very much looking forward to this  
book to build on the canon.  
▷ I have been working with SD for several  
years within the public and private domain.  
Spreading the gospel and gathering practical  
experience. The latter I would like to contribute  
to the book.  
▷ I want to decrease the gap between theory  
and practice, communicating practice in a  
pedagogic and clear way.  
▷ Research in general is in B2B not very  
common. But lack of innovation opens up  
new doors - so B2Bs are discovering Design  
Research not only as a change of perspective  
but also a chance for cultural change.  
▷ I’m an innovation consultant with a back-  
ground totally different from a “typical SDer.”  
I have a degree in economics/marketing/  
strategy but I believe in the power of combin-  
ing design thinking with traditional business  
strategy.  
▷ I’m passionate about service design and I  
begin my adventure with the first black book,  
and now working as a SDer \(implementing  
projects for municipalities, hospitals and  
companies\) so would love to have an impact  
on next book.  
▷ Soy apasionado por el diseño de servicios.  
Estoy interesado que más personas tengan  
acceso a metodologías y herramientas de  
diseño de servicios.  
▷ We have many copies of the first book and  
I’ve been in SD in govt for many years now. I  
would be so excited to be involved and believe  
I can contribute.  
▷ For the past few years, I’ve been trying to  
implement SD principles into large organi-  
zations, but I was disappointed by the lack  
of real practical advice of the first This is SD  
book and would like to be able to ensure it in  
this follow up.  
▷ I am a reader of the This is SD Thinking  
book and excited to make myself useful and  
contribute for the sequel. Met u guys in NYC  
during SDGC 2015, when I first heard the  
sequel was coming and I am eagerly awaiting  
its arrival.  
▷ I’m a practitioner working in SD and have  
a strong bias towards doing over abstract  
thinking. I believe SD is a practical discipline  
that genuinely helps solve problems that other  
disciplines can’t. I also loved the first book \:\)  
▷ I believe that collaboration is the best way  
to improve and share experiences. TISDT is  
a book I refer to during work and it would be  
a great experience to be part of creating the  
new chapter for it.  
▷ I’d like to help and give back from my experi-  
ence from being a big enterprise company how  
I see this integrating.  
▷ I’ve been managing a business R&D unit  
working with the use of Lean Startup, Design  
Thinking and SD. I have practical experience  
of introducing these methods in the corporate  
environment, I saw some good patterns and  
pitfalls while doing that.  
xxii/xxiii  
▷ Doing is the hard bit!  
▷ I’ve got about 18 years of experience in design  
and development. The last 8 years have been  
in a SD capacity. So I have plenty of insight to  
offer SD Doing, for sure. I’m particularly inter-  
ested in techniques from \(eco\)system thinking.  
▷ I am always looking to push SD to the next  
base. And to make it a bona fide part of busi-  
ness operations.  
▷ I’m not that satisfied with current books.  
I also want to bring my experience with public  
SD in Brazil and NY!  
▷ Because I’m part of a Public Innovation Team  
in Colombian Government. We have the SD as  
a core approach and we have to face complex  
challenges, both outside and inside of public  
organizations.  
▷ We have set ourselves the goal of promoting  
the sector in Israel, to implement it in business  
and help organizations develop a better ser-  
vice strategy through design thinking.  
▷ The TiSDD course changed my outlook not  
only for an important project at my current  
company, but also for what I want to do in my  
career. I believe TiSDD will be a great refer-  
ence for marketers and content strategists.  
▷ Excited about this book for a while. Would love  
to provide some support in return for yours.  
▷ Want to be part of the future.  
▷ My mission is to coach 1 billion people in  
Design Thinking.  
▷ Keep the revolution going! Cheers! This is Service Design Doing

1.1 WHAT DO CUSTOMERS01 WANT?  
In your childhood, you might have played a game called  
Pass the Parcel. Before a party, a mystery gift would be  
wrapped in gift paper, then wrapped again and again until  
it became impossible to guess more than the basic form  
of what was inside. The kids playing the game would  
unwrap layers and layers, impatient to get to the middle.  
The offerings made by organizations – the products,  
physical and digital services02 we want – are wrapped  
in much the same way. The outermost wrapping is the  
­ behavior, manner, and tone of the staff member \(or  
technological interface\) we are dealing with. Under this  
is a layer of subject and system expertise made of that  
person’s or system’s knowledge of the offerings and op-  
erations. Then there is a layer of processes carried out by  
staff – for example, the sales or refund routines. Next, we  
have the systems and tools run by the organization – lo-  
gistics systems, billing, and point of sale systems. And at  
the core is the offering itself, like a telephone contract or  
a pair of running shoes.  
As a customer of an organization, you are like the  
child playing Pass the Parcel. The only way to get to  
the offering you want is through all those layers – they  
all contribute to your experience. Disinterested staff,  
misinformed employees, byzantine processes, and clunky  
systems can all make it less satisfying to buy or interact  
with the offering, making it less valuable to you.  
Traditionally, companies have focused heavily on  
the content at the core of the parcel, and perhaps the few  
innermost layers that let them deliver it. They concentrate  
on technical and operational excellence and they want to  
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE  
The experience of our offering is filtered by customers’ perception  
of our behavior, expertise, processes, systems, and tools.  
They only perceive our solutions through the veils of all these  
layers, usually starting with the outermost.03

02 03 In this book, we will generally use the word “customer” in its broadest sense as someone who receives the value  
we produce. In your world, you might use other words like “client,” “user,” “colleague,” “citizen,” “stakeholder,”  
or “boss.” When it is important to differentiate – for example, in a B2B case between a “user” who directly  
interacts with an offering and a “customer” who buys it – we will make a clear distinction.  
For more detail, see the textbox Stakeholder terminology in 3.4.  
The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In academia,  
products are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually bundles of services and physi-  
cal/digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as referring to something tangible, we prefer to speak  
of physical/digital products. Read more on this in the textbox on Service design and service-dominant logic in 2.5.

OFFERINGS This is Service Design Doing  
“get it right.” To them, their job is to optimize the nuts  
and bolts of their activity – like the hamburger restau-  
rant that invests heavily in new recipe development. Or  
they work hard at sales, telling the world that they have  
just what the customer needs to solve his problem – like  
the bank that strives to present a consistent image of  
trustworthiness.  
But is this core offering what the customer really  
cares about? In one study, researchers asked tens of  
­ thousands of patients about the factors that led to their  
hospital stay feeling satisfying or not.01 Now, most of us  
would expect the “medical outcome” – the successful  
healing of the ailment – to be one of the most important  
things to patients. After all, “healing” is the key value  
proposition of hospitals; it’s why people go there. But in  
the study, none of the top 15 satisfaction factors related  
to whether or not the patient’s health improved while  
at the hospital. Instead, the top factors usually related  
to interactions with personnel, including things like  
information flow, complaint handling, empathic and  
polite nursing staff, patient inclusion in decision making,  
a pleasant hospital environment, and the feeling of being  
cared for by a well-motivated team.  
Of course, if someone did not experience a good  
medical outcome, the situation might be different. When  
we become more sick, the medical part of the experience  
becomes eminently important. But until then, it seems  
that the core competency of the hospital – healing – is

In Putting Patients First\: Designing and Practicing Patient-Centered Care. San Francisco, CA\: Jossey-Bass.  
taken for granted by the patients.02 It’s not hard to imagine  
this in other situations. If you are a tourist, you don’t talk  
about your hotel room having a door, window, or bed  
until one is missing. If you are a CFO, you don’t rate your  
corporate accountants on their arithmetic skills until they  
lose you money. And at that point, the deficit becomes  
an issue. But otherwise, customers rate organizations  
on other factors.  
So at the hamburger restaurant, eaters actually  
care more about a warm greeting than an exciting new  
burger recipe. At the bank, clients worry more about the  
awful login process on the website than about ­ trusting  
the institution.03 As customers, it seems that we are  
less influenced by the core offering than by the layers  
of experience around it. So how might organizations  
understand better what their customers value, and use  
their knowledge of customers to systematically make  
that experience better?  
02 03 This phenomenon has been well documented and researched since the 1960s – e.g., Herzberg’s theory on  
motivators and hygiene factors\: hygiene factors only contribute to dissatisfaction if they are missing, but do  
not contribute to satisfaction if they are present, while motivators contribute to satisfaction if hygiene factors  
are fulfilled. Source\: Herzberg, F. \(1964\). “The Motivation-Hygiene Concept and Problems of Manpower.”

# Services? Products? Experiences?  
This book has the word “service” in the title, but the first few paragraphs talk  
about hamburgers and sports shoes. Are they services? Many business people make  
a big fuss about the difference between services and goods \(often colloquially  
called “products”\), and where exactly the distinction lies.  
“If my company offers it, it’s our  
product,” says one. “It’s only a ­ product  
if you can drop it on your foot,”  
says another. There are approaches  
which sidestep this discussion. Within  
­ service-dominant logic04 you will  
hear that tangible goods are merely  
distribution mechanisms for service  
provision – goods have been called  
“service avatars.” Or, the jobs-to-be-done  
approach suggests that customers “hire”  
a certain product or service to get a  
specific job done.05 Within these discus-  
sions, there are further questions around  
emotional, relational, and functional  
aspects of services and products.  
In this book, the word “product”  
is used to describe anything a company  
offers – no matter if this is tangible  
or not. To avoid confusion, instead of  
“goods and services” we often talk about  
“physical and digital products” as well as  
the products we call “services.”  
What all these terminology discussions  
have in common is that customers just  
don’t care. They pay their money \(or  
spend their time, or give their attention,  
or exchange something else they value,  
like data or votes or permission\), and  
they want organizations to co-create  
value with them – by helping them,  
by taking away their problems, or by  
realizing their goals. And while that  
is happening, they expect organiza-  
tions to provide an experience that  
reaches or exceeds their expectations,  
fits in with their lives, and meets their  
emotional needs. ◀

# 1.2 THE CHALLENGES FOR ORGANIZATIONS  
1.2.1  
Empowered customers  
The digital revolution has made customers’ demand for  
good experiences even more powerful. Where they once  
were often forced to take what they could get locally  
or find in the newspaper, they now have a huge choice.  
Indeed, it is often easier to buy from the other side of  
the planet than from the store across town. Customers  
have many channels for information or for purchase,  
even within one provider, and will switch between them  
at their convenience. They have more information, with  
price comparisons, alternative sources, trusted reviews,  
and a wealth of other data just a screen away.  
Social media amplifies this change, as customers  
seize the opportunity to share experiences with potentially  
millions of others. Conversations online are reshaping  
business,01 as users trust the words of peers far more than  
expensive advertising campaigns. Business-to-business  
\(B2B\) services may be less sensitive to social media, but  
word of mouth \(WOM\) seems to fulfill the same role  
here, with employee and customer referrals often named  
as the most effective sales generator.02 Whatever the  
numbers, we agree that when an organization mess-  
es up, the world will be told – and people will believe  
what they hear.  
01 02 This was already pinpointed in The Cluetrain Manifesto back in 1999. See Levine, R., Locke, C., Searls, D., &  
Weinberger, D. \(2010\). The Cluetrain Manifesto. Basic Books.  
Implisit, reported for example in eMarketer. “Referrals Fuel Highest B2B Conversion Rates.” \(2015, February  
10\) at https\://www.emarketer.com.  
Customer experience makes a difference to the  
bottom line, as plenty of studies have shown. As early as  
2009, it was estimated that poor customer experiences led  
to \$83 billion of lost business in the United States alone.03  
Companies that excel at customer experience outperform  
the market04 and are are more likely to be recommended  
by customers and more likely to see customers return and  
buy again;05 also most customers are willing to pay more  
if they are sure of a better experience.06  
It seems obvious that focusing on customer experience  
is crucial, so why do so many organizations get it wrong?  
They are made up of intelligent people who are doing  
good jobs, but they still manage to infuriate, anger, confuse,  
disappoint, or simply fail to impress customers.07 One of  
the answers is the way organizations are set up.  
03 04 05 06 07 See, for example, “The Cost of Poor Customer Service\: The Economic Impact of the Customer Experience and  
Engagement in 16 Key Economies” \(September 2009\) Genesys, e.g., at www.ancoralearning.com.au.

See, for example, RightNow/Oracle \(2011\). “Customer Experience Impact Report.” Retrieved from

Research findings support the conclusion that customers have lost their faith in business practices. Why?  
“Many marketers should confess that deep in their hearts consumers are never top priority”. In their book  
Marketing 3.0, Philip Kotler et al. describe the development of marketing from being product-driven \(1.0\) to  
customer-centric \(2.0\) to human-centric \(3.0, and later also 4.0 to include every aspect of the customer’s jour-  
ney\). This includes a shift in product management from “The Four Ps \(product, price, place, promotion\)”  
to “Cocreation.” \(source Kotler, P., Kartajaya, H., & Setiawan, I. \(2010\). Marketing 3.0\: From Products to Custom-

1.2.2  
Silos  
Since industrialization, through movements like  
Taylorism08 and total quality management,09 organizations  
have focused on operational excellence and efficiency. In  
a mechanistic paradigm, they have understood their ac-  
tivities as a series of operational processes, and looked at  
optimizing each individual step, usually in terms of costs.  
After all, cost and efficiency are fairly simple concepts that  
offer convenient “levers to pull” for management. Whole  
organizational units \(we often say “silos”\) have been  
constructed around work functions that make sense to  
the company, with a dedicated collection of business tools  
set up to understand, track, and manage these functions  
and optimize them within the silo and from the company’s  
perspective – not the customer’s. It sometimes seems  
that anything outside the basic offering and the processes  
necessary to deliver the core value is mostly seen as an  
overhead, a cost center, or as a “soft factor” – something to  
be streamlined, cut away, perhaps left to chance or to the  
“soft factor specialists” in advertising and HR.  
So, these organizational silos reflect many of the  
layers of experience, putting them in the hands of separate  
teams. For example, when I buy my running shoes, the  
advice process might be designed by the Sales department,  
and the salesperson’s soft skills and specialist knowledge  
trained by HR. The salesperson will use sales and stock  
08 09 Taylorism, or scientific management, is a production efficiency methodology from the early 20th century. It  
was based on dividing work into the smallest meaningful subdivisions, each of which could be measured and  
optimized to ensure the perfect flow of actions by the worker.  
Total quality management is a business methodology most famous in the 1980s and 1990s that attempted  
to continuously improve the quality of products and services using feedback loops and the systematic analysis of  
work processes.  
6/7  
systems developed by IT, explain a returns procedure  
drawn up by Legal, and finally sell me a pair of shoes de-  
signed by R&D or bought in by Purchasing. The situation  
becomes even more knotted when my relationship with  
the company grows longer and more silos come into play.  
All these people are good at their jobs, so their  
work inside their silos becomes more efficient from year  
to year while helpless customers bounce between them.  
Of course, there are calls and efforts to work together –  
but how exactly should this happen? People in different  
suborganizations have their own viewpoints on what  
is important, their own measures of success, their own  
key performance indicators \(KPIs\). There are tools like  
process diagrams which can indicate the contributions of  
different departments to the process, but these generally  
only include the customer if she is necessary for part of  
the process, or even exclude her completely. They can  
be used to promote efficient cooperation between silos,  
but not the understanding of the effect on the consumer.  
Even “Voice of the Customer” charts and quotes are  
often so widely shared that they lose all context and real  
­ customer needs are forgotten. And crucially, there are  
many parts of the customer journey that are ­ important  
to the customer, but which do not appear at all on  
traditional process visualizations. These are the parts  
of the journey which are not directly influenced by the  
­ organization, but which are an important part of the This is Service Design Doing

# United Breaks Guitars  
BY DAVE CARROLL  
I have been a professional singer-songwriter  
for over 25 years now, and  
on March 31, 2008, I was traveling to  
Nebraska with our band Sons of Maxwell.  
We’d stopped in Chicago to deplane  
and catch our connector when a fellow  
passenger looked out her window and  
declared, “Oh my God, they’re throwing  
guitars out there.” It turned out that my  
\$3,500 Taylor guitar was badly damaged,  
and this began my entry into a ­ frustrating  
customer service maze with United  
Airlines. After 9 months, I was told that  
because I did not open a claim ­ within the  
first 24 hours and instead waited 5 or 6  
days, United’s policy of taking responsibil-  
ity for the damage was excused.  
I responded by promising to write  
three songs and create three music videos  
that I would post to YouTube with a goal  
of receiving one million YouTube views in  
one year, with all three videos combined.  
While I followed through on the promise  
and the “United Breaks Guitars” trilogy  
was, in fact, completed in just over one  
year, the first video went viral immediately  
and reached one million views in just  
four days. It became the \#1 music video  
in the world for the month of July 2009  
and the center of a mainstream media  
frenzy. Today it has nearly 16 million  
views. United Airlines stock was report-  
ed to have been affected by a 10% drop  
in market capitalization, or a decrease  
of \$180 million in value, and that report  
made the music video relevant to busi-  
nesses everywhere. It was clear that social  
media was now more than just videos of  
a cat flushing a toilet. A single dissatisfied  
customer could affect the profitability  
of one of the world’s most recognizable  
brands with a \$150 music video.  
My story was featured on CNN,  
and virtually every major Western news  
agency. “United Breaks Guitars” was  
also an inspiration to countless unsatisfied  
consumers and I was inundated with  
8/9  
thousands of encouraging and grateful  
emails from customers around the world.  
“United Breaks Guitars” has become a  
textbook example of the new relationship  
between companies and their customers,  
and has demonstrated the power of one  
voice in the age of social media. It has  
become a benchmark case study in the  
­ customer service and music industries,  
as well as branding and social media  
circles. Another unexpected outcome of  
my story is that it led to a busy career as a  
speaker on the topic of customer experi-  
ence, branding, and the power of story.  
In sharing my message in over 25 countries  
to date, I discovered that I am a passionate  
advocate that companies become more  
compassionate to avoid problems altogether,  
and I enjoy teaching others how to become  
more effective storytellers in today’s frenetic  
and noisy environment. ◀

customer experience – like waiting, third-party reviews,  
or discussions with friends.01  
So, put a cross-functional team in a room together,  
and where should they start? Usually the basic tool of  
such cooperative attempts is the meeting, and the teams  
are faced with the colossal task of reconciling different  
worldviews and different terminologies by basically  
talking about it. It is no wonder that cross-functional  
cooperation is extraordinarily difficult, as each delegate  
honestly argues for his own point of view using his  
own specialized language.  
How can we make it easier for these people to  
­ cooperate and create new value together, so that each  
­ department sees the results as its own and is invested in  
their success? And how can we help them to orchestrate  
experiences across their silos, working together to create  
real satisfaction?  
1.2.3  
The need for innovation  
Most organizations feel a great pressure to innovate.  
They see innovation as something necessary and desir-  
able, and prioritize it as a goal in their work. It is often  
closely linked to generating a unique selling proposition  
\(USP\), and the innovation might be in terms of creating  
unique offerings – but it might also be in the internal  
processes that enable those offerings or even in the  
business model of the organization. Whichever of these  
01 Read more on proposition-centered journey maps and experience-centered journey maps in  
3.3.1, A typology of journey maps.  
applies, the need for innovation is driven by a changing  
and super-­ connected \(business\) world, an immense  
shortening of business cycles, and a general ubiquity of  
technology and information which makes it easier than  
ever to copy. If an offering has value and is easy to repro-  
duce, then it will be copied directly or indirectly, legally  
or illegally by people who have not had the development  
costs and can offer it cheaper. Even if they offer it at the  
same price, the result is the same – commoditization.  
There will be two or more similar offerings on the market,  
and a price war will loom.  
Innovation is often focused on pleasing the customer,  
because new features are not new for long. In various  
models of customer satisfaction,02 it’s clear that aspects  
of an offering that are initially seen as delightful soon  
become expected. One vivid example is wireless internet  
in hotels at the start of the 21st century. Initially, travelers  
were surprised and delighted to be able to use WiFi in  
hotels and were happy to pay for it. Soon, they expected  
to find it in every hotel, and began to grumble that the  
price was higher than at home. As we write, with WiFi  
available for free in coffee shops, cabs, and cheap buses,  
hotel guests “compare WiFi to hot water, electricity,  
or air”03 and are often annoyed or angry to see a charge  
for it on their hotel bill. In terms used by proponents of  
the Kano model,04 an excitement factor has degraded to

01 Why service design?  
01 Why service design?  
a performance factor and then a basic factor. Yesterday’s  
innovation is already out of date – a new one is needed.  
All this means that many organizations ­ prioritize in-  
novation as a key success factor. And as service becomes  
more and more visibly important for every business, the  
focus of their innovation turns to services. They attempt  
to meet the multilayered needs of users, not just impress  
with flashy new ads or product extensions.  
So, today’s companies look for ways to understand  
the needs of their customers in a way that will provide  
useful insights and spark interesting ideas. And they want  
a way to work on those ideas in cross-silo \(or cross-organizational\)  
teams, diversifying, filtering, testing, and  
evolving concepts until they are implemented as new or  
improved offerings, operations, or even business models.  
The innovation might be incremental or disruptive, so  
we need techniques that work for both of these.  
1.2.4  
Organizations are reacting  
It’s clear that many organizations today – from ­ startups  
to governments – understand the importance of  
­ innovating customer experience for their success. And  
this awareness is growing fast. Back in 2014, one study  
already predicted that 89% of companies expected to be  
competing mostly on the basis of customer experience  
by 2016 – in comparison to a meager 36% in 2010.05  
05 Sorofman, J. \(2014, October 23\)\: “Gartner Surveys Confirm Customer Experience Is the New Battlefield,”  
at www.blogs.gartner.com.  
10/11  
When organizations understand the importance of  
customer experience, they often start tracking satis-  
faction. The most visible tools are online and offline  
surveys, or the Net Promoter Score \(NPS\)06 in particular,  
with thousands of organizations asking “How likely is it  
that you would recommend our company/product/ser-  
vice to a friend or colleague?” This valuable metric faces  
the challenge of many quantitative measurements\: when  
your NPS slumps, you know that you have a problem,  
but not why. Strong Voice of the Customer loops and  
listening points can show more, but do not in themselves  
offer solutions. They tell you how big your problem is,  
and perhaps where it comes from, but not how to fix it or  
how to innovate.  
NPS and similar metrics can help show problem  
areas – often they pinpoint silo thinking as a source –  
but there is an old adage that weighing the goose will not  
make it fatter. So, organizations are looking for new,  
reliable, and scalable ways to move beyond measure-  
ment and innovate experiences strategically across silos.  
Increasingly, they turn to what we call service design.07

might want to watch out, because some people have very strong opinions about what exactly terms like service  
design and design thinking and all those others really mean. Other people are quite relaxed – for example,  
some people will use the term “service design” to refer to almost any kind of service development work, while  
others will point out that strictly the phrase refers to one particular approach with its historical origins in the  
design studio. It might get a bit tricky when these people try to have a conversation about “service design,”  
without realizing they mean very different things. With “design thinking,” the situation is even worse. Does  
the person mean this great approach, or that splendid version, or do they mean every way of applying design  
principles to business challenges? There are certainly many flavors available – fortunately! – and they all have  
something to offer. But dwelling on the differences is not always useful. On the whole, unless you really enjoy  
this kind of discussion, we think you are better off just getting on with doing it. This is Service Design Doing

PRACTITIONERS SPEAK  
“Service design applies design thinking to services and  
­ focuses on doing \(not just talking\). Service design skills  
are useful because they can transform employees and  
managers to be truly user-centered.”  
— Julia Pahl-Schoenbein  
Senior project leader for  
business development, Germany  
“I got interested because design thinking and service design  
put ­ customers and users at the center of their ­ methodology  
and framework – they provide a holistic view of the ­ solution  
and make it easy to identify gaps in the experience.”  
— Musa Hanhan  
Executive at a business software company, US  
“I love the fast, iterative cycle of the process, and  
that you don’t need to get it right the first time. ‘Sh!tty first  
drafts’ are powerful!”

“My challenge was how to collaboratively generate service  
ideas that work; and how to guide/facilitate that process.  
Service design meets these challenges.”  
— Carola Verschoor  
Creativity and change professional, Netherlands  
“The challenge I was facing was to build a coherent multi-channel  
service. I needed a way to visualize the stages and  
parts of the service in order to identify and communi-  
cate the issues, as well as trying to improve matters for all  
concerned. Service design answered all of this through its  
toolset, specifically service blueprints, user journeys, and  
­ stakeholder maps, and allowed me to bring in ­ others to  
understand the overall picture. Service design also helped  
set a base for research that was needed and then provided  
­ guidance on how to distill that ­ information to a man-  
ageable format.”

“While service design is quite often thought of in a B2C  
context, I find it very useful in a B2B environment. Here,  
we employ service design tools such as customer journey  
maps and stakeholder maps for the company we are doing  
business with, as well as for their customers. The biggest  
benefit is leveraging the designer’s mindset in framing the  
problem or opportunity. We spend a lot more time up front  
framing the problem, making it more likely we will design a  
service that results in a better experience for our customers  
and their customers.”  
— Jeff McGrath  
Business advisor, US  
“Service design helps policymakers focus their minds on  
the impact a policy is likely to have on the people who use  
government services. It lets us prototype policies early in  
the process, to learn where a policy is likely to fail, and to  
design improvements that we can be confident will work in  
the real world.”

# 1.3 WHY A SERVICE DESIGN APPROACH?  
EXPERT TIP  
“It is critical to frame  
the problem or oppor-  
tunity carefully. Many  
companies fail because  
they address the wrong  
problem or miss an  
opportunity altogether.  
It seems they spend too  
little time framing \(and  
asking questions\) up  
front, resulting in a jump  
to the solution based  
on their biases and  
not on the customer’s  
needs or desires.”

Jeff McGrath  
There are many ways to create or improve the value  
generated by an organization. People working on this  
challenge might call what they do service engineering,  
or marketing, or quality, or simply management. A few  
of them – a growing minority – refer to this work as  
service design. They share a certain outlook and often  
a common toolset.01 Service design adopts the mindset  
and workflow of the design process, combining an active,  
­ iterative approach with a flexible and relatively light-  
weight set of tools borrowed from marketing, branding,  
user experience, and elsewhere.  
It is its patchwork background that makes service  
design powerful. As a design discipline, it is focused on  
solving the right problem – by framing the problem or  
opportunity in the right way. So service design usually  
starts by investigating the needs of the user or customer.  
It is inquiring and inquisitive, using a range of mostly  
qualitative research methods to explore the “how and  
why” of the opportunity space. Understanding needs,  
instead of jumping straight to a “solution,” makes true  
innovation possible.  
Next, service design adopts the designer’s approach  
of rapid experiments and prototyping to test possible  
solutions quickly and cheaply while generating new  
­ insights and ideas. Prototypes evolve into pilots, and then  
into implemented new offerings – and along the way  
there is always iteration. With this strong emphasis on  
iterations of research, prototyping, and even implemen-  
tation, service design projects have a firm foundation  
in reality. They are built on research and testing, not on  
opinion or \(rapidly outdated\) authority. And the iterative  
approach makes decision making in service design a  
low-stakes activity. Instead of worrying about getting it  
right the first time, we can evolve a range of options,  
and rely on the structured process of prototyping and  
testing to test and improve our work.  
Many organizations are looking for an effective way  
of working which makes it easy for people with ­ different  
backgrounds and responsibilities to work together  
meaningfully and productively – they are looking for a  
“silo breaker.” Because the tools of service design have  
been filtered through a design mentality, they are visual,  
fast, lightweight, and easy to grasp. They form a common  
language for collaboration, so cross-functional teams are  
happy to pick them up and get on with it. The tools can  
look very simplistic at first sight – they make no effort  
to encompass the entire complexity of a service system  
\(there are already excellent tools for that\). Instead, they  
filter complexity through the lens of various customer  
experiences. This makes the approach very powerful\:  
even complex multichannel services become manageable  
for the team when they can understand them on both a  
practical and a human, empathic level.  
01 See Chapter 3, Basic service design tools. 01 Why service design?  
Service design is not only useful to create value  
for the “end user” or “customer.” It addresses the entire  
value ecosystem, and might focus on offerings aimed  
at end users, other businesses, internal partners,  
or colleagues. In other words, service design works for  
public services, B2C, B2B, and internal services.  
Service design is an intensely practical and pragmatic  
activity, and this makes it inherently holistic. To create  
valuable experiences, service designers must get to grips  
with the backstage02 activities and business ­ processes  
that enable the frontstage success, and address the implementation  
of these processes. They must tackle the  
end-to-end experience of multiple stakeholders, not just  
individual moments. And they must find a way to make  
it pay, considering the business needs of the organization  
and the appropriate use of technology.03  
With these characteristics, it is no wonder that many  
organizations are implementing service design methods  
under whatever name, and that many more are employing  
service design agencies. Examples in this book alone  
include banks, airlines, hospitals, manufacturers, telcos,  
02  
03 “Backstage” refers to processes or actions that are normally not visible to the customer, such as checking in the  
store room or emptying the trash. “Frontstage,” then, refers to the parts of the process that a customer can see.  
In the epilogue of their book Marketing 4.0, “Getting to WOW!,” the authors and Setiawan state that “In a  
Marketing 4.0 world where great products and great services are commodities, the WOW factor is what differ-  
entiates a brand from its competitors.” A WOW moment is a surprising, personal, and contagious experience  
a customer has. “Winning companies and brands are those that do not leave WOW moments to chance.  
They create WOW by design.” See Kotler, P., Kartajaya, H., & Setiawan, I. \(2016\). Marketing 4.0\: Moving from  
Traditional to Digital. John Wiley & Sons, p. 168.

nonprofits, educational in­ stitu­ tions, tourism operators,  
energy companies, governments, and more – with more  
organizations turning to this approach every day.  
Organizations are faced with the challenge of provid-  
ing new and better services and end-to-end customer  
experiences across multiple channels. Service design’s  
borrowed toolset and pragmatic iterative approach uses  
research and sensemaking tools to focus on ­ stakeholder  
needs, and prototyping to test and evolve possible  
­ solutions before making large investments. Organizations  
can use service design to improve the services that they  
offer now and to develop whole new value ­ propositions,  
perhaps based on new technology or new market  
­ developments. It gives organizations a way to balance  
their experiential, operational, and business needs in a  
robust but approachable manner, offering an unusually  
powerful common language and toolset for projects  
that include, empower, and mobilize a wide range  
of stakeholders. This is Service Design Doing

# 2.1 DEFINING  
# SERVICE DESIGN  
Service design can help solve some important challenges  
faced by organizations. You hold a book in your hand  
which tells you how to do service design. But what  
does that term mean? It is something about customer  
­ experience, and innovation, and collaboration – but does  
it include everything related to those concepts, or is it  
just part of those worlds? Is every activity concerned  
with creating, planning, fixing, and shaping services part  
of “service design”? Do service designers even agree on  
what they do? Some people like to start with a definition,  
so in mid-2016 we asked 150 service designers to share  
and vote on their favorites. Here are the most popular\:  
“Service design helps to innovate \(create new\) or  
improve \(existing\) services to make them more useful,  
usable, desirable for clients and efficient as well as  
effective for organizations. It is a new holistic, multi-  
disciplinary, integrative field.” – Stefan Moritz01  
“Service design is the application of established design  
process and skills to the development of services. It is a  
creative and practical way to improve existing services  
and innovate new ones.” – live|work02

COMMENT  
“Lumpers will often  
argue it is all about the  
mindset. Being open,  
empathetic, asking  
questions, starting with ‘I  
don’t know,’ and learning  
by doing. You can call  
yourself anything you  
like, but if you share  
this mindset you are a  
service design thinker …  
or rather a service  
design do-er.”  
—  
Arne van Oosteroom  
And the most popular definition with our panel of  
150 colleagues\:  
“Service design helps organizations see their services  
from a customer perspective. It is an approach to  
designing services that balances the needs of the cus-  
tomer with the needs of the ­ business, aiming to create  
seamless and quality service experiences. Service de-  
sign is rooted in design thinking, and brings a creative,  
human-­ centered process to service improvement and  
­ designing new services. Through collaborative meth-  
ods that engage both customers and service ­ delivery  
teams, service design helps organizations gain true,  
­ end-to-end understanding of their services, ­ enabling  
holistic and meaningful improvements.”01  
– crowdsourced by Megan Erin Miller  
Many service design tools are mind hacks that help  
us reframe problems in a way that humans can handle  
better. We shape slippery data into human forms  
and visual stories which we can understand from any  
viewpoint – technical, specialist, or simply empathic.  
Instead of designing complex systems directly, we try  
to answer simple “How might we ...?”questions. And  
rather than trying to interpret each other’s words, we  
communicate by building prototypes.

Other names  
Listen in on a group of service design practitioners –  
whether they consider themselves “designers” or  
not – and you will hear two types of conversation  
when it comes to terminology. Just like when paleon-  
tologists discuss taxonomy, you will find the “splitters”  
and the “lumpers.”  
The splitters will talk about the differences between  
service design, experience design, design thinking, ho-  
listic UX, user-centered design, human-centered design,  
new marketing, and even more.  
The lumpers will point out that these approaches have  
far more in ­ common than they have differences, and sug-  
gest that names matter far less than the principles that  
these practices all share. The authors of this book belong  
very firmly in the “lumpers” camp. Honestly, we don’t  
care what you call it, as long as you are doing. 02 What is service design?  
# 2.2 DIFFERENT VIEWS  
Service design can be explained in many ways. In different  
situations, each of these can be useful – or misleading.  
Each one, however, is only part of the picture.  
2.2.1  
Service design as a mindset  
If a mindset is a collection of attitudes that determine  
our responses to various situations, service design can  
easily be thought of as the mindset of a group of people  
or even an entire organization. A group with a ­ service  
design mindset will talk about users first, will see  
­ “products” as the avatars of a service relationship, will  
respond to asserted assumptions by suggesting some  
­ research, will reject opinions and endless discussion in  
­ favor of testing prototypes, and will not consider a proj-  
ect finished until it is implemented and already generat-  
ing insights for the next iteration. As a mindset, service  
design is pragmatic, co-creative, and hands-on; it looks  
for a balance between technological opportunity, human  
need, and business relevance.  
2.2.2  
Service design as a process  
Design is a verb, so service design is often described as  
a process. The process is driven by the design mindset,  
trying to find elegant and ­ innovative solutions through  
20/21  
iterative cycles of research and ­ development. Iteration –  
working in a series of repeating, deepening, explorative  
loops – is absolutely central, so practitioners aim for  
short cycles at the outset, with early user feedback, early  
prototyping, and quick-and-dirty experiments. As the  
process continues, the iteration may slow down but it  
never goes away, as prototypes iterate into pilots and  
pilots iterate into implementation.  
2.2.3  
Service design as a toolset  
Ask anyone to imagine service design, and they will  
usually imagine a tool – perhaps a customer journey  
map hanging on the wall, or simply people pointing at  
sticky notes. Those templates and tools sum up service  
design in many people’s thoughts. Talk about tools seems  
to dominate talk about service design, so it’s tempting  
to imagine service design as a sort of toolbox, filled with  
fairly lightweight and approachable tools adopted from  
branding, marketing, UX, and elsewhere. This is not the  
whole story, by any means – without a process, mindset,  
and even common language, those tools lose much of  
their impact and may even make no sense. Used well,  
however, the tools can spark meaningful conversations;  
create a common understanding; make implicit knowl-  
edge, opinions, and assumptions explicit; and stimulate  
the development of a common language. This is Service Design Doing  
One of the main aims of service design, or design  
thinking, or whatever we call it, is to break down silos  
and help people co-create. Do we want to set up our  
own silos at the same time, saying “This is service  
design,” “That is design thinking,” “This is UX,” and so on?  
That makes no sense.  
COMMENT  
“Everyone likes to  
focus on processes and  
toolsets because they  
can see, touch, and use  
them. But without the  
service design mindset,  
people go right back to  
employing the processes  
and tools just like they  
used BPM and  
other ‘improvement’  
approaches. Then they  
end up with the same  
internally focused  
solutions with the same  
awful customer experi-  
ences they have today.”  
—  
Jeff McGrath  
2.2.4 Service design as a cross-disciplinary  
language  
Service design is almost dogmatically co-creative,  
and many practitioners pride themselves on their ability  
to connect people from different silos, bringing them  
together around some seemingly simple tools that they  
all find meaningful and useful. These tools and visual-  
izations – sometimes called boundary objects01 – can be  
interpreted in different ways by the different specialists  
working on them, allowing them to collaborate success-  
fully without having to understand too much of each  
other’s worlds. They are simple enough to be easily –  
even empathically – understood, yet robust enough to  
provide a good working foundation. In this way,  
service design can be seen as a common language or  
even “the glue between all disciplines,”02 offering a shared,  
approachable, and neutral set of terms and activities for  
cross-disciplinary cooperation.  
01 02 See the textbox Boundary objects in 3.2.  
Arne van Oosterom on design thinking, as written on the wall at the Design Thinkers premises in Amsterdam.  
2.2.5 Service design as a management  
approach  
When service design is sustainably embedded in an  
organization, it can be used as a management approach  
to both the incremental innovation of existing value  
propositions and radical innovation for completely new  
services, physical or digital products,03 or even ­ businesses.  
An iterative service design process always includes  
­ collaborative work in a series of loops. In this way, service  
design as a management approach has some similari-  
ties to other iterative management processes.04 However,  
service design differs through using more human-centric  
key performance indicators, more qualitative research  
methods, fast and iterative prototyping methods for  
both experiences and business processes, and a specific  
approach to leadership. Its inclusion of internal stakehold-  
ers and view across the customer journey often results in  
changes to organizational ­ structure and systems.05  
03 04 05 The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In academia,  
products are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually bundles of services and  
physical/digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as referring to something tangible, we prefer to  
speak of physical/digital products. Read more on this in the textbox on Service-dominant logic in 2.1.  
Compare a service design process, for example, with the iterative four-step “PDCA” \(Plan–Do–Check–Adjust,  
or sometimes also Plan–Do–Check–Act\) management process. This is often used in business for project man-  
agement and the continuous improvement of processes, products, or services. While both PDCA and service  
design processes describe an iterative sequence, PDCA focuses on improving defined KPIs that can be measured  
quantitatively. This means iterations only occur from loop to loop, but not within a loop.  
A design process, however, does not restrict iterations at any moment.  
Read more on this in Chapter 12, Embedding service design in organizations. 02 What is service design?

Birgit Mager  
People – especially ones with a design school background –  
often speak of service design as if the term included all  
activities involved in planning and designing services.  
But if we look at the history of service design, we see  
that it is just one approach to working on services, one  
which grew out of design methodology in the 1990s and  
2000s and was developed by designers. Crucially, service  
­ designers represent only one of many professions that  
create and shape services, including systems ­ engineering,  
marketing and branding, operations management,  
­ customer service, and “the organization.”  
That list of important service makers comes from  
Brandon Schauer of Adaptive Path, who back in 2011  
did some rough calculations06 and estimated that around  
\$2 billion was spent each year in the United States on  
the planning and design of services, but only \$70 million  
\(about 3.5%\) of this was spent on “service design.” The  
other 96.5% of the work was done by people who did not  
consider themselves service designers, and had possibly  
never heard the term.  
Things are changing. More recently, customer  
­ experience has become overwhelmingly important for  
many organizations, and design \(more usually, “design  
thinking”\) has become a key innovation and manage-  
ment methodology. Sitting firmly at the intersection  
of design thinking and customer experience, service  
06 Brandon Schauer, presentation at SDN conference San Francisco 2011 and available at Schauer, B.  
\(2014\). “The Business Case for \(or Against\) Service Design,” at https\://www.slideshare.net.  
design is now more visible than ever. Service, as it is  
­ traditionally ­ defined, is often said to make up the lion’s  
share of most developed economies.07 And design is the  
process of ­ making sure something fits its purpose – so  
service design can potentially be applied to the shaping  
of much of ­ human activity. At the very least, it has a  
place in ­ incremental and radical service development, in  
innovation, in the improvement of services, in ­ customer  
experience work, in education, in empowerment,  
in government, and in the strategy of organizations.  
07 From the point of view of service-dominant logic, it’s basically everything. This is Service Design Doing  
# 2.4 WHAT SERVICE DESIGN ISN’T  
Even in closely related fields, there is confusion about  
what service design should and can do. So here are a few  
things which service design certainly is not.01  
2.4.1 It is not simply aesthetics or “putting  
lipstick on a pig”  
The aesthetics of a service are not unimportant,  
but they are not the primary focus of service design.  
Service ­ designers are much more concerned with  
­ whether a service works, whether it fulfills a need and  
creates value, than details of what it looks or sounds  
like. The aesthetics can be a part of those questions,  
but only a part.  
Service design does not only address superficial,  
“cosmetic” aspects of services – the frontend, or the  
usability. In fact, service design looks not just at how a  
service is experienced, but also how it is delivered and  
even whether it should exist. It almost always goes far  
beyond the visible, to challenge and reshape everything  
from operations to the business model.  
2.4.2 It is not simply “customer service”  
“Customer service” – the cliché in stock photos is a  
toothsome model with a headset – could be the subject  
of a service design project. We could look at the  
customer needs and how the hotline specialist fulfills  
them, how she fits into the structures of her organization,  
what technology she uses to help customers, and how  
she creates value for the organization. But we would also  
ask ourselves how the company’s offering might be better  
delivered to make her task unnecessary or ­ unrecognizable.  
Service designers do not \(only\) solve customer ­ problems;  
they design value propositions, processes, and  
business models.  
01 Ask Adam about the term “service design” and he will say, “I hate-hate-hate the term. It’s made up of two  
simple words which most people misunderstand. ‘Service,’ they think, is being nice to customers, or fixing stuff.  
And ‘design,’ of course, is making things look nice. So ‘service design,’ they think, must be ... something which  
involves being nice to customers and making things look nice. So they smile, and nod, and walk away.”  
2.4.3 It is not simply “service recovery”  
Service design does not only come into play when things  
go wrong. It is not an “after sales” cost center or optional  
extra. Service design addresses the entire customer or  
employee journey, from becoming aware of a need all  
the way to becoming a regular customer or leaving the  
service relationship. It asks what service should be of-  
fered, how it should be experienced, and yes, even what  
happens when things go wrong. But it is fundamentally  
concerned with creating services that people value, not  
just repairing mistakes. 02 What is service design?

# 2.5 THE PRINCIPLES OF  
# SERVICE DESIGN, REVISITED  
2.5.1  
COMMENT  
“Services are co-created,  
in the sense that  
different stakeholders  
are involved in innovat-  
ing services. Working  
together, understanding  
the way people perceive  
services, how they use  
them and how they  
would love to use them  
is a driver for change.”

Birgit Mager  
The original  
In the 2010 prequel to this book, This is Service Design  
Thinking,  
02 the authors collected five principles of service  
design thinking which have been widely quoted \(and  
misquoted\) ever since. Should they be re-examined?  
The principles were\:  
1 User-centered\: Services should be experienced  
through the customer’s eyes.  
2 Co-creative\: All stakeholders should be included in  
the service design process.  
3 Sequencing\: The service should be visualized as a  
sequence of interrelated actions.  
4 Evidencing\: Intangible services should be visualized in  
terms of physical artifacts.  
5 Holistic\: The entire environment of a service  
should be considered.  
02 Stickdorn, M., & Schneider, J. \(2010\)\: This is Service Design Thinking, Amsterdam\: BIS Publishers.  
Many of these principles have stood the test of time  
quite well, though they have evolved with the evolution of  
service design. Others bear re-examination.  
Service design remains a highly “user-centered”  
ap-  
proach. Some people ask, “What about the employees?”  
But in the 2010 version of the principles, the term  
“user” referred to any user of a service system, certainly  
including customers and staff. It might be clearer to say  
“human-centered,” clearly including the service pro-  
vider, the ­ customer and/or the user, as well as other  
stakeholders and even non-customers who are impact-  
ed by the service.  
In choosing the word “co-creative,” the authors  
included two different concepts. One was the technical  
meaning of “co-creation” in terms of the value generated  
by services – a service only exists with the participation  
of a customer, so value is co-created together. The sec-  
ond ­ concept was the idea of “co-design” – the process  
of creation by a group of people, usually from different  
backgrounds. People who practice service design have  
concentrated on this latter meaning.03 They emphasize  
the collaborative and cross-disciplinary nature of service  
design, and the power of service design as a language to  
break down silos.  
03 Many designers use the terms “co-creation” and “co-design” interchangeably. If in doubt, it’s best to ask  
for more detail. This is Service Design Doing  
With the term “sequencing,” we were reminded  
of the key role of the experience in service design, and  
of the interplay and relationships between the various  
moments, steps, or “touchpoints”01 that make up a service  
experience. Journey mapping is still the most visible and  
well-known tool in the field. The term “sequencing” is  
an unusual one which causes some people to stumble.  
In everyday conversations, the more common word  
“sequential” is often adopted.  
“Evidencing” was an acknowledgment of the intan-  
gibility of many parts of a service offering, and of how we  
can draw attention to the value created by a service, even  
if the activity takes place out of sight. The classic example  
of evidencing has always been the folded toilet paper in  
a hotel bathroom, signaling to you that your room has  
been cleaned since the last visitor was there. Evidencing –  
showing value – remains an important role and motor of  
service design, connecting it strongly to branding.  
“Holistic” was another choice that combined several  
concepts in one word. One was the relevance of all our  
senses to an experience; another was the wide variety of  
individual journeys that one service can engender; the  
last was the relevance of service design to the corporate  
identity and goals of the organization. Today, the word  
“holistic” is often used to remind us that service design-  
ers aspire to shape the entirety of a service, not just patch  
individual problems \(though that might be a good start-  
ing point\). They also aim to address the complete needs  
of the customer, not only superficial symptoms.  
2.5.2  
The new  
So what is missing in the original five principles? What  
has changed in service design, which is not shown here?  
One key characteristic of the service design approach  
which we cannot see in these principles is the emphasis  
on iteration – starting with small, cheap attempts and  
experiments, allowing them to fail, learning from the  
failure, and adapting the process along the way. This  
is often hard for people to grasp, as many of us come  
from a decide-plan-do background. It is an essential  
­ characteristic of a design-led approach.  
Another missing point might be service design’s  
pragmatic foundation on research and prototyping, not  
on opinions or lofty concepts. It is an essentially ­ practical  
approach, as we can see when Stanford colleagues  
­ describe design thinking as having a “bias toward action,”  
or when participants at jamming events02 wear T-shirts  
emblazoned with “doing, not talking” in many languages.  
But perhaps the most important point not ­ explicitly  
listed in 2010 is the imminent and central need for  
service design to be relevant to business. Although it  
is based on creating better experiences, it does this by  
understanding backstage processes and technological  
opportunities as well as the business goals of the organi-  
zation. No service design can be successful or sustainable  
if it does not make sense on the spreadsheet, as well as  
in the sketchbook.  
02 01 See the textbox Steps, touchpoints, and moments of truth in 3.3.  
The Global Service Jam \(http\://www.globalservicejam.org\), an international volunteer-run design event that  
takes place in around 100 cities each year, has played an important part in disseminating the service design  
approach worldwide. 26/27  
So we offer the new principles of service design doing\:  
1 Human-centered\: Consider the experience of all the  
people affected by the service.  
2 Collaborative\: Stakeholders of various backgrounds  
and functions should be actively engaged in the service  
design process.  
3 Iterative\: Service design is an exploratory, adap-  
tive, and experimental approach, iterating toward  
implementation.  
4 Sequential\: The service should be visualized and  
orchestrated as a sequence of interrelated actions.  
5 Real\: Needs should be researched in reality,  
ideas prototyped in reality, and intangible values evi-  
denced as physical or digital reality.  
6 Holistic\: Services should sustainably address the needs  
of all stakeholders through the entire service and  
across the business.  
Service design is a practical approach to the creation and  
improvement of the offerings made by organizations.  
It has much in common with several other ­ approaches like  
design thinking, experience design, and user ­ experience  
­ design, has its origins in the design studio, and harmonizes  
well with service-dominant logic.03 It is a human-centered,  
collaborative, interdisciplinary, iterative approach which  
uses research, prototyping, and a set of easily understood  
activities and visualization tools to create and orchestrate  
experiences that meet the needs of the business, the user,  
and other stakeholders.  
03 While we often refer to service-dominant logic in this book, we do not understand this as a school of thought  
superseding other theories, but rather as a valuable component within a growing, changing, and patchy body of  
knowledge. As Achrol and Kotler say\: “Some philosophers like Popper, Feyerabend, and Lakatos forcefully argue  
for theoretical diversity and against dominant paradigms \[...\]. Popper \(1959\) points out that because we never  
know for certain that our theories are correct, we should proliferate our theories as much as possible to encourage  
the growth of scientific knowledge.” Achrol, R. S., & Kotler, P. \(2006\). “The Service-Dominant Logic for Market-  
ing\: A Critique.” In R. F. Lusch & S. L. Vargo \(eds.\), The Service-Dominant Logic of Marketing\: Dialog, Debate, and

# Service design and service-dominant logic\: A perfect match  
BY MAURICIO MANHÃES  
Whatever economic sector an organization  
operates in, its core activity is service.  
Whether it produces screws, shampoos,  
cars, or chairs, its product is a service.  
All these products are created through  
service design processes, whether organiza-  
tions are aware of it or not.  
To better understand these statements,  
we need to get to know service-dominant  
logic, proposed back in 2004 by marketing  
professors Steven Vargo and Robert Lusch.01  
general framework to understand service  
\(singular, as the common trait among  
all products\) and services \(plural, as the  
output of specific service provisions\).  
These five axioms are\:  
Service-dominant logic  
Service-dominant logic \(SDL\) is more than  
a snapshot of the current world context.  
It presents an interesting review of human  
economic history, showing clearly that  
“services are the beginning, middle and  
end”02 of all economic activity. SDL offers  
11 foundational premises, which are  
grouped under 5 insightful axioms as a  
Put briefly, the axioms let us see all  
­ products as service, blurring the boundaries  
between tangible or intangible products  
\(1\). They help us understand that value can  
only be created through the interactions  
of multiple actors, which include and go  
beyond the obvious direct customer and  
the service provider \(2\). We also see that  
any service is only made possible by all the  
actors providing resources for it, not only  
the service provider \(3\). Products \(goods  
and/or services\) have no intrinsic values,  
only the ones perceived by a beneficiary  
\(4\). Finally, the co-creation of value only  
occurs through the coordination of  
human-created institutions and institutional  
arrangements \(5\).

trans, George. B. de Huszar, ed. Reprint, Princeton, NJ\: D. Van Nordstrand.  
03 Institutions are rules, norms, meanings, symbols, practices, and similar aides  
to collaboration. Institutional arrangements are assemblages of interdependent  
institutions. See Vargo, S. L., & Lusch, R. F. \(2016\).  
“Institutions and axioms\: an extension and update of service-dominant logic.”  
Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 44\(1\), 5–23.  
1 Service is the fundamental  
basis of exchange.  
2 V alue is co-created by multiple  
actors, always including the beneficiary.  
3 All social and economic actors are  
resource integrators.  
4 Value is always uniquely and  
phenomenologically determined by  
the beneficiary.  
5 Value co-creation is coordinated  
through actor-generated institutions  
and institutional arrangements.03 This is Service Design Doing  
What does this serve for?  
To help understand the axioms, let’s take a  
look at one apparently simple product\:  
a chair. When someone comes into contact  
with any object for the first time, what  
question does he ask? Probably “What is  
this for?” or “What does this serve for?”  
Right? So, what does a chair serve for? Is it  
just a separate seat for one person? Must it  
have a specific form, with a back and four  
legs? And what if a “chair” is not meant  
to be a seat, but is a historical object or  
a work of art? Is it still a “chair”? These  
kinds of questions can go on indefinitely.  
At the end, it turns out to be surprisingly  
difficult to define any object ­ precisely.  
Most likely, when people try to ­ describe an  
object, they do it through the perceived ser-  
vices provided by it. It’s almost ­ impossible  
to objectively define any object without  
­ tapping into the possible ­ potentials for  
action that we perceive it offers us.  
In other words, without understanding the  
set of possibilities of services that can be  
What, exactly, is a “chair”?  
It’s an orchestra of possibilities, different for each beneficiary.  
A B C D  
INSTITUTION—WHOLE  
\(CHAIR\)  
INSTITUTIONAL  
ARRANGEMENT  
INSTITUTION—PART  
\(SUBELEMENT\) 02 What is service design?  
provided by a certain “object,” it is not even  
possible to understand it. So, when the  
plain word “chair” is used by someone, it re-  
ally represents an orchestra of ­ possibilities, a  
large number of potential services, different  
for each beneficiary.  
As shown in the picture, a chair can  
represent \(A\) an ergonomic support for  
working hours, \(B\) a symbol of status,  
\(C\) a ladder, or \(D\) a work of art. Are  
they all “chairs”?  
By going back to the axioms, it becomes  
possible to understand a chair by under-  
standing its potential to act – that is,  
the services it provides \(1\). These services  
can only be co-created by a concerted effort  
of a multitude of actors, like ­ designers,  
­ engineers, production managers, decorators,  
salespeople, shop owners, and influencers –  
always including a specific beneficiary \(2\).  
As a matter of fact, a vast array of social  
and economic actors must integrate all  
sorts of resources to enable every product  
\(good and/or service\) that exists \(3\).  
What exactly each of these products is can  
only be determined by the perception of a  
specific beneficiary \(4\). In all these ­ cases, the  
potential services that a ­ product provides  
can only be understood as a designated  
coordination of institutions and institu-  
tional ­ arrangements \(5\). Basically, this is  
why all existing products were ­ created by  
a service design process, whether inten-  
tional or unintentional.  
Service design  
So, as well as offering an interesting  
review of human economic history with  
service at its center, SDL also sheds light  
on the role of service design. Specifically,  
it’s possible to build a definition of service  
design on axiom 5, stating that “service  
design is the process of coordinating  
designed institutions and institutional  
arrangements to enable the co-creation  
of value.”01  
Therefore, for various reasons, SDL is  
the perfect match for service design. SDL’s  
constant development continues to  
shed light on several important aspects  
relating to service as a broad concept, and  
also on specifics of service design.  
As well as providing a consistent discourse  
to understand service, it also guides us to  
30/31  
perceive any product \(good and/or service\)  
as an orchestra composed of a large  
­ number of players and instruments, of a  
large number of potential services.  
It makes the effort to designate innovative  
arrangements for it far clearer and more  
effective. In other words, it provides an  
immense creative energy for service design  
to create service innovations. This is one  
of the major contributions made by SDL  
to service design. ◀  
01 This is an interesting definition of service design, because it puts together a  
­ particular set of concepts\: 1. “value co-creation” focuses service design on  
enabling value co-creation; 2. “coordination” establishes service design as a  
coordination process; 3. “institutions” acknowledges institutions and institutional  
arrangements as the fundamental and intangible structures of all designed  
products; and 4. “actor-generated” permits us to define design, understood as  
a process that delivers evolutionary actor-generated results, as the ideal process  
to create institutions and institutional arrangements. This is Service Design Doing  
# THE 12 COMMANDMENTS OF  
# SERVICE DESIGN DOING  
1  
CALL IT WHAT YOU LIKE  
Service design? Design thinking? Service design thinking?  
Customer-centric innovation? It doesn’t matter what you call it.  
It matters that you do it.01  
2  
MAKE SH!TTY FIRST DRAFTS  
Don’t waste time on making early versions beautiful. In the  
early parts of a project, you are going for quantity, not ­ quality.  
Ideas don’t need to be complete, just good enough to be  
­ explored and thrown away. The more beautiful you make them,  
the harder they are to abandon. So be sh!tty, not pretty.02  
3  
YOU ARE A FACILITATOR  
Your clients’ knowledge beats yours – so keeping a diverse team  
of employees, experts, and even customers working together is  
the best thing a service designer can do. Help them by embracing  
mind hacks. Shape customer data into personas; explain processes  
as stories; break complex ideation down to “How might we …?”  
questions; build it, don’t describe it. Hack tasks into units you  
can deal with rationally and instinctively, but never forget the  
true complexities.03  
4  
DOING, NOT TALKING  
Opinions are great, and everyone always has at least one.  
But service design is based in reality. Instead of talking about some-  
thing for a long time, build stuff, test it, understand what needs to  
be improved, build it again. Show me, don’t tell me.  
Stop comparing opinions, start testing prototypes.04  
5  
“YES, BUT …” AND “YES, AND …”  
To open up your options and get some rough ideas to work on, use  
divergent thinking and methods \(“Yes, and …”\). To close down and  
get real, use a convergent approach \(“Yes, but …”\). Both of these are  
valuable. Design your own design process as a sequence of diverg-  
ing and converging methods. And change your group cooperation  
patterns to fit what you are trying to do.05  
6  
FIND THE RIGHT PROBLEM  
BEFORE SOLVING IT RIGHT  
When we see a problem, we want to jump right in and create a  
solution. But are we tackling the real problem, or just a ­ symptom of  
something deeper? Get out on the street and challenge your  
assumptions with research, before you consider how to change things.06 02 What is service design?  
7  
PROTOTYPE IN THE REAL WORLD  
Ideas always work in our heads \(or in shiny presentations\), and  
we always love our own ideas too much. Forget “good ideas” –  
aim for plenty of ideas and build good experiments to test and  
evolve those ideas through prototyping.07 Get out of the studio  
as soon as you can, moving on to interactive prototypes that  
you can explore and test with real users in the original context  
of your service.  
8  
DON’T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN  
ONE BASKET  
Triangulate your research with different research methods,  
researchers, and data types. Go for a big pile of ideas, not just  
one “killer” idea. And never, ever, have just one prototype.  
Prototypes are made to fail, and to teach you by failing.08  
IT’S NOT ABOUT USING TOOLS;  
IT’S ABOUT CHANGING REALITY  
A new journey map does not mark the end of a service ­ design  
project. An ideation workshop is not co-design. A survey  
of your employees does not reveal their real needs. Just like  
­ building a house shouldn’t end with an architect’s plan,  
a service design project shouldn’t end with ideas on paper.09  
9  
32/33  
10 PLAN FOR ITERATION;  
THEN ADAPT  
Service design is explorative, so you can never plan exactly  
what you will be doing each day. But you will need to plan your  
time investment and financial budget – so make plans that are  
flexible enough to allow you an adaptive and iterative process in  
the time you have.10  
11  
ZOOM IN AND ZOOM OUT  
As you iterate, keep switching your focus between small details  
or momentary exchanges, and the holistic service experience.  
12  
IT’S ALL SERVICES  
You can apply service design to anything – services, digital and  
physical products, internal processes, government offerings, em-  
ployee or stakeholder experience … It’s not just about making  
“customers” happy.11

In this book, we differentiate between tools and methods.  
Tools are concrete models, such as journey maps,  
spreadsheets, and storyboard templates. They usually  
follow a specific structure or are built on given templates.  
Methods are particular procedures to accomplish  
or approach something, such as conducting contextual  
interviews as a research method or doing desktop walk-  
throughs as a prototyping method.  
Tools represent “what” we use, while methods usually  
describe “how” we create and work with certain tools in  
service design projects, such as interviewing, synthesizing,  
and prototyping. This chapter introduces some of the  
basic tools we use in service design. We describe what  
these tools look like, their structure, their components,  
alternatives you have for these tools, and when and why  
you can use them. On this basis, Chapters 5–8 give de-  
tailed instructions on various methods that explain how  
to work with these tools in a service design project.

# 3.1 RESEARCH DATA  
EXPERT TIP  
“As a design researcher  
you should own your bias.  
Be explicit about the val-  
ues that determine your  
research agenda. And  
think of data collection  
as a process that is as  
creative as design itself.”  
—  
Mike Press  
Research data is one of the core tools of service design.  
Data is made up of facts that can be collected, synthe-  
sized, interpreted, and analyzed to answer research  
questions, to communicate findings, or even to help  
to predict future outcomes. Research activities collect  
countless facts, observations, and a variety of materials.  
This empirical data can be divided into raw data and  
interpreted data, also called first-order and second-order  
concepts, respectively.01 Raw data is any data collected  
during research that has not been filtered by a research-  
er, such as pure statistics like how many people enter a  
shop or videos of customers using a product.02 Raw data  
describes a situation without reflecting interpretations of  
the data by a researcher.  
Interpreted data, on the other hand, includes the  
researcher’s attempts to explain or understand the raw  
data. It summarizes patterns that researchers see in raw  
data or underlying concepts they find. As interpreted  
data reflects the reasoning of the researcher, it is affected  
by the researcher’s education, beliefs, and experience –  
but also by potential cognitive biases the researcher has.  
Interpreted data should be backed up by sufficient raw  
data to minimize potential cognitive biases.  
01 02 More on first-order and second-order concepts can be found in 5.1.3, Data collection.  
The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In academia,  
products are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually bundles of services and physi-  
cal/digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as referring to something tangible, we prefer to speak  
of physical/digital products. Read more on this in the textbox Service design and service-dominant logic in 2.5.  
Although researchers should strive to be agnostic  
during their research, it is almost impossible to collect  
completely unbiased data. Every decision from the  
­ moment a researcher plans the fieldwork – the ­ sampling,  
the methods applied, and so on – is a conscious or  
­ unconscious choice that influences the dataset and  
­ ultimately the research results.

# Assumption-based vs. research-based tools  
The first thing you should do when you have to work with a tool prepared by  
someone else \(e.g., a journey map or persona\) is to ask whether it is based on research  
or on mere assumptions. If it just based on assumptions, challenge it.  
Recognizing whether the content of tools  
used in service design is based on assump-  
tions or based on research helps you to  
understand how solid and credible a piece  
of work is. In particular, when you look  
at work by others, this factor indicates  
how much you should challenge what you  
see. Pinpointing the research behind the  
­ contents of a tool, for example as footnotes  
or a caption, increases the credibility of  
the content. Typically, the research state-  
ment contains all the important aspects of  
the underlying research design, including  
which research methods were used, how  
many interviews or observations were  
conducted when and where, and whether  
basic rules of theoretical saturation and  
triangulation were applied.01  
The information expressed using  
any service design tool, such as personas,  
journey maps, system maps, Business  
Model Canvases, and many more, can be  
based on assumptions or research.  
Assumption-based  
The content of these tools is based on  
­ assumptions and not research data.  
The quality of the information depends  
on the creator’s knowledge of the subject  
matter. Often, you can further distinguish  
between tools that are made “ad hoc,” a  
quick sh!tty first draft mostly used for  
research planning, and tools that have been  
created during a ­ co-creative workshop. The  
quality of the latter can be quite good, if the  
people who participated in the workshop have  
profound knowledge of the subject matter and  
the workshop was properly facilitated.  
Research-based  
The content of these tools is based on  
research data. If the research was done  
properly, research-based tools have a greater  
significance than assumption-based tools.  
Often assumption-based tools develop into  
research-based tools over time, as assumptions  
are challenged and research gaps are iden-  
tified and closed through iterative research  
loops. This needs more time and resources,  
but of course tools that are made to represent  
the current state of something are more robust  
and closer to reality if they are derived from  
real research. ◀

# 3.2 PERSONAS  
EXPERT TIP  
“Personas should have  
an expiry date of around  
12 months. In a year,  
a lot can change in  
terms of technology,  
organisational, and  
policy shifts – and you  
don’t want to design  
based on old data.”  
—  
Hazel White  
A persona is a profile representing a particular group of  
people, such as a group of customers or users, a market  
segment, a subset of employees, or any other stakeholder  
group. This profile is not a stereotype, but is an archetype  
based on real research. Personas, although fictional,  
help make groups with similar service needs more under-  
standable. However, note that people with specific service  
needs and goals will not necessarily align with traditional  
segments in marketing. Rather, the needs expressed in  
personas will often cut across several groups, thus break-  
ing down marketing silos that may hinder service design  
efforts. Whenever possible, personas should be based  
on research and represent a group of people with shared  
needs or common behavior patterns.02  
Personas can be used to share research findings and  
insights within your team and outside your team, across  
different departments or even across organizations. They  
are “characters” with which design teams can engage, and  
can serve as boundary objects to align an interdisciplin-  
ary team.03 They help a team to get onto the same page, to  
build empathy with customer groups, and to step into the  
shoes of different stakeholders, understand their needs,  
and review their tasks. Personas are a useful reference  
throughout the whole design process. They can develop  
into shared, empathic descriptions of a company’s

customer or target groups, described in a form that  
everyone can work with. Some companies even have  
life-sized cardboard cutouts of their personas. They can  
bring them to meetings to include a certain perspective.  
A  
Portrait image  
A representative photo or image. Avoid using images of  
celebrities to prevent prejudice and to increase authen-  
ticity. Alternatively, gender-, age-, and ethnicity-neutral  
sketches or photos showing common attributes, goals,  
motivations, tasks, or behaviors can be used to avoid  
stereotypical assumptions.  
B  
Name  
A name often reflects a persona’s heritage and social  
environment. Sometimes, archetypes are added  
as subheadings or used as an alternative to describe the  
represented stakeholder or target group.  
C  
Demographics  
Demographic information, such as age, gender, or geo-  
graphics, gives context to a persona and immediately cre-  
ates a specific image of a certain target group for a design  
team. This often also leads to stereotypical assumptions,  
so it should be used carefully. Demographics are often less  
meaningful for target group segmentation than they ini-  
tially appear and in fact can be misleading when predicting  
tastes or behavior. This is Service Design Doing

Mood images  
These photos or sketches enrich a persona with context.  
They illustrate a persona’s environment or behavior  
patterns, as well as goals and motivations. One common  
type of contextual image shows items that personas al-  
ways have with them in their pocket, purse, or bag. Mood  
images can also be used to add illustrative material to a  
written description.  
F  
Description  
The description can reveal characteristics, personality,  
attitudes, interests, skills, needs, expectations, motivations,  
goals, frustrations, brands or technologies the persona  
likes, or background stories. This information should  
include details that are important in the context of the  
research question or the company the persona is related to.  
Try to avoid using personas that don’t have information rel-  
evant to the specific design challenge or research question.  
G  
Statistics  
Visualized statistics summarize relevant quantitative  
information. Representative statistics can increase the  
­ reliability of a persona – in particular when used in a  
more quantitative-based management or marketing con-  
text. Statistics can be a starting point for personas or used  
to substantiate the more qualitative descriptions. 03 Basic service design tools

# Boundary objects  
“  
 Boundary objects are objects which \[…\] have different meanings in different social  
worlds but their structure is common enough to more than one world to make them  
recognizable, a means of translation. The creation and management of boundary  
objects is key in developing and maintaining coherence across intersecting social worlds.”01  
Sometimes people with different skills  
can understand each other better if they  
have a common artifact to look at.  
Let’s take the example of a journey  
map. A service design team ­ comprised  
of an expert in service design, a business  
person, and a software developer will  
probably all see different things in the  
map\: opportunities for a better experience,  
chances for cross-selling, or  
potential technology challenges. The  
interesting fact is that all three of them  
are looking at the same journey map,  
but each of them can extract what they  
need for their part of the project –  
­ information which might not be explicit  
in the journey map itself, but which

and Boundary Objects\: Amateurs and Professionals in Berkeley’s Museum  
of Vertebrate Zoology, 1907–39.” Social Studies of Science, 19\(3\), 387–420.  
their specialist eyes can see. While all  
of them look at the same object, they all  
identify different problem areas, come  
to different conclusions, and generate  
different ideas. In this case, the journey  
map acts as a “boundary object.” It helps  
people from different backgrounds and  
communities of practice02 to collaborate  
on a common task.03  
Boundary objects work best when  
they employ language and models that  
are easily understood across disciplines  
and functions. The artifacts act as a  
simple language, providing a unified  
form of communication across  
stakeholders. The service design tools

Conference on Design Research Society, 1–10.  
presented in this chapter can be used  
as boundary objects during various  
activities in the service design process  
for different purposes. However, they  
do not always necessarily serve as  
boundary objects continuously. While  
boundary objects are useful to co-create  
a shared understanding of a concept,  
at some point specialists also need to  
work within their own domain using  
their own technical language. Some of  
these service design tools can be used  
with very discipline-specific \(technical\)  
­ language that others do not understand.  
To bring their specific work back to  
the entire design team, specialists can  
modify existing service design tools  
or create new ones that serve again as  
boundary objects with a common lan-  
guage that is accessible for everyone. ◀ This is Service Design Doing  
# 3.3 JOURNEY MAPS  
EXPERT TIP  
“Journey maps are the  
most flexible tool we  
use with clients. We use  
them in three ways\:  
1\.  To visually and  
transparently  
gather user stories  
when interviewing.  
2\.  To understand how  
existing services work  
and uncover pain  
points and opportuni-  
ties for improvement.  
3\.  To envision  
future services.”  
—  
Hazel White  
A journey map visualizes the experience of a person over  
time. For example, an end-to-end customer journey map  
can visualize the overall experience a customer has with a  
service, a physical or digital product, or a brand. This might  
include recognizing a need, searching for a specific service,  
booking and paying for it, and using the service, as well as  
maybe complaining if something goes wrong, or using the  
service again.  
As a human-centered tool, journey maps not only in-  
clude steps where a customer is interacting with a company,  
but reveal all the key steps of an experience. Journey maps  
help us to find gaps in customer experiences and explore  
potential solutions. They can be used to visualize existing  
experiences as well as potential future experiences. Just as a  
movie is structured as a sequence of scenes, a journey map  
is structured as a sequence of steps \(often also referred to as  
events, moments, experiences, interactions, activities, etc.\).  
year 1  
Focus on 30 years\: end-to-end mortgage loan experience  
year 2 year 30  
day 14 Focus on year 1\: looking for and comparing mortgage loans  
day 15 day 16 day 17 day 48  
minute 7 Focus on day 15\: one-hour consultation meeting  
minute 15 minute 21 minute 24 minute 27  
Journey maps can have various scales and scopes,  
and you will usually need several to represent different  
aspects of one experience or service\: from a high-level  
map showing an end-to-end experience, to more detailed  
maps focusing on one step of a higher-level journey,  
to very detailed step-by-step descriptions of micro-inter-  
actions. The idea of different scales applies to any map.  
For example, when you are driving your car across the  
country, you need a larger-scale map showing the main  
express routes between cities. But when you get to your  
destination you need a smaller-scale street map to find a  
particular street and building.  
Different “zoom” levels of journey maps work just like  
this. A journey map can show 30 years of a mortgage-loan  
experience including searching for a house, signing  
contracts, living in the house, and making loan payments  
until the loan is paid off. Another one can zoom in even  
further and only illustrate a one-hour consultation meeting  
in detail. You can include different types of information in  
maps, depending on their purpose. When you compare  
different geographic maps, they might share some ­ general  
information, but also contain very specific data. For  
example, street maps might highlight data you need to  
drive, nautical maps will contain information for sailing,  
or mining maps will show exact positions of ­ mineral  
resources. You can find similar patterns in journey maps.  
They can contain specific information for different  
­ purposes, while sharing general data. 03 Basic service design tools

Journey maps make intangible experiences visible  
and facilitate a common understanding between team  
members. They are a way to visualize data in a simple  
and empathic way, but the quality of any map depends on  
the quality of the data it is based on. Journey maps make  
no ­ attempt to represent the full complexity of a service  
­ offering with all its options, such as decision trees or  
“if/then” loops. Instead, a journey map shows one typ-  
ical or particularly interesting instance of a service. It  
forms a boundary object01 that allows diverse teams to  
work together efficiently and creatively with a customer’s  
experience as the common denominator. Journey maps  
can develop into living documents that evolve and change  
over several workshops and research loops and that bridge  
different departments and stakeholders in organizations.02  
A  
Main actor  
A journey map always focuses on the experiences of  
one main actor, such as a group of customers or employees  
­ represented by a persona. Some journey maps also  
­ combine various perspectives in one map – for ­ example,  
comparing different customer groups or comparing  
­ customer experiences with those of employees.  
B  
Stages  
Stages represent the main phases of the main actor’s  
experience, such as, for example, the classic buyer de-  
cision process stages of “Problem/Need Recognition,”  
01 02 See the textbox Boundary objects in 3.2.  
For case studies on how to use journey maps in service design projects, see 5.4.4, Case\: Illustrating research data  
with journey maps, as well as 5.4.5, Case\: Current-state \(as-is\) and future-state \(to-be\) journey mapping.  
“Information Search,” “Evaluation of Alternatives,”  
“Purchase Decision,” and “Post-Purchase Behavior.” Stages  
help to structure a journey map and visualize its scale.  
Each stage normally contains several steps.03  
C  
Steps  
A journey map visualizes experiences as a sequence of  
steps from the perspective of the main actor. A step is  
any experience the main actor has, such as an interaction  
with another person, a machine, or a digital interface;  
but steps can also be activities, such as walking or waiting.  
The level of detail of each step depends on the overall  
scale of a journey map.  
D  
Storyboards  
Storyboards visually represent each step through  
­ illustrations, photos, screenshots, or sketches to tell the  
story of specific situations, including their environment  
and context. A storyboard increases our empathy with a  
journey map and allows quicker navigation.  
E  
Emotional journeys  
Emotional journeys are graphs representing the main  
actor’s level of satisfaction at each step, often on a scale  
from –2 \(very negative\) to +2 \(very positive\). An emo-  
tional journey visually reveals obvious problems within a  
specific experience.  
03 See Engel, J.F., Kollat, D.T., and Blackwell, R.D. \(1968\). Consumer Behavior; 1st ed., New York\: Holt, Rine-  
hart and Winston. 03 Basic service design tools  
F  
Channels  
Channels refer to any means of communication involved  
at a specific step, such as a face-to-face interaction, a  
website, an app, a TV advertisement, or a print adver-  
tisement. Specifying which channels the main actor is  
using helps us understand cross-channel experiences.  
A high-level map showing all possible channels pro-  
vides a comprehensive overview of alternative end-  
to-end journeys.  
G  
Stakeholders  
A list of stakeholders involved at each step of a journey  
map reveals which internal or external stakeholders are  
part of – or even responsible for – certain steps. This helps  
you to identify potential key actors that should be includ-  
ed in research, prototyping, and implementation.  
H  
Dramatic arc  
A dramatic arc illustrates the level of the main actor’s  
engagement at each step – for example, from 1 \(very  
low\) to 5 \(very high\). Such arcs of tension are a common  
concept in storytelling used in theater, movies, and books;  
in service design these arcs are often used to reflect on the  
pace and rhythm of an experience.  
I  
Backstage processes  
Backstage processes connect frontstage experiences visu-  
alized as steps of the main actor with backstage processes  
that are often visualized as flowcharts. Backstage processes  
reveal which departments and systems are involved or  
triggered at specific steps. A journey map that includes  
46/47  
backstage processes can provide the same information as  
a service blueprint. Often there are overlaps or hybrids of  
these two tools.  
J  
What if?  
The “What if?” lane asks at every step, “What could  
­ possibly go wrong?” This helps to check if ­ appropriate  
service recovery systems are in place. Important  
­ scenarios or problems that happen can then be visualized  
as separate journey maps.  
Job to be done  
The lane for jobs to be done \(JTBD, sometimes also called  
user/customer jobs\) describes what a particular service or  
product, whether physical or digital, helps the customer to  
achieve – either for the entire journey map or for ­ specific  
steps of it. This helps to move away from the current  
­ solution and create a new frame to look for ­ opportunities  
or to discover steps that do not provide value to a  
­ customer, but only exist due to the provider’s processes.  
Conversion funnel  
A conversion funnel visualizes conversion rates between  
relevant steps – for example, how many people enter a  
shop, how many take a look at a specific product, how  
many interact with staff, and how many actually buy  
it. Conversion analyses can be done for on- and of-  
fline journey maps. They reveal at which step the main  
actor leaves a certain process and prompt questions  
for further research into why the actor leaves at this  
specific moment. This is Service Design Doing  
# Dramatic arcs  
Dramatic arcs \(more usefully, “arcs of ten-  
sion”\) are a well-known lens in the world of  
show business. They describe the sequence  
and rhythm of high and low engagement  
in a piece or performance. From Aristotle  
to Hollywood to dance club DJs, insiders  
know that the dramatic arc can make or  
break the experience.  
But let’s talk services\: considering the  
dramatic arc of a service journey can give  
us new insights into how it is ­ experienced  
and why users might value or reject it. By  
marking moments of high and low en-  
gagement01 along a journey map, we can  
visualize the dramatic arc of an experience,  
and use it to understand the experience  
and focus our ideation.  
The classic “boom-wow-Wow-WOW-  
BOOOM”02 arc of a Bond film \(or rock  
concert\) is strikingly similar to the arc of a  
These can be identified by observing customers’ body language and facial  
expressions, by using survey techniques, or even using physical measurements  
\(like lie detectors – this method is, of course, highly intrusive\). Often, it is useful  
enough for ideation purposes if a team looks at the journey map and honestly –  
perhaps even cynically – assesses the user’s engagement at each step.  
For more on dramatic arcs and 007, see Lawrence, A. & Hormeß, M. \(2012\).  
“Boom! Wow. Wow! WOW! BOOOOM!!!\: James Bond, Miss Marple and Dramatic  
Arcs in Services.” Touchpoint \(4\)2.  
01 02 commercial experience like an ocean cruise  
or a visit to a Disney park, as you can see  
in the figure. It is a great ­ example of how  
­ successful arcs work, with a strong begin-  
ning \(“Boom!”\), rising ­ engagement with  
breaks for breath \(“wow!, Wow!, WOW!”\),  
very strong ­ crescendo \(“BOOOM!!”\), and  
a closing human ­ moment \(“Ah …”\). In the  
wild, you will encounter many other arcs –  
the possible ­ variations are infinite, and  
many work well while others flop.  
Service experiences also have drama­ tic  
arcs which are often unique, but which can  
benefit from analysis and variation even  
if they do not fit a common pattern. It’s  
important to remember that high engage-  
ment does not only come at exciting, loud,  
or “flashy” moments. A very quiet moment  
can be highly engaging too, if it is very  
relevant to the customer \(or audience\).  
Crucially, a high point on the dramatic  
arc is not necessarily “good” and a low  
point is not necessarily “bad.” The height  
of the dramatic arc represents engagement,  
not satisfaction.  
We might think of a high value as  
“thrill” and a low value as “chill.” Both  
have their place – it is the interplay which  
makes the difference.  
Try adding a visualization of the  
­ dramatic arc to your journey map. Is it  
overloaded? Frontloaded? Are early prom-  
ises fulfilled? Are the periods of low or high  
engagement too long? Must a highlight be  
added, or – this is often more practical –  
should a less engaging step be spotlighted  
to increase engagement and show value  
more clearly? Compare the arc with a  
visualization of the emotional journey. If a  
moment is unsatisfying \(a low dip on the  
emotional journey\) and also highly engag-  
ing \(a high peak on the dramatic arc\), this  
is especially dangerous. For example, it’s an-  
noying if a waiter spills soup on you at the  
diner \(low satisfaction, low engagement\).  
But if a waiter spills soup on your dress on  
your wedding day \(low satisfaction, very  
high engagement\), it’s a catastrophe. Ideally,  
your most pleasing experiences will be at  
moments of high engagement. ◀BOOOM!!!

Qualitative research data  
Qualitative research data – such as quotes from cus-  
tomers or employees, observations from researchers,  
or videos, photos, and screenshots – enriches a journey  
map and improves its credibility.  
Quantitative research data  
Quantitative data such as statistics and metrics of,  
for example, satisfaction surveys for specific steps or  
channels can improve the reliability of a journey map  
and substantiate qualitative research data.  
Custom lanes  
Further lanes can be added to visualize project-specific  
content; for example, key performance indicators \(KPIs\),  
references to other journey maps or documents \(files,  
links, etc.\), responsibilities, or indicators of reliability  
\(assumption-based vs. research-based\).  
3.3.1  
A typology of journey maps  
Even though most journey maps share the described struc-  
ture, you will still find a wide variety of different types of  
journey maps. What a journey map represents, its quality,  
its focus, and its level of detail depend on many factors.  
The following list summarizes four useful factors  
worth considering when you create a journey map or  
when you need to evaluate or work with journey maps  
created by others.  
1\. Reliability\: Assumption-based vs.  
research-based journey maps  
Always check if a journey map is assumption-based or  
research-based, as this is one of the crucial factors for  
its reliability.01  
2\. State of journey map\: “Current-state”  
vs. “future-state” journey maps  
A journey map can visualize the current experience \(a  
“current-state” journey map\) or can be used to visualize  
future experiences \(a “future-state” journey map\).02  
Current-state maps describe how someone experiences  
an existing service or physical/digital product.  
Current-state journey maps are mostly used to find gaps  
in an existing experience and identify opportunities to  
improve services and physical or digital products. They  
can serve as boundary objects between team members  
or departments of an organization, between diverse  
­ members of an interdisciplinary co-creative team,  
or between an agency and its client to clearly communi-  
cate the gaps within the customer experience.  
Future-state journey maps visualize the potential  
experience someone might have with a not-yet-existing  
service or physical/digital product. Future-state journey  
maps help people to imagine, understand, and even  
­ experiment with the potential experience and context of  
use. They can help to select which aspects or specific  
steps should be prototyped and tested.  
01 02 See the textbox Assumption-based vs. research-based tools earlier in this chapter for more details.  
See 5.4.5, Case\: Current-state \(as-is\) and future-state \(to-be\) journey mapping, for an example of how to use both  
current-state and future-state journey maps in a service design project. 03 Basic service design tools  
3\. Main actor/perspective\: “Customer” vs.  
“employee” journey maps  
Although journey maps are mostly used to visualize  
customer experiences, they can also be used to visualize  
experiences of other stakeholders such as employees.  
Well-motivated staff is a key factor in delivering good  
­ customer experiences, so considering the employee  
experience can be a very valuable exercise. An employee  
journey map might cover the daily routines or monthly  
sales cycle, and strive to understand how the employee  
experience could be enhanced.  
Other journey maps actually combine the experience of  
a customer with the experience of an employee. Here, inter-  
actions between customer and employee become visible as  
well as the employee actions that take place backstage  
\(e.g., while the customer is waiting\). On the other hand,  
these combined journey maps can also help to reveal  
­ problems customers experience during activities beyond  
the reach of employees – for example, what do ­ customers  
do when they have to wait for an hour while their car  
is repaired?  
4\. Scope and scale\: High-level vs.  
detailed journey maps  
One of the biggest questions when creating journey maps  
is how to select the scale\: Where do you start? Where do  
you end? What should you focus on? Which “zoom level”  
should your map have?  
This depends on where you are in your project and  
why you are creating that specific journey map. If your  
journey map is being made to structure your research, you  
50/51  
will probably want it to be quite comprehensive.  
But if your goal is to communicate an idea or a problem,  
it can be useful to concentrate on a key part that tells you  
a lot about the needs of the customer and how your idea  
meets them. This can give a powerful emotional mes-  
sage, which is why storytellers like filmmakers concen-  
trate on key scenes.  
Just as a play or movie can show us a lifetime in a  
few selected scenes, a journey map can show many of  
the overarching values and the tone of voice of a service  
using a partial view. The scale of a customer journey  
could range from a few seconds \(think of the check-in  
experience a hotel\) to some decades \(think of the end-to-  
end experience of a property loan\). The more you zoom  
out, the longer the experience you illustrate – though  
with less details. The more you zoom in, the shorter the  
time span becomes of the experience you illustrate, but  
with more details. Often this is not an “either/or” deci-  
sion, but you have to constantly move between differ-  
ent zoom levels.  
5\. Focus\: Product-centered vs.  
experience-centered journey maps  
A product \(or provider/brand\)-centered journey map is  
a journey map containing only touchpoints03 – in other  
words, only steps representing an interaction between  
a customer with a service, physical or digital product,  
or brand. These journey maps leave out all steps outside  
the reach of a company. In some cases, product-centered  
03 See the textbox Steps, touchpoints, and moments of truth in 3.3. This is Service Design Doing  
journey maps are useful to visualize a specific and rather  
detailed experience, such as the onboarding experience  
to a piece of software, or to visualize a very high-level  
experience, such as a customer lifecycle map. Sometimes,  
however, these journey maps arise because people create  
them as if their customers think about nothing else than  
their company. For example, an ­ energy ­ provider might cre-  
ate a journey map for how new ­ customers sign up for their  
electricity services when they move into their region. If they  
only map out touchpoints \(collect information on the web-  
site, sign up online, receive and sign a contract, etc.\) without  
considering all the other steps their customers have to do  
while they are moving home \(packing, moving in, creating  
a ­ redirection order for their former postal address, etc.\), the  
map will miss many potential problems and opportunities,  
and clearly will not reflect the situational context.  
Experience-focused journey maps reflect the situa-  
tional context and show how touchpoints are embedded  
in the overall experience. In many cases, using a service or  
product is not the main goal of a customer. You probably  
know the famous saying by Harvard ­ marketing professor  
Theodore Levitt\: “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch  
drill. They want a quarter-inch hole.” But in fact, people  
rarely want a hole in the wall either; they want a comfort-  
able living room. To achieve this goal, they need to do a  
series of activities, such as agreeing on a painting with their  
partner, buying that painting, drilling a hole in the wall,  
and screwing in a hook to hang up the painting. Focusing  
only on the drill or the painting or the hook would miss  
the main point of why people use these items.01  
01 Often this is visualized through an additional Job-to-be-done or User/customer jobs lane in a journey map.  
Referring to the electricity example, people simply  
don’t want to “become a customer” or handle any of  
these things. They probably only want to have light at  
home when they turn on the switch. An experience-cen-  
tered journey map can lead to better insights about what  
people really want to achieve and not only how they  
interact with a company.  
This also changes the design challenges companies  
strive to solve. For example, instead of just asking  
“What is the onboarding experience for our ­ customers?”  
\(a more product-centered question\) we move to questions  
like “What is the overall experience of people moving  
house?” “What is the role of the energy provider in this  
context?” and “What is the role of an energy provider in  
this context in comparison with other basic infrastructure  
providers, like water, gas, phone, internet, etc.?” \(a more  
experience-centered question\).  
6\. Lanes and level of depth\:  
Adding various lanes in journey maps  
Journey maps can be enhanced by a variety of optional  
lanes. The lanes outlined in this chapter are just some  
examples without any claim to comprehensiveness.  
Which ones are useful depends on the subject matter of  
the project, and often lanes must be altered to serve the  
project’s purpose. 03 Basic service design tools  
52/53  
Experience-centered journey maps visualize the overall experience from  
a customer perspective \(e.g., moving from one apartment to another\). In  
contrast, product-centered journey maps only focus on touchpoints, the  
interaction between a customer and a product/service/brand.

Service blueprint  
Service blueprints can be understood as an extension  
of journey maps. They are set up to specifically connect  
customer experiences with both frontstage and ­ backstage  
employee processes as well as support processes.01  
“Frontstage” refers to people and processes with which  
the user has direct contact. “Backstage” represents people  
and processes that are invisible to the user. Support  
processes are activities executed by the rest of the  
­ organization or external partners.  
A service blueprint builds on the frontstage  
­ experience visualized in a customer journey map, but  
adds layers of depth showing relationships and depen-  
dencies between frontstage and backstage processes.  
It illustrates how activities by a customer trigger service  
processes and vice versa\: how internal processes trigger  
­ customer activities.  
A service blueprint can also detail the processes of  
single departments or even employees/roles and how  
these processes are connected with each other and  
with customer activities. Moreover, a service blueprint  
­ illustrates physical evidences that show up in specific  
steps, such as tickets or receipts.  
A  
Physical evidences  
Physical evidences are physical objects that customers  
come in contact with and that can be designed. Besides  
01 One often-cited scholarly publication on service blueprints is Stostack, G. L. \(1984\). “Designing Services  
That Deliver.” Harvard Business Review, 62\(1\), 133–139. Another is Bitner, M.J., Ostrom, A. L., & Morgan,  
F. N. \(2008\), “Service Blueprinting\: A Practical Technique for Service Innovation,” California Management  
Review, 50\(3\), 66–94. For an example of a service blueprint, see 5.4.1, Case\: Applying ethnography to gain  
actionable insights.  
tangible artifacts, messages that are delivered through  
non-physical channels \(such as email, SMS, or interactive  
voice response systems\) are often included here.  
B  
Customer actions  
Customer actions describe what a customer does at each  
step of a customer journey map. A customer action can  
include multiple physical eviden­ ces. They can be connect-  
ed to both frontstage and backstage interactions when a  
customer action triggers a ­ frontstage or backstage process  
or when a process results in a customer action.  
C  
Line of interaction  
The line of interaction divides customer actions and  
frontstage interactions. If a customer interacts with a  
frontline employee, the blueprint shows a connection  
across the line of interaction.  
D  
Frontstage actions  
This lane shows the activities of frontline employees  
that are visible to the customer. Optionally, ­ different  
frontline employees can be detailed out to ­ describe their  
various activities – these are often visualized as individual  
swimlanes.  
E  
Line of visibility  
The line of visibility separates frontstage and backstage  
actions by frontline employees. If a frontline employee  
goes backstage, what he does next is shown in the back-  
stage action lane. If a frontline employee interacts with A

F  
Backstage actions  
Backstage actions are activities by frontline employees  
that are not visible to the customer; these ­ activities take  
place below the line of visibility. Backstage inter­ actions  
can be connected to frontstage ­ actions and support pro-  
cesses. Optionally, a swimlane visualization here might  
describe backstage actions by ­ particular employees.  
G  
Line of internal interactions  
The line of internal interactions marks the boundary to  
the rest of the organization. Processes below this line are  
support processes done by other departments and teams.  
H  
Support processes  
Support processes are activities executed by the rest of the  
organization or external partners. Support ­ processes can  
be triggered by or can trigger customer actions, frontstage  
actions, and backstage actions. Sometimes, a swimlane  
visualization describes the processes of ­ different external  
departments or partners.  
I  
Custom perspectives/lines/lanes  
Further lines or lanes can be added to visualize  
­ project-specific content – for example, lanes for ­ digital  
frontend and backend activities, lists of technical ­ systems,  
applicable rules and regulations, or even an explicit line  
of external interactions to put an emphasis on interac-  
tions with external partners and ­ organizations.

B Very important steps are called  
“moments of truth.”  
C Steps in which a customer

called “touchpoints.” 03 Basic service design tools  
p A journey map describes an experience as  
a sequence of steps from the ­ perspective  
of one main actor. The main actor can  
be, for example, a user, a customer, an  
employee, a target group, a persona, and so  
on. Not all of these steps are ­ interactions  
with a brand. Often, important things  
happen outside the reach of a brand.  
To ­ differentiate between these, clear  
language is helpful. Unfortunately, there  
are no ­ generally accepted definitions for  
these terms and sometimes even people  
within a team talk at cross purposes. This  
is how some of the core terms regarding  
­ journey maps are used in this book.  
Steps  
# Steps, touchpoints, and moments of truth  
on the overall scale of a journey map.  
Sometimes a step might comprise experi-  
ences of several days \(e.g., waiting for the  
­ delivery of an ordered item\), while other  
times a step might represent only a few  
­ seconds \(e.g., greeting the receptionist\).  
Touchpoints  
All interactions of a customer with a  
brand are called “touchpoints.”01 These  
touchpoints can involve different channels,  
such as watching an advertisement on TV  
or reading more about a product online.  
Touchpoints can be direct, such as calling  
a hotline or retrieving information from  
a company website, or indirect, such as  
reading reviews on third-party websites.  
A step is any experience the main  
actor has. A step can be, for example, a  
conversation with another person, an  
­ interaction with a machine, or using a  
digital inter­ face; but steps can also be  
activities, such as walking or waiting.  
The level of detail of each step depends  
01 The term “touchpoint” has been used in branding literature since the early nine-  
ties to describe any point of contact between a customer and a brand. In a liter-  
ature review on service design, Jeff Howard summarizes when the term was first  
used and how it developed in service design. Read more on this in Howard, J.  
\(2008\). “On the Origin of Touchpoints,” at http\://designforservice.wordpress.com.  
56/57  
Moments of truth  
Steps that are decisive for a user, ­ customer,  
or organization are often called “moments  
of truth” \(MoT\).02 These are steps in  
which the impression of a customer changes  
regarding a brand, service, or physi-  
cal or digital product – for example,  
when a customer first hears about a  
new ­ product \(driving expectations\) or  
sees a product in real life for the first  
time \(driving anticipation\), or when a  
­ customer uses a product for the first time  
\(comparing expectations with actual  
quality and customer experience\). ◀  
02 Note that our definition of “moments of truth” differs from its original meaning.  
The term was originally coined by Richard Normann in the 1980s and later popular-  
ized by Jan Carlson see Carlson, J. \(1987\). Moments of Truth\: New Strategies for  
Today’s Customer-Driven Economy. Ballinger\). While Carlson refers to a MoT as  
any interaction a customer has with a business, the meaning of MoT has developed  
since this time. There are dozens of online articles and conference discussions on  
this topic. We follow the common use, where moments of truth are only those  
critical touchpoints where customers have a high involvement; ones that can make  
or break their overall experience. This is Service Design Doing  
# 3.4 SYSTEM MAPS  
A system map is a visual or physical representation of the  
main constituents of the system in which an organization,  
a service, or a digital/physical product is embedded. They  
can include a huge variety of constituents, such as people,  
stakeholders, processes, structures, services, physical  
products, digital products, channels, platforms, ­ places,  
pathways, insights, causes, effects, KPIs, and more. System  
maps are usually visualized on paper, as physical models,  
or as constellations with real people.  
A visualization of a system usually takes a specific  
perspective at a specific moment in time. As ­ ecosystems  
change over time, either several maps are needed to  
­ re­ present different states of a system or a dynamic  
­ approach can be used to illustrate changes over time.  
By visualizing all the main components of a system,  
the interplay between these can be analyzed and designed.  
Complex systems become more comprehensible when  
they are visualized, which is particularly useful for wicked  
design problems. System maps can be used to map out  
­ not only existing \(“current-state”\) systems, but also various  
scenarios of future \(“future-state”\) systems to understand  
the impact of decisions, new components, or changed  
relationships. A system map can be used to find or predict  
intended or unintended benefits as well as disadvantag-  
es in the system. Affected stakeholders can be revealed  
and involved early in a project to increase buy-in and  
chances of success.  
“System map” is a collective term for different visu-  
alizations that are often based on systems theory and/or  
systems thinking. The names of these visualizations may  
vary depending on your background or organization. The  
following three types of system maps are often used in  
service design\:01  
→ Stakeholder maps  
A stakeholder map illustrates the various stakeholders  
involved in a specific experience. These maps can be used  
to understand who is involved, and how these people and  
organizations are connected.  
→ Value network maps  
A value network map is an extension of a stakeholder map. It  
illustrates the network of value exchanges between stakehold-  
ers. Value network maps are used to understand the flow of  
values, such as money, goods, services, information, or trust.  
→ Ecosystem maps  
An ecosystem map is a further extension of a stakehold-  
er map or value network map. These maps are used to  
visualize complex systems that involve various constituents,  
such as humans, machines, interfaces, devices, platforms,  
systems, and so on, as well as their relationships and  
interdependencies.  
01 Besides the three types of system maps described in this book, there are many more, such as  
process maps, flowcharts, or technical maps. Depending on your project, it might make sense to  
also use one of these other types. COMMENT  
“Even quick-and-dirty  
system maps are useful  
in both suggesting cause  
and effect and – ­ perhaps  
more importantly –  
where we have gaps  
in our understanding  
and need to do more  
research. They highlight  
our knowledge - and  
our ignorance!”

3.4.1  
Stakeholder maps  
A stakeholder map illustrates the various stakeholders  
involved in an experience. It basically answers the question\:  
“Who are the most important people and organizations  
involved in an experience?” By representing different  
customer groups or personas, frontstage and backstage  
employees or departments, partner organizations, as well  
as other stakeholders that might have a direct or indirect  
impact on the experience, the interplay between these  
various groups can be charted and analyzed. Stakeholder  
maps help us to understand which stakeholders are  
involved in this ecosystem, help to reveal existing rela-  
tionships between these stakeholders and identify informal  
networks or frictions between stakeholders, and help us to  
find unseen business opportunities.  
During a customer journey, customers interact with  
various internal and external stakeholders. Often ­ customers  
don’t realize which stakeholders are involved as they  
interact with websites, apps, machines, platforms, and  
more, not thinking about who is responsible for main-  
taining these ­ systems and who is involved in handling  
their ­ information.02 Stakeholder maps enable a design team  
to actively redesign a system by adding or eliminating  
certain stakeholders; by creating, changing, or eliminating  
relationships between stakeholders; or by deliberately  
strengthening or ­ weakening relationships.  
02 Often stakeholder maps are derived from a journey map. This is why some journey maps include  
a lane for stakeholders.  
58/59  
1 Sectors  
The background of a stakeholder map depends on the  
purpose. A simple and very generic option is to have three  
circles representing different stakeholder groups\: \(A\) cus-  
tomers, \(B\) internal stakeholders, and \(C\) external stake-  
holders. Alternatively, the three circles could refer to the  
level of impact stakeholders have\: \(A\) essential stakehold-  
ers, \(B\) important stakeholders, and \(C\) other stakeholders.  
2 Stakeholders  
Stakeholders are positioned on the map in a particular  
sector and can be arranged according to departments or  
groups \(e.g., depending on how customers perceive them\).  
Customer-centered organizations often put the customer in  
the center of a map, but depending on the purpose of the  
stakeholder map it can also be centered around a specific  
department for projects on internal services or around a  
specific employee for projects on employee experience.  
3 Relationships  
Relationships between stakeholders are visualized and  
should be detailed out in a description. Relationships can il-  
lustrate both formal and informal networks; they can show  
which stakeholders act as a hub or ­ bottleneck in a ­ system,  
and also reveal formal and informal ­ decision-making  
authority or power structures. This is Service Design Doing

Value network maps  
A value network map is an extension of a stakeholder  
map. Instead of merely describing the relationships  
between stakeholders, a value network map details out  
the exchange of value between stakeholders. “Value” can  
refer to physical products and services as well as financial  
values. A simple value exchange could be\: stakeholder  
A gives money to B, stakeholder B provides a service in  
return to A. Values exchanged can also be less ­ tangible,  
such as information, trust, or status.  
Like stakeholder maps, value network maps vi-  
sualize systems from a specific perspective at a specific  
moment in time. In extension to a simple stakeholder  
map, value network maps can show the flow of values  
through a system, such as information flows or financial  
streams in a network.  
1 Sectors  
The template of a value network map will depend on the  
project\: from simple and rather generic ones \(like the three  
circles\) to backgrounds visualizing different departments  
or geographies like a city or country.  
2 Stakeholders  
Stakeholders are positioned on the map in a ­ particular  
sector and can be arranged according to ­ departments or  
groups as customers perceive them. ­ Customer-centered  
organizations put the customer in the center of a map, but a  
map can also be centered around a specific department or a  
specific employee.  
3 Value exchanges  
The exchanges of values between stakeholders are visual-  
ized with separate arrows from one stakeholder to anoth-  
er. Beside a description, icons help to illustrate the value  
exchange. In almost all cases, value exchanges take place in  
both directions, reflecting the saying “there’s no such thing  
as a free lunch.”  
3.4.3  
Ecosystem maps  
An ecosystem map is an extension of a stakeholder  
map or value network map. Such maps include not only  
stakeholders, but also other actors beyond people and  
organizations. An ecosystem map includes not only  
human–human interactions, but also human–machine  
and machine–­ machine interactions.  
Nowadays, there is no service or physical product  
without additional or connected services or products,  
whether physical or digital. Sometimes, these connec-  
tions are established through automated ­ machine–  
machine interactions – sometimes even without  
any interfaces.  
An ecosystem map visualizes the whole system of  
involved actors – humans, machines, interfaces, devices,  
platforms, and systems. Because systems can become  
very complex, ecosystem maps often need different zoom  
levels, from system overviews without any details to very  
detailed views of subsystems. 03 Basic service design tools  
Ecosystem maps show the following\:  
1 Sectors  
Ecosystem maps can use a variety of sectors to ­ structure a  
map depending on its focus. Besides generic templates  
\(like the three circles\), backgrounds can also represent  
different organizations, departments, or geographies \(e.g.,  
a building, city, or country\).  
2 Actors  
Actors in an ecosystem map can be whatever makes sense  
to visualize a system\: people, departments, ­ organizations,  
places, machines, interfaces, devices, platforms, sys-  
tems, and so on.  
3 Relationships or value exchanges  
Ecosystem maps can use anything to describe the interac-  
tion between actors, from simple descriptions of relation-  
ships to illustrations of value exchanges.

# Stakeholder terminology  
The terminology used in service design  
differs across organizations and cultures –  
particularly when it comes to the different  
players involved. As this can be confusing,  
this list shows how terminology is used in  
this book\:  
→  
Stakeholder  
A person, group, or organization that is  
somehow connected to or has an interest in a  
project, organization, or product \(including  
everyone listed here\).  
→  
User  
A person who uses a service or ­ physical/  
digital product.  
→  
Customer  
A person who buys services or physical/  
digital products.01  
01 Here’s a simple example to illustrate the difference between a user and a customer\:  
if you buy cat food for your cat, your cat is the user of cat food when it eats the  
cat food, but you are the customer as you are the one buying the cat food. This is Service Design Doing  
→  
Client  
Although “customer” and “client” are  
often used synonymously, differentiating  
these terms often makes work easier. In a  
service design context, a client is a person,  
group, or organization that orders and  
purchases \(service design\) services from  
an agency, in-house design department,  
or consultant.01  
→  
Service delivery team  
A person, group, or department within an  
organization that is responsible for provid-  
ing services to users or customers.  
Employee  
A person employed by an organization.  
Frontline staff  
A person, group, or department  
within an organization that provides  
services in direct interaction with  
users and customers.  
01 Note that in this context, as in all kinds of B2B services, “the client” is rarely just  
one person. You might have to look at the people who actually own the issue,  
the people who contacted you, or even the manager who is responsible for the  
department you are going to work with.  
Support staff  
A person, group, or ­ department within  
an organization that supports frontline  
staff without direct interaction with  
users and customers.  
→  
Design team  
A group of people that is involved in the  
service design process.  
Core \(service\) design team  
A \(small\) group of people that ­ manage  
a service ­ design project, includ-  
ing process and activity ­ planning,  
tools and methods ­ selection, and  
­ facilitation. They are ­ typically experts  
on service design.  
Extended \(service\) design team  
A \(larger\) group of people that are  
involved in different activities of a ser-  
vice design project. They are typically  
cross-­ functional and multidisciplinary  
experts with ­ specific competences re-  
lated to the subject matter of a service  
design project.  
Agency  
A person, group, or organization that  
provides services \(design, facilitation,  
consultation\) for other persons, groups,  
or organizations \(i.e., the client\) in the  
development or assessment of a service.  
In-house design department  
A person, group, or department within  
an organization that provides \(service  
design\) services \(design, facilitation,  
consultation\) for other persons, groups,  
or organizations within the organization  
\(i.e., the client\) in the development or  
assessment of a service.  
Consultant  
An internal or external person, group,  
or organization that temporarily pro-  
vides \(service design\) consultation. ◀ 03 Basic service design tools

# 3.5 SERVICE PROTOTYPES  
COMMENT  
“Prototyping is crucial  
to test ideas. As Linus  
Pauling said, ‘The best  
way to have a good idea  
is to have a lot of ideas.’  
Prototyping enables lots  
of ideas to be tested  
out in parallel in a low-fi  
way, so that the bad  
ideas can be killed off  
and the stronger ideas  
developed further.”  
— Hazel White  
Service prototypes are staged experiences and processes  
\(e.g., rehearsals, walkthroughs, simulations, or pilots\) that  
replicate any chosen part of a service from frontstage to  
backstage – often with increasing fidelity and in varying  
contexts.02 They contain or might even zoom in on other  
forms of more traditional physical or digital prototypes  
as important props or stages, such as physical mock-ups,  
scale models, wireframes, or click-models.  
The term prototype derives from the Greek prototy-  
pon, which can be interpreted as “first or early form” of  
something – in our case, of a service or product, whether  
physical or digital. A service prototype needs to create a  
first or early experiential form of the service or the ser-  
vice experience.03  
→  
Purpose  
Prototypes are prepared and used to explore, evaluate, and  
communicate service ideas during different activities within  
the service design process. By engaging with prototypes,  
the design team can quickly identify important aspects of a  
new concept, and then explore different alternative solutions  
and evaluate which one might work in everyday reality.  
Additionally, prototypes can be used as a communication tool  
to enhance ­ collaboration and to present, persuade, or inspire.  
As you go along, they allow you to systematically learn  
and evolve toward implementation and even refine during  
service operations.  
→  
Prototyping questions  
Prototypes implicitly or explicitly address questions around  
the whole service, a specifically chosen part of the service,  
or the ­ experience around a physical or digital product or  
artifact. A prototype can focus on the holistic end-to-end  
customer experience or a single step within that journey,  
or it can zoom in on specific backstage processes, issues, or  
technologies. In that respect, all prototypes are consciously  
set up and built in such a way that we can learn from them  
when they are run or used. Later, we step back and reflect  
and make sense of the results.04  
→  
Fidelity  
Prototypes come in different forms, ­ stages of refinement,  
and levels of detail, reflected onto the entire service or any  
of its intangible, physical, or digital parts. Depending on the  
purpose and prototyping questions, prototypes might be  
“more rough than ready” or be quite polished even at early  
stages. Examples of lower-fidelity prototypes include desk-  
top walkthroughs to explore essential steps in the customer  
journey, cardboard proto­ types to get a first idea about the  
shape of a future product, or sketches on paper to visualize  
02  
03 “Staged” in this context denotes experiences that are consciously put on before a selected audience and  
are accompanied by research activities to learn from them. This implies that if you do not set it up to learn  
from it, it’s no \(service\) prototype.  
See Chapter 7, Prototyping, for an in-depth description of how to prepare, plan, and manage your  
prototyping activities.  
04 In other words\: to be able to understand and analyze the feedback and data you get from a prototype,  
it is essential to know the prototyping question. This is Service Design Doing  
the early stages of a digital user interface. Higher-fidelity  
prototypes might include contextual simulations or pilots to  
test technical and feasibility aspects, 3D prints or immersive  
digital 3D models to evaluate a detailed look and feel, or ac-  
tual code already closing the gap toward implementation.01  
→  
Context and audience  
It is a conscious choice where and when prototypes are  
used/run and who is experiencing them to get feedback  
and other data. For example\: do you want to simulate in  
01 See Fidelity in 7.1.4 for an in-depth discussion on the fidelity of prototypes.  
your actual shop environment with real customers during  
a peak period, or do you want to run a session in a safe  
studio environment with internal colleagues? The question  
of audience is also connected to fidelity, as, for example,  
low levels of fidelity will often require an audience accus-  
tomed to or even proficient in “reading” the prototype and  
learning from it.  
Even though early prototypes are often created and  
used in the design studio, contextual prototypes \(e.g.,  
at home with potential users, at the workplace, or on  
the go\) should be considered as early as possible. The  
more similar the context of the prototype is to the future

Methods  
Prototypes can be created with many different methods or  
techniques. Well-known ­ methods include paper proto-  
typing, cardboard prototyping, or ­ theatrical techniques.  
Prototyping methods replace actual implementation tech-  
niques during the design task to allow you to create faster  
and cheaper, and to maximize learning – or simply because  
you might still need to figure out properly what and how to  
implement at all.  
The precise form and shape of a prototype also depend  
on what you actually need to prototype\: which parts of  
your future services and physical or digital products do  
you need to make or build to get answers to your proto-  
typing questions?  
In this book, we differentiate between and concentrate  
on the following\:  
→ Prototypes of \(inter\)actions, service processes,  
and experiences  
Prototypes of physical objects  
→ Prototypes of environments, spaces, and architecture  
Prototypes of digital artifacts and software  
Prototypes of ecosystems and \(business\) value

02 Also see Audience and Prototyping context in 7.1.4.  
66/67  
3.5.1 Prototypes of \(inter\)actions,  
service processes, and experiences  
Service prototypes are staged experiences and processes  
focusing on a certain part of a service experience. They  
can take the shape of a simple storytelling session, a quick  
step-by-step walkthrough or talkthrough, a more ­ in-depth  
theatrical rehearsal session, or even a set of ­ complex  
service simulations involving many different people  
from all parts of your organization, from frontstage to  
backstage. They contain other forms of more traditional  
physical or digital prototypes as important props or ­ stages,  
such as physical mock-ups, scale models, wireframes,  
or click-models.  
Sticking to the original meaning of the word “proto-  
type,” service prototypes create a first or early experien-  
tial form of the service or the service experience. This is  
connected to how staff, customers, or other stakehold-  
ers do and experience things, and how they behave in  
new service situations. Specifically, they address how  
things should be done differently – and experienced  
­ differently – in the future.  
A  
Actors  
Actors enact the given roles in a service story or  
\(inter\)action – for example, as customers, staff, or other  
stakeholders. They use stages, props, and costumes to sup-  
port their performance. In early or explorative prototypes it  
is often members of the project team who slip into the shoes  
of customers and staff, trying to emulate their behaviors. In This is Service Design Doing  
# Service prototyping\: This is how you learn,  
# and always have  
If you – as an individual – want to learn  
how to do something new, like learning a  
language, playing an instrument, or cook-  
ing a meal, what do you do? You might  
start to read about it, talk to your friends  
or some experts, observe how they do it,  
and at some point get started yourself.  
You might take a course, or find some  
online community to help you. Then you  
practice. You do it. You take your teeter-  
ing first steps. You fall. You adapt. You  
take some feedback and advice. You try  
again. This is how you learn.  
And essentially this is also how you  
learn as a team or an organization if you  
need to do something new. Suppose you  
need to better understand the language  
of your customers, or introduce a new  
system into your daily workflows, or learn  
how to work together with new colleagues  
in a different way. What do you do? You  
might do some training together, or find a  
consultant to help you through those tee-  
tering first steps. You fall. You adapt. You  
learn from the people who are interacting  
with you and your team. You sit down and  
reflect in your group. You take some feed-  
back and advice. You try again. This is how  
you learn as a team or organization.  
There are many different names  
that describe these learning journeys.  
Some might call it practice. Tryout. Run-  
through. Rehearsal. Pilot. Trial. Test flight.  
Demonstration. Simulation. Experiment.  
Or simply preparation.  
All of these examples can be seen  
as a first or early experiential version of  
something we want to do really well at  
some point later. All of these examples  
are service prototypes. In that sense,  
most organizations already create service  
prototypes almost every day. However,  
they usually create them quite late in the  
process, and they do not always plan them  
systematically. And they give them lots of  
different names. ◀ 03 Basic service design tools  
more evolved prototypes, it is key to use real ­ customers or  
actual staff as the actors of a service prototype.  
In those cases, the word actor should be understood  
to mean “the person acting” rather than “a person pre-  
tending to act as someone else.”  
B  
Props  
Props are objects and artifacts that are not part of a fixed  
architecture. They usually are actively handled or at least  
somehow involved during the staging of the story. The pro-  
totype should answer questions about their role and mean-  
ing in the context of your prototyping ­ question. Props can  
be physical or digital and often include signs and symbols.  
C  
Stage  
The stage of a service prototype is the actual room or space  
where the action of the service is happening. This includes  
the interior design and architecture and also the \(sensory\)  
environment, like lighting or even smell. A stage can be  
quite informal. When doing an early-stage investigative  
rehearsal or a bodystorming session, an empty workshop  
room can serve as the stage. Over time, stages might be  
made more complex and more real by adding more and  
more elements. In contextual prototyping the actual busi-  
ness environment is used, turning an existing shop or office  
into the stage of your prototype. In contrast to props, stage  
elements are usually fixed to the stage and rarely moved.  
D  
Service story, \(inter\)action, and dialogue  
The service story, \(inter\)action, and dialogue describe any  
kind of action which is \(visibly\) acted out. They represent  
68/69  
the core of a service prototype. In essence, they describe  
what is happening on stage over time – for example, what  
actors say and do \(including basic movement, dialogue, or  
interaction with other actors\) and how the environment  
or props react to them. A service story can be improvised  
on the spot, follow a journey map as a guideline, or be  
prepared through a meticulous script.  
E  
Subject matter content  
Subject matter content is the information or knowledge  
that is discussed, used, or dealt with in interactions, in dia-  
logues, or as part of physical or digital props. This becomes  
visible in the content of flyers, manuals, books, apps, etc.,  
and extends to expert knowledge and skills actors need to  
be able to do the job.

3.5.2  
Prototypes of physical objects  
In industrial or product design, a prototype is an early,  
often lower-fidelity version of the product itself. We can,  
for example, create a “looks-like” prototype that gives an  
impression of the shape and style of the physical product  
and show them to an audience to get feedback. Or we can  
create a functional, “works-like” prototype and have peo-  
ple test it. Furthermore, embedding the physical prototype  
into a more holistic service prototype helps to explore or  
evaluate the role of the product in the life of its user.  
A  
Function  
Prototypes can exhibit different levels of functionality.  
The function of a prototype defines what it can do or what a  
selected audience can do with the prototype. The functions  
available in a prototype might be real, simulated, or faked.  
In proof-of-principle prototypes, only key functional aspects  
are prototyped, while a working prototype ­ already tries to  
capture most of the functionality.  
B  
Form  
The form of a physical prototype describes the shape and  
aesthetics of a future physical product or artifact, including  
color and texture. Beyond basic geometry it also helps to  
look at wider aspects like balance, proportion, or emphasis  
of the individual elements.  
C  
Size and scale  
The size and scale of your prototype defines how the proto-  
type is compared to the future physical product or artifact.  
Small-scale models in service design are often used in  
connection with desktop walkthrough approaches or when  
they need to be combined with architectural models. Full-  
scale models are often used as stage ­ elements or props in  
contextual walkthroughs or rehearsal techniques.  
D  
Materials \(and tools\)  
Physical prototypes can be created with different  
­ materials and tools. Early prototypes often use ­ materials  
that are easy to work with and do not require ­ specialized  
tools or knowledge \(e.g., cardboard or wood\). Evolved  
prototypes often use more resilient materials like ­ plastics  
to create function, or explore a wider selection of  
­ materials to find the right aesthetics for the final product.  
Working with more advanced materials often requires  
special tools like 3D printers, CNC cutting/­ milling  
machines, molding equipment, and eventually the actual  
production toolchain.

3.5.3 Prototypes of environments,  
spaces, and architecture  
Prototypes of environments, spaces, and ­ architecture  
essentially are a special case of prototypes of ­ physical  
objects. In architecture, those prototypes often are scale  
models of a space or a building to test and ­ communicate  
our ideas. Also, digital 3D ­ models allow you to dive into  
new spaces using virtual reality headsets.  
A  
Layout and space  
Architectural models deal with aspects like orientation or  
layout of buildings and structures within a given fixed space.  
In contrast to physical products, architecture rarely can  
be easily moved around. Thus, architectural ­ models often  
reflect how the future buildings or structures are embedded  
in surrounding spaces, nature, lighting ­ situations, and so on.  
B  
Form  
The form of architectural prototypes or models describes  
the shape and aesthetics of future buildings or structures,  
including color and texture. Beyond basic ­ geometry it also  
helps to look at wider aspects like mass, space, volume, tex-  
ture, light, shadow, and ­ materials of the ­ individual elements.  
C  
Function  
Architectural prototypes and models can exhibit different  
levels of functionality. The function of a prototype defines  
what it can do or what a selected audience can do with  
the prototype. Functions explored or evaluated in archi-  
tectural prototypes include the support of daily routines,  
70/71  
influencing emotions, or at a basic level, dealing with  
climate, heating, cooling, and ventilation.  
D  
Size and scale  
The size and scale of your models defines how the models  
are compared to the future spaces, buildings, or structures.  
Small-scale architectural models are often used in desktop  
walkthrough approaches. Full-scale models are used in  
contextual walkthroughs or rehearsal techniques.  
E  
Materials \(and tools\)  
Prototypes of spaces and architecture can be created with  
different materials and tools. Early prototypes often use  
materials that are easy to work with and do not require  
specialized tools or knowledge \(e.g., paper and card-  
board\). Evolved prototypes are often done using computer  
simulation and immersive 3D environments or explore a  
wider selection of actual materials to find the right aes-  
thetics and feel.

3.5.4 Prototypes of digital artifacts  
and software  
In software or web development, prototypes can be  
­ anything from rough scribbles of the interface, actors  
playing devices, and digital mock-ups or click-models  
up to working pieces of experimental code that already  
run on your target \(mobile\) device. They also might be  
embedded into a more holistic service prototype to ex-  
plore or evaluate the role of the artifact or software in the  
life of its user.  
Many productive prototyping tools and frameworks  
exist that push the boundaries of how real you can get  
with your prototype in a short amount of time. The  
creation of prototypes of digital artifacts or software is  
no longer limited to people with technical expertise only.  
Leveraging easy-to-use/fast-to-learn prototyping software,  
almost anybody can now quickly learn how to create early  
­ versions of software or web projects.  
A  
Display  
The display area of your prototype represents the  
display01 of the future device \(e.g., the screen of a smart-  
watch, smartphone, tablet, computer, or other machine\).  
B  
Screens  
The screen is the canvas where content and interactive  
elements are placed. Multiples screens are ­ created and linked  
together using interaction elements like hotspots or buttons.  
01 More generally, you can, of course, replace “display” with alternative interfaces such as audio or tactile interfaces.  
When clicked or tapped, the ­ display simply switches to an-  
other screen. In more ­ elaborate ­ prototypes, screens can also  
contain layers to model more ­ complex behaviors.  
C  
Interaction elements  
Interaction elements are placed onto a screen. Common  
elements include visible navigational or interactive elements  
like buttons, links, sliders, input fields, and so on. Interactive  
prototypes of touch interfaces might also involve gestures,  
invisible hotspots, or other ways of interaction.  
D  
Content elements  
Content elements are placed onto the display area. They  
allow the subject matter content to be filled in, usually  
through traditional text elements like headings, subheadings,  
textboxes, images, audio, or video. Content elements also in-  
clude labels used for ­ interaction elements \(e.g., defining the  
language on buttons or other navigational elements\). Using  
actual data, copy, ­ diagrams, visualizations, or photo material  
can make a huge difference as opposed to just using sample  
content and should be tested as early as possible.  
E  
Structure and flow  
How the screens or different elements of an interface are  
linked together defines the basic structure of your prototype.  
It allows you to figure out the flow of single features or the  
overall user experience. This includes the discussion of the  
underlying information architecture \(IA\) and data model, as  
inflexible data models or information architecture can create  
barriers for the future vision of a digital product. 03 Basic service design tools  
72/73  
F  
Function  
The function of a prototype defines what it can do or what  
a selected audience can do with the prototype. It is closely  
tied to the interactive and content elements. The ­ functions  
available in a prototype might be real, simulated, or faked.  
In proof-of-principle prototypes, only key functional aspects  
are prototyped, while a working prototype ­ already tries  
to capture most of the functionality of the final artifact or  
software. Functional prototypes are built to assess feasibility  
and experiential aspects, and help to evaluate/guesstimate  
necessary effort.  
G  
Look and feel/graphical elements  
The look and feel adds aesthetics and experience to  
the visible or perceptible elements and transitions/reactions  
of the system. This touches on overall style, layout, key  
graphics, key imagery, color schemes, and patterns as well as  
wider aspects like balance, ­ proportion, or emphasis of the  
individual elements, or timing and responsiveness. Early  
look-and-feel prototypes might be very similar to mood  
boards when trying to capture a direction with perspectives  
like playfulness, gravity, ­ lightness, or emotions.  
H  
Media and prototyping environment  
Prototypes of digital artifacts and software can be created in  
different media. Early prototypes often use pen and paper.  
They are easy to work with and do not require specialized  
knowledge. More evolved prototypes use specialized digital  
prototyping tools like page-based or layer-based prototyping  
environments. Alternatively, \(dummy\) code can be used to  
assess design questions in different environments or stacks\:  
from exploring different toolchains early in the process to  
running experiments on feasibility in actual development  
and test environments or on production systems.

3.5.5 Prototypes of ecosystems  
and business value  
Since all services and physical/digital products are  
part of a complex ecosystem and exposed to various  
\(­ market\) forces, there need to be many different types  
of ­ prototypes. Each prototype is specifically tailored to  
­ understand and explore a certain perspective on those  
complex networks and relationships. Common tools  
include service advertisements \(prototypes of desirability  
and perceived value\), desktop system maps \(prototypes  
of complex dynamics of the holistic business systems\),  
Business Model Canvases \(early prototypes of the core  
business model\), or even business experiments or preto-  
types \(prototypes that follow a fake-it-before-you-make-  
it approach and help to explore and validate the core  
value proposition\).01  
01 See 7.3.6, Case\: Using multifaceted prototyping to create and iterate business and service models, for an example  
of how learning from ongoing prototyping activities might allow you to gain confidence in business models that  
others might consider radical.

# Physical evidences  
Physical evidences, or service evidenc-  
es, are physical or digital artifacts that  
are related to a service \(e.g., letters,  
emails, brochures, signs, souvenirs, text  
­ messages, tickets, bills, receipts, giveaways,  
­ stickers\). One ­ often-used example is the  
­ folded toilet paper in your hotel room as  
a physical ­ evidence that your bathroom  
has been cleaned.  
Sometimes, these physical evidences  
are an integral part of a service. However,  
they are often not designed intentionally  
and lead to unnecessary frustration in cus-  
tomers. As an example, an Austrian credit  
card company used to send out a text mes-  
sage once per month to its customers to in-  
form them that their monthly invoices had  
been created. Unfortunately, it sent out this  
message in the middle of the night, waking  
up thousands of customers just to inform  
them about an invoice in their email inbox.  
Understanding if existing ­ physical ­ evidences  
provide value to ­ customers is often part  
of the first service design initiatives that  
­ organizations undertake.  
Physical evidences can be also added  
to existing experiences, for example to  
deliberately add further steps to a customer  
journey. One example might be giving out  
free souvenirs or giveaways in hotels with  
the intention that guests remember their  
stay when they arrive at home and unpack  
their luggage. In this context, physical  
evidences, like giveaways, can be used to  
intentionally prolong a customer journey  
and trigger certain customer actions \(for  
example, when they are combined with  
a message intended to increase positive  
­ online reviews\). They can also be used  
to make backstage processes visible to  
the customer, as in the case of the folded  
toilet paper.02 ◀  
02 See 8.6.1, Empowering employees for sustainable implementation of a service design  
project, for some nice examples of how the redesign of physical evidences – such  
as the final group photo after an organized motorcycle tour – can impact the  
overall experience.

The folded toilet paper in your  
hotel bathroom is a classic  
example of physical evidence of  
an otherwise intangible backstage  
process \(room cleaning\). This is Service Design Doing  
# 3.6 BUSINESS MODEL CANVAS  
EXPERT TIP  
“Experienced users of  
the Business Model  
Canvas will not just use  
it as a checklist to fill  
out the boxes. They will  
use the BMC to design  
business models that  
outperform competitors’  
with a powerful business  
model story in which all  
business model building  
blocks reinforce each  
other. Great examples  
of business model stories  
are Nespresso, IKEA,  
or the Nintendo Wii,  
which succeeded not  
just based on a great  
value proposition, but  
based on a powerful  
business model.”  
—  
Alexander Osterwalder  
The Business Model Canvas01 is a simple template to  
sketch out a business model using nine core building  
blocks. Considering business models is an inherent part  
of any service design process\: any changes to organiza-  
tional structures, processes, software, physical or digital  
products, services, stakeholder relationships, or custom-  
er groups affect different parts of your business model.  
In return, changes to your business model affect the  
employee and/or customer experience.  
The Business Model Canvas and similar canvas-  
es can be used to understand the influence of various  
options on the employee and customer experience as  
well as on the ­ business impact. It can also be used to map  
competitors and compare their business models with  
your company’s. This might give you insights into where  
you need to differentiate from your competition.  
The upper seven building blocks of the Business  
Model Canvas are directly connected to the previous  
basic service design tools. By including “hard facts” such  
as resources, revenue streams, and cost structures, this  
framework creates a common ground for designers and  
managers to talk about new service concepts within  
any organizational structure. The financial blocks \(Cost  
­ structure and Revenue streams\) allow a design team to  
estimate the potential profitability of a business model.02  
01 02 For more information on the Business Model Canvas see Osterwalder, A., & Pigneur, Y. \(2010\). Business Model  
Generation\: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers. John Wiley & Sons.  
See Chapter 7, Prototyping, for details on how to work with the Business Model Canvas.  
1 Value propositions  
Value propositions03 summarizes the offering of a ­ company,  
such as its services or products \(whether physical or  
digital\), including the unique selling proposition that  
distinguishes that offering from its competitors’. This block  
describes the frontstage parts of a customer journey that a  
company actually offers to the customer, including services  
and physical/virtual products as well as intangible values  
customers may base their purchase decisions on.  
The block Value propositions is connected with\:  
— Journey maps\: Customer journey maps visualize  
—  
the key experience from a customer’s point of view.  
Often, they focus on a main benefit or the job to be done  
\(i.e., why a customer uses a specific service or product,  
­ whether physical or digital\). A summary of this describes  
the value proposition.  
— Prototypes\: Prototypes of services or physi-  
—  
cal/digital products can make a value proposition  
­ tangible and testable.  
2 Customer segments  
Customer segments describes the different market ­ segments  
a company identifies as its core target groups. These target  
groups are normally marked by similar needs and attri-  
butes, and their respective size can be estimated.

The block Customer segments is connected with\:  
— Personas\: Personas make customer segments  
—  
less ­ abstract and more tangible. They help a team to  
­ empathize with customers and users.  
— System maps\: System maps can be used to  
—  
­ visualize customer segments and their relationships  
and ­ interdependencies, such as in stakeholder maps or  
­ value network maps.  
3 Channels  
Channels highlights how customers want to interact  
throughout the customer lifecycle and which methods  
work best and are most cost-efficient. This block  
includes on- and offline channels used for com-  
munication and distribution across all stages of an  
end-to-end journey.  
The block Channels is connected with\:  
— Journey maps\: End-to-end journey maps often  
—  
include information about which channels a customer  
uses to buy a product and to communicate with a com-  
pany. Swimlane maps are particularly useful to visualize  
which channels customers use and which alternative  
channels they could use.  
4 Customer relationships  
Customer relationships describes what kind of relationship  
a company establishes and maintains with each ­ customer  
segment. This block depends on a company’s legacy,  
­ culture, and tone-of-voice. Thus, its description is often a  
bit more vague than the other blocks.  
The block Customer relationships is connected with\:  
— System maps\: System maps often include informa-  
—  
tion on the relationships between stakeholders, such as  
the ­ relationship between customers and various depart-  
ments of an organization.  
— Journey maps\: End-to-end journey maps include  
—  
­ information on the quality of relationships, such as how  
often a customer has contact with a company and wheth-  
er the contact is automated or personal.  
— Prototypes\: Prototypes can be used to tangibi-  
—  
lize ­ relationships and to test the tone of voice used to  
­ communicate with customers.  
5 Key activities  
Key activities summarizes backstage processes a company  
needs to execute to produce or offer its value proposition.  
The block Key activities is connected to\:  
— Service blueprints\: Service blueprints connect front-  
—  
stage customer experiences with backstage processes and  
therefore often include a comprehensive overview of a  
company’s key activities.  
— Journey maps\: Journey maps can include informa-  
—  
tion about which internal stakeholders are involved in  
­ certain steps of the journey, particularly when a journey  
map includes employees or additional ­ perspectives on  
backstage processes or stakeholders.  
— Prototypes\: Prototypes can be used to identify  
—  
and test key internal activities and human–human,  
­ human–machine, as well as machine–machine  
­ interactions that happen internally and externally. 03 Basic service design tools  
6 Key resources  
Key resources summarizes what a company needs to sustain  
and support the business, such as physical, intellectual  
\(brand patents, copyrights, data\), human, or financial assets.  
In a business model, key resources often include decisions  
regarding make-or-buy or in-/outsourcing.  
The block Key resources is connected to\:  
— System maps\: System maps can include detailed  
—  
­ information on the involved internal stakeholders  
­ \(stakeholder maps or value network maps\) as well as  
other key resources \(ecosystem maps\).  
— Service blueprints\: Service blueprints mostly include  
—  
­ detailed information on involved internal stakeholders.  
— Journey maps\: Journey maps can include ­ information  
—  
about which internal stakeholders are involved in  
­ certain steps of the journey and which of them might be  
­ considered as key resources, particularly when a journey  
map includes employees or additional perspectives on  
backstage processes or stakeholders.  
7 Key partners  
Key partners describes the direct ecosystem in which a com-  
pany operates, including stakeholders that are needed as  
suppliers for key resources and key activities as well as other  
important strategic partners.  
The block Key partners is connected to\:  
— System maps\: System maps can include detailed  
—  
­ information on the involved internal and external  
stakeholders. Stakeholder maps or value network maps  
78/79  
are particularly useful to understand the relationships be-  
tween a company and its external stakeholders and which  
of these might be considered as key partners regarding  
the business model.  
— Service blueprints\: Service blueprints include  
—  
detailed information on involved external stakeholders,  
some of whom are key partners.  
8 Cost structure  
Cost structure outlines the most important fixed and vari-  
able cost factors of a business model and whether these can  
be affected by economies of scale and scope.  
 The block Cost structure is connected to the upper seven  
building blocks of the Business Model Canvas.  
9 Revenue streams  
Revenue streams describes how a company generates in-  
come from each customer segment or from key ­ partners. It  
includes how much each customer segment pays, for what,  
how, and how much this contributes to the ­ overall revenue  
through sales, usage or subscription fees, ­ licensing, broker-  
age fees, or advertising.

Simon Clatworthy  
In this chapter and the ones that follow, we sketch out a  
framework that will help you understand the underlying  
activities and the overall process of designing a service.  
It will also help you to get a sense of its limitations. We’ll  
consider questions like\:  
→ How much can you plan for, and how can you  
­ professionally manage expectations and uncertainty  
in the remaining parts?  
→ How can you stay on time and on budget while the  
process still needs to be iterative and explorative?  
→ How much structure is necessary? When will too  
much structure have a negative effect on the ­ quality  
of the results?  
activities from real-world projects that are the strategic  
building blocks for any service design process.  
The specific process you need to adopt for a project  
will vary depending on your organization, the challenge,  
the complexity of the challenge, the people involved,  
the underlying ideas or problems, and of course \(and not  
least\) the available budget, time, and other resources.  
Designing the process and choosing the right  
methods and tools are core skills in service design. Even  
though you will see a lot of process charts and agendas in  
this book, be very aware that it won’t be enough to sim-  
ply copy them. Always adapt the process to the people,  
culture, and goals of the project you are working on.  
These questions have no easy answer, and not surprisingly,  
there is no one process to rule them all, no step-by-step  
checklist, no silver bullet. However, it is one of the beauties  
of service design that it allows or even demands ­ flexibility.  
The best design processes are those that adapt to the  
problem you want to solve – and not the other way  
around. Instead of a rigid theoretical process, we have  
something much more powerful\: emerging patterns and This is Service Design Doing  
# Iterative and adaptive  
# design in a VUCA world  
The adoption of iterative and  
adaptive design processes is in  
no way a fringe phenomenon.  
It is taking place in major organizations –  
­ including the very conservative ones and  
very pragmatic ones, such as the US military.  
Faced with an operational context that is in-  
creasingly VUCA \(volatile, ­ uncertain, com-  
plex, and ambiguous\), the US Army adopted  
a new approach in 2010 with its field manual  
FM 5-0. The ­ manual “is a set of guidelines to  
be adhered to by military ­ commanders when  
planning and ­ decision-making for the battle-  
field. FM 5-0 is unique, as it is the first time  
that ­ design – and specifically ‘design think-  
ing,’ the ­ iterative process of problem-solving  
that is considered by some typical of design –  
was introduced into the vocabulary of the  
military field manual.”01 ◀  
01 In its foreword, the manual states\: “With \[...\] the introduction of design into our  
doctrine, we highlight the importance of understanding complex problems more fully  
before we seek to solve them through our traditional planning processes.” From US  
Army \(2010\). The Operations Process FM 5-0. Headquarters Department of the Army.  
As our world is cranking out innovations at an  
unprecedented rate, more and more industries are being  
shaken up by disruptive shifts. The business world is  
increasingly described as VUCA – volatile, uncertain,  
complex, and ambiguous.02 With that much pressure,  
you also need to be able to quickly adapt your problem-solving,  
innovation, and design skills. You need to be  
flexible and grow with the ever-changing ­ challenges –  
and so does your process.  
This book provides a framework for flexible service  
design process planning. It provides a set of proven tools  
to create and manage ­ exactly the service design tech-  
nique that your project and organization needs. As you  
evolve in your service design journey you might discover  
better ways to do things for yourself within your own  
context. However, getting to this point requires practice,  
skill, and a lot of experience.  
To add to this, we challenge you to be critical as you  
read through the following chapters – and when you first  
apply the TiSDD framework. We challenge you to build  
your own customized service design process and give it  
a go. And we also challenge you to always stay critical of  
your own process. Always ask yourself\: What worked?  
What didn’t work? Why didn’t it work? How might we  
do it better in the next project?

# 4.2 CORE PATTERNS IN THE  
# DESIGN PROCESS  
EXPERT TIP  
“Designers need to think  
critically and not adopt  
a model of the design  
process without question,  
but design the design  
process itself for the  
problem at hand.”  
—  
Jamin Hegeman  
4.2.1 Divergent and convergent  
thinking and doing  
At the core of any design process is the recurring pattern  
of creating and reducing options\:  
A During research activities, you generate a lot of  
­ knowledge through research methods which is  
then ­ focused again through organizing and extract-  
ing key insights.  
B During ideation activities, you create many opportu-  
nities that you filter through decision-making pro-  
cesses to arrive back at a handful of promising ideas.  
C In prototyping and implementation, you open up by  
exploring and building potential solutions and then  
focus again through evaluation and decision making.  
The design process  
as interplay between  
divergent phases  
\(seeking opportunities\)  
and convergent phases  
\(making decisions\).  
These patterns can be described as divergent and conver-  
gent thinking and doing; they are some of the most import-  
ant patterns within any design process. The terms divergent  
thinking and convergent thinking were first coined by psy-  
chologist Joy Paul Guilford in 195603 and were introduced  
into the field of design and architecture by Paul Laseau in  
1980.04 In essence, both found that successful design and  
problem-solving processes can be described as an interplay  
between divergence \(where we seek or create opportuni-  
ties\) and convergence \(where we make decisions\).05  
From the perspective of a team member who is part  
of this kind of design process, divergent and convergent  
thinking require different skills and often come with a  
different mindset. On one side, you have many people  
who exhibit a bias toward divergent thinking and doing.  
They just love to create and explore new ideas. On the  
other side, there are others who look at an idea and  
instantly see the risk and potential problems\: “Won’t  
work here. Too expensive. Too political. Not legal.” etc.  
They spot instantly why something might not work in  
the world they know. Those two sides are often called  
the “Yes, and …” \(trying to find new solutions\) and  
“Yes, but …” modes \(instantly challenging or reality  
diverging  
converging

“The more expertise  
and experience you  
have, the greater the  
likelihood you’ll find  
yourself in the ‘Yes,

checking every idea\).01 However, be careful before judging  
whether one of them is better than the other. Divergent  
\(“Yes, and...”\) and convergent \(“Yes, but...”\) skillsets are  
both essential in service design.  
For a successful project, you will always need both\:  
divergent skills to create enough base material to have  
great results or breakthrough concepts, and convergent  
skills to help you to stay legal, stay within the budget,  
or manage real risks and – in the end – come to a ­ decision.  
The key is to consciously plan and manage when to  
do which, which specific methods to use, and who to  
­ involve. This holds true for both the workshop level  
and the service design process as a whole.  
Divergent and convergent thinking can be used as  
a generic, high-level lens when planning for or man-  
aging a service design process\: Which of the activities  
or methods you use are divergent or convergent. When  
inviting stakeholders for your co-creation activities, this  
can be an additional perspective\: What is the required  
mindset in terms of divergent and convergent thinking?  
Which mode should you currently be in? Is everybody  
on the same page?  
4.2.2 Make sure you are solving the right  
problem before solving the problem right  
Design processes are consciously designed to make sure  
you identify the right problem first before wasting time  
01 See the “Yes, and …” warm-up method in Chapter 10, Facilitating workshops.  
and money on solving the problem right. This sounds  
almost trivial, but it is indeed fundamental and does not  
always come naturally. Many organizations are trained  
to solve problems and implement immediately as part  
of their DNA – which in many situations might even be  
considered a good thing. But when facing new prob-  
lems, how can you be really sure that you are working  
on the right problem? Or, if you were asked to solve the  
problem by someone else, how can you be sure that the  
project sponsor or client has indeed accurately identified  
the problem in the first place? That you are not being  
asked to solve just a symptom? Or whether or not she  
herself actually has access to all the relevant information  
and has given it to you?  
This is what sets design approaches apart\: rather  
than jumping right in – which also often leads to obvious  
solutions – you first take a step back. You make sure you  
identify and understand the right problem before you  
move on and then are able to come up with genuinely  
better solutions.  
In 2005 and 2007, the British Design Council  
­ conducted research02 on how successful design teams  
across many industries work, and they found that the  
designers were following this very approach. The teams  
would split their projects into two major parts. During  
the first part, they would use market/user/design  
­ research to learn more about the problem and define  
the actual project scope, as opposed to the assumed or  
­ perceived one. Only then – as part two – would they

Most people have encountered situa-  
tions in meetings where half the team  
is in “Yes, and …” mode but the other  
half is already in “Yes, but …” mode,  
ready to shoot down every idea that  
the others come up with. And, hey, you  
have some friction. The good news is  
that the friction often can be addressed  
simply by explaining and acknowledg-  
ing those two modes of working and  
clearly establishing which one the team  
is supposed to be in right now. For  
example, if you are running an ideation  
session, explicitly ask the team to  
switch to “Yes, and …” mode and defer  
judgement and negative comments.  
This becomes even more effective when  
you also mention that there will be a  
session afterward where the group can  
filter, review, and critique those ideas –  
and kindly ask the “Yes, but …” people  
in the room to be patient, as “Your  
time will come!”03  
“Yes, and …” and “Yes, but …” at-  
tach a simple language to the divergent  
and convergent thinking modes and –  
if introduced right – soon become  
symbols for the associated behaviors  
and frictions within your team\: “Hey  
guys, are we still in ‘Yes, and …’ mode?  
Or are we already ‘Yes, but-ing’ each  
other? Let’s align!” ◀

proaches, visual management, prototyping, and testing  
until they implemented and launched the new service or  
product, whether physical or digital,01 and received the  
first feedback from the market.  
It is a good rule of thumb to challenge initial  
­ assumptions and kick off with some planned research.  
But even though this will often mean starting with  
research activities, keep in mind that there might be  
exceptions to that rule \(e.g., when you start working on  
projects that are based on previous research or existing  
opportunity areas\).

EXPERT TIP  
“Our best practice is to  
brainstorm on processes  
and tools adaptation  
at the beginning of  
each project, with the  
aim to tailor our very  
own design process as  
much as we can to  
the project with all its  
challenges we will face.”

Francesca Terzi  
Over the last couple of decades, a plethora of ­ different  
design processes have either been published by  
­ practitioners or described in literature.  
This is also true in the field of service design. There  
might be differences in the exact wording and the num-  
ber of activities, steps, or phases – usually between three  
and seven. But they ultimately share the same mindset  
and the same principles of service design we described in  
the previous chapter. Here are just a few examples\:  
01 The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In academia,  
products are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually bundles of services and  
physical/digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as referring to something tangible, we prefer to  
speak of physical/digital products. Read more on this in the textbox on Service-dominant logic in 2.5.

One thing that becomes obvious very quickly is that at  
this level there are few \(if any\) differences in the core  
design process between service design and other design  
disciplines. The difference is rather in the specific set of  
tools and methods service design uses \(e.g., customer  
journeys, service blueprinting, service prototyping\), not  
in the design process itself. No matter what you ­ design,  
you always need to understand user needs, you always  
work iteratively, you always have diverging and converg-  
ing phases, and so on. So we need to look more deeply  
at exactly how these service design projects are run and  
what the underlying patterns and activities are.08

# Adapt and iterate forward, or  
# how to not go in circles  
It is important to understand as early as  
possible that the service design process  
is never a linear process \(i.e., a sequence  
of activities that is planned in advance  
and can be executed step by step with  
expected results\). In fact, it’s quite the  
opposite. A service design process always  
needs to be explorative and iterative.  
It has to be able to adapt, building on a  
series of more or less repeating, deepen-  
ing, explorative loops\: iterations.  
This adaptive and iterative nature  
makes design processes difficult to visu-  
alize. Even though they are not meant  
to, many visualizations still somehow  
­ suggest a linear structure – especially  
to people who are new to this way of  
working. It is just difficult to graphically  
visualize iterations as a process. Some  
use circles to illustrate the iterations – but  
a circle also describes a linear process,  
starting again with the first step after the  
last one. In reality, at any moment with-  
in a design process, you can move on to  
any other activity – if it makes sense.  
Design processes do not go in circles.  
They do not go back. Instead, they  
constantly move forward and adapt.  
Strictly following a linear process, like  
ticking checkboxes off of a task list or a  
rigid how-to-guide, might restrict your  
design work and in fact slow you down.  
For example, you might do some  
initial research, then some ideation  
based on what you learned, and start  
some proto­ typing activities, only to  
find out that you have to go back to do  
more ideation or even more research  
to ­ address issues you have discovered  
during prototyping. But you keep  
on iterating through varying combi-  
nations of the core activities toward  
working prototypes and finally into  
implementation.  
There seems to be a ­ fundamental  
friction between the explorative ­ aspects  
and the pressures from the daily  
­ business to deliver results on time and  
in budget. Chapter 9, Service Design  
Process and Management, describes  
how you can use concepts like planned  
­ iteration to build an overarching  
project structure that not only creates  
trust in the process but also creates  
predictability for your organization  
without giving up on the iterative and  
­ explorative principles. ◀  
You will soon notice that while there might be useful patterns  
between the various core activities, there is no generally  
implied sequence. This is the reason why in this book we have  
decided to stop talking about core “phases” or “stages,”  
and talk about core “activities” instead. 04 The core activities of service design

We will discuss the four core activities of the service  
­ design process in Chapters 5–8 before moving on to  
explain the detailed mechanics of the overarching service  
design process in Chapter 9.  
→ Chapter 5, Research\: In service design, research  
is used to understand people and their behavior in  
relation to a service or product, whether physical  
or digital. Design research enables a design team  
to empathize with the people they design for and  
build up a genuine understanding of their practices  
and routines. This allows the team to work from  
a user-centered perspective throughout a project  
and potentially also include people they encounter  
during research at a later stage to ideate or pro-  
totype concepts.  
→ Chapter 6, Ideation\: Producing ideas is a vital part  
of a service design project – but it is not as all-im-  
portant as many people seem to think. In service  
design, ideas are just starting points within a bigger  
evolutionary process. They need to be, however,  
generated systematically en masse, mixed, recom-  
bined, culled, distilled, and evolved or parked. Their  
real value often lies not in the ideas themselves but  
in the outcome\(s\) that stem from them.  
→ Chapter 7, Prototyping\: In service design, prototyp-  
ing is used to explore, evaluate, and communicate  
how people might experience or behave in future  
service situations. Prototyping enables the design  
team to identify important aspects of a new concept,  
explore alternative solutions, and evaluate which one  
might actually work in the everyday business reality.  
→ Chapter 8, Implementation\: Implementation  
­ describes the step beyond experimenting and testing,  
moving into production and rollout. The implemen-  
tation of service design projects can involve various  
fields, such as change management for organizational  
procedures and processes, software development  
for apps and software, and product development or  
engineering for the production of physical objects, as  
well as architecture and construction for the creation  
of environments and buildings.  
→ Chapter 9, Service Design Process and  
Management\: Research, ideation, prototyping, and  
­ implementation are the major building blocks of a  
working service design project. This chapter provides  
a framework to plan and prepare as well as to manage  
and continuously adjust your iterative approach to  
build trust and deliver results for your organization. This is Service Design Doing

In service design, research is used to understand people,  
their motivations, and their behavior. Usually research  
is one of the first activities in a service design project,  
but it’s not uncommon for ideation, prototyping, or  
­ implementation to send a team back to research activ-  
ities when new questions arise. Design research en-  
ables a team to\:  
→ Empathize with the people they design for and  
build up a ­ genuine understanding of their practic-  
es and routines.  
→ Immerse themselves in an unfamiliar area or  
subject and learn about the specific context they  
will be working in – which might be quite technical  
and specialized.  
→ Step away from established routines and assump-  
tions, looking at a certain topic with fresh eyes.

Mostly, researchers strive to find out how customers  
experience a specific physical or digital product, service,  
or brand \(customer experience\). Furthermore, research  
is used to study the experiences and behavior of different  
employees \(employee experience\) as well as other involved  
stakeholders. More generally, it can be used to reveal the This is Service Design Doing

ecosystem in which a certain theme, service, good,  
or product is embedded, including other players, places,  
artifacts, processes, platforms, and stakeholders, and to  
see how they are connected.  
Research is crucial in service design, as it helps a  
design team to move beyond assumptions. There’s a  
continuum from simple research for the inspiration of a  
design team to solid data that can reveal \(valid\) discov-  
eries. Research can be divided into quantitative methods  
and qualitative methods. Both types are useful in service  
design. Quantitative research is often a good way to gain  
insights into the “what” and “how” of an experience, while  
qualitative research provides insights into the “why” –  
people’s motivations and needs. However, research can be  
used in various forms at different stages within a service  
design project. We might see initial research ­ identifying  
user needs, discovering experience gaps and other  
problems. Then we have research testing prototypes,  
validating implemented solutions and assisting ideation  
\(by systematically gathering existing ideas and avoiding  
reinventing the wheel\). In all stages research is used to  
inform decisions based on real data and insights, rather  
than on assumptions that may be biased.01  
Service design research is a structured process  
with planned iterations. It starts with a research topic  
or one or more research questions and often aims to  
derive insights. Design research is based in user/hu-  
man-centered design and usually includes ethnographic  
01 See 5.4.2, Case\: Using qualitative and quantitative research in service design, for an example of how to use both  
quantitative and qualitative research in a service design project.  
research methods.02 When you start to explore this field,  
you might find that the methods and vocabulary used  
are often quite fuzzy or non-defined – it’s an issue that  
academics and designers often criticize themselves for.  
Also, this type of qualitative research feels a little unsafe  
for people who are more accustomed to quantitative  
research in a business context, but usually a qualitative  
approach turns out to be really valuable.03 Instead of  
looking for “the” truth, qualitative research can provide  
insights into “a” relevant truth. Insights from quali-  
tative research are often more actionable than mere  
quantitative data as they provide answers to the “why”  
questions. New perspectives and nuances come up.  
Communicating ­ insights with quotes, photos, or videos  
of user realities can initiate change in organizations by  
creating a common understanding of the problem and  
motivating people to do things differently.  
As this book is about doing, this chapter presents an  
actionable framework for service design research, based  
on common academic standards.  
02 03 Strictly speaking, these are often more “ethnographically inspired” research methods. In “real” ethnographic  
research projects, ethnographers usually immerse themselves much more deeply into an organization or  
culture than designers do. It is not uncommon for ethnographers to spend months or even years in the field  
researching one particular topic. For a comprehensive introduction to how designers practice ethnographic  
research, see Nova, N. \(2014\). Beyond Design Ethnography. Geneva\: SHS Publishing.  
While your research should be heavily rooted in \(and maybe start with\) a qualitative approach, it should  
include quantitative data as necessary and useful. Following a a more holistic, mixed-method approach in  
design research often increases buy-in from other stakeholders. 05 Research

# 5.1 THE PROCESS OF  
# SERVICE DESIGN RESEARCH  
Research can be used at different stages within a design  
process. Design research can be used to find opportunity  
fields by identifying customer problems and needs; to  
research experience gaps in existing services or products  
\(whether physical or digital\);01 to get inspiration from  
other domains; or to test and collect feedback on ideas,  
concepts, and prototypes.  
Service design research can benefit from a clearly  
articulated research design that considers some of the  
­ aspects and main criticisms of ethnography.02 Even though  
not every research process needs extensive ­ planning, this  
framework might help you to achieve richer results with  
fewer resources. It doesn’t need to be ­ followed step by step,  
but should serve as a collection of useful rules of thumb  
that can be applied to your research. This section describes  
each step in detail.  
5.1.1  
01 02 The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In academia,  
products are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually bundles of services and  
physical/digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as referring to something tangible, we prefer to  
speak of physical/digital products. Read more on this in the textbox Service-dominant logic in 2.5.  
For a description of a well-articulated research design see, for example\: Peffers, K., Tuunanen, T., Rothenberger,  
M. A., & Chatterjee, S. \(2007\). “A Design Science Research Methodology for Information Systems Research.”  
Journal of Management Information Systems, 24\(3\), 45–77. For a brief scholarly discussion of problems of  
internal and external reliability and validity of ethnographic research see, for example, LeCompte, M. D.,  
& Goetz, J. P. \(1982\). Problems of Reliability and Validity in Ethnographic Research. Review of Educational  
Research, 52\(1\), 31-60.  
Research scope and research question  
To define the scope of your research, it might help to  
consider which of the following options is applicable  
for the project.  
Exploratory research vs.  
confirmatory research  
→ Exploratory research sets out to learn more about  
a specific subject without the prior formulation  
of explicit assumptions. The objective is often to  
find answers to “Why” questions without a sound  
assumption of what might be the cause. You can also  
do exploratory research to get inspired by solutions  
\(or problems\) from different industries, regions,  
cultures, target groups, and so on.  
→ Confirmatory research is intended to validate  
­ specific assumptions you have generated before you  
start research. The objective is often to find out if an  
assumption or hypothesis is supported by research  
findings. For example, assumption-based journey  
maps you created during a workshop might now  
need to be challenged with solid data on cus-  
tomer experience. 05 Research  
Research into existing services  
and physical or digital products vs.  
new ideas/concepts  
→ Research that focuses on existing physical/­ digital  
products or services is mostly done in the existing  
­ situational context through fieldwork using ethno-  
graphic approaches. Customers, employees, and oth-  
er stakeholders are observed or interviewed when  
they interact with the service or physical/digital  
product in question, or with one another in reality.  
→ Research which could lead to new ideas or concepts  
uses similar ethnographic methods, but as there are  
no existing physical/digital products or services to  
be researched, we often use prototypes or experi-  
ments to get results that are as close as possible to  
the results we would get from the future situational  
context of this idea or concept.  
Start by formulating a research question to make sure  
that your team \(and your potential client\) has a common  
research aim. An initial research question might derive  
from a \(client\) brief, from customer complaints, from  
a workshop, or somewhere else. Often you need to do  
some preparatory research before or during defining  
your research scope and phrasing research questions.03  
A research question could have various aims\: per-  
haps to understand customer needs \(“Why do people  
03 See Preparatory research in 5.2.  
100/101  
use selfie sticks?”\), to find gaps in an existing ­ customer  
experience \(“Where do customers have problems or  
leave when they are in our shop?”\), to confirm steps of an  
assumption-based journey map \(“Which steps are missing  
in our journey map when our customers go through our  
software onboarding? And which ones do they skip?”\), or  
to understand the ecosystem of a physical/digital prod-  
uct or service \(“Which players are directly and indirectly  
involved in our procurement process?”\).  
When developing your research question, always re-  
member to think ahead and ask yourself what you will do  
with the answers. You know what the next activity of your  
project will be, so you can test a question by asking “How  
will the answer to this question help us generate a range  
of insights and ideas to create new \(or more\) value?”  
Research questions are often rather broad and vague  
in the beginning, but then narrow down to one or more  
specific questions ­ throughout the iterative process. It is  
like finding a path through a jungle\: you don’t know the  
way when you set out. You have a vague aim and move  
in that direction. Then, if you stumble over a creek, it’s  
best to follow it as it might take you somewhere interest-  
ing much faster.  
Be aware that research questions often need to be  
refined over time due to the iterative and explorative  
character of design research. In general, you should avoid  
questions that could be answered with a simple “yes” or  
“no” – otherwise your research might come to an end  
very fast, and you won’t learn much. Often research  
questions are open-ended, sometimes followed with a fol-  
low-up “Why” question to gain more detailed insights. It This is Service Design Doing  
usually helps if you write down not only one question in  
the beginning, but 10 or 20 and then select one or more  
you like.01 With a little practice, you will get better at  
developing questions. But you will always need to iterate  
and refine them.  
Based on your progressive understanding of the  
subject matter, you’ll be able to gradually rephrase the  
question better, improve your process and methods of  
collecting data during your fieldwork, and also refine  
the focus of your documentation.  
5.1.2  
Research planning  
When planning your research, you should think of  
research methods that are most likely to give you fruitful  
answers for your proposed research questions. On the  
other hand, your research must fit within certain business  
constraints, as you always have to consider how to best  
allocate time, money, and people within a project.  
A good starting point is to take a look at what is  
already out there so you are “standing on the shoulders  
of giants.” Take a look at previous research and existing  
data on the subject matter. Ask the Market Research or  
Each loop should include data collection with various  
methods as well as at least a simple form of data  
synthesis and analysis.  
01 Y ou’ll find some helpful methods for creating many research questions with your design team in  
Chapter 6, Ideation.  
Innovation department if they have any relevant data,  
get statistics that might be useful for your research, and  
get an overview of what has been done in this field by  
other departments in the organization. Besides ­ existing  
research within the organization, also invest some time  
into classic desk research\: use \(academic\) research  
platforms to look for scholarly papers published on that  
topic. In many cases, you might invest an hour or so to  
screen the research landscape until you have a good idea  
whether it is worth spending more time reading pub-  
lished research. If you find interesting research, it will  
save some time and budget by focusing your research on  
the really useful parts.  
Besides conducting some preparatory research,  
your research planning will include decisions regard-  
ing ­ research loops, sample selection, research context,  
­ sample size, and method selection.02  
Research loops  
Always plan qualitative research as an iterative ­ process  
with a sequence of research loops. Fruitful design ­ research  
often starts with a broad focus and aims to narrow it  
as soon as possible. The first loops can be really short\:  
something between one hour and one day.  
Through iterative research loops, it is possible to be  
more confident that the research is effectively targeting  
the important questions.  
02 Iteration does not mean doing the same thing over again. It means reflecting on your new data, adapting your  
approach, and starting another experiment. For more, see the textbox Adapt and iterate forward in 4.4. 05 Research  
EXPERT TIP  
“Good practice is to  
regard the first one or  
two interviews as pilots  
to test out your script  
and materials. If all goes  
well you include the data  
in the research; if there  
are serious changes  
needed you may want  
to consider doing some  
extra pilot interviews.”

Sample selection  
Sampling is the definition of who you want to  
take part in your research. Who participates in your  
research and how you select them is a critical question for  
the reliability of any study. A skewed selection of research  
participants may distort your results – for ­ example, when  
you ask only a specific age group, or only happy custom-  
ers \(the “sampling bias”\). There are various strategies that  
aim either to get a representative dataset for large-scale  
quantitative research \(probability sampling\) or to get  
richer data from a specific group for in-depth qualitative  
research \(non-probability sampling\). Results based on  
quantitative probability samples can usually be gener-  
alized, but with data from qualitative non-probability  
samples that’s not the case. Mostly service design research  
uses ­ qualitative research methods and selects participants  
with ­ non-probability sampling techniques, like these\:  
→ Convenience sampling\: Find some people to  
­ participate in your research \(the simplest, but also  
most biased sampling approach\).  
→ Self-selective sampling\: Let participants decide to  
take part in your study without defining specific  
­ criteria or quotas – for example, through a link on a  
company website \(also a very biased approach\).  
→ Snowball sampling\: Find a few relevant people for  
your research purpose and ask them to recommend  
others \(e.g., users of electric cars can get you in  
touch with other users from their network\).  
102/103  
→ Quota sampling\: Find out how a population is  
­ structured according to certain criteria, set a ­ quota  
for how many participants you would like to have  
for each ­ criterion \(e.g., gender\) and randomly select  
­ participants for each quota.  
→ Extreme case sampling\: Find very unusual  
­ participants to understand extreme positions \(e.g.,  
very early adopters of interesting technologies,  
or the ­ opposite\: people who are radically against  
or have never thought about using your service/  
product/technology\).  
→ Emergent sampling\: Follow new leads during  
fieldwork as they unfold, to flexibly take advantage  
of new knowledge.  
→ Maximum-variation sampling\: Find participants  
with a wide range of variation on dimensions of  
interest with the aim to discover central themes or  
shared dimensions across a diverse sample \(e.g.,  
people who use a product in very different ways than  
it was intended\).  
→ Maximum-input sampling\: Find participants with  
a comprehensive overview of an entire experience  
or system in order to get a maximum of input from  
the ­ selected ­ participants \(e.g., people who have just  
followed a ­ complete customer life cycle\). This is Service Design Doing

Probability sampling can also be useful for service design  
research, especially when you need larger sample sizes or  
even representative samples for large-scale quantitative  
research. Here are just a few examples for probability  
sampling techniques\:  
→ Simple random sampling\: Randomly pick partici-  
pants from a sampling frame.  
→ Systematic random sampling\: Select a random  
­ number, such as 10, and pick every 10th person  
from a flow of people as your participants.  
→ Stratified random sampling\: Separate your sampling  
frame into groups based on specific crite-  
ria and use simple or random sampling to select  
­ participants ­ within these groups.  
→ Cluster sampling\: Create a list of clusters based on  
specific criteria and randomly choose some of these  
clusters, then randomly choose participants within  
the selected clusters.

Most projects use a combination of different sampling  
techniques, for example systematic random sampling in  
combination with snowball sampling. Often you need to  
set certain selection criteria as screening questions  
\(e.g., “Do you drive an electric car?”\). Emergent ­ sampling  
is something we should always do anyway in design – if  
you find something interesting, don’t ignore it. The aim  
of a sound sampling strategy is to avoid a sampling error,  
like systematically excluding a certain group of people  
that should have been considered.  
Research context  
Besides the “who,” it is also crucial to define the context  
of your research\: “when” and “where” to conduct the re-  
search. This might seem obvious – but think, for example,  
of the people you’d meet at a train station on weekdays  
in the morning \(commuting to work/school?\), weekdays  
around noon \(lunch break?\), weekdays in the afternoon  
\(commuting from work/school?\), or weekdays in the eve-  
ning \(leisure activities?\). And compare this to the same  
times during the weekend. Also, seasons are important\:  
consider how hard it would be to research customer ex-  
perience at a ski resort during the summer season.  
It often helps to engage participants in their natural  
surroundings or in a specific situational context of inter-  
est. Interviews are often done at people’s homes, because  
they are most at ease when at home. Observations or con-  
textual interviews should be done at places where people  
often use the specific service or physical/digital product,  
as they can relate to their experience more easily in that  
environment and maybe even point out certain aspects of  
it that they like or dislike. Also consider the effect of ex-  
ternal factors on the experience and behavior of people,  
such as weather, public holidays, major events, and so on.  
Sample size  
You might decide to fix the sample size \(how many par-  
ticipants your research has\) before data collection, or you  
might choose to stay flexible. This is mostly a question 05 Research  
Sample size in service design is determined using an  
ethnographic research approach based on the concept  
of theoretical saturation. In other words, you stop  
collecting data when new data does not bring additional  
insights to the research questions.

of the research objective and methods used, as well as the  
resources and time available.  
In quantitative statistics, your sample size depends  
on whether the data need be representative for a defined  
group of people \(the population\). In qualitative research –  
and particularly in ethnographically inspired design  
research – ­ researchers instead look for recurring patterns.  
You do enough ­ research – such as interviews or observa-  
tion – to let you identify patterns. When more research  
only confirms the patterns you have already identified,  
you have reached theoretical saturation. This means doing  
more research would only confirm what you already  
know and will not bring any new knowledge. Just like a  
usability test that is designed to find the biggest bugs in  
software, ­ service design research is used to find the biggest  
bugs \(or ­ opportunities\) in a physical or digital product, a  
service, or any \(customer\) experience. Unlike quantitative  
­ statistics, service design is not especially interested in  
accurate percentages of exactly how many people struggle  
with one issue, but rather needs a ranking or just a shortlist  
of bugs to fix, a list of inspirations as a basis for ideation,  
or a hit list of features customers would like to have.  
When you set your sample size, it should be large  
enough to identify recurring patterns. In 1993, the usability  
104/105  
researchers Nielson and Landauer published an article  
revealing that usability tests with only 5 users found  
85% of all usability problems, while they needed at least  
15 users to find all problems. Since service experiences  
are more complex, a good rule of thumb is to start with  
a small but culturally diverse set of participants. If you  
already see patterns emerging, use the next batch to  
confirm the patterns you spotted and see if you’ve already  
reached theoretical saturation for these patterns.01  
5.1.3  
Data collection  
There are a huge variety of research methods you can  
use to collect meaningful data in service design. We use  
quantitative methods like surveys \(offline and online\),  
any form of automated statistics \(e.g., conversion rate  
analysis\), and manually collected quantitative data  
\(e.g., frequency of shop visitors through simple count-  
ing\). However, we mostly use qualitative methods and  
particularly methods based on ethnography. Select and  
line up a sequence of research methods to collect and to  
visualize, synthesize, and analyze your research data. See  
this section and 5.1.4 for details.  
01  
“How many interviews are enough?” Theoretical saturation helps us understand when we have done enough,  
but it doesn’t help us to define a sample size a priori. For example, when you have interviewed 20 \(randomly  
selected\) participants and identified patterns, the probability that the next 20 will tell you something completely  
different is negligible \(i.e., theoretical saturation\). However, you don’t know how many people you will have  
to ask before you start seeing these patterns – it could be 10, 20, 30, or even more. See, for example, Guest, G.,  
Bunce, A., & Johnson, L. \(2006\). “How Many Interviews Are Enough? An Experiment with Data Saturation  
and Variability.” Field Methods, 18\(1\), 59-82. For an academic review of theoretical saturation, see for example,  
Bowen, G. A. \(2008\). “Naturalistic Inquiry and the Saturation Concept\: A Research Note.” Qualitative Research,  
8\(1\), 137-152. For a more critical reflection on this topic, see O’Reilly, M., & Parker, N. \(2013\). “‘Unsatisfactory  
Saturation’\: A Critical Exploration of the Notion of Saturated Sample Sizes in Qualitative Research.” Qualitative

# Overt vs. covert research  
When you use research methods that include any direct contact with people  
– that is, with your research participants, your “research subjects” – you can  
decide if you want to conduct overt or covert research.  
For research methods such as  
­ autoethnography, contextual interviews,  
online ethnography, and non-partici-  
pant and participant observation, this  
is an ­ especially important decision  
with certain advantages and disadvan-  
tages, as well as ethical implications.01  
Overt research describes a  
­ situation where researchers are open  
about their research intentions and  
make sure that the research subjects  
are aware of what is happening.  
This has some advantages – researchers  
can be honest and open about their  
work, avoiding ethical issues such as  
deception or lack of informed consent.  
It also helps researchers avoid getting  
01 For a brief academic discussion on the ethics of covert research, see  
Van Deventer, J. P. \(2009\). “Ethical Considerations During Human Centred  
Overt and Covert Research.” Quality & Quantity, 43\(1\), 45-57. For a more  
general scholarly literature review on overt and covert research in  
ethnography, see Amstel, H. R. V. \(2013\). “The Ethics and Arguments  
Surrounding Covert Research.” Social Cosmos, 4\(1\), 21-26.  
too close emotionally to the people  
they study. An important disadvantage  
of any overt research – even online  
research – is the “Hawthorn effect” or  
“observer effect.” This is when subjects  
change their behavior to act in a way  
that they believe is expected by the  
researcher, or by society in general  
\(this is often referred to as the “social  
desirability bias”\).  
Covert research is when ­ researchers  
do not share their research intentions  
with the research participants; they go  
“under cover.” Even though covert  
research obviously has an advantage  
of avoiding or at least minimizing  
potential observer bias, it almost  
automatically leads to ethical concerns  
as researchers might deceive research  
participants or lack informed consent.  
If you decide to use covert research in  
a project, always consider the ­ ethical  
and even legal framework in the  
­ country and organization where you  
plan to do your research.  
You might decide in advance if  
overt research is in or out of scope  
for your project, and sometimes you  
might switch between both in your  
­ research. If in doubt, always choose  
overt ­ research as the increased validity  
of your research \(often\) is not worth  
the risk of potential legal consequences  
of covert research. ◀ 05 Research

Research methods  
You should always consider a mix of methods as each  
research method has its own inherent potential bias.  
“Actions speak louder than words” is a common ­ saying,  
and indeed you often observe that people behave  
­ differently than they say they would. This can have  
­ different causes, like the “interviewer effect,” when the  
style and personality of the interviewer affects inter-  
viewees; the “Hawthorne effect,” when people modify  
their behavior simply based on their awareness of being  
observed; or “confirmation bias,” when researchers tend  
to search for information that confirms their beliefs or  
­ assumptions and thereby ignore other data that con-  
tradicts their ­ beliefs. However, a good mix of research  
methods levels out potential biases.  
As a rule of thumb, for a good mix of research methods  
pick one method from each of the following categories\:02  
→ Desk research, like preparatory research,  
secondary research  
→ Self-ethnographic approaches, like autoethnogra-  
phy, online ethnography  
→ Participant approaches, like participant  
­ observation, contextual interviews, in-depth  
­ interviews, focus groups  
02 All of these methods are described in detail in 5.2.  
106/107  
→ Non-participant approaches, like non-participant  
observation, mobile ethnography, cultural probes  
→ Co-creative workshops, like co-creating personas,  
journey maps, and system maps  
Method triangulation  
When we are selecting the “right” research methods –  
ones that yield a lot of useful data – we always face the  
question of how many research methods we should use.  
Given a limited budget, researchers often need to decide  
whether they should put their budget into one method  
and do this rather well, or distribute their budget to use  
a variety of research methods. We always suggest the  
latter, based on the concept of method triangulation.03  
Triangulation is based on classic navigation and land  
surveying techniques. In simple terms, with triangulation  
you can estimate your own position by measuring the  
directions of at least two distinct landmarks. Based on  
basic principles of geometry, the more landmarks we  
measure, the more accurately the position can be calcu-  
lated. Similarly, researchers can improve the accuracy  
and richness of their research by using different methods  
to collect data on the same phenomenon.  
If different methods lead to the same outcome, you  
can be more confident about these findings. However,  
in design research, triangulation is not used as much to  
seek validation or verification of research results,  
03 Denzin \(1978\) refers to four types of triangulation\: method \(methodological\) triangulation, data triangulation,  
researcher \(investigator\) triangulation, and theory triangulation. For more information, see Denzin, N. K.  
\(1978\). “Triangulation\: A Case for Methodological Evaluation and Combination.” In N. K. Denzin \(ed.\),

but rather to ensure that insights are based on a rich and  
comprehensive dataset that is robust enough to provide a  
foundation for design decisions. In particular, when you  
do exploratory research to get inspiration for new ideas,  
richness of data and perspectives is key.  
In a research context the fundamental idea of  
method triangulation is to cross-check findings with  
different methods.  
Data triangulation  
Different research methods generate different types of  
data as output, such as text \(e.g., field notes or interview  
transcripts\), photos, videos, artifacts \(e.g., tickets or info  
flyers\), as well as statistics. Some methods can generate  
different or even multiple types of data, and researchers  
should plan what kind of data they need. Again, following  
the principle of triangulation, you should strive to create  
different types of data in your research process.  
METHOD  
TRIANGULATION  
Data triangulation enables researchers to support  
findings with different underpinnings and makes your  
dataset richer and more comprehensible. One advantage  
of using different types of data can be explained with  
a simple example. Imagine the situation of a contextu-  
al ­ interview. If researchers only take field notes, they  
only write down what they regard as important. If they  
add photos of the situation, others can understand the  
situational ­ context of the interview. If they do an audio  
recording of the interview and transcribe it afterwards,  
others have a chance to interpret the interview as well. If  
they take a video of the situation, others can also interpret  
body ­ language and situational context. Different data  
types can help you to get a richer dataset and reduce the  
subjectivity of researchers.  
Another differentiation is the distinction between  
primary and secondary data. Primary data is data  
­ collected by a researcher for a specific purpose. Secondary  
data is data that has been collected by someone else for 05 Research

other purposes, but is being used by a researcher for a  
new purpose. If your organization will be conducting  
several service design projects, it makes sense to integrate  
a data or knowledge management system. The ­ outcomes  
from primary research in one project can serve as  
­ secondary data for another project and thereby save time  
and money. Researchers can build on the outcomes of  
prior research \(i.e., secondary data\) and so might be able  
to use a given research budget for more focused primary  
research, “standing on the shoulders of giants.”01  
The differentiation between first- and second-order  
concepts \(not the same as primary and secondary data\)  
is an important factor which affects how other researchers  
can work with the data. Basically, first-order concepts are  
the “raw data” \(e.g., the direct transcript of an interview\),  
while second-order concepts include interpretations by  
researchers. In practice, first-order concepts might be  
any original evidence of research that researchers gain  
from observations or interviews – for example, interview  
transcripts, but also photos or videos. Second-order  
concepts might be summarized field notes or any other  
form of data filtered or biased by a researcher striving to  
identify patterns.02 While both are useful, it is important  
to collect enough raw data \(first-order concepts\) that  
does not include interpretations by researchers, as only  
this raw data can be interpreted by other researchers at a  
later stage. Recorded data like photos or videos pre-  
serves to a large extent the raw content, which is often  
more convincing when presenting your results than any  
second-order concept. When you can do only field notes,  
distinguish between an accurate description of a situation  
studied and your personal interpretation, so that you can  
always go back and refine your interpretation.

how to reuse previous research.

Researcher triangulation  
As a \(design\) researcher using ethnographic methods,  
it is important to step into someone else’s shoes. However,  
to be able to walk in the customer’s shoes, you first need  
to take off your own. All researchers have their individ-  
ual background, knowledge, and prejudices. It’s almost  
impossible to get rid of this “researcher bias,” but it helps  
if you become aware of your own tendencies regarding  
your interpretations and conclusions \(e.g., through peer  
reflection by other ­ researchers regarding potential biases  
and predispositions\).  
Researchers should also be aware of their “­ researcher  
status” – the social position a researcher holds among the  
studied group. Depending on your status, ­ participants will  
react differently to your questions. This is ­ something to  
consider in your research planning. How do you commu-  
nicate the research to participants? Which research aim do  
you communicate? What expectations do your partici-  
pants get through this and which hidden ­ intentions might  
arise as a consequence?  
One way to tackle researcher bias is by including var-  
ious researchers, both during the collection of data and  
during synthesis and analysis. This researcher triangula-  
tion can help to reduce the level of ­ subjectivity in ethno-  
graphic research and keep the team on a consistent knowl-  
edge level throughout the project. One way to ­ increase the  
number of researchers involved is to use methods of data  
collection that actively integrate parti­ cipants as research-  
ers \(e.g., diary studies or mobile ethnography\) or meth-  
ods that put researchers in the roles of participants \(e.g.,  
service safari or autoethno­ graphy\).  
In general, you’ll have more informed conversations  
and increase buy-in from clients or management if your  
design process includes people from the client organiza-  
tion or management as well as other stakeholders. Invite  
them to participate in your fieldwork – even if they only  
have limited time. In most cases, contact with customers  
and other research participants will increase appreciation  
for research, and attention to customer needs.  
Sometimes the downside can be that invited clients  
or management use such opportunities to explain or  
even promote their offerings to interviewees, or to  
­ prioritize single users or responses. One way of support-  
ing less-knowledgeable clients could be by assigning  
them a clear role, such as a supporting interviewer or  
observer, while the members of the key project team lead  
the fieldwork.  
Indexing  
During your research, it is important to index your data  
so that you can trace insights back to the data sources  
they are based on. A simple way of indexing could be to  
label data with a short index, such as “i6.17” for inter-  
view 6, line 17, or “v12.3\:22” for video 12, at minute 3\:22.  
This allows you to later base your design decisions not  
only on insights you have generated, but on raw data.  
You might even be able to include the participants who  
reported a specific phenomenon in your prototyping of  
solutions to improve the original situation.01  
01 See 5.4.1, Case\: Applying ethnography to gain actionable insights, for a nice example of how to use indexing with  
a coding system to consistently trace every step of a design process to the research results. EXPERT TIP  
“It is often worth iterat-  
ing within stages, as well  
as between techniques\:  
coding data then sifting  
and filtering and then  
analyzing to draw out  
insights. For example, in  
diary studies we write  
up all comments in a  
spreadsheet, look for  
common patterns and  
highlight/color code,  
then dig deeper again  
on specific issues and  
reanalyze comments.  
The issues identified are  
then explored further in  
exit interviews.”

5.1.4 Data visualization, synthesis,  
and analysis  
There are many ways to synthesize and analyze data  
\(also known as sensemaking\) in design research. In general,  
we can see two major ways to do this\: the academic way  
and the practitioner’s way. Although we’ll focus mostly  
on the practitioner’s approach, we can learn a lot from  
academic approaches.  
The academic way to work with qualitative data mostly  
includes codifying data and then searching for patterns  
within this codified data. This process is often referred to  
as content analysis – there are various methods  
and even software02 to support researchers in doing this,  
but of course pen and paper will often also do the job.  
For ­ example, a researcher could codify the data by going  
through transcribed interviews and tagging sentences  
with specific labels. In a second step, the researcher  
then counts how often specific labels occur – or rather a  
software tool does this automatically.03 This process takes  
some time, but is particularly useful when you have to  
cope with a huge amount of data because it lets you split  
up a set of data and work your way through it step by step.  
This ­ happens often when you plan research design with a  
classic project management approach\: one period of data  
collection followed by one period of data analysis.  
02 03 Researchers use a huge variety of software to synthesize and analyze data, from simple spreadsheets or  
documents to sophisticated qualitative research software, such as ATLAS.ti, MAXQDA, NVivo, or QDA Miner, to  
name but a few. There is a wide selection of very specialized research software for different purposes.  
Some methods require transcribing audio and video files so that researchers work only with text files.  
With new software, various data types can be codified using the same software\: text can be coded at certain lines,  
audio and video files at certain timestamps, and photos at certain positions.  
110/111  
However, if you follow an iterative research design  
with a rather visual synthesis and analysis process, you  
won’t be drowning in data as you will have multiple itera-  
tions of data collection, synthesis, and analysis.  
Visualizing data  
Visualizing data helps teams get an overview of the  
amount of information, brings structure into complex  
data, identifies patterns, and uncovers existing gaps in the  
data. It also deepens their understanding of a topic and  
develops empathy with the people who were the subject  
of the research. There are many ways to visually work  
with and present research, and what makes sense de-  
pends on your aim. The following list summarizes some  
common ways to visualize research data in service design,  
with a brief description of why each might be useful\:04  
→ A research wall05 to give you an easy overview of  
your data and your mix of research methods and  
data types; the wall may contain any of the other  
assets listed here.  
→ Personas to exemplify different groups of people,  
such as customers or employees, and their individu-  
al characteristics, goals, and/or tasks.  
→ \(Customer\) journey maps to visualize customer  
­ experiences happening over time.  
04 All of these methods are described in detail in 5.3.  
05 Keep your research wall separate from your idea wall, if you have one. The concept of an idea wall is  
explained in Chapter 6, Ideation. This is Service Design Doing  
SERVICE  
4 Set up\: Prepare the project or service,  
prepare the use of the product.  
The customer sets up the service and  
­ prepares for first use.  
# Generic stages of a customer journey  
This is a list of generic elements of a high-level customer journey. This list can act  
as a pragmatic checklist to see whether you have already included all the main steps,  
or if you need to do more research to fill any potential gaps.  
PRE-SERVICE  
1 Wake up\: Become aware. The ­ customer  
becomes passively aware of the service  
provider and/or their services.  
2 Wise up\: Find out more,  
understand, consider. The customer  
looks for more information. This in-  
cludes first direct interactions with peers,  
review sites, or the service provider as  
well as the ­ decision-making process.  
3 Join up\: Enter the \(service\) system.  
The customer co-designs and/or  
­ negotiates the service or contract, and  
signs up or makes the purchase.  
5 Start up\: Do the first real runthrough,  
use the product for the first time.  
The customer experiences the service.  
At this stage, some support systems for  
new customers may still be in place,  
while others for experienced customers  
may not yet be offered.  
6 Keep up\: Co-create value ­ repeatedly  
\(habitual use\). The service co-creates  
the planned value and is experienced on  
a regular basis.  
7 Mess\(ed\) up\: Resolve incidents or  
problems. Something goes wrong;  
­ perhaps the customer reports an issue.  
The customer’s questions or issues are  
answered and resolved.  
8 Grow up\: Grow the service or use of  
the product. Upgrade. Add. As the cus-  
tomer becomes experienced, she may  
start to extend her usage or add more  
service offerings to the existing package.  
9 Pay up\: Pay for the service.  
The customer pays for the service,  
perhaps with money, data, attention, or  
another value exchange.  
10 Close up\: Shut down the service  
or stop using the product. The  
­ customer decides to stop using the  
service \(or signs up again\).  
12 POST-SERVICE  
11 Speak up\: Share your experience.  
The customer shares her experience  
with others.  
Listen up\: Stay in the loop.  
The customer receives advertisements,  
occasional phone calls, or invites to  
events to stay in the loop even though  
he is not actually a client at this time.  
This closes the loop, returning to the  
step “Wake up\: Become aware.” ◀ 05 Research  
→ System maps to show relationships between  
­ stakeholders and product-service ecosystems.  
→ Key insights to highlight the biggest ­ customer  
­ problems or potentials customers have regarding a  
­ certain physical/digital product or service.  
→ Jobs to be done to emphasize the big picture of what  
customers strive to achieve.  
→ User stories to ensure a common language with  
­ software developers.  
→ Research reports to ensure a ­ comprehensive  
­ research overview, often including many of  
the tools above.  
It is important to consider the target audience for your  
visualization and ask yourself what exactly you want to  
share. Different audiences will have different needs – do  
they need pithy research insights or lots of raw data? Do  
you need something rather formal and self-explanatory  
so your outcomes can be used in different departments or  
organizations? Or are your outcomes only needed for your  
internal team? Any research outcome that you need to  
communicate beyond your own team needs more polish.  
Peer review and co-creation  
One simple way to increase the quality of your research  
is through peer review. Include other researchers,  
­ customers, employees, and stakeholders to benefit from  
112/113  
multiple perspectives and reduce the risk of ­ confirmation  
bias. If you want to include others at this stage, they  
must be able to understand your data and draw their  
own ­ conclusions. So, aim to collect as much raw data  
\(i.e., first-order ­ concepts\) as possible and compare your  
own ­ interpretations with those of your peers. Make sure  
that insights are always trackable to your raw data \(use  
­ indexing\), so that reviewers can understand the translation  
from data to insight and second it.  
As a rule of thumb, it is easier to include other people  
early on during the synthesis and analysis stage, so that  
you can cluster your data and generate categories using  
a co-creative approach instead of only invit­ ing others to  
review your work. However, sometimes co-creative work-  
shops are not possible; then, peer-review is a way to limit  
subjectivity and research bias.  
Codifying data  
One major question when you’re codifying data01 is this\:  
where do the categories for these codes come from?  
Mostly, qualitative research is understood to follow an  
­ inductive approach in which researchers “immerse”  
themselves in the data and generate categories and  
­ insights from the data itself. On the other hand, some-  
times researchers follow a deductive approach and start  
with a defined set of categories derived from literature  
or other research, but then eliminate or add categories  
01 Note the difference between codifying data and indexing data. Labels used for indexing data are often rather  
cryptic and only serve to find a specific piece of data within the raw dataset \(e.g., “i6.17” or “o12.3\:22”\). Labels  
or tags used for codifying data are often keywords to summarize or interpret parts of the data. This could be  
categories of customer problems or phrases that customers repeatedly mentioned \(e.g., “ticket machine” or “too  
little time to choose”\). However, in practice, indexing and coding are often mixed up or used interchangeably. This is Service Design Doing

through their data synthesis. Deductive qualitative  
­ analysis strives to test specific assumptions or concepts  
and therefore often categorizes data in previously defined  
categories. While design research to identify customer

research to test prototypes is often rather deductive.

usability improvements for a piece of software that can  
be ­ described as user stories and directly implemented  
during software development.01 The usual case, however,  
is that topics identified during the research process are  
visualized with personas, journey maps, system maps,  
key insights, jobs to be done, user stories, or research  
­ reports. These can be used to identify problems or  
opportunities in subsequent ideation activities.02 If you  
already have some immediate ideas of how to solve dis-  
covered issues, you might also directly try to prototype  
these in prototyping activities.03  
Using research outcomes  
The outcome of service design research usually serves  
as input for other service design activities, such as  
­ ideation or prototyping. In some cases, research output  
can even be used directly in implementation activities.  
For example, research can sometimes reveal simple

03 See Chapter 7, Prototyping. 05 Research  
114/115  
# Problem space vs. solution space  
Immediate solutions usually just fix a symptom, but not the deeper  
problem \(or opportunity\) underneath.  
Typically, during research activities,  
you explore in detail the existing  
problems of an experience, a process,  
or a system. You try to question what  
you see and challenge your assump-  
tions. At least, this is what you should  
do. Unfortunately, one problem is  
that we as humans are trained to solve  
problems. When we see a problem,  
we immediately start thinking about  
potential solutions.  
This is unfortunate, as these are  
probably not solutions for the root  
cause. To be able to work on that,  
you need to invest more effort into  
understanding the problem. You  
need to remain longer in the problem  
space, without jumping into the solu-  
tion space too soon.  
Sometimes it helps a design team if  
they clearly understand where they are.  
Are you in the problem space trying to  
understand someone’s problem in more  
detail and depth, exploring this from  
various perspectives and trying to dig  
deeper and discover the root cause of it?  
Or are you in the solution space striving  
to find ideas on how to solve a well-de-  
fined problem? You can make this clear  
using visual clues such as a poster on  
the wall wherever your design team  
works, by clearly articulating where you  
are in your meetings and workshops.  
Of course, a design team will have  
many ideas during research ­ activities  
and it would be a shame to lose them. If  
ideas come up during research, capture  
them on an idea wall04 and then let go.  
Or, you might want to see the idea  
as a hypothesis and rephrase it into its  
underlying assumptions – this feeds  
into your next research iteration as a  
new research question. Also, you might  
want to brief your team before the  
next steps of the design process, such  
as ideation activities that might follow  
your research. ◀

unexpected times. This is Service Design Doing

# 5.2 METHODS OF  
# DATA COLLECTION  
This section provides a wide selection of potential  
research methods to collect data in service design ­ research.  
Many more methods exist, and often the same method  
has several inconsistent names. We can only give a very  
brief ­ introduction for each method, but if you want to  
dig ­ deeper, there is plenty of literature – and for some  
methods, even whole books – with detailed ­ descriptions  
and examples.01 The research methods are structured in  
five categories\:  
→ Desk research\: Preparatory research,  
secondary research  
→ Self-ethnographic approaches\: Autoethnography,  
online ethnography  
→ Participant approaches\: Participant observation,  
contextual interviews, in-depth interviews, focus groups  
→ Non-participant approaches\: Non-participant  
­ observation, mobile ethnography, cultural probes  
→ Co-creative workshops\: Creating personas,  
journey mapping, system mapping  
These categories are not an academic standard, and as  
there are many variations and names for each research  
method, the boundaries between the categories might  
be rather fluid. However, as a rule of thumb, we suggest  
you use at least one method from each category in your  
research to give better method triangulation.

potentially interesting topics iteratively.  
C A smartphone and/or a simple notepad is often the best  
tool to document auto­ ethnographic research.  
DESK RESEARCH  
# Preparatory research  
Your own preparation before you start your actual  
research or fieldwork.01  
Preparatory \(or simply “prep”\) research often includes digging  
deeper into an industry, an organization, competitors, or similar  
products, and also the client’s perspective of what the research  
problem is, their context, perceptions, internal conflicts or inter-  
plays, and so on. Prep research is less about finding answers,  
and more about finding the right questions to ask in your  
research. Prep research can result in a summary of text snippets  
and/or a collection of photos, screenshots, or videos, perhaps  
visualized as a mood board.  
Preparation\: Often prep research starts with very wide  
research questions or topics, from soft topics such as  
“How does home feel?” to rather specific topics such as  
“Where else is this technology used?”  
Use\: Prep research can include conducting internal  
interviews; screening social media; listening to pod-  
casts, online videos, or conference talks; and reading  
­ industry-specific scientific or special-interest publications  
along with newspapers or general-interest magazines.  
Expected output\: Text, statistics, photos, and videos,  
as well as mind maps, mood boards, and the like  
01 See 9.2.2, Preparatory research, for a brief description of the importance of prep research for  
the overall service design process. METHODS 05 Research  
DESK RESEARCH  
# Secondary research  
The collection, synthesis, and summary of  
existing research.02  
In contrast to primary research, secondary research \(often  
also simply called “desk research”\) uses only existing secondary  
data – information collected for other projects or purposes. The  
main idea is to check whether research regarding a topic already  
exists. This helps us to formulate a research question more  
precisely and identify promising methods of data collection,  
visualization, and synthesis. Desk research should always be the  
starting point of a research process, simply to avoid reinventing  
the wheel and to stand on the shoulders of giants when you start  
your primary research.  
Preparation\: Collect a list of potentially promising  
­ internal and/or external sources such as academic  
­ papers, white papers, and reports, as well as experts on  
your research topic.  
Use\: Search for qualitative and quantitative secondary  
data regarding your research topic using online search  
engines, scientific databases and journals, libraries,  
­ conferences, and expert talks and interviews.  
Expected output\: Text, statistics, mind maps  
and the like  
02 For a description and discussion of a more systematic process to use secondary data in research see,  
for example\: Johnston, M. P. \(2017\). Secondary data analysis\: A method of which the time has come.  
Qualitative and Quantitative Methods in Libraries, 3\(3\), 619-626.  
118/119  
SELF-ETHNOGRAPHIC APPROACH  
# Autoethnography  
Researchers explore a particular experience themselves and  
self-document this using field notes, audio recordings, videos, and  
photographs;03 also called self-ethnography/documentation.  
Besides “real” \(i.e., rather academic\) autoethnographic research  
where researchers immerse themselves for months within an  
organization, service design often applies shorter versions of this\:  
team members explore a particular experience themselves in  
the real situational context, mostly as customers or as ­ employees.  
Variants of this include mystery shopping, mystery working,  
­ service safaris, explorative service safaris, or diary studies.  
Preparation\: Autoethnography is often one of the first  
research methods undertaken as it helps researchers  
to interpret behaviors when they conduct interviews  
or observations. Decide when and where you will  
­ conduct your research.  
Use\: Autoethnography can address one or more channels  
as well as actions with or without other ­ people  
and/or machines. If you take field notes, write up first-level  
\(“raw data”\) and second-level concepts \(“­ interpretations”\)  
separately\: for example, what you see and hear on the  
left page and what you interpret from this or how it  
feels on the right.  
Expected output\: Text \(transcripts, field notes\),  
audio recordings, photos, videos, artifacts  
03 For a more comprehensive introduction to how autoethnography can be used as a qualitative research method see,  
for example, Adams, T. E., Holman Jones, S., & Ellis, C. \(2015\). Autoethnography\: Understanding Qualitative Research  
\(Oxford University Press\). This is Service Design Doing  
SELF-ETHNOGRAPHIC APPROACH  
# Online ethnography  
An approach to investigate how people interact with one  
another in online communities,01 also known as virtual or  
cyber ethnography.  
Online ethnography can be done as self-ethnographic research,  
non-participant ethnography, or participant ethnography –  
however, it always focuses on online experiences. It can look at  
many different aspects, such as social interactions within an  
online community or the differences between the self-perception  
of people when they are online and in real life.  
Preparation\: Based on your research question, define  
which online communities might be suitable for your  
research question. Decide how you will document your  
experiences; e.g., through screenshots or screencasts,  
system or journey maps, or simply field notes.  
Use\: Often online ethnographies include a mix of  
­ methods, such as observations, contextual interviews  
conducted online with screen sharing, or in-depth  
­ retrospective interviews with other community members.  
Expected output\: Text \(quotes, transcripts, field notes\),  
screenshots, recordings \(screencasts or audio recordings\)  
PARTICIPANT APPROACH  
# Participant observation  
Researchers immerse themselves in the lives of  
research participants.  
Participant observation is an umbrella term for a variety of  
­ methods, such as shadowing, a day in the life, or work-along.02  
Preparation\: Based on your research question, select  
suitable interviewees and plan when and where you will  
conduct your research and how you will document it.  
How will you approach your participants? How will you  
start and end? How will you manage the “observer effect”?  
How much time will you plan for it?  
Use\: Observations might be at the participant’s workplace,  
in their home, or even following them throughout a process  
like a holiday trip. Use the situational context and ask  
participants to explain specific activities, artifacts, behavior,  
motivations, needs, pains, or gains. Sometimes contradic-  
tions between what people say and what people do can be  
very revealing if you mirror behavior back to participants.  
During participant observations it is important to observe  
not only what people are doing \(by interpreting their body  
language and gestures\) but also what they are not doing.  
Expected output\: Text \(transcripts, field notes\),  
audio recordings, photos, videos, artifacts

120/121  
PARTICIPANT APPROACH  
# Contextual interview  
Interviews conducted with customers, employees, or any other  
­ relevant stakeholders in a situational context relevant to the  
research question,03 also known as contextual inquiry.  
Contextual interviews are used to understand a certain group of  
people better \(their needs, emotions, expectations, and environ-  
ment – useful for personas\), to reveal formal and informal networks  
and hidden agendas of specific actors \(useful for system maps\),  
or to understand particular experiences \(useful for journey maps\).  
Contextual interviews can be done, for example, with employees at  
their workplace or with customers during a specific moment of the  
customer experience.  
Preparation\: In contrast to studio interviews, contextual  
ones are conducted “in situational context,” so that research-  
ers can observe the surroundings and interviewees can point  
to elements in the environment. Based on your research  
question, define who, when, and where you will interview  
and how you will document the situational context – includ-  
ing the interviewee’s mood, gestures, and body language.  
Use\: Try to ask your interviewees to demonstrate details  
of the concrete experience of interest. It is often easier for  
people to articulate their motivations and experience when  
they can refer to concrete examples.  
Expected output\: Text \(transcripts, field notes\), audio  
recordings, photos, videos, artifacts  
03 See, for example, Beyer, H., & Holtzblatt, K. \(1997\). Contextual Design\: Defining Customer-centered

A  
B  
A Pay attention to your interviewees’ body language and  
gestures and write down interesting observations. This often  
leads to further questions.  
B Try to differentiate between concrete observations and your  
own interpretations \(first-level/second-level concepts\).  
PARTICIPANT APPROACH  
# In-depth interview  
A qualitative research technique of conducting intensive  
individual interviews.  
In-depth interviews are often conducted with relevant ­ stakeholders  
or external experts to understand different perspectives on a  
­ specific subject. These interviews can help researchers learn more  
about particular expectations, experiences, products, services,  
goods, operations, processes, and concerns, and also about a  
­ person’s attitude, problems, needs, ideas, or environment.  
Preparation\: In-depth interviews are mostly done in a  
semistructured way to collect useful data. For example,  
interview guidelines can be based on an empathy map.01  
In-depth interviews are mostly done face to face, allowing  
researchers to observe body language and create a more  
intimate atmosphere. They can also be conducted online  
or by telephone.  
Use\: These interviews can be supported by co-creating  
boundary objects, such as scribbles or mind maps, or  
using personas, journey maps, system maps, or other useful  
templates. They can also include tasks like card sorting to  
understand user needs or storytelling supported by tangible  
touchpoint cards to visualize experiences.  
Expected output\: Text \(transcripts, field notes\), audio  
recordings, photos, videos, artifacts  
01 The original empathy map includes the topics of Who are we empathizing with?, What do they need to do?, What  
do they see/say/do/hear?, and What do they think and feel \(pains and gains\)? In 2017, Who are we empathizing  
with? and What do they need to do? were added to the original template. See Gray, D., Brown, S., & Macanufo, J.

PARTICIPANT APPROACH  
# Focus groups  
A classic qualitative interview research method in which a  
researcher invites a group of people and asks them questions on  
specific products, services, goods, concepts, problems,  
prototypes, advertisements, etc.  
With a focus group, researchers strive to understand the  
­ perceptions, opinions, ideas, or attitudes toward a given topic.  
Although focus groups are often used in business, they have only  
limited applicability in service design. They typically lack the sit-  
uational context and usually do not co-create boundary objects,  
such as personas or journey/system maps. This often leads to lim-  
ited informative value as results depend solely on the moderated  
discussion and are biased by issues like observer effect, group  
think, ­ social desirability bias, etc.02  
Preparation\: Focus groups are mostly carried out in a  
rather informal setting, like a meeting room or a special  
room where researchers observe the situation through a  
one-way mirror.  
Use\: Researchers often ask only an initial question  
and then observe the group discussion and dynamics.  
Sometimes a researcher acts as a moderator guiding  
the group through a set of questions.

dicated by important insights from several disciplines,” says Gerald Zaltman, Emeritus Professor, Harvard Business

NON-PARTICIPANT APPROACH  
# Non-participant observation  
Researchers collect data by observing behavior without actively  
interacting with the participants.  
In non-participant observation, researchers do not interact with  
research participants; they behave like a “fly on the wall.” Research  
subjects are often customers, employees, or other stakeholders,  
observed in situations that are relevant to the research question.  
Often, non-participant observation is used to level out researcher  
biases in other methods and to reveal differences between what  
people say and what they actually do.  
Preparation\: Plan who will do the research, when, where,  
and with whom. Sometimes when researchers do covert  
­ non-participant observation they pretend to be ­ customers  
or passers-by, or even use one-way mirrors, minimizing the  
risk of the “observer effect.”03  
Use\: During non-participant observations, it is important  
to observe not only what people are doing \(for example by  
interpreting their body language and gestures\), but also  
what people are not doing \(perhaps ignoring instructions  
or refraining from asking for help or assistance\).  
Expected output\: Text \(field notes\), photos,  
videos, audio recordings, sketches, artifacts, statistics  
\(e.g., counting customers per hour\)  
03 Y ou can also do overt non-participant observation, for example, when researchers sit in on meetings or  
workshops on site, but do not actively participate in it. They behave like a “fly on the wall”. See also the textbox  
Overt vs. covert research in 5.1.3. This is Service Design Doing  
NON-PARTICIPANT APPROACH  
# Mobile ethnography  
Aggregated multiple self-ethnographies, taking place in a  
guided research setting where data is collected with mobile devices  
such as smartphones.01  
A mobile ethnography research project can include anywhere from  
a handful to thousands of participants. Usually users, customers, or  
employees are included as participants, self-documenting their own  
experiences on their own smartphones with text, photos, ­ videos,  
or quantitative evaluations, as well as date, time, and ­ location.  
Researchers can review, synthesize, analyze, and export the  
­ collected data in real time.  
Preparation\: Plan to offer incentives for your participants  
\(recruiting is often the hardest part!\). In your invitation,  
provide clear and short instructions on how to join the  
project and how to document. Define questions for your  
participant profile so that you can cluster participants into  
groups matching your personas.  
Use\: Mobile ethnography works well for longer research  
over one or a few days. Once you have started your data  
collection, you can start to synthesize and analyze.  
Expected output\: Text, photos, videos, audio recordings,  
date and time information, geolocation data, statistics of  
participant profiles  
01 For a comparison of mobile ethnography with other ethnographic approaches, see Segelström, F., & Holmlid, S.  
\(2012\). “One Case, Three Ethnographic Styles\: Exploring Different Ethnographic Approaches to the Same Broad  
Brief.” In Ethnographic Praxis in Industry Conference Proceedings, 2012 \(1\), 48-62. For more examples of applied  
mobile ethnography in tourism, see Stickdorn, M., & Frischhut, B. \(eds.\) \(2012\). Service Design and Tourism\: Case

NON-PARTICIPANT APPROACH  
# Cultural probes  
Selected research participants collect packages of information  
based on specific tasks given by researchers.02  
In cultural probes, research participants are asked to self-docu-  
ment certain experiences with field notes and photos, and/or to  
collect relevant artifacts. Cultural probes are often also done vir-  
tually using online diary platforms or mobile ethnography apps.  
Preparation\: Prepare and send a package to participants,  
which might include a set of instructions, a notebook,  
and a single-use camera. You might want to prepare a  
simple script for participants to follow, or instruct them  
to take photos of how they use specific products in  
various contexts.  
Use\: The aim of cultural probes is to gain unbiased  
data that has been collected by participants themselves  
in context, without having a researcher present. They  
help researchers to understand and overcome cul-  
tural boundaries and bring diverse perspectives into  
a design process. Cultural probes are often a mix of  
various ­ approaches and may be combined with in-depth  
interviews to review the collected data retrospective-  
ly. They can include diaries kept over a day, a week, or  
even several years.  
Expected output\: Text \(self-documented notes, diaries\),  
photos, videos, audio recordings, artifacts  
02 For an introduction on how to use cultural probes in design see, for example, Gaver, B., Dunne, T., & Pacenti, E.

CO-CREATIVE WORKSHOP  
# Co-creating personas  
A  
Using the know-how of a group of invited participants  
to create a set of personas.  
The quality of results of a co-creative persona workshop depends  
on the research data you bring to the workshop and on how  
much participants know about the group of people you want to  
exemplify with personas – for example, a workshop with frontline  
employees is often quite useful to create personas of customers.  
For less biased results, avoid inviting only people with abstract  
knowledge of the subject matter. The results might look convincing,  
but often they are very biased.  
B  
Preparation\: Invite and incentivize your workshop  
participants and describe the aim of the workshop. Select  
participants with in-depth knowledge of the stakeholder  
group you are creating the ­ persona for. Write a facilitation  
agenda to create a safe space during the workshop.05  
Use\: These workshops often follow a structure similar to  
this\: welcome and split into smaller groups, create initial  
personas, present and cluster, discuss and merge, visualize  
and validate, iterate.  
A Participants use a mobile ethnography app on their  
smartphones to report on and evaluate their experi-  
ences step by step. Researchers see the data in real  
time and can start analyzing it immediately.03  
B The content of a cultural probe \(the observation  
package\) to research flight travel experiences.04  
C Even though age and gender is always an easy start  
for a persona, demographics might be quite misleading.  
Instead, think of factors that differentiate the groups  
you would like to represent with your personas.  
Expected output\: Drafts of personas \(physical or digital\),  
workshop photos, quotes of participants \(audio or text\),  
videos of workshop progress

CO-CREATIVE WORKSHOP  
# Co-creating journey maps  
Using the know-how of a group of invited participants to  
create one or more journey maps or service blueprints.  
Invite participants who have solid knowledge about the expe-  
rience you are mapping. If you want to create a journey map  
about customer experiences, this might be customers \(yes, real  
ones!\) and/or frontline employees. The outcomes of co-creative  
workshops are often assumption-based. The results might look  
convincing, but often they are biased. These outcomes should  
be understood as tools in development, as a common starting  
point to design the research process, or to evaluate and enhance  
collected data.  
Preparation\: Think about inviting workshop participants  
with either a shared perspective \(such as customers of a  
particular target group\) or from differing perspectives  
\(such as customers of various target groups or ­ customers  
and employees\). Clearly communicate the scope of  
the journey map, such as a high-level journey map vs.  
a more detailed map of one specific situation within a  
high-level journey map.  
Use\: Define your main actor and journey scope, welcome  
and split into smaller groups, identify stages and steps,  
iterate and refine, add perspectives such as the emotional  
journey \(optional\), discuss and merge, iterate.  
Expected output\: Drafts of journey maps \(physical or  
digital\), workshop photos, quotes of participants \(audio  
or text\), videos of workshop progress  
CO-CREATIVE WORKSHOP  
# Co-creating system maps  
Using the know-how of a group of invited participants to  
­ create system maps.01  
For each system map, define a specific perspective and invite  
participants with a sound knowledge of this. With your decision on  
who to invite and who to leave out, you also decide which perspec-  
tives might be interesting enough to include. Constantly challenge  
your assumptions with solid research. Over time, assumption-based  
maps should develop into research-based ones.  
Preparation\: In addition to the know-how of the workshop  
participants, a second important factor is the qualitative  
research you do beforehand and bring to the workshop,  
for example through a research wall.  
Use\: Setting a clear scope and situational context helps  
workshop participants to get on the same page. Often these  
workshops follow a structure like this\: welcome and  
split into smaller groups, create initial stakeholder maps  
\(1. list stakeholders, 2. prioritize stakeholders, 3. visualize  
stakeholders on map, 4. illustrate relationships between  
stakeholders\), present and compare, discuss and merge,  
iterate and validate, test different scenarios within the  
ecosystem \(optional\).  
Expected output\: Drafts of system maps \(physical or  
digital\), workshop photos, quotes of participants \(audio or  
text\), videos of workshop progress

# 5.3 METHODS OF DATA  
# VISUALIZATION, SYNTHESIS,  
# AND ANALYSIS  
B  
C  
This section introduces methods used in service  
­ design to visualize, synthesize, and analyze data collected  
as ­ described in the previous section – sometimes this  
­ process is also called “sensemaking.” This is just a brief  
overview; there are many more approaches to ­ visualize  
data, and plenty of appropriate ways to ­ communicate the  
data and insights. Also, often the same method is known  
by several \(perhaps inconsistently used\) names. If you  
want to dig deeper, there is plenty of literature, and for  
some methods even whole books with detailed descrip-  
tions and examples.  
A  
This section presents eight methods of data  
­ visualization and analysis\:  
A Visualizations, such as a journey map, help participants  
to ­ understand the context of each step and enable  
them to navigate quicker.  
B Paper templates often help participants to get  
started and to take a task seriously. The more  
­ familiar they become with a tool, the less important  
­ templates are for them.  
C Value network maps quickly can become quite messy.  
Try to give a map a specific focus to keep an overview.

# Building a research wall  
EXPERT TIP  
“To take personas  
further, use a perso-  
na’s goals, issues, and  
unmet user needs to \(1\)  
stimulate scenarios and  
ideation sessions on  
iterations of an existing  
service or develop a new  
service, or \(2\) to guide  
recruitment in ethno-  
graphic studies, as a  
starting point to create  
journey maps or build  
service blueprints from.”  
—  
Phillippa Rose  
Synthesizing and analyzing research data through a visual  
arrangement of research data on a wall.01  
You can imagine a research wall as a more complex version of  
how detectives structure their crime scene data in many thrillers  
\(think of any CSI episode\). You’ll find many types of data on  
these walls \(quotes, photos, screenshots of websites or videos,  
statistics, artifacts, etc.\). This enables you to identify patterns  
within your data, while also providing a place to share your  
research with others as it develops.  
Preparation\: Prepare a wall space or large cardboard  
sheets to hang up your research data. Also, think about  
who should join you to create a research wall.  
COMMENT  
“We started to docu-  
ment all our core cus-  
tomer experiences with  
­ current-state journey  
maps based on quanti-  
tative and predominantly  
qualitative research.  
Now that we know where  
we are, we can make  
educated decisions  
on what exactly needs  
improvement and why.”  
—  
Anke Helmbrecht  
Use\: Hang the material on the wall and start synthesizing  
data by clustering it according to specific topics, like cer-  
tain customer segments, common problems, steps along  
the journey map, etc. Name these clusters and look for  
connections between clusters as well as connections be-  
tween single materials \(be aware of a potential confirma-  
tion bias\). The various patterns you identify can then be  
further explored with tools like personas, journey maps,  
system maps, key insights, and so on – all of which also  
become part of the research wall.  
Expected output\: A visual arrangement of research data  
01 See 8.3, Service design and software development for an example of how a research wall is used to connect  
different service design activities of research, ideation, prototyping, and implementation.  
# Creating personas  
Creating a rich description of a specific fictional person as an  
archetype exemplifying a group of people, such as a group of  
customers, users, or employees.02  
Personas focus on particular types of customer motivations  
and behaviors, and help to achieve empathy with a group of  
people to create solutions that address real problems. You can  
­ create them for existing market segments or to challenge an  
­ existing segmentation.  
Preparation\: Persona templates or empathy maps are  
sometimes helpful when creating personas. You often  
mix different approaches – for example, starting with  
­ assumption-based personas developed during a co-cre-  
ative workshop with frontline staff, then enriching and  
backing these with research.  
Use\: Create approximately three to seven core personas  
representing your main market segments. Following the  
principle of “design for the average – test with extremes,”  
create many more “edge-of-the-curve” personas to test  
ideas and prototypes with people from more extreme  
ends of your user spectrum.  
Expected output\: Personas

# Mapping journeys  
C  
A  
Visualizing specific experiences of a main actor,  
often exemplified by a persona, over time.  
Journey maps can visualize03 existing experiences \(current-state  
journey maps\) or planned experiences \(future-state journey  
maps\). The basic structure of a journey map consists of steps  
and stages defining the scale of the visualized experience, from  
a high-level journey map that shows an end-to-end experience  
to a detailed journey map showing only a few minutes.  
Preparation\: Even though assumption-based journey  
maps are relatively easy and fast to do, they can be very  
misleading. If you start with assumption-based journey  
maps, constantly challenge your assumptions. Over time,  
assumption-based journey maps should develop into  
research-based ones with a solid foundation on research  
data \(beware of confirmation bias\).04  
B  
Use\: Often a process to create a journey map looks like  
this\: prepare and print out data, choose a main actor  
\(persona\), define scale and scope, create steps, iterate  
and refine, add lanes.  
A Using foam boards as research walls helps a research team to keep  
research data \(such as quotes, photos, screenshots, artifacts, etc.\) with  
them when they have to move between rooms.  
B Structure your research wall by clustering and adding headings to the  
different sections.  
C Starting personas with demographics, like age, gender, nationality, job,  
and so on, carries the risk of stereotyping. Instead, try to build your  
personas from your research, perhaps starting with behavioral patterns  
you find within your data.  
Expected output\: Journey maps

# Mapping systems  
A  
B  
Visualizing the ecosystem around services and physical  
or digital products.  
“System maps” is an umbrella term for different visualizations,  
such as stakeholder maps, value network maps, or ecosystem  
maps. All of these can be created from various perspectives.  
A system looks different from a customer’s perspective compared  
with a business internal perspective. System maps have obvious  
relationships to other tools in service design, such as personas  
and journey maps.03  
D  
C  
Preparation\: As system maps can become very messy,  
it is important to define a clear focus for a map. Don’t try  
to visualize every stakeholder you can think of on the same  
stakeholder map; it’s more useful to make various maps for  
different purposes. System maps are an excellent tool to  
synthesize research data, so it is useful to prepare research  
data beforehand. Remember that research is iterative, and it  
makes sense to use these maps to find gaps in your research,  
which you can investigate in later research iterations.  
A A journey map visualiz ing two different scales of  
daily and weekly user activities. The map includes  
a sketched storyboard, an emotional journey,  
and user needs.01  
B Journey mapping software helps you to quickly create  
professional journey maps with dispersed teams.02  
C System maps are often hard to understand for people  
outside of your core team. Reduce them to the most  
important facts when you use them for communication.  
D Using templates or a specific structure helps to  
develop key insights, but constantly ask yourself if  
every aspect of your insight is specific and clear  
enough and if it is backed by sufficient research data.  
Use\: Often, creating system maps looks like this\: prepare and  
print out data, collect stakeholders, ­ prioritize stakehold-  
ers, visualize stakeholders on map, illustrate relationships  
between stakeholders \(optional\), find gaps and iterate.

# Developing key insights  
Summarizing main findings in a concise and actionable format  
for communication within and across project teams.04  
Key insights are built on research and supported by raw data.  
They often include a situational context, and an intended out-  
come, as well as a restriction, obstacle, or friction. First insights  
are often generated based on patterns you find while you are  
­ collecting data, building your research wall, or codifying your  
data. If you don’t have enough data to critically reflect on an  
assumption, collect more data. Design research is iterative!  
Preparation\: There are many ways \(and templates\) to  
formulate insights, such as\: … \[actor\] wants to … \[action\]  
because … \[motivation\], but … \[tension\]. It helps to  
write down initial ideas for insights at any stage of the  
research process and then critically reflect on them using  
your research data.  
Use\: Often, key insights are developed from initial as-  
sumptions, hypotheses, and intermediate insights \(try to  
avoid confirmation bias\). The process often goes like this\:  
prepare and print out data; write initial insights; cluster,  
merge, and prioritize; link key insights to data; find gaps  
and iterate. Key insights should be carefully phrased,  
as they will serve as points of reference for the further  
design process.  
Expected output\: Several key insights  
04  
“In contrast to this abundant data, insights are relatively rare. \[...\] When they are generated, though, insights  
derived from the smart use of data are hugely powerful. Brands and companies that are able to develop big  
insights – from any level of data – will be winners.” Kamal, I. \(2012\). “Metrics Are Easy; Insight Is Hard,” at  
https\://hbr.org/2012/09/metrics-are-easy-insights-are-hard.  
130/131  
# Generating jobs-to-be-done  
# insights  
Summarizing the bigger picture of what customers want  
to achieve when they use certain services or physical/  
digital products.  
Jobs to be done \(JTBD\) is a specific way to formulate insights  
based on a framework by Clayton Christensen.05 JTBD describes  
what a product helps the customer to achieve. It can be formu-  
lated for an entire physical/digital product or service \(the main  
aim behind a journey map\). Alternatively, formulate it for certain  
steps within a journey map by asking yourself what a customer  
or user wants to get done and adding your discoveries as an  
additional lane on a journey map. JTBD can help a team to  
break away from a current solution and discover new solutions  
based on what customers really want to achieve.  
Preparation\: Often, JTBD are developed based on this  
structure\: When … \[situation\], I want to … \[motivation  
or forces\], so I can … \[expected outcome\]. To phrase  
JTBD, prepare and print out research data, personas,  
and journey maps.  
Use\: JTBD insights can be created iteratively ­ together  
with data collection and can follow a process like  
this\: write down initial JTBD insights; cluster,  
merge, and ­ prioritize; link JTBD insights to data; find  
gaps and iterate.  
Expected output\: Jobs-to-be-done insights

# Writing user stories  
Summarizing what customers or users want to be able to do; used  
to bridge design research with defining requirements for soft-  
ware development.01  
User stories are used in software development to define require-  
ments from a user perspective, instead of more product-based  
requirement documents. User stories are often formulated like this\:  
As a … \[type of user/persona/role\], I want … \[action\], so that …  
\[outcome\]. In service design, they are used to connect design  
research with actionable input for IT development to turn insights  
and/or ideas into productive software. User stories can also be  
used beyond software development to define the requirements of  
any physical/digital product or service.  
Preparation\: Just as journey maps have different zoom  
levels, software requirements also have different scales.  
While user stories typically describe detailed requirements,  
a set of user stories can be combined into an “epic,” a longer,  
less detailed description of the big picture of what software  
can do. It’s important to define this scale level beforehand.  
Use\: User stories should be formulated without IT-specific  
language, using simple, concise words, so that everyone  
can understand them. Writing user stories often follows a  
­ process like this\: write initial user stories, cluster user sto-  
ries into epics, link user stories to data, find gaps and iterate.  
Expected output\: User stories  
01 User stories are used in many agile software development frameworks, such as Extreme Programming,  
Scrum, and Kanban. Mind that different approaches often use specific templates for how to phrase user stories.  
See, for example, Schwaber, K., & Beedle, M. \(2002\). Agile Software Development with Scrum \(Vol. 1\).  
Upper Saddle River\: Prentice Hall.  
# Compiling research reports  
Aggregate research process, methods, research data,  
data visualizations, and insights. Reports are often  
a required deliverable.  
Research reports can have many forms, from written reports  
to more visual collections of photos and videos. Depending on  
the project a research report can serve various purposes, such  
as providing actionable guidelines to improve a physical/digital  
product or service, a “shock report” to get internal buy-in for a  
service design project, proof of work that justifies the budget  
spent on research, a compendium of research data that can be  
reused in other projects, and more.  
Preparation\: Have your research process and your re-  
search data, as well as different visualizations \(personas,  
journey maps, system maps\) and insights \(key insights,  
JTBD, user stories\), at hand. Think who you could invite  
to peer-review your report.  
Use\: Write a first draft of your research report. Ask your-  
self\: who was involved, which methods and tools did you  
use, and how many iterations did you do? Add a sum-  
mary of your key findings and key visualizations, add  
raw data as evidence, and use indices to show that there’s  
much more data these are based on. Then invite other  
researchers or participants of the research to peer-review  
your report and iterate.  
Expected output\: Research reports A

The challenge  
Every year, the electricity supply is  
turned off in approximately 350,000  
households in Germany01 because  
the electricity bill cannot be paid.  
For those affected, the effects are  
dramatic and often lead to further  
social problems. For energy suppliers,  
cutting off the supply incurs costs,  
and it negatively affects the company’s  
image. Energy-related debts are often  
just one aspect of a complex debt is-  
sue and must therefore be addressed  
holistically. In view of this, there is  
no viable alternative to a cooperative  
effort involving institutions from the  
public, private, and social sectors.  
Project objectives  
The project was intended to avoid  
electricity cutoffs, reduce energy  
debts, and prevent their recurrence.  
To reach these goals, the various  
01 Bundesnetzagentur \(2015\). Monitoring Report, p. 192.  
perspectives of all stakeholders in  
the arena of energy poverty had to  
be taken into account. The project  
sought to establish and consolidate  
intersectoral cooperation between  
job centers, debt counseling charities,  
and the energy provider.  
The goal is to develop services for  
customers, job centers, and ­ counseling  
charities that have an ­ immediate  
impact as well as ­ long-term  
­ benefits, and to implement them  
throughout Germany.  
Our project process\:  
From briefing to  
evaluation in six phases  
We started the Zahlhilfe ­ project  
in 2014. It consists of six key  
­ stages. Following the Identification,  
Understanding, and Developing  
phases, we tested the service con-  
cepts with approximately 300  
real customers, job centers, and  
­ counseling charities over a period of  
six months in the Testing phase.  
The joint minds & makers and  
E.ON project team is currently  
developing the necessary skills and  
resources within E.ON to prepare  
processes and employees for the  
implementation of the service system.  
Additionally, we are steadily involving  
more job centers and debt counsel-  
ing charities with the aim of rolling  
out the service system throughout  
Germany \(Implementation phase\).  
In a continuous monitoring ­ process,  
qualitative and quantitative data  
from the company operation are  
being ­ analyzed to make the social  
and economic effects of the ser-  
vices visible and communicable

B Based on service concepts that are  
linked to insights and opportunity  
areas, the project team develops first  
prototypes in a co-creation workshop.  
C The service blueprint, complemented  
by insights, opportunity areas, and  
prototypes of the individual touch-  
points, makes the service tangible for  
all stakeholders.  
Systematic approach\:  
A guarantee for accountability,  
a basis for decision making  
Our systematic approach is par-  
ticularly useful in meeting the  
special challenges of the complex  
stakeholder cooperation and the  
long timescale of this project. We  
systematically integrate our research  
results into all stages of our inno-  
vation process. To this end, we use  
a precise coding system to be able  
to consistently trace every step of  
our work process to our research  
results at any time\: from the orig-  
inal experiences and statements  
of our respondents to the insights  
derived from these, right through  
to the identified opportunity areas,  
subconcepts, and concepts and to  
final implementation.  
Our stringent coding system is  
a vital prerequisite to keeping the  
context of the innovation and service  
concepts transparent and commu-  
nicable. For example, we always link  
the code of an insight to that of the  
original quotes it is derived from.  
In concept descriptions, we always  
quote the insights and opportunity  
areas the concept is based upon. This  
136/137  
high traceability does not apply only  
linearly to one single project phase  
and the previous step; thanks to  
our methodology we can trace back  
from any project phase to any other  
project phase.  
Our carefully designed research  
system prevents adaptations of our  
innovation and service concepts that  
are not strictly based on our insights  
and thus contradict our ­ consistent  
people-centered perspective.  
The ­ entire content of a project is  
always transparent and comprehen-  
sible for any of the stakeholders so  
that decisions are made on the basis  
of verifiable research results instead  
of opinions or taste.  
Results  
Job centers, counseling charities,  
and energy suppliers are working  
together closely so that E.ON can  
offer its customers suitable aid at  
different points of the customer  
journey\: through a separate hotline,  
­ counseling ­ charities and job centers  
can ­ directly reach out to E.ON  
contact staff who have the authority  
to take action and suspend cutoff  
orders ­ immediately. Customers This is Service Design Doing  
in emergency ­ situations receive  
initial external debt counseling via  
telephone, helping them to work on  
solutions. Interest-free installment  
plans with realistic payment levels  
now reduce energy debts for the  
customers as well as the loss of rev-  
enue and other costs for the energy  
provider. These are just a few exam-  
ples of our overarching, intersectoral  
service system that is now being  
applied ­ throughout Germany and is  
in the process of consolidation.  
The three stakeholders – job  
centers, counseling charities, and  
energy provider – are addressing the  
complex societal problem of energy  
poverty simultaneously at comple-  
mentary levels. Finally, to ensure  
positive outcomes from the project,  
an accompanying social impact eval-  
uation monitors the service system  
in the long term, so that potential for  
optimization can be recognized and  
­ implemented continuously.  
Because of the Zahlhilfe project,  
the issues of energy poverty, payment  
problems, and cutoffs have been given  
a sustainably firm place within the  
company structure.  
KEY TAKEAWAYS  
01 A high degree of transpar-  
ency\: Using this approach  
ensures that solutions are  
very transparent and easy  
to understand. This is  
­ particularly important in  
more complex cooperations,  
such as those in which not  
all stakeholders are involved  
in all steps of the project.  
02 Ongoing verification  
of completeness and  
­ effectiveness\: In this  
­ approach it is continuously  
verified that the interests of  
the various ­ stakeholders are  
being taken into ­ account  
and whether the services  
that are ­ offered solve the  
identified ­ problems.  
03 Flexible application\:  
The original quotes of  
­ customers and other stake-  
holders’ views make their  
concerns tangible; in this  
approach ­ findings serve to  
support ­ decision-making  
­ processes undertaken by the  
­ responsible bodies.  
04  
A foundation of research\:  
By building upon the ini-  
tially conducted research  
work, this approach makes  
­ concepts less vulnerable to  
ad hoc changes or process  
dilution.  
05 Ongoing effort\: This  
approach is ­ slightly more  
elaborate in the ­ beginning,  
but ­ especially in the case of  
complex, ­ long-term projects  
it reduces the overall error  
rate, as well as the time and  
effort needed for subsequent  
phases.

# Policy Lab Work & Health Project  
AUTHORS

The problem  
Around 2.5 million people ­ receive  
health-related benefits in the  
United Kingdom, which costs about  
£15 ­ billion per year,01 and the wider  
economic costs of sickness absence  
and worklessness associated with  
working-age people in ill health are  
estimated to be over £100 billion.02  
The longer people are on these  
benefits, the less likely it is that  
they will return to work, and being  
out of work can have a big impact  
on people’s health and well-being.  
On the other hand, finding the  
right work can be actively good for  
people’s health.  
The approach  
The UK government’s Policy Lab  
and the joint Work & Health  
Unit \(a joint unit sponsored by  
the Department of Health and  
01 02 Black, C., & Frost, D. \(2011\). “Health at Work – An Independent Re-  
view of Sickness Absence,” Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer.  
Department of Health \(2013\). “Annual Report of the Chief Medi-  
cal Officer 2013.”  
Department for Work and Pensions\)  
created a multi­ disciplinary team  
with the service design agency  
Uscreates, ethnography agency Keep  
Your Shoes Dirty, and data science  
organization Mastodon C, and in-  
volved around 70 service providers,  
users, and stakeholders to solve the  
problem. After a three-day sprint  
to properly diagnose the problem,  
we embarked on a discovery phase  
of ethnography and data science,  
and a develop phase where we  
co-designed and prototyped ideas  
which we are now taking to scale.  
We conducted ethnography with  
30 users and people that supported  
them\: doctors, employers, Jobcentre  
staff, and community groups.  
The insights  
We used data science techniques  
\(Sankey analysis and k-means  
­ clustering\) to look at patterns  
of people surveyed through the  
Understanding Society survey. It  
validated the existing insight that  
once people move onto long-term  
sickness benefits, they tend to  
stay on them and that people on  
health-related benefits also have  
­ non-health-related needs. It also  
revealed fresh ­ insights. For example,  
the clustering showed two groups  
of people on ­ health-related benefits  
who reported comparatively good  
health, meaning non-health-related  
interventions must be more import-  
ant for them, and these two groups  
were distinct \(one high previous  
salary, the other low\). Therefore,  
we need to personalize responses to  
support people in different ways.  
We used a combination of  
techniques, including spending  
time with people in their homes  
or places of work, conducting  
interviews based on photos that  
participants had taken, and doing  
user-journey interviews. This is Service Design Doing  
Two key insights were\:  
→ People have to tell their ­ stories  
multiple times to many differ-  
ent services that do not share  
information, meaning no one  
has a complete picture about  
someone’s needs.  
→ Individual line managers and  
confidence are big factors  
in whether people stay in or  
get back to work.  
Idea generation  
We turned these insights into  
­ evidence-based challenges to which  
users, doctors, employers, and  
policymakers brought their different  
perspectives at a co-design work-  
shop. Ideas formed around a Work  
& Health coach who could sign-  
post people to different non-health  
services, liaise with their employers  
to make adjustments, and build  
their confidence. We knew we could  
not build a whole new service from  
scratch, so local Jobcentres and com-  
munity groups prototyped elements  
of it to see how it could fit in with  
their existing services.  
In Penzance, the Jobcentre  
tested a website and posters which  
would allow employers to refer  
their ­ employees to its service. One  
employee said\: “Something like  
this would have been useful while  
I was still in work. I wasn’t as quick  
as some other staff because of my  
condition but they didn’t understand  
that. It might have helped me talk to  
my manager better about my health  
and what help I needed from him.”  
In Southend, the Jobcentre  
tested offering its services to the local  
doctors, so doctors could easily refer  
patients to them. In East London,  
the Jobcentre and a local commu-  
nity group tested how they could  
work together to provide Work &  
Health coaches with their combined  
knowledge of local services. In  
Bournemouth, the Jobcentre tested a  
Health & Work book for users to keep  
their information all in one place.  
One user said\: “It helped me organize  
the situation and focus on what I  
need to do to get where I need to be.”  
Scaling  
The qualitative feedback from the  
prototyping showed that these  
A  
B CASES 05 Research  
C  
prototypes had real value. We are  
now taking the ideas to scale, and  
the project has prompted wider  
systems change. The insights gained  
have informed a more positive  
and holistic conversation for new  
applicants for health-related bene-  
fits. We are creating a digital version  
for people who are still in work,  
preventing them from falling out of  
work. And the project has played an  
important part in the creation of the  
Work & Health Unit \(set up halfway  
through the project\) and the subsequent  
£40 million Work & Health  
Innovation Fund.

Lessons learned  
A valuable lesson was how the  
insights from the data science in-  
formed the ethnography \(e.g., reveal-  
ing how mental and physical health  
are related\), and how the ethnogra-  
phy informed the data science \(e.g.,  
highlighting the non-health needs  
of those on health-related benefits\).  
There is huge power in using these  
two techniques together, with the  
data science giving the broad, large-  
scale “what” and the ethnography  
providing the deep, rich “why.”

5.4.3 CASE\: DEVELOPING AND USING VALUABLE PERSONAS  
# Met Office app\: A goal-based persona case study  
AUTHOR  
Phillippa Rose  
Service Designer and  
Facilitator, current.works  
I recently led user research for the  
new Met Office01 app, replacing its  
old weather app. I worked closely  
with The App Business design team  
and the Met Office over six months  
on a range of research interventions.  
The use of goal-directed personas  
proved to be the most consistent and  
impactful tool.  
Traditional demographic metrics  
were not fit for purpose. It was far  
more critical to deepen understanding  
of user behavior patterns, and moti-  
vations were key.  
What do we need  
to understand?  
In terms of target audiences for the  
new app, we were asked to design  
for almost everyone. As ever, we  
needed to make sure we really  
­ understood the problem before we  
could design solutions.  
The weather affects everyone  
to varying degrees, and increas-  
ingly more and more people have  
smartphones and use them to access  
weather information – so in design-  
ing an experience for almost every-  
one, we needed to understand peo-  
ple’s levels of interest in the weather  
and their motivations. We needed to  
make sense of user tasks and goals.  
We also needed to consider technical  
considerations, and of course human  
behaviors and skill levels, ensuring  
the app provided just enough of the  
right information, quickly and easily.  
In order to answer some of  
these questions we chose to ­ create  
goal-driven personas. This approach  
was key in identifying and meeting  
user needs, engaging a wider range  
of stakeholders, and informing  
design decisions.  
01 The Met Office is the United Kingdom’s national weather service.  
Step 1\:  
Use what you have –  
what do we know already?  
We collated and analyzed existing  
Met Office desk research and reports,  
analytics of the old Met Office app,  
and websites, plus feedback from  
the Met Office Public Weather Desk.  
We reflected on the data to get a  
sense of any common goals, tasks,  
or correlations between behaviors  
and motivations.  
Step 2\:  
Distilling data into value curves  
Next, we distilled evidence from this  
body of research with recent in-  
sights from our own user research –  
­ including over 500 interviews, online  
surveys, and field research – to  
produce a set of common user  
tasks and activities influenced by  
the weather. We then ranked them  
against key considerations to create  
a set of value curves of 11 common  
tasks/scenarios. CASES 05 Research  
Step 3\:  
Testing assumptions  
through card sorting  
We also needed to test our assump-  
tions about what information is most  
important to people, so we ­ conducted  
an online card sorting exercise with  
139 responses.  
Step 4\:  
Value curve trend analysis  
We plotted the 11 value curves  
together and looked for common-  
alities and patterns between them.  
Three cluster groups emerged from  
the value curves one of the accompa-  
nying illustrations shows an example  
of four value curves forming one  
broad cluster group.  
Step 5\:  
Affinity mapping exercise  
We then reviewed all our findings  
and did an affinity mapping exercise  
to drill down further into the various  
tasks, looking at behaviors and con-  
siderations for individual tasks/goals.  
The basic premises of three  
goal-directed personas emerged  
from this process\:  
Flexible planners\: people adapting  
plans/timing/locations depending on  
the forecast conditions \(prepared to  
wait for or seek out the best weather\)  
— Be prepared\: people preparing  
—  
for and making provision for  
weather conditions in order to  
stick to their overall plans, or  
adapting their plans to incorpo-  
rate forecast weather conditions  
— High stakes/high impact\:  
—  
­ high-risk outdoor activity/event  
planning requiring decisions  
based on long-term forecasting  
with others involved  
Step 6\:  
Persona development workshop  
We ran a goal-driven development  
workshop to flesh out the personas  
further using a persona template  
by Lucy Kimbell as a starting point.  
We adapted Lucy’s template to  
focus less on individual character-  
istics and more on goals, environ-  
ments, and issues.  
Here’s the final list of what we found  
most useful to flesh out each of the  
personas in turn\:  
142/143  
— Goals  
—  
— Situations and considerations  
—  
\(can relate to time frames,  
­ logistics, or mindset\)  
— Environment and ­ resources  
—  
\(can include people,  
­ information ­ sources, and  
­ physical environment\)  
— Ties and associations \(including  
—  
people and organizations/brands\)  
— Issues/challenges \(what’s  
—  
stopping them?\)  
— Workarounds/­ opportunities  
—  
\(possible solutions,  
problem solving\)  
We also used this session to fur-  
ther develop a set of user needs  
for each persona based on the  
guidelines from the Government  
Digital Service\:02  
A  
As a … \[who is the user?\]  
B  
 I need to … \[what does the  
user want to do?\]  
 So that … \[why does the user  
want to do this?\]  
02 This template is often called a “user story.” See also\: Writing user  
stories in 5.3.  
C This is Service Design Doing  
Step 7\:  
Sharing  
We then distilled the data down  
even further and wrote it up using a  
mix of text and images. We shared  
our refined personas with the wider  
Met Office teams and stakehold-  
ers, and stuck them on the wall in  
the project room.  
Step 8\:  
Ongoing iteration  
During ongoing user research the  
personas are being continuously  
reviewed and adapted as neces-  
sary. Persona profile characteristics  
have directly informed recruit-  
ment of participants for week-long  
diary studies using Dscout and  
ExperienceFellow. In usability lab  
testing interviews we have asked  
questions to test assumptions and  
uncover examples of goals, tasks,  
and behaviors associated with the  
different personas.  
We also ran a series of ongoing  
design ideation workshops to gener-  
ate ideas for future app updates and  
features during 2016 based on the  
needs and goals of our three core  
personas, and created a dedicated  
Trello board to document the ideas  
with color-­ coded labels correspond-  
ing with the relevant personas.  
Learnings and next steps  
What is distinct about this approach  
to previous personas I’ve worked  
on is that we deliberately concen-  
trated on goals and tasks at the  
expense of characterization. Each of  
these three personas is distinct and  
people may identify with one more  
than the ­ others, but it is likely that  
each one of us has experienced user  
needs ­ similar to at least two of these  
personas in different situations or at  
different times in our lives.  
A second distinction is that  
these personas have evolved over  
a six-month period, whereas often  
I work with teams on persona  
development in shorter, sharper  
iterations. A significant amount of  
time was dedicated to developing  
them and evolving them, in a close  
collaboration between myself, Rob  
Jung, and Dima Shvedun from The  
App Business with support from  
Chris Frost and Jay Spanton at  
the Met Office.  
KEY TAKEAWAYS  
01  
02  
Consider focusing the  
­ approach on common goals,  
instead of solely personas, to  
help identify with user needs.  
Customer personas can  
evolve over a period of  
time as more insights are  
­ uncovered.

Don’t forget to use existing  
data that can help provide  
information.

5.4.4 CASE\: ILLUSTRATING RESEARCH DATA WITH JOURNEY MAPS  
# Promoting youth mental health\: The impact of mapping the journey  
AUTHOR  
Jamin Hegeman  
Design Director,  
Adaptive Path  
The challenge  
How can we help youth with mental  
health issues in a challenged com-  
munity within San Francisco? What  
services might they need? How  
can we best deliver them? How can  
we inform policymakers to get the  
funding for such services? These are  
the questions that the Edgewood  
Center for Children and Families’  
Organizational Consultation team  
faced in early 2014 when they  
contracted with Mo’ MAGIC, the  
Western Addition collaborative of  
youth-serving nonprofits.  
The Edgewood team sought  
to bring a human-centered design  
approach to the challenge. They  
engaged 29 youths who attend Magic  
Zone, an after-school program lo-  
cated in the southeastern area of the  
Western Addition, and conducted  
24 qualitative interviews with adult  
community stakeholders from 15 or-  
ganizations from within the Western  
Addition and city-wide.  
After a discovery and research  
phase, Edgewood reached out to  
Adaptive Path for service design  
expertise in creating a journey map  
and facilitating an ideation and  
prioritization session with com-  
munity stakeholders. The Adaptive  
Path team, consisting of one service  
designer and one visual designer,  
designed two three-hour workshops\:  
one focused on gathering data  
to create a journey map, anoth-  
er to generate ideas based on the  
journey framework.  
Journey mapping workshop  
For the first workshop, we gathered  
a small group of subject matter  
experts, people who worked with  
the youth in different capacities  
or on different programs and the  
Edgewood team that conducted  
primary research with the 29 youths  
who attend the Magic Zone af-  
ter-school program.  
The information we sought  
included the stages of the journey,  
actions, thoughts or ­ expectations,  
feelings, people, services, and  
locations relevant to the stages.  
We also wanted to identify the high  
points and low points of each stage.  
To ­ simplify data collection, we  
created large butcher paper tem-  
plates \(one for each stage\) for the  
data we needed.  
Journey map visualization  
After the workshop, we synthesized  
the data both editorially and visu-  
ally. We transferred the data into  
a spreadsheet, grouped like items,  
and applied an editorial lens to the  
information. We did this to focus the  
information and make it succinct  
and digestible.  
In the workshop, we used custom  
worksheets to capture the ­ essence of  
what needed to be communicated to  
aid the ­ editorial process. CASES 05 Research

journey and analyzed them to tell a  
complete story.

146/147  
Our visual design process started  
on paper to quickly explore ideas.  
We then moved to Illustrator and  
continued exploring visual constructs.  
Once the visual matched the story  
we wanted to tell, we layered in the  
content. Several rounds of internal  
critique and share-outs with our  
stakeholders for feedback followed.

Journey map outcome  
The journey is broken into five stages,  
or phases. Each phase is signified  
by a one-word title\: Unawareness,  
Sensing, Awareness, Connection, and  
Engagement. Within each phase,  
there is a quote that represents the  
overarching feeling or belief of the  
youth. This is followed by more of  
a matter-of-fact statement regard-  
ing the situation – for example,  
“Youth is not considering change.”  
Each roadblock includes dialogue  
­ boxes containing language the youth  
might use. Dark gray arrows rein-  
force that youths often drop off the  
path to empowerment at all phases  
of the journey.  
For the ideation and priori-  
tization workshop, we created an  
ideation framework modeled after  
the stages of the journey. It ­ contained  
a matrix of journey stages and  
­ opportunities. A cross-organizational  
team drew solutions for each box  
in the ideation framework for a set  
period of time.  
Impact  
This project achieved impact in  
several ways. First, it provided a  
common tool and language for  
various organizations and exposed  
stakeholders to a new way to tackle  
old problems. Second, stakeholders  
found the map useful when engaging  
youths to discuss where they might  
be in the journey. Finally, the jour-  
ney map provided a new way to see a  
complex issue and make the case for  
funding several initiatives.  
“Issues have been studied to  
death,” says Mo’ MAGIC executive  
director Sheryl Davis. Creating a  
journey map to understand the  
complexity of servicing youths  
with mental health issues was “very  
different,” she said. It showed stake-  
holders where the gaps were and led  
to new ideas for action. Armed with  
our journey map and new service  
concepts, the organization received  
\$200,000 in funding from the Office  
of the Mayor. That’s service design  
making an impact.

Introduction  
Over the past four years the  
Service Design Lead at Vodafone has  
developed and fine-tuned a Service  
Experience Design methodology that  
was used for all Vodafone’s customer  
journeys in the Netherlands, and  
later also in the rest of the Vodafone  
countries. STBY contributed to this  
by doing deep-dive design research  
on several of these journeys.  
Each project focused on a par-  
ticular set of customer journeys with  
the aim to better understand the  
experiences, behaviors, motivations,  
preferences, latent needs, and pain  
points of customers. At the same  
time, considerable extra value has  
been created across these projects  
through a structured way of working.  
The results of this approach have led  
to a company-wide change program.  
The key added value of this approach  
is that customer journeys mapped  
for specific projects can be linked up  
to customer life cycles with a more  
strategic scope. In this way, ­ service  
design contributes to strategic  
value for a business on a larger scale  
than just the individual customer  
journey projects.

customer life cycle can deliver a more  
strategic overview with relevance to  
the wider organization.”

Customer journey maps  
illustrating as-is and to-be  
service experiences01  
Customer journeys are one of the  
key tools in the service design  
­ approach. In many service design  
projects, customer journeys are  
01 In this book, as-is and to-be journey maps are referred to as “current  
state” and “future state,” respectively. See Mapping journeys in 5.3.  
mapped to explore the experiences  
of people and their interactions with  
service providers. These customer  
journey maps offer an important  
foundation to analyze existing  
situations and to identify recurring  
patterns, pain points, and opportuni-  
ties. A similar format can also be used  
for a different purpose – to visualize  
how service experiences could be  
improved in future offerings.  
During each project with  
­ various teams in Vodafone the  
typical ­ dynamic and project flow  
would be as follows\: during the  
fieldwork stage, customer journeys  
are mapped to investigate how they  
actually recently happened \(as-is\).  
This leads to insights on aspects that  
could be improved \(low-hanging  
fruit\) and also on opportunity areas  
for ­ substantial service innovation  
\(new propositions\). After a strate-  
gic prioritization of the identified This is Service Design Doing  
­ opportunities with stakeholders from  
several departments, the ideation  
stage in these projects then leads  
to ideas for new service concepts.  
These concept directions are ex-  
pressed in new ­ customer journeys  
\(TO BE\) that highlight where and  
how the customer experience can be  
improved for both new and existing  
customers, typically illustrated with  
sketches to indicate what these new  
service concepts would add to the  
customer experience. The concept  
ideas and sketches are then pro-  
gressed in implementation projects  
that further specify and build the  
new service offerings.  
Examples of focus points for the  
various projects STBY and Vodafone  
worked on include\:  
— New contracts for ­ consumers  
—  
\(choosing a new contract  
or renewing a contract, and  
­ choosing a new phone\)  
— New contracts for businesses  
—  
\(complex process of stake-  
holder communication and  
decision making\)  
— Expenditure \(monitoring and  
—  
managing usage and costs during  
the contract period\)  
— Connectivity \(­ experiences  
—  
with the network during the  
contract period\)  
— International usage  
—  
\(­ traveling abroad during the

— Multiple contacts \(complex  
—

ers and provider\)  
— Multiple contracts \(add-

Systematic approach generating  
progressive deliverables  
To enable cross-comparison ­ between  
the results of various projects,  
it was important to use a systematic  
approach and to make sure that the  
project deliverables were created  
in a similar way that allowed for  
progressive understanding and

In the Define stage, the ­ aggregated  
as-is customer journey is ­ developed,  
based on the recurring patterns of  
customer behavior and pain points  
found in the individual customer  
journeys. Relevant insights are then  
drawn out that lead to both direct  
improvements for the existing ­ service  
offering and concept directions for  
substantial new service offerings.  
Each to-be customer journey deliv-  
ers three levels of service solution  
outcomes\: Fix \(operational fixes\),  
Optimize \(improvements\), and  
Change \(­ service innovations\).  
From customer journeys to  
customer life cycles  
Although produced for specific  
projects and specific project teams,  
customer journeys can also ­ deliver a  
more strategic overview of consum-  
er–provider interactions and offer  
relevance for the wider organization.  
This is done by linking the various  
customer journey maps into a cus-  
tomer life cycle map. While working  
together on the subsequent focused  
service design projects, Ozlem01  
came up with this method, and it  
turned out to work really well.  
Customer life cycles are a key tool  
in the field of business strategy. The  
scope of a customer life cycle is wider  
than that of a customer journey, as it  
includes the entire relationship from  
the first day of formal interaction  
between a customer and an organi-  
zation \(e.g., a new customer requests  
a quote\) until the last day \(e.g., the  
customer stops being a client\). In the  
case of Vodafone, the customer life  
cycle spans from the first contract  
01 Ozlem Dessauer-Siegers, Sr. Service Experience Design  
Lead at Vodafone. CASES 05 Research  
offered to a customer to the day that a  
contract ends and is not renewed.  
For customer journeys, the  
start and end points of the process  
are less well defined. They usually  
start when a customer has identi-  
fied a specific need and engages in  
activities to fulfill this need, and  
go until the point that this need is  
sufficiently fulfilled \(or the custom-  
er decides to abort the process\).  
This means that there can be a few  
different customer journeys within a  
customer life cycle.  
Mapping customer journeys  
according to the focus of what  
customers are trying to accomplish  
is very useful for empathizing with  
their perspective and improving  
specific service concepts, but from  
the point of view of the organization  
these journeys need to be added up  
to create a more tactical and strategic  
overview that can be matched with  
the overall operations and the way  
the business is run. This is what a  
customer life cycle offers.  
The wider scope of the ­ customer  
life cycle needs to be taken into  
account while developing specific  
project assets. To be able to link the  
outcomes from each project into  
an overall customer life cycle, it is  
important to use a basic similar struc-  
ture across projects. While doing  
this, the service design team needs  
to not only focus on the delivera-  
bles for the project at hand, but also  
­ anticipate how these deliverables can  
later be linked up to be useful to a  
more long-term and strategic view.  
A firm understanding of the link  
between customer journeys and cus-  
tomer life cycle maps enables this.  
152/153  
KEY TAKEAWAYS  
01  
Several focused customer  
journeys can be combined  
into a more overarching and  
strategic customer life cycle.  
02  
Customer journeys can be  
formatted to express both  
the current as-is state of  
customer experiences and  
the envisioned to-be state of  
future improved ­ customer  
experiences.  
03 Customer journey–based  
analysis and ideation leads to  
both direct improvements  
for existing service offerings  
and concept directions  
for ­ substantial new service  
offerings.  
04 A systematic approach to  
customer journey mapping is  
needed in order to be able  
to link up into a ­ customer  
life cycle.

Reflection out of action 166  
Being visual 170  
The world will tell you that creativity is all about having  
the best ideas. People who work in arts or any type of  
­ creative profession – even designers – are always ­ being  
asked, “Where do your ideas come from?” And when  
­ organizations initially approach service designers for help,  
they often say something like, “We want to kick off by  
generating some good ideas.” Ideas are seen as the precious  
starting point of value generation.  
Let’s start by challenging that belief. Of course,  
­ producing ideas is a vital part of any service design ­ project –  
but it is not as all-important as many people seem to think.01  
In service design, ideas represent one point \(or usually  
several points\) in an evolutionary process, and are a critical  
part of problem solving. They concretize aspects of what has  
come before, and are the sparks of what comes after them.  
Ideas are not especially valuable in themselves – they are  
neither good nor bad, but they might be useful.  
So, to the surprise of many newcomers, service design  
does not set out to find one killer idea as a starting point.  
Instead, ideas are generated en masse at various stages in the  
process, mixed, recombined, culled, distilled, and evolved or  
parked. We call this process ideation, and it never stops.  
The Kano model 174  
01 In his 2015 TEDTalk “The Single Biggest Reason Why Startups Succeed,” \(https\://www.ted.com/talks/bill\_gross\_the\_  
single\_biggest\_reason\_why\_startups\_succeed\) Ted Gross suggests that the main success factor is not idea quality, but  
the timing and skills of the team. Timing is especially relevant to us, as service design can get prototypes and pilots  
on the road earlier. This is Service Design Doing  
# 6.1 IDEAS  
EXPERT TIP  
“Don’t get attached to  
individual ideas. You  
are there to broaden  
the field of possibility.  
Later, you will come  
back and might find  
treasure – but for now,  
keep planting seeds.”  
—  
Belina Raffy  
Although ideation is often shown as a discrete process  
step – you will usually see a main phase of idea genera-  
tion marked on the project plan, and it’s there in the visu-  
alizations in this book – it is not the only time we gener-  
ate ideas. We will have ideas all through the project. Our  
brain’s determination to churn out ideas is valuable, but  
we should differentiate carefully between ideas from dif-  
ferent contexts, as each context brings its own bias. Very  
early ideas might be useful – but do we really understand  
the challenge yet? Ideas often pop up in research – but  
is the data or situation which prompted that idea valid  
or representative? For many “tinkerers,” the prototyping  
bench is the ultimate idea generator as we think with our  
hands – but are we in love with a clever prototype feature,  
or are we addressing a real customer need?  
So all through the project, we will be creating ideas  
which might be useful – we should make sure we preserve  
them. Our idea management system might be as simple  
as an idea wall – a simple sticky note “parking place” – or  
a more structured layout. More ambitiously, we can adopt  
collaboration platforms and techniques from knowledge  
management. We might note the original context of each  
idea, so it can carry the appropriate bias warnings. It’s  
wise to treat all unproven ideas with skepticism anyway.  
Apart from the inevitable spontaneous ideas, there  
will be times when we deliberately try to generate ideas  
or fixes. These are generally the divergent phases of our  
project, and we use divergent techniques, aiming for  
quantity, not quality – at least at first. It is often said that  
a high quantity of ideas leads to later success.01 Whether  
this is true or not, it’s not the only reason to aim for idea  
volume in a service design project.  
The process of generating ideas is a valuable way  
for participants to begin to explore a theme cognitively.  
Aiming for quantity will help them move beyond the  
obvious to more interesting, radical ideas. Group ideation  
is also a good way to develop shared ownership of ideas,  
as participants build on each other’s input. Later, no one  
can say whom the idea belongs to. Generating many ideas  
can be good training for divergent thinking, as the team  
practice temporarily suspending judgment. And, crucial-  
ly, it can help break habits of perfectionism and owner-  
ship. If project participants are encouraged to generate a  
heap of ideas in a short time, they find it easier to accept  
that many of those ideas will be sketchy and imperfect,  
though perhaps still useful. And if we start with a big pile  
of ideas, it is easy to abandon most of them. Learning to  
let go of ideas to make way for new ones is a crucial skill  
of service design, and one that needs practice.  
01 The link between idea quantity and idea quality is still debated \(for example, see Paulus, P. B., Kohn, N. W., &  
Arditti, L. E. \(2011\). “Effects of Quantity and Quality Instructions on Brainstorming.” The Journal of Creative  
Behavior, 45\(1\), 38-46\) – partly because it is very hard to determine what constitutes a “good” idea without  
launching all of them. In service design, the question is whether or not an idea is useful in moving forward.  
Even incomplete, flawed, or impractical ideas can be valuable if they generate useful questions or prototypes. 06 Ideation

# 6.2 DECISIONS  
As well as periods when we generate ideas, there will also  
be times when we want to reduce our number of ­ options,  
to converge in on the most useful content. We will need  
to decide.  
In business life, decision making is seen as one of the  
most important skills we can have. Decisiveness is under-  
stood to be a key skill of leadership; decisions in business  
are often momentous, and the very term “­ decision mak-  
er” implies a senior role.  
In service design, decisions are seen differently.  
We are not deciding the future of our company or ­ project.  
Instead, we are merely successively and routinely narrow-  
ing down options in the convergent phases of our work.  
We attempt to avoid making big, weighty choices when-  
ever possible. Instead, we set up many small, low-risk,  
provisional decisions, usually along the lines of “Where  
are some places we could start?” or “What experiments  
do we try next?” This can be difficult for people who are  
new to this way of working. Many participants will want  
to spend a long time on selecting the “best” idea – or  
even a perfect one. They may feel that they are not ready  
to make a choice or do not have enough information.  
Teams will need to learn that in a design process,  
we are not trying to choose the perfect idea, the silver  
bullet, then immediately investing massive resources in  
implementing it. Instead, we are trying to quickly spot  
a few ideas which are interesting, which seem to fit the  
project goals, or which are “good enough” to kick off an  
­ experimental, evolutionary process.  
These quick decisions sound risky, but they are not.  
We will rely on the later parts of the project – ­ especially  
prototyping and testing – and on later iterations to  
­ confirm the quality of ideas and to improve them.01  
It’s another way of working which is unfamiliar to many  
co-creative partners, and may feel uncomfortable.02  
Idea selection methods can help formalize that choice  
and reassure them, but some inexperienced partners  
may still need frequent reminders that this will not be  
the last opportunity to change or replace key ideas – we  
are ideating and evolving ideas all through the project.  
Because our choices are lower risk and more  
frequent than in traditional project management, the  
responsibility for making decisions often devolves to the  
project team.03 The members of the team are preloaded  
with information, impressions, and inspiration.  
Their knowledge has been built up from a thousand  
details of the project and cannot be meaningfully  
­ communicated in a quick management briefing – or  
even in a lengthy document or discussion – because it is  
implicit, emergent, empathic, or abstract.  
01 02 03 See 6.5.2, Case\: Co-design with hybrid methods, for an example of successful postlaunch ideation.  
In \(company\) politics, sticking to your ideas is usually seen as a positive characteristic. But in innovation,  
being ready and willing to switch focus is a key skill. In startups, we talk about the pivot, the “structured course  
correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, and engine of growth,”  
as a key success factor. Quote from Reis, E. \(2011\). The Lean Startup. New York\: Crown Business, p. 149.  
The role of the design facilitator in decision making is discussed in Chapter 10, Facilitating workshops. 06 Ideation  
# Abductive thinking  
BY JURGEN TANGHE  
One particular way of thinking differentiates design  
from other forms of working, thinking, and decision making,  
and that is abductive thinking.  
Abductive thinking is the logic of what  
might be.04 It’s about synthesizing the  
data and making sense of it in a way  
that possibly hasn’t been done before  
and thus finding a new, best plausible  
explanation given the observations  
and based on your own personal and  
professional experience. The founda-  
tions of abduction are laid when you  
formulate your challenge – specifically,  
the value you want to create for your  
customer, or for the world.  
For most people, it is best done  
in a “low-tech,” small-team context  
with sticky notes stuck to a wall. This

pattern recognition. These are the first  
steps\: summarize your data, spread  
it out and digest it, interpret it, and  
find out what appeals to you and how  
everything would make sense. This is  
where insights come from that allow  
you to take a fresh point of view that is  
suggested by the data.  
Abductive thinking is intuitive –  
intuition combined with data from  
research. Its intuitive nature also means  
it is by definition not certain; it’s a pro-  
posal of what could be going on. You  
will have to accept that\: it’s not about  
what’s “right,” it’s about what’s “proba-  
ble” and “possible.”  
160/161  
Abductive thinking often takes place  
in a low-tech environment.  
This viewpoint, a novel perspective  
on the situation, consists of hypotheses  
about the human experience, the mech-  
anisms of the design challenge, and a  
belief that this explanation of the situa-  
tion helps to create value. Sometimes it  
is captured in a metaphor.  
This new perspective is very  
inspirational and energizing, fueling  
ideation and paving the way for design  
and innovation. ◀ This is Service Design Doing  
This necessity to keep implicit knowledge inside  
the process leads to one of the key concepts of decision  
making in service design\: the people who are close to  
the project and who understand both the origin and  
implications of the choices need to be involved in all  
major decisions.  
The difficulty of communicating implicit knowledge –  
especially across silos – is the reason why a continuity  
of personnel is crucial in service design projects.  
While the relative makeup of the team may shift  
throughout the project, we make sure that at least some  
of the people who will implement the project are there in  
the earliest phases, and that the people who understand  
the customer needs are still around during implementa-  
tion. In a digital project, at least one coder needs to sit  
on the customer’s sofa in the initial research; and at least  
one customer insights specialist should be there when  
the software is built and rolled out.  
They might not be alone, as the decision will some-  
times need to involve people who were not part of the  
ideation or prototyping process. Experts on ­ technical,  
strategic, or brand issues, senior management, the  
legal team, and more might be brought in at particular  
moments, but these valuable “outsiders” should not  
decide in a vacuum.  
The rich supply of details and strength of ­ impressions  
carried by the team is valuable, but it can also make  
decision making cumbersome. How can they sift through  
the data to focus on what is important? How can they  
Decision time is often a critical moment for a team as it moves from a  
divergent phase into a convergent phase.01  
step back and leave behind ideas they love? We need a  
set of tools and methods to protect the team from decision  
paralysis, and to help them co-decide with outsiders  
while making the most of their hard-won knowledge and  
empathy. These tools can be relatively lightweight – there  
is rarely need for complex analysis when you are merely  
deciding “which five ideas do we try next?”. 06 Ideation

# 6.3 THE PROCESS OF IDEATION  
Even if many “spontaneous” ideation activities will often  
be carried out without extensive planning, systematic ide-  
ation can still benefit from a clearly ­ articulated process.  
6.3.1  
EXPERT TIP  
“Need a bunch of ideas?  
Build some prototypes  
and mess around –  
ideation doesn’t only  
happen on sticky notes.”  
– Belina Raffy  
Planning ideation  
When you are setting up a divergent ideation activity,  
it pays to lay some groundwork. In a service design  
project, you will usually have done some research be-  
forehand and will be well prepared for ideation, perhaps  
after insight generation. Or you might be coming back  
from a prototyping phase, ready to use what you have  
learned. Your starting point will be some kind of ideation  
challenge or question, made by reframing your insights.  
In planning your ideation activities, you will often be  
building from observations and data through insights  
and questions towards ideas, and then diversifying and  
filtering those ideas in a series of loops. Here are some  
things to think about when planning.  
A  
Starting point/scope  
Re-examine the previous work \(e.g., research or proto-  
typing results\) – it can be helpful to immerse the core  
project team in it. Then decide on the starting point and  
scope of your ideation.01 At times, you may like to leave  
01 The scope of ideation activities is sometimes defined during the previous activity in your project,  
often research or prototyping.  
some fuzziness within the scope, to increase the chance  
of disruptive or more novel solutions. For example, you  
might explicitly not brief some contributors on your  
research, add activities which use random input, allow  
­ opportunities for productive misunderstanding,02 and  
so on. Based on your starting point, you might do some  
additional preparatory research to check for existing  
­ solutions or analogous problems.03  
B  
Immersion and inspiration  
Consider how to bring in the essence and raw data from  
your previous work. Apart from including people who were  
active in the research or prototyping phase, you might show  
artifacts, videos, and quotes, keeping the raw data hidden  
but accessible. You could also develop key insights from  
your data. Also consider which inspiration elements or  
activities can be valuable prior to the actual ideation session.  
C  
Split the challenge  
You do not need to think about everything at once, and  
you will probably want to split your ideation \(and indeed  
the whole project\) into multiple manageable tracks. Use  
“slicing the elephant” techniques,or cluster “How might  
we …” questions into opportunity areas that suggest direc-  
tions for potential ideation.04  
02 03 For example, see 6.5.5, Case\: Supporting creativity with trigger visuals.  
Again, you should make a conscious decision about when to share this knowledge with the team.

Do a stakeholder mapping session for each of the

contribute to that area. Make sure you are balancing  
the needs of end users, key participants, and your own  
­ organization. A mix of insiders, outsiders, experts,  
and users works well. Our natural tendency is to make  
­ heterogeneous groups – but homogeneous groups will  
often get you more extreme ideas. And while experts are  
good at spotting minefields, they can sometimes be too  
­ dominant. You might mix and remix the groups in different  
sessions to get the best from the people you have.01

G  
Set stopping criteria  
It can be useful to define criteria for when to stop. This  
can be as simple as setting the number of ideas you want  
to achieve, or deciding to rely on expert assessment. Like  
with theoretical saturation in research, you might stop  
when further ideation produces \(essentially\) no new  
original ideas.04 You should also assess the dependencies  
for doing prototyping or further research as you can be  
sure new questions will arise.  
H  
Fix outputs  
Decide how many selected ideas you will eventually  
need \(e.g., how many prototypes you want to later build\)  
and what format the ideas need to have so they can be  
pushed forward.  
6.3.2  
Idea generation  
Briefing and inspiring participants  
If there has not been formal research – or if you are in a  
preparatory ideation phase and research will come later  
in the project – you might fall back on other methods  
to connect with reality. You can give the participants  
homework – perhaps not to generate ideas,05 but to put  
themselves in the shoes of the customers.06 An alternative  
04 05 06 See 5.1.2, Research planning for more on theoretical saturation.  
It can be useful to give some ideation homework after this research homework. The ideas participants generate  
at home, outside the groupthink of the sessions, will be diverse and considered. There is a risk that they may  
fall in love with these ideas, so frame them as springboards for further ideation, or prototype them fast so they  
can fail and start to evolve.  
Essentially, this is research. Indeed, many research techniques make great homework – such as autoethnography,  
service safaris, diary work, cultural probes, or interviews.  
164/165  
is storytelling, where participants share their own  
experiences or listen to customers or colleagues from  
the front line.  
You can also introduce participants to the theme of  
your ideation activity by giving them background infor-  
mation on what is happening currently in that field and  
in other useful contexts, and letting them explore this  
information – for example, using a World Café format.07  
As well as sparking ideas, this can also help put partici-  
pants “on the same page,” giving them all at least a basic  
grounding in the important themes.08  
Method selection  
Always consider a mix of methods. Like research  
methods, many ideation methods have their own in-  
herent bias, perhaps allowing different types of people  
to contribute to varying degrees. While many people  
feel comfortable writing ideas on sticky notes, others  
might be more creative when you allow them to express  
themselves using visuals \(e.g., sketching\), mock-ups,09 or  
movement \(e.g., bodystorming\).  
A good mix of ideation methods levels out  
­ potential biases and invites the diverse talents of your  
­ contributors. Depending on the complexity of your  
­ ideation challenge or problem, pick one or more methods  
from the following categories.10  
07 See http\://www.theworldcafe.com.  
08 But think twice before tasking all your participants to look at existing solutions, as this can actually reduce the  
diversity of their ideas. See for example Smith, S. M., Ward, T. B., & Schumacher, J. S. \(1993\). “Constraining  
Effects of Examples in a Creative Generation Task.” Memory & Cognition, 21\(6\), 837-845.

All of these methods are described in detail in 6.4, Ideation methods. This is Service Design Doing  
# Reflection out of action  
BY SATU MIETTINEN  
Group or team ideation using “reflection in action” is  
an everyday practice in designer’s work and focuses on  
generating new ideas and solutions.  
Yet, Becky Currano from Stanford has dis-  
covered01 that a major part of the innova-  
tive ideas of Silicon Valley ­ designers were  
produced during reflection out of action in  
situations such as in the park, in the show-  
er, or while doodling or jogging.  
When we work with ideation in ser-  
vice design, it would make a lot of sense to  
mix in methods and processes to support  
not only in-action time but also out-of-ac-  
tion reflection.  
The combination of in-action ideation  
with a team or group and out-of-action  
solo reflection helps you to understand  
and process large information clusters and  
do the slow thinking02 that is supported by

a car where you can note the innovative

Simple challenges can be approached with a quick  
15-minute ideation session with a simple activity. More  
complex questions might involve sessions with different  
stakeholders spread over a couple of weeks, perhaps  
first splitting up the challenge into distinct development  
directions, then running multiple ideation sessions with  
employees, customers, and experts. Each session might  
build directly on the output from the previous ones to  
diversify and evolve ideas.  
Managing energy  
There is growing evidence that boredom can lead to  
good ideas.03 While this deserves exploration \(perhaps  
you can use a long drive or repetitive preparation tasks  
as part of your process\), deliberately boring participants  
will not make your project popular. Instead, warm-ups  
can help us feel more energetic and productive – they

166/167  
are especially valuable before ideation sessions. Just as  
­ importantly, they can also help us establish the safe space04  
which makes us more ready to fail and helps us with more  
radical thinking. In each ideation workshop, you should  
choose one or more suitable warm-ups for your group,  
and consider carefully when to place them. It’s usual  
to do warm-ups at the very beginning of a workshop,  
but there is plenty of evidence05 that delay or deliberate  
distraction can improve the results of ideation sessions.06  
This might suggest placing the warm-up after you set  
the challenge for the ideation, but before you start to  
generate ideas.  
6.3.3  
Idea selection  
The groan zone  
Many representations of the service design process, like  
the famous Double Diamond,07 show convergent phases  
following immediately on the heels of divergent phases.  
This abrupt change can be very hard, or even distressing,  
for project participants. Often, participants do not feel  
ready to start abandoning these fresh new options yet.08  
Before participants feel ready to make a decision,  
they might need to develop a mutual understanding of  
04 05 06 07 08 For more on safe space, warm-ups, and idea facilitation, see Chapter 10, Facilitating workshops.  
See, for example, work by Jihae Shin, reported in Grant, A. M., & Sandberg, S. \(2016\). Originals\: How Non-Con-  
formists Move the World. Viking.  
It is usually suggested that distraction or delay gives the participants’ subconscious time to work on the  
problem. More modern “honing” theories of creativity suggest that it is more about forgetting barriers.  
Whichever you prefer, it works.  
See Chapter 4, The core activities of service design.

the options open to them. Their ideas will probably be at  
different levels – some will be concepts or systems,  
some features or details. Some might be reframed needs,  
some might be very concrete solutions. Teams might need  
to explore and organize their thinking by asking each oth-  
er questions, sorting items, or perhaps developing some  
boundary objects02 to bring clarity. Or participants might  
just need a break, a game to distract them, or a good  
night’s sleep. Consider this when planning your process.  
But don’t give them too long. The more time  
we spend considering, explaining, and shaping our  
thoughts, the more we feel invested in them – and the  
more we fall in love. If the team has difficulty letting go

of ideas, this can be a problem. So sometimes it makes  
sense to acknowledge that other ideas also deserve more  
time, but to keep moving anyway, taking just a few ideas  
forward and asking participants to park the others.  
Even if you don’t come back to them formally, the best  
aspects of abandoned ideas will bubble up in the DNA of  
future iterations.  
Physical context of decisions  
The physical context of decisions is important. Many  
people like to have a “clear head” and make decisions  
in a relatively neutral environment – which is why  
we take walks in the woods and cogitate on beaches.  
But in service design projects, it is less about making  
a single weighty decision, and more about running a  
­ decision-guiding process and the conversations it throws  
up. It’s going to be useful to have our assets nearby, so we  
can quickly return to any points which come up, pointing  
at the sticky notes and turning the prototype around once  
more. It also seems that visually complex environments  
lead to better cognitive function, and ultimately to better  
decisions.03 See what works for your team.  
Agreeing to decide and selecting methods  
Many decision-making tools do not actually make a  
decision. Instead, they prepare the ground by sorting  
information, flagging favorites, or slicing the big ­ decision  
elephant into smaller, more manageable questions. In  
03 Davidson, A. W., & Bar-Yam, Y. \(2006\). Environmental complexity\: information for human-environment  
well-being. In A. Minai & Y. Bar-Yam \(eds.\), Unifying Themes in Complex Systems, Vol. IIIB \(pp. 157–168\).  
Springer Berlin Heidelberg. 06 Ideation  
some cases, the method will make the decision very  
clear, and a glance around the room will show that you  
can just move on. But often there will still be the need for  
some discussion or voting before the course is clear.  
One of the best things that a group can do in this  
situation is to decide in advance how and when the  
decision will be made, and what happens to the ideas left  
“on the cutting room floor.” Before using a method, par-  
ticipants can decide what decision factors will be most  
important, and how long they will spend on the ­ decision.  
Several of the methods presented in this ­ section will  
be helpful – but no method in the world should de-  
cide for you. They can only support and facilitate your  
decision process.  
As a rule of thumb, if you want to reduce friction it  
makes sense to break down the decision-making process  
into several steps and select one or more methods from  
each of the following categories\:04  
Understanding, clustering, and ranking options  
such as octopus clustering, Benny Hill sorting  
\(“Thirty-Five”\), idea portfolio, decision matrix  
Reducing options such as quick voting methods,  
physical commitment  
04 All of these methods are described in 6.4 Ideation methods.  
168/169  
6.3.4  
Documentation  
Ideation is a process which soon becomes complex and  
rather wasteful as you abandon far more ideas than you use.  
The ultimate documentation of your ideation process is  
the prototypes which come out of it, but they can never  
contain all the complexity of what has gone before. It is  
worth thinking about keeping track of what ideation activi-  
ties you have done, and mapping where your idea assets are.  
At the simplest level, you might just keep the physical  
artifacts of your ideation on display, evolving ideas along  
the wall – like a research wall, this supports conversations  
and the discovery of connections. You might digitize the  
results of each round for future reference. Or, you might  
use more complex indexing methods, connecting ideas to  
their project origins. It’s very powerful when you can say,  
“This prototype comes from this idea, which comes from  
this partial idea, which comes from this ‘How might we  
…’ question, which comes from this strategic opportunity  
area, which comes from this insight, which comes from  
this original customer statement.05 Let me play you the  
recording.” On the other hand, indexing also takes a lot of  
work.06 Find what…

# The Kano model  
When we are deciding which ideas to explore, understanding how customers  
value the various aspects of our services and physical or digital products01 is very useful.  
The Kano model02 can tell us where to start.  
The Kano model is a theory of customer  
satisfaction. It gives us useful insights  
into what customers care about, and how  
this changes as expectations change. It  
is often represented as a graph, mapping  
customer satisfaction against the degree  
of implementation \(level of technical  
development or ubiquity of the offering\)  
of a value proposition. The curved lines on  
the graph represent different categories03 of  
value proposition.  
Some features of an offering can be  
considered basics \(Kano calls them ­ Must  
01 The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is  
tangible or not. In academia, products are often divided into goods and services.  
However, products are usually bundles of services and physical/digital products.  
As “goods” is colloquially understood as referring to something tangible, we  
prefer to speak of physical/digital products. Read more on this in the textbox  
Service-dominant logic in 2.5.

Must-be Quality from the Viewpoint of Environmental Lifestyle in Japan.” In H.-

Japanese, or the influence of other authors.  
be Qualities\). If these features are not  
there, the customer is dissatisfied – but  
endlessly improving the implementa-  
tion will never be enough to delight the  
customer. For example, if a phone cannot  
connect to a network, the owner will be  
angry. But having a phone which always  
connects is nothing special unless you live  
in a very remote place.  
Other attributes are performance  
factors \(One-Dimensional Qualities\) –  
the better they are, the higher the customer  
satisfaction. Battery capacity is one exam-  
ple – the longer my phone runs between  
charges, the more satisfied I am.  
The third type are sometimes called  
delight or excitement factors \(Attractive  
Qualities\). These are not missed if not  
resent, but can lead to high customer  
satisfaction if implemented. On a phone,  
a 3D screen is a good example. While most  
phones have 2D screens, a 3D display  
would be something to be proud of – but  
not having one does not mean you are  
disappointed with your phone.  
The Kano model shows how the  
satisfaction gained from a value propo-  
sition decays with time, as excitement  
factors become performance factors, then  
basics. One great example is a camera on  
a mobile phone. When cameras were first  
added to phones, they were an excitement  
factor – not expected, and great fun to  
have. Some years later, manufacturers were  
caught up in a “pixels race.” As we write  
this book, most phones can record better  
pictures than most of us need. A good 2D  
phone camera is fast becoming a basic  
factor – for most of us, it only affects our  
­ satisfaction if it’s missing. 06 Ideation

“Deciding in advance  
how decisions will be  
made is essential for  
process transparency,  
security, and perceived  
fairness. Who will decide,  
and how? We know from  
research that design by  
committee is often a  
­ recipe for poor design,  
yet service design is at  
its core participative  
and inclusive, so it is  
somewhat of a para-  
dox. Some organiza-  
tions use adults – lead  
­ designers or executives  
who can set direction  
and decide from options  
­ presented by the team.”

PRE-IDEATION  
# Slicing the elephant  
# and splitting the  
# ideation challenge  
Making one big ideation challenge into a series of more  
manageable ones.  
Often, the theme of ideation is too large or abstract to get a  
grip on. You can help the team by using techniques to limit or  
split ideation into more manageable subtasks. Famous ­ examples  
include the Six Thinking Hats, where participants ideate from  
different viewpoints \(process, facts, feelings, creativity, caution,  
and benefits\); attribute listing, where you start with the attri-  
butes \(physical, procedural, etc.\) of a challenge; 5 Ws + H, which  
invites teams to start from the who, where, what, why, when, and  
how; and the Five Whys, where we ask ourselves “Why?” five  
times. Each answer is a starting point for ideation.  
Prepare and use\: The process depends on the  
method used. Generally start by inviting the right people  
\(people who know the background or will implement  
and deliver the service, experts, users, management,  
etc.\). Prepare the participants01 and run the method.  
Now examine your ideas. What do they suggest? Should  
you repeat? When ready, move into idea selection.  
Expected output\: More manageable challenges, more  
diverse approaches.

# Ideas from  
# journey mapping  
Using the classic visualization tool to generate ideas around  
experience and process.  
Starting with a current-state map, or using your research and  
experience, you create new future-state journey maps. On the way,  
you generate many ideas which may be diversified or prototyped.  
With groups who are comfortable thinking in journeys, this lets you  
think about orchestration and expectations early on.01  
Prepare and use\: Let the group look at your current-state  
journey maps and, if practical, the research behind them. \(If  
you have no maps, storytelling offers a weaker alternative\).  
Taking one map at a time, use the best information you  
have to spot critical steps in the journey by ­ referring to your  
research, stepping into the shoes of your ­ personas, or simu-  
lating process and experience using desktop walkthroughs,  
investigative rehearsal, or bodystorming. Use other ideation  
techniques to ideate around each critical step, recording  
insights, ideas, and new questions. Now draw some rough  
new maps with your most promising ideas. How does the  
change affect the rest of the journey \(technology, process,  
experience, dramatic arc, expectations\)?  
Expected output\: Idea descriptions \(text\), idea sketches  
\(visualizations\).

# Ideas from  
# system mapping  
Using a classic visualization to generate ideas based  
on relationships.  
The group try to add value to an existing \(or quickly created\)  
system map by adding, removing, or replacing elements, and  
examining the exchange between stakeholders.  
Prepare and use\: Let the group look at some current-state  
system maps and, if practical, the research behind them \(a  
weaker alternative is to make some quick assumption-  
based maps\). Take one map at a time – it’s faster if you  
physicalize using Business Origami or a stakeholder con-  
stellation02 – and ask\: Can we strengthen a relationship?  
How could a key person become a hero? Which exchange  
could we facilitate? How could the network still function if  
some elements were removed, added, or changed?  
Write down your insights, ideas, and questions.  
Use other ideation methods to diversify, then draw up  
new future-state system maps for the most interesting  
ideas. How can you make each map work? Is something  
still missing or imbalanced? Dig deeper using new journey  
maps, service blueprints, or prototyping.  
Expected output\: Idea descriptions \(text\), idea sketches  
\(visualizations\)

in a room just like on a system map. See the online description of this tool for more details.

PRE-IDEATION  
# “How might we …?”  
# questions from insights  
# and user stories  
A systematic method to base ideation on research  
and knowledge.03  
Use this systematic method when you have research or  
­ experience to build on, or when you need to step back from ideas  
and return to needs and opportunities.  
Prepare and use\: Start with the insights or user  
­ stories developed in your research activities. Look at  
the ­ individual parts within each insight or user story,  
and convert each insight or story into several trigger  
­ questions, perhaps starting with “How might we …”  
Sort and group the questions into useful clusters or  
“opportunity areas.” Invite strategic specialists and senior  
management to help you prioritize them.  
Look at the questions inside the clusters and decide  
what specialists you should invite to enrich your usual  
ideation cast of researchers, people who will ­ implement  
and deliver the service, users, management, etc. Ideate  
around the questions inside your most important  
­ clusters, then move to idea selection.  
Expected output\: Trigger questions \(text\),  
map of idea clusters

GENERATING MANY IDEAS  
# Brainstorming and  
# brainwriting  
Two famous methods which help teams stay in divergent mode  
while generating ideas quickly.  
Use verbal brainstorming01 to find a starting point for your  
work, to get to grips with the theme, to boost energy, or to add  
options. Use the silent, more thoughtful brainwriting02 when  
ideas are more complex, when diversity is key, when the group is  
large, or to empower quiet participants.  
Prepare and use\: Prepare your group with information03  
and remind them to refrain from criticism, be open to  
wild ideas, focus on quantity, and build on the ideas of  
others. Show the ideation theme, then do a distracting  
warm-up before the exercise starts. In brainstorming,  
ask the group to shout ideas while you write them on  
the board. In brainwriting, ask participants to silently  
and individually write or sketch their ideas, one idea per  
page. They can pass them on to others for development,  
post them on a wall, or keep them secret for a while.  
At the end, display the ideas on the wall, cluster, discuss,  
and begin selection.

See Briefing and inspiring participants in 6.3.  
GENERATING MANY IDEAS  
# 10 plus 10  
A fast visual ideation method which combines breadth and  
depth of ideas.  
The 10 plus 10 exercise04 is a strong method for ideating around  
physical or digital situations and interfaces. It helps teams  
to quickly generate a broad variety of concepts, and to get  
some depth in understanding. The very visual approach helps  
them be specific.  
Prepare and use\: Pick a challenge and do a warm-up  
­ before dividing into table-sized teams. Give the teams  
just a few minutes to individually, silently, and very  
roughly sketch 10 concepts per team that address the  
challenge. They should draw real-world implementations,  
not metaphors or concepts. When the time is up, they  
can each briefly explain their sketches to their immediate  
team members. Then each team should quickly choose  
one sketch which seems interesting, before sketching  
silently again, making 10 variations of this. After sharing  
the results, they now have 20 sketches from two rounds –  
one broad, and one deep – to take into idea selection.  
Expected output\: Idea sketches \(visualizations\)

ADDING DEPTH AND DIVERSITY  
# Bodystorming  
A physical ideation method, sometimes called “brainstorming  
for the body.”05  
Use this physical exploration method to help understand, ideate,  
and show problems. It is very useful when the challenge has  
­ physical or interpersonal aspects, or when a session needs  
empathy, energy, or a highlight. Bodystorming is simpler and  
faster than investigative rehearsal,06 but has less depth.  
Prepare and use\: Immerse the group in the context of  
the challenge via research or site visits. If the group know  
the context well, storytelling might be enough. Make a  
list of interesting situations or ideas. In the original context  
or in a workshop space, take one situation at a time and  
act it out.07 There will be lots of laughter at the beginning,  
but remember that this is work and challenge the group  
if they make their lives too easy or slip into ­ discussion  
mode. As alternatives come up, try them out or park  
them. Take notes to help the group remember what  
they discovered, and repeat for other situations or ideas.  
Reflect, and take ideas forward into idea selection.  
Expected output\: Video/photo documentation of  
bodystorming sessions, documentation as idea descriptions  
\(text\), bug lists \(text\) or idea sketches \(visualizations\)

06 See Chapter 7, Prototyping.  
Safe space is especially important for this method. See 10.3.4, Creating a safe space. This is Service Design Doing  
ADDING DEPTH AND DIVERSITY  
# Using cards and checklists  
Cards \(and checklists\) focus an ideation session on one  
question or inspiration, with surprising results.  
Ideation, creativity, brainstorming, and method cards \(there are  
many names\) can be used when the group feels stuck, or can’t  
move away from familiar thinking. They promote discussion, to  
suggest new avenues of exploration, to structure thinking, and  
to spark ideas. There are many sets – and similar lists – available,  
or you can make your own. Card sets can also function as a  
checklist – work through the cards, and you won’t forget anything  
important. The cards can also be used to prioritize by sorting out  
the most important ones, or they can form the headings around  
which you cluster your ideas and observations.  
Prepare and use\: The process will vary, so read the  
instructions. Warm-ups will be useful if you aim to  
ideate, especially warm-ups around making associations  
and building on each other’s ideas. To push beyond  
the obvious, spend a little longer on each card than the  
group wants to.  
Expected output\: Idea descriptions \(text\),  
idea sketches \(visualizations\)  
ADDING DEPTH AND DIVERSITY  
# Ideation based on analogies  
# and association  
Ideate by translating existing solutions or looking for links  
to random stimuli.  
Analogies are a way to translate ideas which already exist.  
Instead of struggling with new Problem A, adapt known solutions  
to the essentially similar \(analogous\) but familiar Problem B.01  
Associations work in a similar way to analogies, but help us  
reframe the problem and think in new ways by trying try to find  
associations with a randomly chosen word or image.  
These methods are best used after other, simpler methods.  
Prepare and use\: Good analogies are powerful, and  
preparing them gets easier with experience. Basically,  
you reduce the challenge to its essential characteristics,  
separate it from its context, and look for problems  
with similar characteristics in other fields. Choose the  
best analogies, and think about the analogy, not the  
initial challenge. What worked there? Make notes, and  
try various analogies. Can the ideas and experience  
be translated?  
Random association has the same basic process, but  
starts with a random word, phrase, or image. Open a  
book at random, or use one of the many random word  
and image generators online.

# Octopus clustering  
A very quick group method to sort and cluster ideas or  
­ information. Everyone gets to know the ideas.  
Use octopus clustering to sort large numbers of ideas, insights,  
data – anything which fits on a sticky note. As well as sorting,  
everyone gets an overview of what the material is and starts to  
share ownership of ideas.  
B  
C  
A Octopus clustering. In a very large group, five highly  
engaged rows of participants sort hundreds of sticky  
notes in minutes.  
B Card packs can help focus or diversify an  
ideation session – or break a deadlock.  
C Random words or images can be used to diversify and  
unblock ideation.  
Prepare and use\: Stand people in clear rows in front  
of a wall of sticky notes. The front row actively sorts  
the notes; the second row advises, and other rows have  
various support functions. Every 30 seconds, the front  
row moves to the back, and everyone steps forward into  
a new role. Remind them to watch out for “orphans” and  
break up overlarge clusters. After a few cycles, the notes  
are sorted and the group knows the content.  
In this exercise, people work fast and close to each  
other, so it also acts as a great warm-up. Also, everyone  
touches many notes, leaving them crumpled and tired –  
we lose attachment to the ideas. The new clusters might  
help us understand the overarching structure of the  
material, or suggest different directions for the next step.

# Benny Hill sorting  
# \(“Thirty-Five”\)  
A fast, high-energy way to choose the most interesting or popular  
from a large group of options.  
This method01 for bigger groups takes a large number of items  
and quickly ranks them by whatever criteria you decide. Use it to  
select ideas or pitches which the group finds most interesting.  
Or use it to agree on priorities for the session, rules of cooperation,  
and so on.  
Prepare and use\: Everyone is standing, each holding a  
piece of paper, perhaps with a very clear sketch of their  
idea. When music plays, they move quickly through the  
group, swapping papers with everyone they meet. When  
the music stops, they form random pairs, compare their  
two unfamiliar papers, and have 45 seconds to share 7  
points between the ideas. The exercise repeats five times  
and the results are summed. As well as ranking the  
items, this exercise also thoroughly mixes them, starts to  
­ establish co-ownership, and leaves the idea papers looking  
tired and used – helpful if the group have trouble letting  
go. Perhaps you can use a physical commitment method to  
form work groups around the most interesting ones.

# Idea portfolio  
A slightly more analytical selection method for quick but  
reliable sorting.  
Ideas are ranked according to two variables and arranged on a  
portfolio or graph.02 Because two variables are used, the method  
can balance different needs and appeals to analytical mindsets.  
It prepares the groundwork for an informed decision, and even  
allows a strategic view of the options.  
Prepare and use\: Decide on your criteria\: “Impact on  
customer experience” against general “Feasibility” works  
very well. Mark up a portfolio \(graph\) on the wall or  
floor. Taking one idea at a time, ask the group \(or a  
subgroup\) to assign 0 to 10 points for each variable and  
­ position it on the portfolio. The discussion they have  
now is as important as the tool. When all ideas are laid  
out, talk about which to investigate. Often the ideas with  
high impact and high feasibility are the most interesting,  
but you need a varied selection, so you might include  
some other ideas for their long-term benefits, or for idea  
­ diversity. Take the shortlisted ideas into further exploration,  
perhaps via journey maps, blueprints, or prototyping.  
Expected output\: Ranked ideas, visual idea portfolio

# Decision matrix  
A more analytic, multiple-factor approach to decision making.  
This MCDA \(multiple criteria decision analysis\) method03 is  
welcomed by analytical thinkers. It includes several criteria in the  
decision, but lets us consider them one at a time.  
Prepare and use\: Collect your options and list them  
down one side of a table. Write the decision factors as  
headings for the columns of the table. If you want,  
give each decision factor a weighting. Be careful – small  
differences in weighting will strongly affect the outcome.  
For each idea, assign a value for each factor. Multiply the  
value by the weighting and write it in the box. The idea  
with the highest total value is the one to consider first,  
but you should choose a mixed group to take further.  
Like with many “decision” tools, the discussion while  
using the tool – even while selecting decision factors and  
weighting – is as important as the tool itself. This tool can  
lead to very long discussions, where teams are ­ basically  
guessing values. Point this out, and use the tool to high-  
light the gaps in understanding, then use research or  
prototyping to inform or replace the discussion.

REDUCING OPTIONS  
# Quick voting methods  
Quick ways to get the majority view, for larger groups  
and small teams.  
Often, groups faced with options or decisions will slip into  
­ discussions, simply out of habit. Adopt quick techniques to explore  
which ideas, insights, or datapoints are most interesting or see if  
the group has already made a decision.01  
Prepare and use\: Dot voting gives each team member a  
fixed number of sticky dots or pen marks to show favorites.  
Barometers let us assess every option by marking ­ ratings  
on paper labels or holding a stickynote in the air to show  
approval or disapproval \(perhaps with a Likert scale from  
+2 to –2\). “Nose picking” lets teams or small groups see  
if they already agree. Each team member puts one finger  
on their nose, and they all count together to three and  
quickly put that finger on their preferred item. Anyone  
who hesitates has lost her vote.  
Before using techniques like these, you might want  
to \(quickly!\) agree on criteria. If in doubt, ask, “What is  
most promising right now?” Then apply these techniques  
to support decisions, or see if one has already been made,  
not to make them. They should not replace important dis-  
cussions, but can quickly reveal if discussion is ­ necessary.  
Expected output\: Revealed decisions, ranked  
ideas or favorites

REDUCING OPTIONS  
# Physical commitment  
A way to quickly pinpoint popular ideas and form teams  
for the next step.  
These physical choice methods let everyone see who supports an  
idea and who wants to be in which group, and any changes are  
quick, easy, and obvious.02  
Prepare and use\: In a floor gallery, participants browse  
papers laid out on the floor. They show support or join a  
group by standing on a piece of paper. Use this when the  
items are larger or need time to read – like elevator pitches,  
idea sketches, or service ads.  
In Coraling, group members look at items on the wall  
and put their finger on a favorite. Others join by touching  
the shoulder of the first person, forming lines and branches  
like coral. Use this variant for anything which is tricky to  
take off the wall, like clusters of sticky notes.  
If you are forming groups, now look at the groups.  
Are they viable? Too small, too large? Who might change  
groups and help out elsewhere? Which important ideas  
are the group ignoring? If you are selecting ideas, is there  
enough balance and variation? Which important ideas  
are missing? What needs more attention?  
Expected output\: Ranked or selected ideas, new working  
groups \(if used for group forming\).  
02 Groups formed this way might be unbalanced \(often beneficial in the short term\), so use these activities to split  
up the group for the next task of a workshop, not to form long-term teams for a project. B

# KLM cares\: Developing ideas through  
# co-creation with customers  
AUTHOR  
Marcel Zwiers  
Founding Partner,  
31Volts  
Over the last decade or so, many  
airlines – including KLM – have  
focused on providing more and more  
self-services, empowering their  
­ customers to take control of their  
travel experiences. Services that  
used to be delivered by the ground  
­ stewardesses now belong to the  
­ customer, from printing out your  
boarding pass to labeling and  
checking in your luggage. Checking  
passports, printing boarding passes,  
and lifting suitcases onto conveyor  
belts became a thing of the past  
for KLM staff. But what would the  
future look like? If the the team were  
no longer depended on to do these  
tasks, what then?  
In many projects, a question  
or challenge is often answered by a  
solution. In this case, the idea was to  
provide the staff with more freedom  
to provide the KLM ­ customers with  
a positive travel experience. But  
what does freedom look like? How  
much freedom are we talking  
about? And, even more difficult,  
who will be managing this newly  
acquired freedom?  
Our main goal was to use \(service\)  
design in order to learn as much as  
we could from the people that KLM  
cares deeply about\: the world travelers  
entering, leaving, or just transferring  
through Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.  
We tried to understand what it  
was they valued, what was import-  
ant to them, and what it meant to  
travel the world.  
Let me take you one step back  
… In 2010, the Eyjafjallajökull  
volcano in Iceland erupted, put-  
ting huge amounts of ash into the  
atmosphere. For five days, most  
flights to and from Europe were  
canceled, leaving many people  
stranded in airports. The Amsterdam  
Airport Schiphol was also closed. But  
something interesting happened –  
most of the KLM staff headed to  
the airport. Not because they had  
to – there were no flights leaving –  
but ­ because they cared. The KLM  
staff took their ­ freedom not for their  
­ personal benefit but to be there for  
the people stranded at Amsterdam  
Airport Schiphol.  
This event and the many things  
that happened afterward meant a  
lot for KLM. It was also, although  
indirectly, the starting point of several  
service design projects we started.  
from the “Wall of Inspiration,” to  
the “Idea Canvas,” to the SurpriseUs  
game, to designing the book No Day  
Is the Same, for which we collected  
more than 100 stories.  
Service Design Studio  
All these small projects led to the  
Service Design Studio we created for  
KLM, right in the middle of all the  
buzz at the airport. For two months CASES 06 Ideation

in the spring of 2013, we were open  
almost 24/7 to talk to people. The  
Service Design Studio was an open  
space without doors, so everybody  
could drop by to ask questions  
and participate.  
Design as the language  
Talking to people in design means en-  
gaging them in activities, using design  
to help people to express themselves.  
Every week we picked a relevant  
topic to work on, from “Traveling  
with kids” to “Peace of mind” to  
“Connectivity.” With the studio as a  
context and using small designerly as-  
signments, we had KLM staff engage  
with the people traveling through  
Amsterdam. The design approach  
and the way of working was new to  
them. However, the goal was to work  
together with the people visiting the  
airport, which was ­ familiar territory.  
The combination of the new way  
of working within a comfortable  
­ environment worked surprisingly  
well. The Service Design Studio  
turned out to be a safe haven for  
both the staff and the passengers to  
have conversations about an even  
better customer experience. This is Service Design Doing  
Conclusion  
What about the freedom? All project  
teams were built around KLM staff  
taking ownership of the goals we set.  
They were the true designers.  
We are very proud of the Service  
Design Studio and the things we  
accomplished together with and for  
KLM. It hasn’t been an easy path. For  
an organization that is highly depen-  
dent on doing things fast, safely, and  
on time, the explorative and creative  
nature of a designerly approach is  
hard to incorporate – especially when  
the outcome of the project isn’t clear  
from the start. And when we finally  
delivered the more than 50 insights,  
the question remained, “Who would  
take the next step?”  
Together with KLM, we learned a lot  
during this time. The most important  
practical lesson might well be the value  
of a designerly approach in an open  
­ environment to engage people. Talking  
to people by way of doing things  
­ together creates a deep ­ understanding  
of the relationship your ­ organization  
has with its customers.  
KEY TAKEAWAYS  
01  
When a ­ customer-centric  
organization or  
­ customer-centric culture is  
a key aspect of your service  
design project, make the  
project room stand out and  
ensure that it is accessible  
to everyone who wants to  
participate. Make it a ­ project  
in itself.  
02  
03  
Designing out in the open  
and for everyone to see  
might feel uncomfortable  
at first. Don’t worry –  
your ­ vulnerability is your  
strength. Any discomfort  
will pass faster than you  
expect.  
Provide service design tools  
for the non-designers from  
your client organization to  
guide them. ­ Conversations  
about innovation are  
­ different from daily reality.  
04  
05  
Set daily or weekly goals  
\(e.g., by introducing themes  
for working in the studio\).  
“If you don’t do this, you will  
die,” was the ­ remark one  
passenger made, referring  
to the need for listening  
to your customers in ways  
that go beyond a regular  
survey. This was the best  
­ compliment the KLM Ser-  
vice Design Studio could wish  
for.

# From vision to reality in 90 days

Experience Officer/CXO,

InReality  
Project background  
Imagine you are in need of a new  
kitchen faucet. Where do you start?  
For many, the answer may be to visit  
a local kitchen and bath showroom.  
Once there, you are faced with a sea  
of options. Shiny fixtures of all shapes  
and sizes cover the walls. Tiny name-  
plates, manufacturers’ part numbers,  
and features too technical to under-  
stand flood your senses. Eventually,  
you might be greeted by a sales associ-  
ate who, if willing and engaged them-  
selves, begins to help you through this  
process toward the selection of your  
dream kitchen faucet. The process  
leaves consumers overwhelmed and  
unlikely to stay loyal to any one brand.  
The journey just described  
happens repeatedly, in variations, all  
over the world. This was the situation  
facing Danze, an “affordable luxury”  
brand in the kitchen and bath space.  
Danze wanted to become a recog-  
nized leader in the industry. They  
envisioned an innovation that served  
two purposes\: \(1\) to create such a  
­ dramatically better customer experi-  
ence that \(2\) a new channel part-  
ner is compelled to implement the  
­ experience on the showroom floor.  
The people and the design brief  
A key driver for this project was  
visionary CEO Michael Werner.  
He and his team approached  
InReality, and collaborated actively  
at all stages of the project. His energy  
also invigorated his internal sales  
and marketing team, as well as his  
operations group – we had a base  
level of buy-in from the beginning.  
Outside collaborators such as adver-  
tising agency and trade association  
representatives were important part-  
ners early on. In an industry where  
innovation is moving slowly, this  
shared authorship helped pave the  
way to quicker adoption of ­ service  
innovation. How did we build the  
vision for this new, reimagined  
showroom experience?  
192/193  
It was clear that the ­ traditional  
presentation of products on slat  
walls left little room for imaginative  
­ customer experiences or brand build-  
ing beyond a simple logo on the wall.  
Together, we evaluated the  
latest innovations in automotive  
showrooms, best-in-class retail,  
and leading museum experiences  
\(London’s V&A, amongst others\).  
Interviews with some of the ­ creators  
of these experiences helped our client  
understand what it takes to make a  
bold ­ vision a reality. Observational  
­ research and interviews with sales  
associates rounded out the first phase.  
From understanding to  
creating\: Service design tools  
“out in the wild”  
Using co-creation methods, the team  
at InReality facilitated a collaboration  
workshop with key stakeholders.  
Activities moved us quickly from the  
sharing of objectives into a collab-  
oration space, one that empowered This is Service Design Doing  
every single participant in the  
room to contribute and share their  
voices. The culminating event was  
a bodystorming/customer journey  
hybrid – essentially a stop motion of  
a typical customer journey where our  
customer would act out journey steps  
and then state their feelings at each  
moment in the journey. Participants  
watching each scene were asked to  
share insights from their ­ perspectives\:  
brand, product, marketing,  
­ operations, sales, and so on.  
During a series of pre-meetings,  
it became clear that we would have  
to plan for a way to infect all project  
stakeholders with a passion for what  
would be possible.  
Taking an approach of live journey  
mapping versus presenting a static  
slide deck resulted in a heightened  
level of empathy not only for the  
user but also for other \(internal and  
external\) stakeholders. Participants  
shared freely what they loved  
about various steps in the process  
and what they found challenging,  
forming a rich design brief for  
subsequent phases.  
The solution  
Our co-created customer journey  
evolved into a service blueprint, out-  
lining requirements for the ­ physical  
form and digital components.  
Customer-centric thinking, stake-  
holder awareness, and a sophisticated  
interpretation of brand form language  
were merged with a deep under-  
standing of digital technologies.  
Product samples are mounted  
on RFID-enabled, removable bases.  
Customers or associates can place  
the product on a “Smart Shelf ”  
containing an RFID reader ­ mounted  
below the touchscreen display,  
delivering dynamic content based  
on the product placed on the shelf.  
From there, shoppers can navigate  
through product details, material  
finishes, coordinating products,  
and more. The solution allows for a  
“three-way conversation” between  
the physical product, the digital  
content, and the people interacting  
with it all. When not in use, the  
screen works as a brand-centric  
messaging platform, attracting cus-  
tomers and reinforcing top-of-mind  
brand awareness with showroom  
representatives.

A Throughout our research, we directed the focus on  
“service design grit” – the hard work of making a  
service vision a reality. The findings, along with the  
strategic business requirements, made for a robust  
design brief from the onset of the project.  
B The workshop was nothing short of amazing\:  
the energy in the room was immense and a feeling of  
shared accomplishment by all truly was deep-felt.  
C The buying experience for the customer and the ­ selling  
experience for the showroom representative were so  
­ dramatically different that our client was easily able to  
break into the new sales channel, ­ strategically widen-  
ing its distribution base. The adoption by the show-  
room partner happened in greater numbers and at a  
faster pace than initially projected.  
The solution requires less linear  
wall space \(less money spent for  
products on display\) and adds a level  
of engagement previously not seen  
in these showroom environments.  
And the digital interactions can be  
tabulated and analyzed in a way that  
was never possible before.  
Making it a reality  
We produced and deployed the  
system to hundreds of locations  
in three months. Yet, initial usage  
of the smart shelf was not as high  
as anticipated. What was going  
on? Rather than pointing blame,  
our ­ collaborative client–agency  
relationship allowed us to proac-  
tively seek a solution. A quick round  
of heuristic ideation revealed that  
perhaps the attract loop content did  
not have the immediate stopping  
power we desired. We suggested a  
change to the screen content with a  
stronger call to action. Working with  
an agency partner, we redeveloped  
the narrative and quickly pushed  
changes to the field. This improved  
usage rates dramatically.  
194/195  
Using service design tools tightly  
integrated with traditional marketing  
and industrial design tools resulted  
in a rapid development cycle and an  
­ industry-leading experience, ultimately  
exceeding the client’s business goals.  
KEY TAKEAWAYS  
01  
Live journey mapping can  
lead to amazing levels of  
participation and buy-in.  
02 Digitally driven experiences  
offer great value – we can  
now enter the market with  
a minimum viable product  
\(MVP\) and iterate on it  
afterward.

True partnership with all  
stakeholders builds a trust  
and long-term mutual  
respect that encourages pro-  
active thinking and problem  
solving.

Mental health in the UK is costing  
the government around £70 billion  
per year,01 and that figure continues to  
increase. In 2014, the Department of  
Health \(DoH\), Department for Work  
and Pensions \(DWP\), and RAND  
Europe report outlined existing evi-  
dence around mental health inter-  
ventions and made a call to “provide  
access to online mental health and  
work assessments and support.”02  
Snook was commissioned in  
partnership with The Point People to  
conduct research to explore future  
opportunities for digital products and  
services, specifically looking at the  
potential of digital to scale up access  
to frontline services that exist to sup-  
port positive mental well-being, and  
also at self-management and how  
processes like cognitive behavioral  
therapy \(CBT\) could be scaled.

Service Provision and Outcomes.” Retrieved March 26, 2016, from  
https\://www.gov.uk.  
The project was undertaken  
with sponsorship by the Government  
Digital Service \(GDS\) and focused  
on executing a discovery phase, out-  
lined in the GDS Service Manual.03  
During this phase, our focus was on  
identifying opportunities and user  
needs across varying stages of em-  
ployment that could then be taken  
forward by design teams to later  
work up solutions.  
As a research and design team,  
we were focused on not producing  
“solutions” for two reasons\:  
1 The discovery phase is about the  
identification of user needs aligned  
at core stages of employment, such  
as “As a line manager, I need tools  
to recognize my employees’ mental  
well-being so that I can support them  
before they reach crisis points” and  
03 Government Digital Service \(n.d.\). “Service Manual” at https\://www.  
gov.uk/service-manual.  
“As someone who is unemployed,  
I need encouragement and tools that  
give me belief in my own abilities,  
because I have low self-esteem.”  
2 The system we were designing  
for was more complex than one or  
two products of the Government  
Digital Service. Our results could  
end up being used in a variety of  
contexts, from suggesting content  
and tools housed on NHS Choices,  
to creating principles to stimulate the  
private sector market, to developing  
digital tools that meet needs.  
“If someone is off work with broken  
arms and legs, people rally around  
them. If someone is off work with  
mental health problems, they’re like  
‘Oh, they will pull themselves together’  
sort of thing … A lot of places need to  
understand it a little bit more.”  
— Charles \(research participant\),  
45 years old CASES 06 Ideation  
We conducted user research with  
people throughout the UK, from  
Dundee to Brighton, to gain  
­ understanding of their experience  
of being in and out of work and the  
impact on their mental well-being.  
The people we interviewed were  
not diagnosed with mental health  
conditions and a full breakdown of  
demographics can be found in the  
project report, ­ including the ability  
to use technology.  
Phases of research  
Snook’s research was in two phases\:  
1 Discovery phase\: User research  
investigating people’s ­ experiences  
of accessing support for mental  
well-being and their current use of  
digital platforms  
2 Pre-alpha phase\: Co-designing  
digital platforms and tools that  
could support people to maintain  
mental well-being throughout their  
­ employment journey  
Snook’s sessions included in-depth  
interviews, focus groups, and  
workshops, all using bespoke tools  
developed specifically for the project.  
These helped in the creation of  
visual maps of people’s employment  
history, clearly illustrating highs  
and lows of mental well-being and  
opportunities for digital innovation  
in service delivery.04  
As a discovery project, our core  
findings were vast, so we split these  
down according to core stages  
of ­ employment and user groups.  
Within the “in work” stage, our core  
findings highlighted the need for  
a greater set of resources and tools  
within the workplace for both line  
managers and staff to discuss and  
manage well-being. Our research  
highlighted key moments where and  
when this would be needed, from  
embedding tools into email accounts  
to annual review processes.  
In the “finding work” phase, we  
highlighted a need to support people  
in thinking proactively about job  
searching, including alternative op-  
tions like networking and skills de-  
velopment and how other people had  
achieved this in practical terms. Our

partners \(Department of Health, Department for Work and Pensions,  
and Government Digital Services\) to present findings and identify  
priorities for research and development.  
196/197  
research therefore picked up both  
macro and micro needs/insights  
across the employment journey.  
The focus was on three main  
phases of employment\: finding work,  
being in and out of work, and man-  
aging work. Based on extensive user  
research, we created a set of design  
briefs presenting needs, insights, and  
challenges, each with its own case  
study. In addition, we outlined a list of  
design principles relevant to anyone  
developing digital tools in this field.  
Key tools and processes  
There were three key tools and  
­ processes utilized in the ­ project – use  
cases, life journeys, and ­ low-fidelity  
wireframes. These were chosen so  
a product development team could  
easily build on our framed user needs  
with deeper research and subsequent  
service ­ designs by understanding the  
context to design for.  
The ideation sessions included  
a variety of methods, like sketch-  
ing, looking for analogies in other  
industries, and creating journey maps  
and low-fi mock-ups. The designers  
brought form to ideas through sketch-  
ing, all of which corresponded to the This is Service Design Doing

ideas in timed sessions, working  
through each use case, identifying  
useful content for users, or sometimes  
joining several needs and use cases to  
form a standalone product or ser-  
vice opportunity.  
We developed concepts through  
discussion, utilizing sketching to  
bring basic form to ideas. We iden-  
tified one or two key features so we  
could recognize each idea later on,  
focus on the function of the concept,  
and quickly articulate it to others.  
We also looked for examples of  
innovations and existing products  
and services that were used to inspire  
similar concepts, but applied within  
the context of mental health and the  
scenarios we were designing for.  
To further concepts, we sketched  
journeys of users and the concepts we  
were developing to articulate ­ features  
of the service concepts and the  
delivery mechanisms that might be  
involved to make them a reality. This  
helped us not only to provide service  
and product design propositions, but  
to articulate stakeholders within the  
system of government, employment,  
and health who could be the deliv-  
ery mechanisms.  
After our core ideation sessions,  
we produced low-fidelity mock-  
ups, focusing only on features. The  
mock-ups did not include any visible  
aesthetic design features like color or  
defined fonts. We used this process  
to come to concrete design decisions  
on the core features of the different  
ideas we were creating and, through  
this whole process, consider how  
they might work together in tandem  
as a system of products and services.  
“This research into likely user groups,  
needs, and preferences for a poten-  
tial online mental health and work  
assessment and support tool provides  
invaluable insight into experience and  
need within our population. It provides  
information on people’s experiences of  
living with a mental health condition  
and service provision. The research  
outlines where a digital service  
could benefit particular groups and  
through the early design and testing of  
­ prototypes provides a range of ideas  
for potential online tools.”

Work, Department of Health CASES 06 Ideation  
Looking ahead  
This project was a new way of  
working for the DoH, which  
has historically ­ employed mar-  
ket research techniques to inform  
digital development. The depth  
of insights generated through this  
user research exceeded the ­ clients’  
original expectations and have been  
carried forward into ­ various work  
packages through NHS Choices, the  
DWP, and the DoH.  
The ongoing projects our clients  
were undertaking at the time were  
able to utilize the strategic recom-  
mendations, ideas, and wider user  
needs and insights we identified to  
inform the products and services in  
current development. Throughout  
every stage, we sought to ensure  
there were projects already instigat-  
ed that could utilize the results to  
inform their work.  
While this was a research project  
specifically for a digital tool, some of  
the findings have been useful for  
informing wider policy decisions  
and have been presented to Nesta,  
NHS Choices, and the wider GDS  
teams. The DoH welcomed these  
reports and has made them publicly  
available so that they can inform the  
future design of mental health and  
employment support.  
KEY TAKEAWAYS  
01 When undertaking  
­ discovery research, ensure  
that you are not forming  
solutions before identifying  
user needs and that insights  
are clearly identified and  
­ communicated.  
02  
03  
Utilize journeys to ­ consider  
the wider end-to-end  
remit of where a product  
or ­ service moment fits in  
­ context with the ­ wider sys-  
tem. Use this when research-  
ing to uncover insights and  
also to present needs at a  
later stage.  
When “working live,”  
make sure you understand  
the wider system of orga-  
nizations, people, other  
stakeholders, and ongoing  
programs of work. This is so  
04  
05  
198/199  
you can identify as you go  
where your developing proj-  
ect knowledge can be fed  
into \(and how\) and you can  
strategically position your  
work to increase the likeli-  
hood of positive impact.  
Focus on function, not form,  
especially when testing  
prototypes. Keep everything  
low fidelity for as long as  
you can to ensure you test  
the proposition.  
There is no silver bullet  
to “solve” mental health.  
The problem of service  
support is not owned by  
one department or orga-  
nization, and you cannot  
design a “solution.” Ensure  
the insights about how to  
design a product or service  
are clearly articulated and  
useful for a follow-on team  
or funder to learn from  
when embarking on their  
development within one  
part of the wider system. This is Service Design Doing

interviews with families, patients,  
and almost all the range of profes-  
sionals that work within the hospital\:  
nurses, doctors, staff of support  
services \(admissions and reception,  
customer service, social service, co-  
ordination of ­ volunteers and donors,  
communication, digital marketing,  
and management\). We then synthe-  
sized all that data into detailed – and  
valuable – user journey maps.  
Due to the very tight schedules  
of hospital staff, it was challenging to  
involve them actively. We had to fix  
workshops months in advance and  
squeeze them into two-hour slots,  
which included putting everyone  
back on track, moving forward, and  
collecting results – there was almost  
no time left to create a safe space!  
We started by having profes-  
sionals related to each type of patient  
observe their corresponding user  
journey and make an individual  
traffic light assessment – what was  
already working \(green\), what could  
be improved \(amber\), and what  
was not working at all \(red\) – with  
an additional round of what was  
missing. After sharing and clustering  
everyone’s notes, they translated the  
categories into ideation questions  
starting with “How might we …” At  
that point, we noticed that most of  
the issues they had ­ identified in sep-  
arate user journeys were ­ surprisingly  
similar. There were eight big oppor-  
tunity areas across patient types and  
services, such as managing fear and CASES 06 Ideation

with additional knowledge. In some cases, reading patients’ own  
words was a shock, but it sparked meaningful conversations  
around the need to change procedures or attitudes.  
D Hospital staff integrated the research results by doing a traffic  
light assessment of user journeys, and moved into ideation by  
translating emerging topics into “How might we …?” questions. This is Service Design Doing

normal \(as opposed to sick\) while  
in the hospital.  
Ideas to prototypes  
From that moment on, we no longer  
worked in patient-related teams,  
but mixed staff from different  
units. We generated tons of ideas  
through brainwriting rounds with  
different angles and prioritized them  
using a bull’s-eye\: most relevant in  
the center, least relevant outside.  
Ideas were developed into concepts  
by ­ quickly sketching and describing  
how they would work; identifying  
who would be involved; and consid-  
ering how innovative, feasible, and  
­ impactful they would be.  
“I feel hope every time we meet.  
We are actually working to improve  
problems I see on a daily basis.”  
— Case manager for international patients  
Finally, staff also contributed to  
taking concepts further through  
prototyping. Some teams sketched  
new systems and procedures in  
detail. Others focused on digital  
tools and were able to produce early  
versions of interactive mock-ups.  
We refined those prototypes just  
enough to check them with ­ patients  
and families in guerrilla tests  
around the hospital.  
A long-term vision and action  
After prioritizing the projects  
again with an idea portfolio, some  
are already being put into prac-  
tice by Patient Experience and the  
­ relevant stakeholders – for example,  
­ context-sensitive ways for commu-  
nicating bad news and a resource  
center for families.  
This case also proved the value  
of a service design approach to  
the management. Beyond discrete  
­ projects, patient experience has  
become one of the foundations of the  
new strategic plan of the hospital.  
Taking a broader approach was  
key to building a long-term vision  
with projects for the next few years.  
Involving staff from different units  
and levels both as informants during  
research and as co-creators since  
then developed a shared understand-  
ing and a goodwill for change.

Despite decades of donor and  
government financing, three billion  
people worldwide still cook on  
smoky traditional stoves and open  
fires, and a large-scale shift away  
from the traditional use of biomass  
for cooking has yet to occur in many  
developing countries. This results in  
4.3 million annual deaths from respi-  
ratory illnesses. Still, typical methods  
for understanding behavior tend  
to be quantitative and tell us little  
about exactly how and why house-  
holds adopt \(or fail to adopt\) and use  
improved cookstoves and cleaner  
fuels. Service design methods helped  
to shed new light on the needs and  
wider contexts of improved cook-  
stove users in Kenya. The work led  
to concrete insights for the specific  
context, but could also be used to  
improve the way in which better  
cookstove programs are designed and  
implemented in other developing  
country settings in the future.  
In September 2015, a mixed  
team of service designers and SEI  
­ researchers conducted 19 in-depth  
interviews with households in  
Kiambu County, Kenya, with focus  
on the adoption and usage of a  
biomass pellet stove from Philips.  
We partnered with SNV Netherlands  
Development Organisation, which  
distributed the stove, and with a  
local micro-finance institution,  
VEP \(Visionary Empowerment  
Programme\), which provided loans  
to the women to afford the stove.  
“It was really useful for us to see the  
full journey for the women – not just  
receiving the stove, but how they get  
information, how they learn to use the  
stove, and how they cope if something  
goes wrong. This helps us to see where  
problems might pop up now and in  
the future, and how we might solve  
them together with our partners.”  
— VEP field staff  
202/203  
The interviews were conducted with  
the help of a local translator, and in  
order to overcome language ­ barriers  
we used visual material showing dif-  
ferent situations and suggestions re-  
lated to cooking. This visual ­ material  
triggered the respondents to share  
stories and helped us facilitate the in-  
terviews. When displaying the visuals,  
we asked “What is this?” “How would  
you use this?” or “What if things  
looked/worked this way?” and they  
started to share their stories. After our  
first set of initial interviews, we could  
see patterns within the customer  
journey that were not ideal for them  
as end users. In order to understand  
more about those problem areas, we  
used other visual material to show  
the respondents new situations, new  
services, or different stove designs.  
The overall ideation process  
In the first round of interviews, the  
users claimed to be happy with the This is Service Design Doing  
usage of the stove and had no sug-  
gestions for improvements. But when  
shown images of stoves with different  
simple variations in height, width,  
or fabrication materials, suddenly  
something happened. Users sponta-  
neously started talking about the pros  
and cons of the different designs,  
which also gave clues on how they  
experienced using the current stove\:  
for example, “Oh, I would love if it  
was higher, then it wouldn’t burn the  
food,” or “A wider stove would defi-  
nitely make less pellets go to waste  
at the bottom.”  
They even started coming up  
with new suggestions for designs,  
services, and solutions. When differ-  
ent respondents were presented with  
ideas for alternative stove designs  
over and over again, they automat-  
ically refined relevant ideas and  
sorted out the irrelevant ones.  
“This was useful for us to understand  
the daily logistic challenges faced by  
our field staff in trying to deliver the  
stoves and how we can address these  
challenges together to make the system  
smoother for the customer.”  
— VEP Managing Director  
Misinterpretations, assumptions, and  
evaluations of what they saw in the  
visuals were encouraged. This was  
an important part of the ideation  
process, where simple, rough draw-  
ings left space for interpretation and  
allowed the respondents to fill it with  
their own needs and wishes. The core  
activity within the ideation process,  
as any service designer would know,  
is not to confirm ideas generated  
by “designer geniuses,” but really to  
co-create together with the users.  
Ideas and innovations have no value  
on their own unless the ideas meet the  
needs of the user.  
Thanks to the iterative ­ process  
of interviews and ideation, we could  
both co-define the challenges connect-  
ed to adopting improved cookstoves  
and co-create the solutions together  
with the end users.  
Some of the challenges for the end  
users were hands-on practicalities,  
such as the logistics of getting the new  
fuel and stoves to their homes. Others  
faced challenges in lack of support  
during the crucial startup phase, where  
their new habits are beginning to be  
formed. It was also difficult for the  
end users to compare and evaluate

“Starting from the customer journey

and friends, the distributors, NGOs,  
and even the government – fits into the  
system and how we can collaborate to  
improve the user experience.”  
— SNV program officer  
The CJM as a communication  
tool for stakeholders  
The user’s experience of acquiring  
and using an improved cookstove was  
summarized and visualized in a cus-  
tomer journey map. This map showed  
bottlenecks and thresholds for achieving  
widespread adoption of improved cook-  
stoves. We used the map in a stakehold-  
er workshop as a base for sorting out  
roles and relations between stakehold-  
ers. It proved to be a crucial commu-  
nication tool, as it created a common  
understanding with the end user’s needs  
and experience as the unifying focus.  
Based on the outcomes from this  
case we were invited to apply the same  
methods for a cookstove company  
working in Zambia in spring 2016.

# REDUCING UNCERTAINTY  
COMMENT  
“One of the key  
challenges in service  
prototyping is the  
constant interplay  
between prototyping of  
single touchpoints vs.  
consistent and iterative  
development of holistic  
service experiences.”  
—  
Johan Blomkvist  
In service design, prototyping is used to explore,  
­ evaluate, and communicate how people might behave  
in or experience a future service situation. Prototyping  
helps the design team to\:  
→ Quickly identify important aspects of a new service  
concept and explore ­ different alternative solutions.  
→ Systematically evaluate which solutions might work  
in our everyday reality.  
→ Effectively create a shared understanding of  
initial ideas and ­ concepts, enhancing commu-  
nication, collaboration, and participation of  
­ interdisciplinary stakeholders.  
Prototyping is an essential activity to reduce risk and  
uncertainty as early and as cheaply as possible, to improve  
the quality of your final deliverable, and to eventually  
implement your project successfully. Usually prototyping  
is done after some initial research and ideation in a service  
design project, but it can also be used to kick off a project,  
especially when working on ­ existing products. Prototyping  
activities often uncover new questions and send the team  
back to research or ideation, which leads to even more  
options you might decide to prototype and test.  
By turning your ideas into prototypes and ­ testing  
them with real customers and stakeholders in ­ realistic  
contexts, you keep your personal biases01 in check.  
Through prototyping you produce work which is  
­ grounded in reality, not in assumptions and opinions.  
Practically, over the course of a whole service design  
project you will use a wide range of methods, from  
quick-and-dirty prototyping to simulating and testing  
close-to-reality prototypes that deliver solid and valid  
\(market\) data. Prototyping is a structured but in itself  
iterative process. It often starts with exploring a simple  
idea or question and leads to iterating ­ between working  
on specific parts of the service and exploring the effects of  
those changes on holistic end-to-end experiences.  
Service prototyping uses walkthroughs, theatrical  
­ rehearsals, or process simulations as well as traditional  
model making and testing techniques from a wide range  
of disciplines. While the scope of prototyping in ­ service  
design might vary, it should always balance holistic  
perspectives across multiple steps with a detailed focus on  
single touchpoints or experiences. You employ ethno-  
graphic research methods to evaluate and make sense  
of the gathered data. In many ways – especially when  
used for explorative and validating purposes – service  
prototyping can be seen as research focused on future  
service situations.  
01 As we are now working in solution space, we – the proud creators of a service concept or solution – are  
especially prone to confirmation bias. In other words, we want our babies to succeed. So, our assumptions and  
estimations about how our ideas will perform when implemented will most certainly be much too optimistic.  
Be mindful of this bias, especially when creating tests for your prototypes. Always try to really break your pro-  
totypes. Remember\: if you do not break them, your clients will \(or the board will during the final presentation\). 07 Prototyping

# SERVICE PROTOTYPING  
EXPERT TIP  
“Don’t underestimate  
the energy factor in  
prototyping. It is highly  
stimulating to create  
tangible artifacts and to  
see quick results. It opens  
up stimulating conversa-  
tions; it creates passion,  
pride, and ownership;  
and it attracts internal  
attention, sometimes  
also external. Prototyping  
pushes a team and an  
organization forward.  
These may look like  
positive side effects,  
but should be seen  
as important ­ reasons  
in themselves.”  
—  
Kristina Carlander  
Introducing an actionable framework for  
service prototyping  
Compared to prototyping in other \(design\) disciplines,  
the prototyping of services or product experiences is  
more holistic. It starts with the wider context of how  
­ services and physical or digital products01 are expe-  
rienced and used, but also encompasses traditional  
prototyping work on key assets like \(physical\) products,  
software, architecture, or actual content, making it more  
complex to work with. This chapter presents an actionable  
framework for service prototyping in practice.  
Just like any other core activity of the service  
design process, prototyping02 can benefit from a clearly  
­ articulated design. Even though not every prototyping  
activity needs extensive planning, the following frame-  
work might help you to achieve richer results with fewer  
resources. It doesn’t need to be followed step by step,  
but provides a collection of useful principles that you can  
apply to your prototyping efforts.  
01 02 The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In academia,  
products are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually bundles of services and  
physical/digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as referring to something tangible, we prefer to  
speak of physical/digital products. Read more on this in the textbox Service-dominant logic in 2.5.  
Interestingly, the process of service prototyping also works nicely for other forms of prototyping. One reason is  
that a service prototype often contains physical or digital products as props or architecture for its stage. So, to  
create a full-service prototype we also need to include all other forms of prototyping.  
7.1.1  
Decide on the purpose  
Your first step in prototyping is to clarify your purpose\:  
Why you are prototyping and what you want to achieve.  
There are three main reasons why prototyping is used in  
service design\: to explore, to evaluate, and to commu-  
nicate.03 Be aware that this is not a strict distinction and  
often the activities can be mixed – to some degree even  
within a single prototyping session.  
Prototyping to explore  
Explorative prototyping \(or prototyping to explore\) is  
used to create new options and new future solutions  
03 See Blomkvist, J., & Holmlid, S. \(2010\). “Service Prototyping According to Service Design Practitioners.”  
In Proceedings of the Service Design and Innovation Conference \(pp. 1–11\). Linköping University Electronic Press.  
Interestingly, this research also showed a lack of shared concepts and language in service prototyping. So, when  
you talk to colleagues, do not assume but ask about what they are actually doing and why they are doing it.

“We use prototyping  
sessions instead of  
traditional idea genera-  
tion on sticky notes when  
we start working with  
highly interdisciplinary  
teams. Every one of them  
has their own specialist  
jargon and this leads to  
many misunderstandings.  
Prototyping is the univer-  
sal language that helps  
them to understand each  
other much faster.”  
— Francesca Terzi  
07 Prototyping  
based on a given initial service concept or idea \(or a  
previous prototype\). Think of it as a form of ideation,  
or “thinking with your hands.” You learn more about the  
opportunities and the challenges of the solution space.  
Explorative prototyping is mostly done for ­ yourself or  
the core project team.04 Prototypes are created in ­ parallel  
to quickly compare different options and ­ perspectives.  
Explicitly, they are built to be thrown away, so you might  
want to use prototyping materials or platforms that are  
geared toward creating prototypes fast. Early in the ­ process,  
these are typically things you have lying around your  
workspace already. Explorative prototyping creates many  
insights, new questions, and hypotheses about how a future  
­ service might create value, might work, or might feel.05  
Prototyping to evaluate  
Evaluative prototyping is used to understand how people  
experience the future that our prototyping suggests.  
Sometimes you will carefully evaluate your hypothe-  
ses in formal testing, and sometimes you will do more  
lightweight tests on the fly.06 Whether formal or infor-  
mal, ­ evaluative prototyping helps you to converge again,  
to start ­ reducing the number of options you have and  
decide what to focus on. Evaluative prototyping sessions  
are created with a specific set of questions or hypotheses  
04 05 06 This does not mean, however, you cannot or should not include an audience from outside your team \(i.e.,  
customers or other stakeholders\) in the explorative prototyping sessions as co-creators. See for example 6.5.1,  
Case\: Opening the design studio to your customers, for a great example of how to engage with your customers.  
It can also be used as a tool during research to better understand users’ needs or desires using a physical  
representation of their ideas. For example, see Buchenau, M., & Suri, J. F. \(2000\). “Experience Prototyping.” In  
Proceedings of the 3rd Conference on Designing Interactive Systems\: Processes, Practices, Methods, and Techniques  
\(pp. 424–433\). ACM.  
Note that a prototype itself can be seen as an implicit way of expressing a hypothesis which is otherwise hard to  
articulate. The prototype is the hypothesis.  
212/213  
in mind that need to be tested. Prototypes are often built  
for potential customers or other carefully selected stake-  
holders from outside the team. 07  
During formal evaluative prototyping, you strive  
to create prototypes that mimic aspects of reality as  
closely as possible. If you are interested in the emotional  
responses to a service \(or part of a service\), you must let  
the customers experience it. For the evaluation part, this  
form of prototyping is heavily supported by qualitative  
research and analysis methods that can provide some  
hard facts and metrics, such as contextual and in-depth  
interviews as well as various forms of observation.  
Prototyping to communicate and present  
Communicative prototyping is used to communicate  
important aspects of your project to selected audiences.  
Specifically tailored prototypes and prototyping activities  
help you to reduce misunderstandings and ignite mean-  
ingful discussions around the key design questions with-  
in the team or organization, or with other stakeholders.  
This facilitates collaboration, supports decision making,  
and reduces friction in your project right from the start.  
Different personal perspectives and potential conflicts  
become clearly visible and can be openly addressed. In  
addition to creating a safe space for experimentation,  
these activities are a great tool for team formation.  
For a wider audience, presentational prototypes  
can be used as props for well-rehearsed storytelling  
07 Note that even early in the process and even with rough, lo-fi prototyping you will still use evaluative  
prototyping. It is used whenever you need to make decisions or have to reduce the number of prototypes you  
want to work on. This is Service Design Doing

presentations. In those cases there is little to no interac-  
tivity of the audience with the prototype.02 The prototypes  
are adapted from previous prototyping activities and are  
usually quite polished. Used with care, ­ presentational  
prototypes are a valuable strategic tool to present,  
­ persuade, and inspire management or key stakeholders.  
7.1.2  
Decide on your prototyping questions  
At each iteration, you need to clearly state what you want  
to learn or achieve through your prototyping activities by  
formulating one or many prototyping questions. Think  
about these prototyping questions as the research ques-  
tions03 of the prototyping stage. In our prototyping work,  
we have found value, look and feel, feasibility, and inte-  
gration to be especially helpful perspectives in generating  
initial prototyping questions and focusing on key aspects  
of a service concept during prototyping.04  
As Stephanie Houde and Charles Hill point out,  
“prototypes provide the means for examining design  
problems and evaluating solutions. Selecting the focus of

The presenter usually follows well-prepared steps through the different aspects of a prototype \(e.g., like showing  
precreated click paths through an app prototype\). Some people would refer to this as a demo.  
See 5.1.1, Research scope and research question.  
The model presented here is adapted from Houde, S., & Hill, C. \(1997\). “What Do Prototypes Prototype?”  
Handbook of Human-Computer Interaction, 2, 367–381. It uses a set of high-level perspectives that is tailored  
toward a more general prototyping approach. While we \(the authors\) have found using it to be quite insightful  
in most of our own projects, we are aware that these perspectives certainly are not the only ones you could use.  
For example, another widespread set is people-­ business-technology, which might work for some.

a prototype is the art of identifying the most important  
open design questions.”05 By formulating one or many  
prototyping questions you make sure that your team \(and  
your potential client\) have a common prototyping aim.  
Start with a value prototype  
Value prototypes are often a great start. Usually it is  
easier to find a suitable technology or business mod-  
el if you already have a strong value proposition than  
the other way around. Be aware that look-and-feel and  
especially technical feasibility prototypes can take a lot of  
time and effort to create. This is easily wasted if the value  
proposition is still changing rapidly. You can spend a lot  
of effort and money creating a great look and feel, but  
if you don’t build it on top of a solid value proposition  
that is backed by research or prototyping, you are very  
likely to burn money.  
Assess idea and project context  
Keep in mind that your actual starting point always  
­ depends on your individual project. In the fashion indus-  
try, look-and-feel prototyping will get more focus than  
in B2B business consulting, where there is a stronger  
focus on value. In projects where a specific technology  
stack has to be used, feasibility prototypes should be  
given a higher priority as they define the playing ground  
for many solutions. Your decision will also depend on  
whether the project needs to deliver immediate results or  
is used to explore innovative future solutions as inspira-  
tions for future developments – like concept cars in the  
automotive industry. 07 Prototyping

VALUABLE PERSPECTIVES TO IDENTIFY  
PROTOTYPING QUESTIONS  
START HERE  
VALUE  
HOW DO WE CREATE VALUE?  
What can this future service do for the customer?  
What kind of needs and pain points do we address?  
How will our service eventually fit into the  
bigger context of our customers’ or stakeholders’ lives?  
HOW DO WE MAKE IT WORK?  
What does our organization need to do to deliver this service?  
What are the requirements for scalability and performance?  
Is there a business model?  
Is it feasible technically, financially, legally?  
INTEGRATION  
WHAT DOES IT LOOK AND FEEL LIKE?  
What does the service as a whole or in part look like?  
Who do we interact with and how does it feel?  
What are the physical or digital objects we interact  
with and how does this feel?  
FEASIBILITY  
LOOK & FEEL  
HOW DOES IT ALL WORK TOGETHER?  
What is the whole customer experience when we bring  
together value, look and feel, and implementation?  
How do the different aspects of the service work together?  
How do we need to balance and resolve constraints?  
Iterate  
As you move forward, iterate between value, look and  
feel, and feasibility on one side and integration proto-  
types on the other to make sure you are not wasting  
time and effort on concepts that might not work in the  
implementation context. Identify dependencies between  
the different aspects early and learn how to integrate  
them into your design. Staying with value prototypes  
for too long tends to result in concepts that are hard to  
implement – which makes it challenging for short-term  
projects. On the other hand, this might be spot on when  
you are looking for inspirational concepts as a guidance  
for future work. This is Service Design Doing

Assess what to make or build  
It can be helpful to first assess which parts of your future  
services and physical or digital products you actually need  
to make or build in order to get the answers you need, and  
then get concrete. Future-state journeys of customers or  
key stakeholders are a great first step.01 Often, this allows  
you to break your prototyping challenge down to a mix of  
the following major components\:

\(Inter\)actions, service processes, experiences

Ecosystems, \(business\) value  
01 Note that your chosen scope can be frontstage as well as backstage. Usually you would start by looking at the  
journeys of customers and frontstage staff, but this can and should be extended to other key stakeholders  
depending on your specific purpose and prototyping questions.  
For some prototyping questions this can be straightfor-  
ward. If for example you are working on a new home  
automation system, your questions about hardware  
and software might suggest that you build a functional  
prototype of a piece of software together with a physical  
prototype of an internet-enabled gadget.  
However, more complex questions – for example,  
whether your home automation service actually creates  
a meaningful value for your customers and makes them  
happier people – cannot be answered directly.  
In this context, experiences with services or ­ products,  
whether physical or digital, can be likened to an \(interac-  
tive\) theater play. While theatermakers cannot design the  
emotions of an audience directly, there are things they can  
do. They can create a compelling story, write gripping  
dialogue, create great costumes and stage design, develop  
systems and technologies for special ­ effects, and rehearse  
with actors and staff \(front- and backstage\). They can keep 07 Prototyping

# Experiential aspects\:  
# Getting concrete  
You will find that breaking down ­ complex concepts into simple but concrete questions like Who? What? Where?  
When? and How? makes them much easier for people to understand and relate to – and helps you to identify  
what you need to build or make tangible through your prototyping activities.02 Consider the following\:  
→ Scope and scale\: Which part of  
the overall journey do you need  
to look at \(i.e., which detail and in  
which time frame\)?  
→ Actors\: Who are the main actors or  
stakeholders you choose to look at?  
Who can you influence?  
→ \(Inter\)actions, process, ­ activities\:  
What is happening across the  
whole journey? What is happening  
at a specific step? What are the  
\(inter\)actions with other actors,  
objects, or the environment?  
→ Stage – interior design, archi-  
tecture, \(sensory\) environment\:  
What is your stage? What does  
the “stage” look like? What is the  
spatial layout? What is the archi-  
tecture like? What are the ambient  
conditions as perceived with your  
five senses? What does it smell  
like? How is the lighting?  
→ Props – physical objects or  
­ artifacts\: What physical objects  
are involved, actively handled,  
or merely present? What role  
do they play? What signs and  
symbols are used?  
→ Props – interactive digital or  
electronic objects or artifacts\:  
What digital objects \(or software\)  
are involved, actively handled, or  
merely present?  
→ Visible content or topics\: What  
do people talk or think about? Is  
there specific content visible as  
part of ­ other artifacts \(e.g., in an  
app, a brochure, etc.\)?  
→ Location and geographical  
context\: Where is your stage  
located? What are the other places  
involved? Think about different  
geographies or markets.  
→ Temporal context\: When does  
this happen? In summer? In  
winter? At the start of a business  
day? At the end of it? At the  
beginning of a customer relation-  
ship or at the end?  
→ Quantities\: How much? How  
many? How many people are  
there? How large or small are  
things? How many products are  
in your lineup? How many con-  
sulting sessions do you plan for?  
How much is the merchandise? ◀  
02 Note that the experiential aspects of an idea or concept are closely related  
but not limited to the concept of physical evidences \(see textbox Physical  
evidences in 3.5\). The experiential aspects go beyond physical or digital  
artifacts and also include interactions, processes, and activities as well as  
other aspects that can be experienced directly by an audience using suitable  
prototyping/simulation methods. This is Service Design Doing  
doing this until they can deliver an engaging interaction  
that evokes the emotional response and creates the value  
they are striving for in both the actors and their audience.  
Prototyping tackles the same challenge with the same  
basic approach. We cannot design the actual experiences  
of our future services and physical or digital products  
directly, but we can design and prototype many concrete  
aspects around them to gather valuable feedback and  
other data from the people involved.  
However, since it is usually impossible to prototype  
every aspect, you will need to make a decision about  
which aspects are most important. One way to do this is  
to use a prototyping portfolio \(based on an idea portfolio\)  
to discuss and prioritize the parts and elements of your  
service that you want to explore, evaluate, or communi-  
cate through prototyping.01  
EXPERT TIP  
“Prototyping is serious  
business, that should be  
used systematically and  
may require a notable  
amount of planning. But  
don’t forget the ability  
to quickly create lo-fi  
­ prototypes of your ideas,  
also in later stages.  
You will learn a lot just  
by taking a step from  
thinking to doing. If you  
get stuck in a discussion,  
a simple role-play \(acting  
out the problem\) may in  
that moment suggest  
the solution you need.  
And that role-play is also  
a prototype others can  
react to. Nurture a proto-  
typing culture!”

Planning prototyping  
When planning your prototyping activities, you should  
think of the ways that are most likely to give you fruitful  
­ answers for your proposed design questions within your  
chosen purpose and goals. Just like anything else you do,  
prototyping activities must fit within certain ­ business  
constraints, as you always have to consider how to best al-  
locate time, money, and human resources within a project.  
Specifically, prototyping planning includes ­ decisions about  
01 See Idea portfolio in 6.4. Useful dimensions for an efficient prototyping portfolio are complexity \(“How hard is it  
to actually implement or test this aspect of the service?”\) and importance \(“How important in the overall context  
of your service concept is it to get this aspect right?”\).  
audience, authors, fidelity, context, prototyping loops,  
multitracking, and method selection. We’ll explore them  
further here.02  
Audience  
Like in research, you have to think about your sample\:03  
Who will be experiencing or testing your prototypes?  
Who do you want to observe? Who should participate in  
your prototyping sessions and how do you select them?  
These questions are critical for the reliability of what you  
are going to learn during prototyping and how valid the  
results will be. Use stakeholder mapping to get a clear  
picture about the sampling strategy for your prototyp-  
ing activities.04  
In prototyping you will typically move between  
different groups of stakeholders acting as your audience\:  
e.g., members of your project team, colleagues, current  
staff, internal/external experts, clients, \(potential\) users,  
customers, and future staff.05 As a rule of thumb, the clos-  
er people are to the project team the easier \(and faster\)  
it gets to recruit them for your prototyping sessions.  
However, you will find stronger bias in those groups than  
with people from outside. Of course, your goal should  
always be to show your prototype to actual users and  
customers as soon as possible.06  
02 03 04 05 Please note that you do not have to work through those aspects in the order presented here,  
or in any other particular sequence. This is more like a checklist to help you ask the right questions  
when planning prototyping activities.  
See Sample selection in 5.1.2 to learn more about sampling and the different strategies you can use there.  
Also see Stakeholder maps and Ideas from system mapping in 6.4 Ideation methods.

07 Prototyping  
Roles in the team  
While the audience has a huge impact on the outcome  
of the prototyping activity, so too do the people who  
drive the prototyping process, who prepare and build the  
prototypes, run the sessions, and observe the reactions  
of the chosen audience.07 Typical roles in prototyping  
activities include\:  
→ Concept owner\: The concept owner is the ­ person  
who came up with the concept you are prototyping.  
→ Writer or \(model\) maker\: The writer scripts or  
­ sketches out a starting point for the experiences,  
\(inter\)actions, or scenarios that you are going to  
prototype. The \(model\) maker builds all necessary  
\(physical and digital\) props, sets, and stages for the  
prototyping session.08  
→ Facilitator\: The facilitator is responsible for the  
process and guides the selected audience through a  
prototyping session.09  
06 07 08 09 Or in the words of Hazel White\: “Show your prototypes to the people who will use the service – they’ll add to  
them, turn them upside down, tear them apart, and challenge your assumptions. Listen.”  
Prototyping might never stop. In a running service, needs, systems, and access to resources are changing  
constantly – so it’s valuable to ask yourself early on how you can involve the people who will be responsible for  
running and adapting the future service. See 7.3.3, Case\: Enabling staff and stakeholders to prototype for continu-  
ous evolution, for an example of how to enable staff to take over the prototyping and design process, without the  
need for a skilled designer or any special tools.  
Possible starting points are an exposé \(text\), sketching up a sh!tty first draft of a storyboard \(visualization\),  
defining a set of rules for the improvisation game \(guidelines/ruleset\), or filming part of a desktop walkthrough  
\(hands-on simulation documented on film\).  
Because the facilitator’s involvement can actively influence the audience, it’s important to be as neutral  
as possible when acting as the facilitator. See Chapter 10, Facilitating workshops, for more on different  
kinds of neutrality.  
218/219  
→ Actors and operators\: Actors and operators ­ assist  
the facilitator in creating an experience during the  
­ prototyping session. This involves people acting as  
staff or other customers during service simulations,  
or ­ manually operating an interface that is tested.  
When preparing your prototyping sessions, always  
ask yourself\: Who will be taking on which role  
during the prototyping process? What are the biases  
and motivations each person brings to the table?  
→ Researcher\: The researcher independently observes  
the audience during the prototyping ses-  
sion and ­ records her insights.  
→ Subject matter experts and key stakeholders\:  
Subject matter experts and key stakeholders com-  
plete the prototyping team, adding special skills  
and in-depth knowledge about the subject matter  
and target contexts suggested by scope and proto-  
typing questions.  
Note that especially early in the project, one person  
can be concept owner, maker, facilitator, and researcher  
all rolled into one. Later, when you have a clearer picture  
of your service concept, you might make the decision to  
involve specialists for each necessary craft or discipline  
\(e.g., model makers, UX specialists, experience directors,  
ethnographers, etc.\).  
Always be aware of your role, bias, and associated  
­ influence on the audience at every step of the prototyp-  
ing process. For example, concept owners and makers This is Service Design Doing  
# Wishlists and  
# hostages  
BY JOHAN BLOMKVIST  
Note that some people might see your  
­ prototypes as wishlists \(“an opportuni-  
ty to push my ideas and agenda into the  
project”\) or even as hostages \(“if I put this  
in the ­ prototype they’ll have to include it  
in the result”\).  
In order to avoid unrelated agendas  
interfering, be specific about the purpose and  
extent to which the prototyping session will  
influence the project as a whole and the  
role/function of the prototype. Then capture  
participants’ ideas and put them into your  
idea portfolio to be prioritized and checked  
against research and other ideas and concepts  
at the next ­ iteration planning session. ◀  
often want their concept to survive – consciously or  
unconsciously – because they have already invested some  
time into the concept or prototype. This obviously has  
an influence on the audience, and the results become  
biased.01 One way to tackle this prototyper bias is to be  
open about your role and acknowledge that there is a  
bias. This lets you consciously put down your concept  
owner or maker hat and take a more objective position.  
Other options include inviting an independent facilitator  
or researcher for your testing sessions, or changing roles  
within the existing team between iterations.  
Fidelity  
Decide how refined your prototype needs to be. What  
level of detail is needed? What resolution does it make  
sense to achieve for your given scope and research  
question? How much effort do you need or want to put  
into this prototype? The question of fidelity is closely  
connected to the economic principle of prototyping by  
Lim, Stolterman, and Tenenberg\: “The best prototype is  
one that, in the simplest and most efficient way, makes  
the possibilities and limitations of a design idea visible  
and measurable.”02  
The economic principle seems to suggest starting  
with low-fidelity prototypes like paper or cardboard pro-  
totypes and then gradually increasing the level of detail  
as you get closer and closer to implementation. However,  
01 02 This very much relates to the problem of researcher bias. See Researcher triangulation in 5.1.3.

Alexander Osterwalder  
the world is slightly more complex than simply dividing  
the prototyping world into lo-fi or hi-fi.  
While fidelity is often connected with visual fidelity  
\(look and feel\), you can also talk about fidelity in other  
dimensions, like fidelity of the implementation.03 You can  
even find those different levels within one single proto-  
type. The prototype of a website can be low fidelity with  
respect to look and feel, but quite high fidelity with  
respect to content or information structure. Hence, try  
to be specific about which parts of your prototype are  
really needed at which level of fidelity. This will help you  
manage your prototyping resources efficiently. It also is a  
great tool to guide the attention of your audience.  
It is important to understand that the fidelity of  
your prototype has an impact on the quality and type of  
feedback you get from your test audience. Low-fidelity  
prototypes tend to inspire more open discussions while  
high-fidelity prototypes seem to lead the discussion  
more to the details of a concept because the prototype  
looks finished – and therefore decided.  
03 See 7.3.4, Case\: Minimum lovable products, living prototypes, and high-fidelity sketching in code, for an example  
of how to use sketching with code in a service design project.  
Low-fidelity prototypes usually allow you to work  
blazingly fast. However, if you put too much emphasis  
on speed and low fidelity, your prototypes become  
meaningless. Try to find the sweet spot – the lowest  
meaningful fidelity at any given time – and move to high  
fidelity when you really need it.  
220/221  
The right fidelity for your prototype also depends on  
where you are in the process and what your purpose is.  
Earlier in the process, especially during explorative proto-  
typing you would lean toward lower fidelity, while later in  
the process or during evaluative and communicative pro-  
totyping you usually lean toward higher fidelity. However,  
this needs to be reassessed for each project on an individ-  
ual basis. Value prototypes like a service advertisement –  
which can be done quite early in the process – can already  
show high fidelity in a few essential perspectives \(e.g., the  
value propositions\), even though the rest of the business  
model is still quite raw.  
In any case, always make sure the fidelity fits your au-  
dience. For example, people new to prototyping approach-  
es usually need higher-fidelity prototypes together with  
clear guidance on purpose and scope. On the other hand,  
also make sure you are not over-promising. High-fidelity  
prototypes often are perceived as “­ finished” even if the  
underlying concept is still raw and ­ basically untested.  
Prototyping context  
Choose the environment and context in which you  
run your prototyping sessions carefully. There are two  
major approaches\:  
→ Contextual prototyping\: Contextual prototyping  
­ happens where the final service or product, whether  
physical or digital, would be used or be produced –  
for example, in the actual shop, tourism destination,  
or in one of your own offices where you run your  
consulting practice. By doing the prototyping session This is Service Design Doing  
DIFFERENT FLAVORS  
OF FIDELITY  
Fidelity comes in different flavors depending on what you are prototyping. While it is  
often connected with visual fidelity \(look and feel\), you can also talk about fidelity in

“Even if you have only a  
­ limited budget, do your  
best to stretch the  
scope to allow at least a  
few iterations, to make  
use of the learnings from  
the prototyping. It is  
better to make a few less  
ambitious prototypes  
than a bigger one-  
shot prototype.”

in context you can very efficiently assess whether  
or not a prototyped solution is a fit for that context  
or not. You also ­ quickly learn what might work  
and, especially, what might not work. Just as in  
contextual research \(e.g., contextual interviews,  
participant and non-participant observations, work-  
alongs, self-ethnography, etc.\), you get a much better  
feel for the nuances that are needed to implement a  
working solution.01  
→ Lab prototyping\: Lab prototyping is done ­ within  
the safe confines of a lab environment or any place  
that is out of context. Choose lab prototyping when  
the real context is not available to you, does not  
­ allow any changes, does not exist yet, or simply is  
too expensive to use.  
It is important to note that context can include not only  
the space or location but also the time when you are  
prototyping, the availability of key resources, or even  
environmental conditions. For example, prototyping new  
hospitality services for a winter sport destination in winter  
can be contextual, while to test the same activities in  
summer you will have to fall back on lab prototyping.  
As a rule of thumb, the closer your prototyping  
environment and contexts are to the intended implemen-  
tation contexts, the more reliable feedback you will get  
during evaluative prototyping. Similarly, during explor-  
ative prototyping, ideas generated in similar contexts  
See 7.3.1, Case\: Enabling effective co-creation through prototyping minimum viable solutions and contextual  
mock-ups, for an example of simulating workflows in day-to-day working environments.  
01 222/223  
tend to be more transferable from the prototype to the  
intended implementation context.02  
Prototyping loops  
Always plan prototyping as an iterative process with a  
sequence of prototyping loops. Each loop should have  
a clear purpose; a clear set of prototyping questions; and  
include \(a\) building or preparing a prototype, \(b\) running  
the prototyping session, as well as \(c\) at least a ­ simple  
form of data synthesis and analysis. The first loops are  
often explorative and might only take a couple of hours  
or a day. Use them to open up and create a shared un-  
derstanding of the opportunity space. After those first  
loops, you might want to validate the proposed value  
propositions before eventually moving toward system-  
atically exploring and validating the different aspects  
and dimensions of the selected concepts further and  
further. Continually check whether the chosen methods  
deliver meaningful results and whether your hypoth-  
esis or research questions for the prototyping stage  
need adjustments.  
Depending on the skill set of your prototyping  
teams, you might have to involve specialists and split  
the work into separate work streams to achieve higher  
fidelity – for example, UX designers working on im-  
proving an existing app, service designers prototyping  
human-to-human interactions or required business  
processes, and an ­ architect redesigning the office space.  
Even though they will work at different iteration speeds,

COMMENT  
“Just as there is the-  
oretical saturation in  
design research, there  
is practical saturation in  
prototyping. Prototyping  
is great to help us under-  
stand by doing. At each  
iteration, you pivot into a  
new version by integrating  
the learnings of the previ-  
ous version of the proto-  
type. However, when any  
new learnings or insights  
have no significant or  
meaningful impact on  
the next version of your  
prototype anymore, you  
have effectively reached  
practical saturation. You  
are now ready to move on  
to the next phase on your  
service design journey.”  
— Carola Verschoor  
it is still important to plan in regular sessions \(e.g.,  
weekly or biweekly\) to give feedback and to adjust the  
prototyping plan. Depending on the complexity of your  
prototypes, you might also want to consider establishing  
a first sprint-like structure.01  
Keep iterating between the details of a single  
\(­ inter\)action, object, or app and the wider picture of the  
­ end-to-end experience.  
Multitracking  
Decide how many prototypes you want to work on in any  
given segment. Multitracking your efforts helps you to  
reduce risk by not putting all your eggs into one basket.  
It also allows you to strategically manage uncertainty in  
your concept portfolio and expectations of stakeholders\:  
→ How many of the prototypes seem to be  
in reach for a quick win?  
→ How many of them seem to have  
­ potential mid/long term?  
→ How many of them are lined up for a  
­ disruptive breakthrough?  
→ How many of them are a  
shot from the hip?02  
Also, decide whether you want to have different teams  
working on individual prototypes or have one team se-  
quentially work through them.  
See 9.5.2 Case\: Managing strategic design projects for an example of how to adopt agile methodologies like sprint  
structures in a service design project.  
Out-field prototypes which are thought to have a low chance of success but which help teams think bigger are  
often called “dark horse” prototypes.  
01 02 The prototyping stage consists of a number of  
­ exploratory or evaluative prototyping sessions that can  
be lined up in parallel or in sequence. At certain points,  
you might add communicative prototypes to involve  
external stakeholders.  
Method selection  
Reflect on your chosen scope \(including which elements  
of the service need to be prototyped\), fidelity, and target  
context and choose the methods for your prototyping  
activities accordingly.  
A helpful starting point is to do a quick assessment of  
the resources you have at your disposal. Before spending  
too much effort on creating complex prototypes, you might  
want to do some quick desk research03 to find ­ existing  
prototypes or research on similar questions or an appro-  
priate prototyping platform you can ­ leverage. Are there  
any elements you can simply reuse? Ask your Innovation  
department if they have ­ already done something similar.  
Desk research might quickly reveal similar services  
or products, whether physical or digital, which you can  
use as a basis to create your own prototypes so you do  
not have to start from scratch.  
When you are selecting the “right” prototyping  
methods – ones that give you a lot of useful data, support  
your decisions, or communicate the concept well – you  
always face the question of how many methods you  
should use. Given a limited budget, you need to decide  
whether you should put all your budget into one method

EXPERT TIP  
“It is easy to like a pro-  
totype, even a mediocre  
prototype of a medio-  
cre idea, as long as it  
addresses and solves  
an important problem in  
some way. It is therefore  
valuable to challenge one  
prototype with another, to  
make sure to get the best  
ideas. Therefore, make  
different prototypes,  
representing different  
ideas or directions of your  
idea. It is often valu-  
able to stretch different  
directions to extremes  
\(more or less\), to provoke  
and learn rapidly. This  
is mostly relevant in  
early stages, where lo-fi  
prototypes are cheap  
to do and test.”

and do this rather well, or distribute our budget to use  
a variety of prototyping methods. Just like in research,  
you should also apply the concept of method triangula-  
tion during prototyping.04  
As a rule of thumb, you might want to consider to  
including at least one method from each of the follow-  
ing categories\:  
→ An experience prototyping approach to validate  
the core value proposition.  
04 Also see Method triangulation in 5.1.3.  
→ Some methods that allow the exploration  
and assessment of a holistic/end-to-end perspective  
on the service, like desktop walk-  
throughs, contextual walkthroughs, Business  
Model Canvases, Business Origami, minimum  
viable services/products or service simula-  
tions, and so on.

“Make sure you do not

Prototyping should be  
future oriented rather

—  
Johan Blomkvist  
Running prototyping sessions  
Prototyping methods share an underlying common  
structure. Any prototyping method can be broken up  
into the following three core activities\:  
→ Preparation\: Prepare prototypes through setting  
up templates or canvases, scripting and practicing  
an intended interaction or walkthrough, mak-  
ing physical models, building stages/sets, and/or  
­ preparing environments.  
→ Use\: Use the prepared objects and practiced  
activities to explore, evaluate, or communicate a  
design concept.  
→ Research\: Use research methods while running  
the use scenarios to capture feedback, data and  
­ generate insights.  
Take, for example, the prototyping of the in-store experi-  
ence of a retail store. To prepare, you might need to create  
a first sketch of the intended customer journey, consider  
your roles, practice the key scenes, set up the stage, and  
create a handful of key props \(like an app prototype, some  
mock-up advertising posters, or a new checkout desk made  
of foamcore\). You then use the setup to test the resulting  
experience \(e.g., the checkout process\). By using research  
methods like observation and interviews with the partici-  
pants of your prototyping sessions you can collect a lot of  
data and capture and generate valuable insights.  
It is important to understand that prototyping is not  
just about creating a prototype.01 Rather, the creation of  
prototypes is only the starting point, which allows us to  
focus on using and testing prototypes and learning from  
them.  
02 As Michael Schrage \(author of the book Serious  
Play\) says, “the value of prototypes resides less in the mod-  
els themselves than in the interactions they invite.”03 In this  
sense, prototyping indeed is research into future situations.  
01 02 03 This is why some people refer to the creation of a prototype as model making to make a clear distinction. It is only  
after you have used the model and learned from it that it becomes a real prototype.  
See 7.3.6, Case\: Using multifaceted prototyping to create and iterate business and service models, for an example of  
how learning from ongoing prototyping activities might allow you to gain confidence in a business model that  
others might consider radical.

# Two types of service prototyping\:  
# Direct experience vs. indirect imagination  
“  
 When we use the term ‘experience prototyping’ we are talking about  
methods that allow designers, clients, or users to ‘experience it themselves,’  
rather than witnessing a demonstration or someone else’s experience.”  
—  
Marion Buchenau and Jane Fulton Suri on experience prototyping04  
Experience prototyping  
Experience prototyping \(also called ex-  
perience-like, do-like, interact-like, or  
act-like prototyping\) uses prototypes  
that allow people to act in the way  
they would act – or use the thing they  
would use – in the future service, and  
in that way “experience it themselves.”  
The people might interact with  
low-fidelity versions of environments,  
objects, or other actors. While the  
interaction itself might be low fidelity  
\(e.g., a “fast-forward” or walkthrough\),  
the people still interact essentially in  
the same way, hence provoking a sim-  
ilar experience.  
Experience prototyping is some-  
times also referred to “direct,” “experi-  
ential,” or “embodied” prototyping.  
Imagine-like prototyping  
Imagine-like prototyping uses proto-  
types that only help us to rationally  
think through, imagine, or empathize  
with the intended \(inter\)action \(it  
“scaffolds our thinking”\). It is used  
when the actual interaction is not pos-  
sible to do or not accessible. Here the  
interaction itself is different than in the  
future service. Imagine-like prototyp-  
ing includes sketches and customer  
journey maps, as well as metaphorical  
simulations \(e.g., during a role-play  
replacing an app interface with a real  
person doing the same job\).  
Imagine-like ­ prototyping might  
also be referred to as “indirect,”  
“empathic,” or “disembodied”  
prototyping. ◀

7.1.6  
Data synthesis and analysis  
Running prototyping sessions generates a lot of data,  
insights, and new ideas about the future service. So,  
as a next step you need to synthesize and analyze that  
prototyping data \(sensemaking\). As prototyping can be  
interpreted as research into future service situations, the  
synthesis and analysis process in prototyping is techni-  
cally the same as the synthesis and analysis process that  
was covered in Chapter 5, Research.  
01  
7.1.7  
Visualizing prototyping data  
There are many ways to present your prototyping data,  
and once again what makes sense depends on your  
aim. Luckily, all the ways to capture research data  
in service design are also applicable for prototyping  
data. They include\:02

See Visualizing data in 5.1.4  
Additionally, since you are now essentially working  
in solution space, there are two more tools that are  
­ especially useful\:  
→  
 Idea wall/portfolio\: To get a quick overview of  
new concepts and ideas to be prioritized and lined  
up for prototyping and testing  
→ The prototypes themselves\: To make the  
future service experience tangible, and replace  
tedious verbal documentation  
Again, it is important to consider the target audience  
for your visualization\: Do you need something rather  
formal and self-explanatory so your outcomes can be  
used in different departments or organizations? Or are  
your outcomes only needed for your internal team? Any  
­ prototyping outcome that you need to communicate  
beyond your own team needs more polish. 07 Prototyping

# Dealing with failure of  
# prototypes and critique  
BY KRISTINA CARLANDER  
Is a failed prototype a failure? I would say  
no. Sometimes a prototype brings to light  
legal, ethical, or other barriers that should  
stop a concept that seems to be good in  
theory. Embrace the fact that the barriers  
have now been discovered much faster  
and more cheaply than they would have  
been through any “thinking/talking/in-  
vestigating” process. And all the learnings  
you have made are far from wasted.  
But even when you consider the pro-  
totype a success, prepare to be criticized –  
especially if you work in an environment  
where prototyping is not everyone’s nor-  
mal way of working. No matter how much  
you emphasize that “this is just a proto-  
type,” you may get comments such as “Is  
it really going to look like that?” or “Have  
you not thought of X?” Just be patient,  
welcome the feedback, and make sure you  
have a chance to come back and show a  
new version, proving that prototyping is a  
very powerful tool to get quick results. ◀ This is Service Design Doing

# 7.2 PROTOTYPING METHODS  
This section provides concise descriptions of a selection  
of methods which allow you to prototype a broad range  
of services or products, whether physical or digital. As  
service design needs to provide a common language  
and support co-creation between different disciplines,  
we have chosen prototyping ­ methods that do not re-  
quire specialist skills. While this might sound limiting  
at first, this selection of methods allows you to push  
almost any concept to the point where you can make  
a safe decision on which experts you actually need to  
involve for which aspects of the project.  
Many more methods exist and should be included in  
the planning and execution of your prototyping activi-  
ties, but many of those require you to invite specialists  
from the respective field of expertise, like change manag-  
ers, product designers, or software developers.  
The prototyping methods selected for this book are  
structured in five categories\:  
→ Prototyping methods for service processes and  
experiences\: Investigative rehearsal, subtext,  
desktop walkthrough  
→ Prototyping methods for physical objects and  
environments\: Cardboard prototyping  
→ Prototyping methods for digital artifacts and  
software\: Rehearsing digital services, paper proto-  
typing, wireframing  
→ Prototyping methods for ecosystems and busi-  
ness value\: Service advertisement, desktop system  
mapping, Business Model Canvas  
→ General methods\: Mood boards, sketching, Wizard  
of Oz approaches01  
There are many variations of and names for each  
prototyping method, and the boundaries between the  
chosen categories might be rather fluid. Often, a specif-  
ic prototyping method can also be adapted to answer  
different prototyping questions. Reflect on your chosen  
scope \(including which elements of the service need to  
be prototyped\), fidelity, and target context and choose  
the methods for your prototyping activities accord-  
ingly. As a rule of thumb, you might want to consider  
including at least a few methods to account for method  
triangulation.02  
01 02 General methods can be used across any of the above categories.

# Investigative rehearsal  
Investigative rehearsal is a theatrical method to deeply  
understand and explore behaviors and processes through  
iterative rehearsal sessions.01  
Based on forum theater, it is a structured, full-body way to clarify  
the emotional side of an experience and reveal many practicalities  
around physical space, language, and tone of voice.02  
Preparation\: Choose and quickly prepare a \(key\) scene as  
a starting point, e.g. from research or from a future-state  
journey map, and create essential props and a stage.  
Use\: Play through the initial scene, repeating and com-  
menting until there is a deeper understanding on a phys-  
ical and motivational level. Only then, change the scene.  
Review the effect of each change and explore alternatives.  
Iterate. Always keep a list of bugs, insights, and ideas.  
Research techniques\: Use-it-yourself \(autoethnogra-  
phy\), participant observation, co-creative workshops  
Expected output\: Research data \(specifically a  
list of bugs, insights, and new ideas\), raw video  
footage and photos  
01 02 Investigative reheasal is based on Forum theater. See, for example, Boal, A. \(2000\). Theater of the Oppressed.  
Pluto Press. Investigative Rehearsal uses participants’ own experiences, ideas, or prototypes as a starting point,  
and goes beyond Forum’s focus on behavioral strategies to also examine and challenge the basic process, the  
architectural setting, support tools, and more.  
See 7.3.5, Case\: Using role-plays and simulations in large-scale 1\:1 prototypes, for an example of how to use simi-  
lar techniques to focus on the feasibility and desirability of the overall service as well as individual elements.  
PROTOTYPING SERVICE PROCESSES  
AND EXPERIENCES  
# Subtext  
Subtext is a theatrical method that can reveal deeper  
motivations and needs by focusing on unspoken thoughts  
in a rehearsal session.03  
We can think of subtext as the unspoken thoughts of a charac-  
ter – it is what we mean, but don’t say. Bringing subtext into a  
rehearsal session can reveal deeper motivations, help us under-  
stand needs, and illuminate new opportunities to create value.  
Preparation\: In an investigative rehearsal, identify a key  
scene. Now, hold the scene at one key statement by a  
customer or employee.  
Use\: Ask, “What would be the subtext of that state-  
ment?” Continue with, “What would be the subtext of  
that subtext?” and repeat. As you go deeper, ask how the  
service could respond at each level.  
Research techniques\: Use-it-yourself \(autoethnogra-  
phy\), participant observation, co-creative workshops  
Expected output\: Research data \(specifically documen-  
tation of the subtext chains, new insights, and ideas\), raw  
video footage and photos  
03 Subtext is a crucial concept in performing arts, and is especially important in the work of Stanislavski and his  
artistic heirs. On stage, the subtext is usually implicit, but in prototyping \(as in some rehearsal techniques and  
improv games\) it becomes explicit, making it easier for the workshop participants to focus on it. For more on  
subtext in theater, see Moore, S. \(1984\). The Stanislavski System\: The Professional Training of an Actor, New  
York\: Penguin Books. For a film where subtext becomes explicit for comedic effect, see Annie Hall \(Woody  
Allen, 1977, MGM\). METHODS 07 Prototyping

# Desktop walkthrough  
Desktop walkthroughs can be seen as interactive mini-theater  
plays that simulate end-to-end customer experiences.04  
Using maps, figurines, and small-scale models of the service  
environment, you test and explore common scenarios and alter-  
natives of a service process or experience.  
Preparation\: Create an overview map for all relevant lo-  
cations. Pick a figurine for each key stakeholder in your  
service and create essential props using paper, cardboard,  
modeling clay, etc. Decide on a story as a starting point.  
Use\: Run through the story using the maps as the  
stage and the figurines as actors. Act out all dialogues  
and interactions with other actors, devices, etc. After  
each runthrough, reflect on what you would like to  
change or try. Always keep a list of bugs, insights, and  
ideas. Then iterate.

PROTOTYPING PHYSICAL OBJECTS  
AND ENVIRONMENTS  
# Cardboard prototyping  
Cardboard prototyping refers to prototyping 3D mock-ups of  
almost any physical object or environment out of cheap paper  
and cardboard.01  
The prototypes – for example, the interior of a shop or a ticket  
machine – can be small scale or actual size. To explore the role  
the objects play in the context of the future service, cardboard  
prototyping is often used together with walkthrough approaches.  
Preparation\: Use simple materials to build the objects.  
Split your team into users, operators, and observers and  
give them some time to prepare.  
Use\: As the user starts to use the object \(i.e., handling it,  
pressing buttons, etc.\), the operators manually simulate  
the reaction of the object. Observe and keep a list of  
bugs, insights, and ideas. After each testing session reflect  
on what you would like to change or try. Then iterate.  
Research techniques\: Use-it-yourself, participant obser-  
vation, interviews, co-creative workshops  
Expected output\: Research data \(specifically bugs,  
insights, and new ideas\), raw video footage and photos,  
documentation of the tested variants

PROTOTYPING DIGITAL ARTIFACTS AND SOFTWARE  
# Rehearsing digital services  
Rehearsing digital services is a variant of investigative rehearsal  
that helps to prototype digital interfaces as if they were human  
conversations or interactions.02  
Within an investigative rehearsal, your app or web page is  
replaced by a human actor. This method can be used even  
before creating any wireframes or paper prototypes.  
Preparation\: Choose a starting point, e.g. based on user  
stories from research, and prepare props and a space.  
Then, quickly familiarize yourselves with the chosen story.  
Use\: Run through the story and have a human play the  
app or web page. Don’t think digital be a full human be-  
ing, but one with superhuman access to knowledge and  
media, like a knowledgeable butler or “genie in a bottle.”  
For example, a landing page can be simulated by a con-  
cierge asking, “What are you looking for?” then evolving  
the conversation naturally. Afterwards, consider how to  
digitalize the experience.  
Research techniques\: Use-it-yourself, participant obser-  
vation, co-creative workshops  
Expected output\: Research data \(specifically a list of  
bugs, insights, and new ideas\), raw video footage and  
photos, updated wireframes or paper prototypes

PROTOTYPING DIGITAL ARTIFACTS AND SOFTWARE  
# Paper prototyping  
In paper prototyping, the screens of a digital interface are  
hand sketched on paper and presented to a user to quickly  
test interfaces.03  
Users can now use the interface by “clicking” with their finger  
indicating what they want to do. A researcher simulates the  
operation of the computer simply by replacing the screen page  
or by adding “pop-ups” on smaller pieces of paper.  
Preparation\: Create hand-sketched versions of all key el-  
ements \(e.g., pages, dialog boxes, and actual key content\).  
Split your team to take on the roles of users, \(computer\)  
operators, and observers and give them time to prepare.  
Use\: As the user starts to use the interface, the opera-  
tors simulate all changes in the interface by replacing  
or adding parts. Keep a list of bugs, insights, and ideas.  
After each testing session reflect on what worked, what  
didn’t work, what you would like to change. Revise your  
prototype and iterate.

# Interactive  
# click modeling  
Interactive click modeling is a popular lo-fi method to create  
a first working digital prototype.  
Special prototyping apps allow you to take photos of your hand-  
drawn sketches and link them together so you can test them on  
the actual device you are developing for.  
Preparation\: Hand-sketch all the different screens of  
the interface on paper, take photos of the sketches, and  
import them into the prototyping app. In the app you  
can now define click-areas that link between sketches,  
effectively creating a working interface.  
Use\: Ask a user to complete some tasks using the  
click-model and observe how she reacts to the inter-  
face. If you want to use the prototype for communi-  
cation you can also film the use of the click-model for  
further reference.

# Wireframing  
Wireframing uses nongraphical schematics of digital interfaces  
and their structure to show how they fit together and create  
alignment within the design team.01  
Most of the elements are more hinted at than explicit, which  
makes wireframes fast to create, requiring less specialized skills.  
Wireframes are often used to align the different disciplines within  
a design team and to map out user journeys or act as the start-  
ing point for paper prototypes or interactive click-models.  
Preparation\: Rough versions of the different screens of  
the interface are sketched on paper, on whiteboards, or in  
special wireframing apps. Leave out color, specific fonts,  
and aesthetics as much as possible. Use placeholder  
content.  
Use\: The wireframes are put up on a wall and discussed  
with the team or a selected audience. Annotations are  
added to capture the behaviors of the marked interface  
elements and details about the content or context in  
which the system might be used.  
Research techniques\: Co-creative workshops, inter-  
views, concept tests  
Expected output\: Research data \(specifically bugs,

# Service advertisement  
Service advertisements are prototype advertisements that allow  
us to \(re\)focus on the core value proposition and test the desir-  
ability and perceived value of a new offering.  
Like simple advertisement posters, they use concise slogans,  
engaging visuals, and text to sell the new offering. Later, service  
advertisements can be created as online ads, web landing  
pages, or TV or video advertisements \(including in-depth  
documentary-style variants\).  
Preparation\: Do a brief brainstorming on ideas for  
emotional and factual content for the poster. What do  
you want to communicate in the ad? What could be  
suitable emotional hooks or narratives? What are the  
facts? Sketch out a couple of advertisements on big  
pieces of paper.  
Use\: Show your advertisements to people who do not  
yet know your project and collect their feedback. Keep  
a list of bugs, insights, and ideas. Discuss what worked  
or what didn’t work, and what you would like to change.  
Revise your prototype and iterate.

# Desktop system mapping  
# \(a.k.a. Business Origami\)  
A  
Desktop system mapping is an approach which helps us to  
understand complex value networks using simple paper cutouts  
representing key people, locations, channels, and touchpoints.01  
The cut-outs can be quickly placed, moved, and reconfigured  
again on a table or horizontal whiteboard. Relationships and  
value exchanges are visualized by grouping or drawing connec-  
tions between different elements.  
Preparation\: Create, cut out, fold, and label the key ele-  
ments of the service system using the paper templates.  
B  
C  
Use\: Create a draft of the service system by placing key  
elements to create a map. Reflect on relationships, value  
exchanges, \(inter\)actions, or basic material/money/  
information flows. Add those as arrows and consider  
grouping elements. Start to simulate the service system  
over time. Always keep a list of bugs, insights, and ideas.  
Then, revise your prototype and iterate.  
A Business Origami first looks at the system taking  
a holistic approach. Like with many other service  
design tools, the critical deliverable is not the model  
itself but the experience of modeling the service  
system in the team.

# Business Model Canvas  
The Business Model Canvas is a high-level approach to co-create  
and visualize the key components of a business model  
that allows you to iteratively test and refine various options.02  
Considered a strategic management tool, it is intended to be  
used in an iterative design process.  
Preparation\: Prepare the Business Model Canvas tem-  
plate. It helps if you have personas, stakeholder maps,  
customer journeys, and prototypes at hand as well.  
Use\: Fill in the upper seven boxes first. If available, use  
information from other service design tools to fill in  
information from previous work. Then fill in the lower  
two boxes, identifying cost drivers and potential revenue  
streams. Add numbers and estimate costs and revenues.  
Prototype and test whether your business model is sus-  
tainable. Then start creating alternative business models  
and test potential options. Compare different models and  
iterate; combine and refine them.03  
Research techniques\: Co-creative workshops, interviews  
Expected output\: Research data \(specifically bugs, in-  
sights, and new ideas\), photos

Changers, and Challengers. John Wiley & Sons.  
Eventually, a Business Model Canvas needs to be translated into experience prototypes or actual offers. See

GENERAL METHOD  
# Mood boards  
Mood boards are collages that help to visualize and communi-  
cate intended design direction.  
Using a mix of text, sketches, visualizations, photos, videos, or  
any other media, they transport current or future experiences,  
style, or contexts.  
Preparation\: Start to collect inspiration and raw materi-  
al \(often photos or video footage\) from magazines, stock  
photo libraries or your own media library, or quickly cre-  
ate new material yourself. Organize that material and set  
up a first collage. Iterate until you are happy. Your mood  
board can be a physical wall, or it can be an online media  
board, a more practical solution if you are working with  
video or interactive media.  
Use\: Present your mood boards either to each other  
within the design team or to an external audience to  
receive feedback and ignite discussions. During these  
presentation sessions, you can work on existing boards  
by adding annotations or adding, reshuffling, or remov-  
ing media or even create completely new boards from  
a pool of data.  
Research techniques\: Studio interviews, focus groups,  
concept tests/discussions

GENERAL METHODS  
# Sketching  
Sketching refers to methods of visualization or representation of  
design ideas that support fast and flexible exploration.01  
Sketches – low-fidelity visualizations of an idea – are flexible,  
quick, and inexpensive. Their explorative nature often makes  
them the first step in explorative prototyping.  
Preparation\: Sketches are usually created fast using only  
pen and paper. However, you can create sketches with al-  
most anything as long as they are quick to produce, inex-  
pensive, and support exploration – e.g., sketching in soft-  
ware,02 hardware, 03 or with our bodies \(bodystorming\).  
Use\: Present sketches to others to receive feedback and  
ignite discussion. During these sessions, you can directly  
work on existing sketches \(e.g., by adding annotations or  
changing them on the spot\) or easily add new ones with  
the changes already included.  
Research techniques\: Studio interviews, focus groups,  
concept tests/discussions

GENERAL METHODS  
# Wizard of Oz approaches  
Faking it using invisible puppeteers.04  
Wizard of Oz techniques manually create the responses from  
people, devices, apps, or the context/environment through invis-  
ible operators \(“wizards”\) behind the scenes. The users are led to  
believe that they are dealing with an actual working prototype.  
Preparation\: Think of the operator \(“wizard”\) as an  
invisible puppeteer for those objects and service ele-  
ments. Prepare all relevant parts of the service or systems  
and rig them to allow the “wizards” to create realistic  
responses on the spot.  
Use\: A user is given specific tasks to use the prototype.  
The operator simulates the operation of backstage pro-  
cesses, devices, or the environment by operating behind  
the scenes and manipulating the objects and environ-  
ment. Use this approach to explore and evaluate core  
functionality and value.

# From specialized approaches to  
# your own living prototyping lab  
Keep in mind that a prototyping lab is not just a room with tools in it. It needs to be a  
living lab – a vibrant combination of people, community, skills, methods, and tools all  
set in an accessible environment  
–  
that allows you to work fast and learn fast.  
This methods section only provides a  
concise selection of prototyping meth-  
ods, specifically chosen to not require  
specialist skills. This allows you to have a  
conversation within a broader team about  
where the project should be heading. It  
also allows you to make safer decisions  
about what kind of skills and expertise  
will be needed when moving toward  
implementation; e.g., when you dive  
deeper into change management, soft-  
ware development, product development/  
management, architecture, or other more  
specialist disciplines. You can now safely  
invite the relevant stakeholders with their  
expert methods.  
Those specialists bring in specialized  
tools to tackle specific challenges quickly  
and efficiently, including but certainly  
not limited to\:  
→ Software prototyping  
tools and frameworks  
→ CAD \(computer aided design\)  
and 3D printing  
→ Change management tool-  
sets and structures  
→ VR \(virtual reality\) applications  
for architecture and experi-  
ence prototyping  
→ Fablab \(fabrication laboratory\)  
­ environments or makerspaces  
with access to tools that allow  
you to prototype almost any  
physical object  
When you choose suitable methods for  
your project, carefully assess how quickly  
they will allow you to build and test the  
prototype. Your choice might also depend  
on the skills of your team and the tools  
they have access to.01  
It can be useful to put together your  
own tailored prototyping pipeline or even  
create your own prototyping lab.  
Where can you run a quick service  
simulation? Are you allowed to prototype  
in context? How fast do you get access  
to fabrication equipment, and are you  
able or even allowed to use it on your  
own? Do you have instant access to a user  
01 See 7.3.3, Case\: Enabling staff and stakeholders to prototype for continuous  
evolution, for an example of how to enable staff to take over the prototyping and

community for a quick user research, or  
do you first have to go through a long  
purchase process? Where can you exper-  
iment with fresh ideas and grow them  
before you need to apply for funding?  
Your own prototyping lab can start  
small and be quite informal. With iter-  
ation, it might develop into something  
useful enough to become an official inter-  
nal institution.02  
But remember, whatever you set up,  
always keep it accessible to your whole  
organization and stay fast.03 ◀  
Virtual reality environments and content can be highly  
engaging. Unfortunately, authoring VR content often  
still requires specialist skills – but as tools evolve this  
might change rapidly, making it one of the most excit-  
ing technologies not only for prototyping but also for  
documenting and revisiting field research data.  
02 03 Y ou might even consider including a network of supporters like internal/external  
development teams in other time zones that can finish your prototypes overnight.  
This can be very impressive to teams.

# Innovation on the shop floor\: How to demonstrate the value  
# of design thinking to a manufacturing organization  
AUTHORS

Innovation Manager,  
Airbus  
Dr. Markus Durstewitz  
Senior Innovation  
Manager, Airbus  
Crafting a design thinking  
strategy and proving it in reality  
Design thinking at Airbus  
emerged organically from different  
­ departments – workshops were con-  
ducted, training offered, and projects  
­ following human-centered approach-  
es established, all labeled under  
the term design thinking. However,  
besides a core group of departments  
that formed a deep understanding of  
the power design thinking can have  
in ­ product and service innovation,  
the ­ majority of employees of Airbus  
have ­ different understandings of  
design and design thinking, if they  
are acquainted with the concept at  
all. In July 2015, we crafted a strategy  
to infuse design thinking as part of  
the DNA of Airbus. One step on the  
ladder toward a broader understand-  
ing of design thinking was to engage  
in a grand challenge\: we wanted to  
show, in an investment project of  
strategic importance, the potential of  
design thinking. Airbus is currently  
extending its production capacity  
of its successful Single Aisle Family,  
A319, A320, and A321. To enable  
this ramp-up, Airbus has created  
an additional final assembly line in  
Hamburg. Our value proposition in  
this project was to co-innovate with  
the workers at the shop floor.  
The project started in September  
2015 and focused on problem  
framing and need finding from the  
workers’ perspective. To ensure  
visibility and to reach the right level  
of awareness, it was important that  
design thinking was placed prom-  
inently in the project structure as  
one dedicated work stream. Being  
placed at this level gave us enough  
influence to push for creating real  
impact by achieving an end-to-end  
implementation.  
“With design thinking, we are  
following a balanced approach that  
emphasizes early user engagement.  
The purpose is to make sure that we  
address the real needs and focus on  
doing the right things, which finally  
will make the difference to succeed  
with innovation in delivering added  
value to customers and users by going  
beyond the obvious.”  
— Dr. Markus Durstewitz  
Prototyping plays a prominent role in  
the design process as a tool to make  
assumptions tangible and to involve  
users. We applied ­ prototyping for  
gaining user insights, and for en-  
suring employee engagement and  
management buy-in. Our prototypes  
were often quite simple, rough mock-  
ups such as cardboard proto­ types or  
clickable user interfaces. In general,  
these are good enough to test func-  
tionalities and to continuously involve CASES 07 Prototyping  
users in the evolution of the concepts.  
In addition, we used the prototypes  
to better understand goals and the  
rationale behind requirements from  
different departments. Here, inter-  
disciplinary and cross-functional  
collaboration was essential to reach  
consensus between all stakeholders.  
“Fast iterations in prototyping min-  
imum viable solutions are a key as-  
set for gathering user insights, for  
reducing the time to product, and for  
accelerating the innovation process.”  
— Dr. Markus Durstewitz  
By having tangible prototypes and  
the possibility to interact with and  
alter them, we were able to gain  
deep insights, tapping into the tacit  
knowledge of the different stake-  
holders. We used the prototypes to  
test early and fail fast and cheap, in  
order to iterate to a solution that  
would ­ ultimately ­ be valuable to  
the end users and approved by all  
stakeholders. The simple proto-  
types helped us to perform early  
user tests and to reach a good level  
of maturity and alignment before  
making bigger investments.  
From need finding to  
prototyping\: Finding  
opportunities beyond the  
obvious and prototyping in  
design thinking  
We started out with user research  
to understand how the production  
environment is perceived from a  
worker’s point of view. We shadowed  
key people, going through their  
workdays with them, and we inter-  
viewed workers on the shop floor  
and other relevant stakeholders such  
as production ­ support and manufac-  
turing engineers. The need-finding  
stage lasted three months, in which  
time we can to understand the  
final assembly line from the work-  
ers’ point of view. We distilled our  
findings into four opportunity areas  
where design can make a change.  
“Although it is tempting to shortcut in  
the early phase, crucial for the success  
was to conduct deep need finding  
prior to prototyping. Only through  
going into the field, observing and  
shadowing users, was it possible to  
look beyond the obvious and to ensure  
we are doing the right things.”  
— Thomas Abrell  
246/247  
After need finding, we selected  
two of the four opportunity areas  
to prototype in a timebox of eight  
weeks, from kickoff until the final  
prototypes were delivered. To master  
this tight timeline we built a team  
of internal and external experts  
with diverse skills, from industrial  
design and rapid prototyping to user  
research to coding.  
We addressed two challenges in  
an iterative way, ­ utilizing prototypes  
as a tool to co-create, to commu-  
nicate, and to iterate\: information  
system interfaces on the shop floor  
and material delivery.  
In building the team, we relied  
on experienced service designers  
from Airbus to manage the over-  
all design process, project and  
stakeholder management. For  
the information system side of  
the project, we chose an external  
partner with specialists in indus-  
trial design, design thinking, and  
user experience design. It was also  
important for us to bring in perspec-  
tives from a non-aerospace domain,  
bringing in diverse skillsets and  
design expertise. This is Service Design Doing

Prototyping\:  
Making things tangible  
on the shop floor  
The project was set up in such a way  
that two teams worked in parallel,  
one focusing on the physical proto-  
type, the other on the ­ information  
interaction prototype. It was  
­ important to co-locate the teams in a  
creative space\: we used an aircraft fu-  
selage and built a workshop around  
it, so that our team had the possibili-  
ty to continually build things.  
Our experiment was to see how  
digital and physical prototyping  
could work in parallel, involving  
all stakeholders. Workers were  
involved ­ continuously. In addition,  
we ­ scheduled three co-creation  
workshops to engage a wider group  
of stakeholders, a demo day, and  
an intermediate management  
presentation. We used a build-  
measure-learn cycle, but instead of  
measuring, we relied on qualitative  
evaluations and direct feedback  
from the users. The co-creation  
workshops were used to iterate the  
prototypes, and we moved from  
lo-fi mock-ups to functional us-  
ability mock-ups.  
“It was an interesting experiment  
to run physical prototyping in  
parallel to digital prototyping.  
Ultimately, we designed a service  
for the ­ workers, involving  
digital and physical touchpoints.  
Our aim was clearly to  
improve the work experience  
for our employees.”  
— Thomas Abrell  
With the information system inter-  
faces, we complemented our need  
finding by researching what infor-  
mation workers really need – and  
want to use – to perform their work,  
and which devices would be suitable  
for interacting with the information.  
We therefore enriched our findings  
from the need-finding phase, and  
observed and interviewed the work-  
ers specifically with respect to the  
information they need. We mapped  
the necessary information and proto-  
typed it in rough concepts, showing  
screens on different devices such as  
tablets, smartwatches, smartphones,  
and large touchscreen displays.  
In the first co-creation work-  
shop, we got user feedback on the  
devices and the functions. We  
248/249  
distilled the most important insights  
before going into the next prototype  
iteration, ­ until a user interface was  
generated and a device concept was  
determined. Finally, we took the  
prototypes into one existing final as-  
sembly line, and let the users interact  
with them, simulating their very own  
workflow with the new prototypes  
in their current day-to-day working  
environment. These insights helped  
us to further iterate and refine them.  
The material delivery units  
\(MDUs\) were addressed the same  
way. First, we went to the shop floor  
to see how material delivery works  
in practice – complementing the  
view we had from need finding, the  
planning documents, and internal  
logistics. Then, we conceptualized  
three material delivery units and  
built 1\:5 scale models – in practice,  
three material trolleys for the same  
set of material, but with different  
conceptual considerations behind  
them – which were iterated in  
co-creation workshops.  
One week later, we had the first  
1\:1 full-scale mock-up, which was  
brought to the final assembly line  
for feedback at the assembly station This is Service Design Doing  
itself. With this feedback, and feed-  
back gathered in the ­ co-creation  
workshops, we built two more  
iterations of the full-scale mock-up.  
We added “smart” functionalities  
\(connectivity\) to the prototype,  
­ simulating how it would inter-  
act with its environment and the  
parts inside. The second prototype  
­ iteration got additional usability  
features such as a bumper and box-  
es for tools to make it more usable  
and more useful for the worker.  
In the last co-creation work-  
shop, we simulated a scenario  
incorporating both prototypes,  
the information system interface  
and the material delivery unit.  
Our project team simulated the  
situation together with the us-  
ers, gathering feedback about the  
overall workflow, since material de-  
livery and the information system  
interface are interrelated in their  
respective workflow.  
At the editorial deadline of  
this book, we are doing a proof of  
concept of the material delivery  
unit, and integrating the informa-  
tion system interface into a larger  
project at Airbus changing the way  
our manufacturing environment is  
set up and operations are performed.  
The learnings of the project are being  
used to propose a holistic design  
thinking approach for Airbus.  
Learnings  
Crucial for success were not only  
user engagement and user accep-  
tance, but also the involvement  
of the Workers’ Council as a key  
­ stakeholder. This entity, entitled to  
represent the workforce, can amplify  
a project’s results in positive or nega-  
tive terms. Only through continuous  
deep involvement of the council  
did we create a sense of ownership,  
involving them as a strategic partner  
for employee engagement imple-  
menting user-centered solutions.  
“It’s important to have a good  
balance between internal and  
external project team members.  
Only with a small internal  
core team is it possible to maintain  
continuity during the project,  
while external team members  
bring in specific expertise.”  
— Thomas Abrell  
For the future, we will need a small  
internal core team with a wide array  
of skills to anchor the approach and  
leverage the expertise until imple-  
mentation. In practice, it will be an  
interdisciplinary team consisting  
of aircraft manufacturing domain  
experts from Airbus, ­ designers,  
method experts, and specialists for  
end-to-end support of the innova-  
tion project. We believe that collab-  
oration with external partners from  
the design community \(e.g., with  
freelancers and design agencies\) will  
be necessary to keep up a high level  
of momentum and creativity.  
“People are at the heart of our com-  
pany. Let’s complement the diversity  
of our employees and introduce a  
new way of working in cross-func-  
tional teams to deliver outstanding  
results. Let’s team up for innovation!  
This may include all actors along  
the value chain, suppliers, custom-  
ers, and users.”  
— Dr. Markus Durstewitz  
Now, the next step is to go ­ further  
in our endeavor to make design  
thinking part of the DNA of Airbus, CASES 07 Prototyping  
by creating a specific design center to  
coordinate and steer the activities and  
to give creatives a home within the or-  
ganization. In this organization-to-be,  
we want to educate service designers  
­ inside Airbus, and build up a strong  
­ network spanning Airbus.

Deep need finding is  
­ necessary to ensure that you  
are “doing the right things.” If  
this phase is bypassed, you run  
the risk of merely incremen-  
tally improving existing solu-  
tions instead of innovating.  
Prototyping is a powerful  
tool for demonstrating to  
stakeholders the power of a  
design team. Designers are  
fast at making ­ assumptions  
visible and tangible. This  
craft helps to make tacit  
knowledge of stakeholders  
explicit, and to get buy-in for  
design thinking as an inno-  
vation approach.

04  
A combination of external  
and internal team mem-  
bers is crucial, but the right  
balance needs to be found.  
A team of experts is need-  
ed to be fast, and it should  
be complemented by a  
cross-functional team from  
the organization to make  
innovation happen.  
A new way of working  
for users leads to a strong  
commitment to finding  
solutions. However, these  
solutions might be in  
conflict with traditional  
metrics in the company, and  
the speed of working might  
alienate parts of the orga-  
nization. Although benefits  
such as increased usability  
can be related to KPIs such  
as increased performance,  
organizations also need to  
acknowledge “soft” expe-  
rience-related factors as  
benefit.

250/251  
It is crucial to create the  
right environment for  
design teams to work in.  
Having not only an inspiring  
workspace but also access  
to prototyping facilities is  
clearly necessary. Also, a  
shared location is manda-  
tory for success, as much of  
the information otherwise  
gets lost in transmission.

# Reducing the waiting time for breast cancer patients

By reducing the waiting time for  
breast cancer patients from \(up to\)  
three months to seven days, Oslo  
University Hospital used service  
design methods to improve the lives  
of women facing a difficult period  
in their lives.  
Women with a heightened risk  
of developing breast cancer typi-  
cally faced a delay of up to three  
months before receiving an exam-  
ination and diagnosis at the Oslo  
University Hospital, the largest  
hospital in Scandinavia. Supported  
by the Norwegian Design Council’s  
Design-Driven Innovation Program  
\(DIP\), Designit worked together  
with a project team at the hospital  
to reduce waiting time and improve  
the overall patient experience. The  
collaborative, visual, and iterative  
process enabled the hospital staff  
to work more closely together and  
envision a new system.  
Service thinking and  
co-creation  
The project group and the ­ designers  
facilitated a workshop with 40 em-  
ployees across different depart-  
ments within the hospital to map  
out a typical patient journey from  
their point of view. Afterwards, the  
patient journey was visualized in  
a detailed diagram demonstrating  
all the steps a patient goes through.  
This diagram was a valuable tool that  
enabled a common understanding  
across ­ different departments of the  
­ complexity of a patient’s journey.  
After the workshop, in-depth  
interviews were conducted with  
patients. The designers used image  
cards to help the patients express  
emotional aspects of their journey,  
which are just as important as the  
logical steps. In order to gain deeper  
understanding of the staff ’s work  
process, the designers conducted  
contextual inquiry with the staff,  
role-play with general practitioners  
\(GPs\), and phone interviews with  
stakeholders. Designit talked to a  
number of different actors that were  
involved in the patient’s process,  
including oncologists, radiologists,  
radio technicians, nurses, patient  
coordinators, secretaries, private  
clinics, and GPs.  
There was a lot of information  
gathered through these activities.  
This was used to identify the right  
opportunities for optimizing the  
process, ultimately reducing patient  
waiting time. The findings had to  
be inspiring and actionable. The  
key insight from all of this was that  
patients felt that they were patients  
from the day a lump was discovered,  
while the hospital considered them  
patients from the day the diagnos-  
tic work started.  
The Oslo University Hospital  
decided to rethink the process.  
The ideal user journey was mapped CASES 07 Prototyping  
out, completely removed from  
today’s process and its challenges,  
and they worked backward from  
that. Together with the designers, the  
staff came up with solutions on how  
they could work differently with new  
­ routines that reduced the diagnosis  
period. The team then ran co-creation  
workshops with staff members where  
they developed prototypes, mainly  
in the form of scenarios and user  
stories. The scenarios were tested by  
presenting them to patients and staff.  
The designers did some alterations  
based on the test results in collab-  
oration with the project team until  
they had a solution that was both  
feasible and met user needs \(both  
backend and frontend\). As a result,  
the team defined what the radiolo-  
gist, the nurse, the pathologist, and  
the ­ patient coordinator had to do to  
deliver this experience.  
The solution aimed to improve  
cancer patients’ lives by ­ rethinking  
behind-the-scenes processes from a  
patient’s point of view. The ­ hospital  
staff played an important role in  
their patients’ lives, and this had to  
be acknowledged. A large part of this  
included the hospital ­ recognizing,  
252/253  
accepting, and ­ working on improv-  
ing the customer service experience  
for the time leading to diagnosis.  
The new Breast  
Diagnostics Centre \(BDS\)  
The new process at the BDS was  
officially inaugurated at the Oslo  
University Hospital on November 4,  
2013, with the Norwegian Minister  
of Health and the Norwegian Design  
Council attending the event.  
With the new process, patients  
should feel confident that they are in  
the care of the hospital from the mo-  
ment they leave their general practi-  
tioner’s office. The goal was to create  
a straightforward path from the GP  
to diagnosis, getting the patient an  
answer as soon as possible  
The journey toward a diagnosis  
has been radically reduced down to a  
total of seven days, a previously un-  
thinkable goal. On day one, patients  
receive a brochure from their GP  
with information detailing the steps  
they will go through to diagnosis.  
They are also equipped with a direct  
phone number they can call in case  
they have any questions. On the  
backend, the hospital now ­ assesses  
the referrals daily, ensuring timely  
reviews. If the practitioner ­ reports a  
suspicious lump, the patient in ques-  
tion now gets an appointment within  
seven days. In the ­ cases that are not as  
alarming, the ­ patient may wait longer,  
but never more than four weeks.  
On the day of the examination,  
the patient is greeted at the center  
by a radiographer. The patient then  
meets the radiologist and is given a  
preliminary diagnosis. The patient  
receives a follow-up appointment This is Service Design Doing

the next day where the diagnosis  
is confirmed and, in the case of  
a positive diagnosis, a treatment  
plan is outlined.  
Instead of meeting once a week,  
all the specialists involved meet ­ every  
morning to discuss the patients.  
The test results are ready four days  
after the examination, and are eval-  
uated in this meeting. This ensures  
that all patient cases are discussed  
in a timely manner and the waiting  
time doesn’t accrue.  
Prior to this, it could take up to  
12 weeks before patients received  
a letter scheduling an examination  
at the hospital. Now, patients are  
contacted, either by phone or letter,  
just a few days after receiving their  
referral from their GP. All in all, the  
time from ­ referral to diagnosis is now  
between 7 and 28 days, depending  
on the severity of the case. The new  
process represents a 90% reduction  
in waiting time.  
Service design proved to be a  
valuable method in starting up this  
project and contributed to creating a  
real change. After the design phase,  
hospital staff drove the new process  
through implementation.

Prototyping is often described as one  
of the core activities of the design  
process. But in service design, we  
need to embrace the prototype as the  
goal. There is no final service, it is  
just an infinite prototype.  
Complex services need  
evolutionary improvements  
Doberman was engaged by the  
healthcare innovation hub Experio  
Lab to redesign the different points  
of contact between people with  
chronic diseases and primary  
care clinics. Early in the process it  
became clear that smaller evolution-  
ary improvements in the interface  
between patients and staff would  
have the most impact, as opposed to  
making one radical service inno-  
vation. And even more important,  
the improvements needed to be in  
constant evolution to be adapted to  
constantly changing needs, systems,  
and restricted resources. Enter in-  
finite prototyping.

when I got my diagnosis.”

just to evaluate ideas, but to estab-

Staff taking over  
the prototypes  
The design team developed a wide  
range of lo-fi prototypes that were  
tested and refined by staff and  
­ patients, in up to five iterations.  
As all prototypes were made in sim-  
ple formats, like Word documents,  
so the staff could gradually adapt  
the process of prototyping, with no  
need for in-depth designer skills. As  
a side effect, the staff involved have  
embraced the concept of the com-  
plete service as an infinite prototype,  
and are now capable of approaching  
further challenges through design  
together with the patients.  
“As we worked with lo-fi prototypes,  
we could iterate quickly, together with  
the staff and patients.”  
— Therese Björkqvist, Service Designer, Doberman CASES 07 Prototyping  
“As we see and spread the solutions as  
prototypes, they are easy to pick up,  
adjust, and integrate in other parts of

helps build courage and nourish a more

In early 2015, the Australian Tax  
Office \(ATO\) embarked on a  
­ program called Reinventing the  
ATO, which outlined the future  
experience for ATO customers,  
partners, and staff. In partnership  
with the ATO, Fjord was engaged  
to help realize the Reinventing the  
ATO program through a subproject  
called Working with Our Partners –  
all the stakeholders who sit between  
the ATO and taxpayers, primarily  
tax and BAS \(Business Activity  
Statement\) agents and ­ developers  
who create tax and accounting  
­ software that interacts with the  
ATO’s systems and services.  
As a result of the initial  
­ engagement, a group of prioritized  
service concepts were created to  
bring Working with Our Partners  
to life. One of these concepts was  
Partner Space, an online space  
where tax partners can ­ easily  
access information and start  
­ interactions with the ATO.  
Collaborative prototyping work-  
shops are an excellent substitute for  
telepathy, because they make intent  
tangible. They help concrete discus-  
sion, highlight hidden complexities,  
and avoid participants talking at  
cross purposes.  
Building a team of stakeholders  
Looking beyond the online space,  
a combined team of ATO and Fjord  
staff visited tax partners to conduct  
contextual research and gather  
­ in-depth knowledge of their goals,  
pain points, and opportunities,  
as well as the way they work with  
taxpayers and businesses across  
Australia \(e.g., such as how the ATO  
communicated with them and their  
clients, the status of queries to the  
tax office, keeping track of deadlines,  
and maintaining an overview of their  
clients’ situations\).  
Additionally, tax software pro-  
viders were involved in the research  
to ensure the ATO can support them  
258/259  
to deliver a consistent experience  
for tax partners. We co-designed  
activities with ATO stakeholders and  
combined insights with internal data  
to ideate initial concepts.  
After refining these concepts,  
we ran a special prototyping work-  
shop01 with tax partners, ATO staff,  
and the project team. Such collab-  
orative co-design workshops are  
used to discuss and develop initial  
­ concepts with a focus on making  
ideas tangible by building simple  
­ prototypes on the spot.  
Creating a minimum  
lovable product  
Developing the prototyping work-  
shop outputs further, the team  
mapped out what a “minimum  
lovable product” would look like in  
terms of features and user journeys.  
We use “lovable” instead of “via-  
ble” because this shifts the focus  
01 Fjord Makeshop is a proprietary co-design and prototyping workshop. This is Service Design Doing  
from the functional to the experi-  
ential. A bare-bones service that  
nobody likes using is not going to  
gain traction out in the world in its  
fragile early days.  
Apart from the usual research  
and concept outputs at the end of  
this stage of a project, we created  
giant journey maps and roadmaps  
for the development of Partner  
Space. Since a focal point was a  
portal, Fjord’s Creative Technologist  
built a living prototype. This was a  
case in which it was quicker to build  
something in HTML, CSS, and JSON  
than to design mock-up screens and  
annotate them. The prototype was  
created over the course of a couple  
of weeks. It used a pseudo-dataset  
that could be queried and filtered by  
a mocked-up frontend. Within the  
bounds of the fake data, we could  
demo filtering, searching, notifica-  
tions, and responsive layouts and give  
a much greater sense of the power  
of the design than with just clickable  
pages. This provides an easier segue  
from concept to UX to delivery.  
The fundamental ideas and  
needs for the portal had already  
been gathered and synthesized  
and concepts refined and iterated  
in workshops and in the weeks  
­ following. These were shared with  
the client team and external part-  
ner stakeholders – tax agents and  
software developers. The roadmap  
for the rollout of the features of the  
big picture experience was done  
based on a scoring system. The  
final scores from each group deter-  
mined, more or less, which features  
were to be ­ developed in phase one,  
which in phase two, and so on. The  
portal ­ prototype was only part of  
a broader set of concepts, since it  
was a portal view onto several other  
deeper and more complex features.  
The prototype was intended more  
to explain how such a portal might  
work than to be a final design –  
a high-fidelity sketch in code rather  
than an end state.  
Spreading the service  
design practice

7.3.5 CASE\: USING ROLE-PLAYS AND SIMULATIONS IN LARGE-SCALE 1\:1 PROTOTYPES  
# Prototyping at scale\: Redesigning Lufthansa’s business class experience  
AUTHOR  
Barbara Franz  
Senior Lead Design and  
Research, IDEO  
Aiming to increase competitive-  
ness through service, Lufthansa  
approached global design and  
innovation consultancy IDEO in  
October 2013 to redesign its long-  
haul business class experience.  
With an aggressive one-year time  
frame to roll out the new service,  
­ prototyping proved a vital tool  
­ throughout the process.  
Learning by doing  
The ambitious timeline demanded  
an iterative, hands-on approach from  
the get-go. After putting ourselves  
into the shoes of ­ passengers and  
crew, and diving into what ­ luxury  
means for today’s traveler, we  
­ immediately began to prototype.  
The team mocked up a section of an  
airplane cabin in the IDEO Munich  
studio which was used for regular  
role-plays, helping us draft the initial  
service concept.  
“Our goal was to improve service in  
these private moments so that the  
guest receives a totally new flying  
experience with much more quality  
time – time which they can use to  
work, relax, or be pampered.”  
— Dorothea von Boxberg,  
Head of Customer Experience, Lufthansa  
Designing the  
personal experience  
Based on our insights, we created a  
more personal service experience,  
focusing on the interaction between  
crew and passenger. Crew should  
think of themselves as a ­ traveler’s  
trusted, knowing hosts, like at  
­ top-notch restaurants.  
“Only if flight attendants understand  
and live the new service philosophy –  
being a host – will passengers feel the  
difference in the long run.”  
— Stefan Wendland,  
Project Manager, Lufthansa  
Prototyping, at scale  
We then moved to a large-scale,  
1\:1 prototype – 92 seats, 3 gal-  
leys. Over four weeks IDEO and  
Lufthansa stakeholders, including  
crew, catering, and management,  
prototyped several versions of the  
new service, focusing on the feasi-  
bility and desirability of individual  
service steps, interactions, and the  
overall service flow from a passenger  
and flight attendant point of view.  
Building for buy-in  
The mock-up allowed us to run  
four- to five-hour simulations with  
real crew, watched by passengers and  
board members. The early involve-  
ment of key ­ stakeholders created a  
sense of ownership and increased  
their confidence in ­ shaping the ­ design  
toward a common goal. During  
rollout, heightened awareness and  
buy-in from crew members helped  
ensured more willing adoption across  
all 18,000 flight attendants.

KEY TAKEAWAYS  
01 02  
Challenge the system\: If the  
organizational effort and lead  
time for change in your test  
follow the rigid rules of the  
current system, you won’t  
operate freely and are limited  
in your creativity. Allow for  
flexibility in the test to enable  
you to experiment and iterate  
on your learnings.  
Zoom in and out\: When  
prototyping, pay attention  
to the details, but don’t get  
lost in them. Balance that by  
constantly ­ removing yourself  
to look at the ­ bigger picture  
and the ­ design intent.  
262/263  
03  
Take time to tell and listen\:  
Brief your partners ­ before  
each test, and debrief after-  
wards. Customer experience  
projects require us to listen  
to customers, but also to  
all those who deliver the ser-  
vice to them.  
04 Engage stakeholders early\:  
Leverage knowledge from  
different stakeholders and  
use the opportunity to  
create a sense of support  
and ownership by bringing  
people on board early. This  
will accelerate implementa-  
tion and minimizes the risk  
of failure.  
05  Know what you’re mea-  
suring, and how\: Many  
different factors impact a  
service, so agree beforehand  
on what you’re testing and,  
just as importantly, how you’re  
testing. Make sure to pick  
the appropriate technique for  
what you’re trying to measure,  
and one that doesn’t impact  
the overall service experience.

7.3.6 CASE\: USING MULTIFACETED PROTOTYPING TO  
CREATE AND ITERATE BUSINESS AND SERVICE MODELS  
# Multifaceted prototype evolution over time  
AUTHOR  
Klara Lindner  
Head of Customer  
Experience, Mobisol  
The company Mobisol started with a  
goal and an insight\: having ­ traveled  
around the globe, its founder Thomas  
Gottschalk came to under­ stand that  
energy is an essential requirement for  
development, and thus set his heart on  
“plugging in the world.” He also saw  
the potential of combining two seem-  
ingly ­ unrelated trends\: a steep cost de-  
crease for photovoltaic \(PV\) solar, and  
the radical uptake of mobile networks  
and phones in the developing world.  
Building on that, the initial  
business idea was quickly ­ formulated\:  
offer PV solar systems to people  
living off the grid, and let them pay  
for it over time via SMS.  
Rather than working on a  
­ 50-page investor’s deck, the first  
action was building a tangible prototype  
that illustrated the concept,  
which was used to get rich feedback  
and find partners to collaborate with.  
The prototype at this point was a  
light bulb and a solar panel connect-  
ed to microchip with an embedded  
SIM card. By sending an SMS to that  
card, you could turn it on and off.  
Sized to fit in a suitcase, we could  
take it anywhere we wanted.  
To better understand how to  
turn this idea into a solid business  
model, we jumped on a plane to visit  
the three countries that had ­ adopted  
mobile most \(Kenya, Tanzania,  
and Ghana\). We hired a car and a  
translator to carry out intensive field  
research and get in touch with poten-  
tial partners in those isolated areas.  
What we brought home were  
four main insights that would help  
to shape our offer substantially\:  
— Even in the remotest village, the  
—  
awareness about PV solar is quite  
high, but bad-quality products  
and lack of after-sales infrastruc-  
ture have harmed its reputa-  
tion in the past.  
— Better lighting is of course ­ nice to  
—  
have, but what people really long  
for is a power source that is able  
to run larger electric appliances  
like stereos or TVs.  
— The classic indicator – ability to  
—  
pay – is not fixed number. Many  
people have three or four income  
sources and their monthly  
income fluctuates depending on  
seasonal factors and also how  
much they want something.  
— The current spending on energy,  
—  
which we could substitute with a  
solar system \(lighting and getting  
the phone charged\), adds up to  
approximately 15 €/month.  
We used these insights to evolve our  
core offer\: large PV systems coming  
in three different sizes, complete  
with battery, cabling, lights, etc. The  
offer also includes a three-year credit  
agreement and free maintenance  
throughout the repayment period.  
A second prototype of the PV  
system was developed, now fully  
functional \(but still very ugly\)\: CASES 07 Prototyping  
we could remotely turn the PV sys-  
tem off and on based on incoming  
mobile money payments \(M-Pesa\),  
and gather performance and usage  
data in real time to foresee mainte-  
nance activities.  
A hardware prototype made  
from DIY components helped to  
overcome cultural barriers and  
get honest feedback from our  
pilot customers.  
During our trip, we had found  
a small, like-minded Tanzanian  
organization, with whom we started  
a field test soon after. In batches,  
we connected a total of 200 house-  
holds \(paying customers\), gathered  
feedback on our technology, and  
prototyped different approaches to  
get the service ecosystem around the  
PV system right. There were many  
open questions about how to orches-  
trate different steps of the customer  
journey – let’s zoom in on a few of  
these to better understand the itera-  
tive approach we chose.  
“This is like having to put  
the engine into your  
new Mercedes-Benz!”  
— Mama Baraka, focus group member  
How can we assure proper  
system installation?  
Since we are all trained as ­ engineers,  
we did the system installation our-  
selves in the beginning – but quickly  
grasped that this would not be feasi-  
ble for a ­ commercial rollout.  
Our first move was to develop  
a plug-and-play kit that custom-  
ers could install themselves, and  
in co-creative sessions with real  
­ customers, we even managed to draft  
an accompanying manual that works.  
But we came to realize that even  
though our customers were now able  
to do the installation themselves,  
they simply did not want to.  
People wanted someone knowl-  
edgeable to do the job. Our second  
iteration was the development of the  
“Mobisol Akademie,” a two-week  
program through which techni-  
cians from the village \(until then  
repairing houses, bikes, or phones\)  
got trained and certified as Mobisol  
Installation Technicians.  
And with that, we not only ar-  
rived at a feasible solution for us, but  
also made our customers even happi-  
er \(because they know and trust their  
264/265  
local technicians\) – and created jobs  
in the village.  
What is the business  
model behind this?  
Initially, we thought that Mobisol  
could become a manufacturer or may-  
be wholesaler, with local distributors  
buying in bulk and acting as the point  
of contact for the end users. But in our  
field test, we learned that there was  
neither a distribution nor a financing  
infrastructure to build on, and if we  
wanted this to work, we would have to  
build up our own structures and adapt  
our value proposition\:  
— We needed to take on the role of a  
—  
micro-lender. This meant that on  
the one hand we had to ­ borrow  
money from somewhere to bridge  
the three-year repayment period,  
and on the other, we had to care-  
fully assess the creditworthiness of  
interested households. While the  
“switch off” mechanism helped us  
to get the necessary pre-finance  
more easily than we had thought, it  
took several iterations to come up  
with a credit survey that allowed us  
to find suitable customers. This is Service Design Doing

— We needed to make sure that our  
—  
­ customers could gain access,  
no matter how ­ remote their  
homes were.  
To come up with a cost-efficient dis-  
tribution strategy, we looked into in-  
formal markets for ­ inspiration\: when  
a Tanzanian family build their new  
home, they go to the nearest market,  
buy the bricks, and find a means for  
transporting all the materials home –  
sometimes a bus with the right route,  
sometimes a car, sometimes a boat.  
Every village has a mason, who is  
hired to build the house.  
We already had the local tech-  
nicians, so we started to build up  
a ­ decentrally organized network  
of sales outlets. Today, we have  
our “market hubs” at marketplaces  
that our customers regularly vis-  
it. We make sure the packaging is  
­ optimized for easy transport, and  
as soon as the papers are signed  
our customers handle transport  
over the final stretch, bringing the  
system components home, where a  
­ village technician is waiting to do the  
­ installation for them.  
266/267  
“Side effects” of  
our pilot research  
Through close interaction with our  
first 200 customers, we found out  
that some of them were using the  
system productively and making  
quite a bit of money. We wanted  
to foster that and started to devel-  
op small business kits, so-called  
“business out of the box.” In es-  
sence, these are ­ electric appliances  
suited to our system together with  
­ entrepreneur-training materials  
and marketing materials for the  
customer to use. At the moment,  
we have a phone-charging kit and  
a barber shop.  
Evolution  
of the business  
Through our iterative process and  
being very close to our custom-  
ers, we gained confidence about a  
business/service model that others  
considered pretty radical. As we  
pre-finance our technology for three  
years, we could only grow if we  
borrowed money. This confidence  
plus our “proof from the field”  
helped to make sure we found people  
who believe in it.  
As I write this, Mobisol is about  
four years into the business and  
around three into commercial sales.  
We’ve grown to 500+ employees  
and provided access to electricity  
to more than 50,000 households.  
Having started in Tanzania, we went  
to Rwanda in 2014 and later started  
operations in a third country, Kenya.

Through the Mobisol  
Akademie, we found a way  
to empower our users to  
not just be consumers but  
business-people as well.  
When asking for feedback  
on our prototypes, we used  
a DIY hardware iteration,  
which helped to overcome  
cultural barriers and get  
honest feedback.

# THE SHARP END  
# OF SERVICE DESIGN  
COMMENT  
“To provide solutions,  
firms need to create ser-  
vice systems composed  
of physical components,  
technology, and data,  
including knowledge,  
communication channels,  
and networked actors.  
This equally applies  
to service systems in  
manufacturing, health-  
care, energy, or security  
and has been promoted  
­ especially in the context  
of the Internet of Things.”

Kathrin Möslein  
This chapter also includes  
Pilots\: Prototypes or implementation? 273  
Implementation – turning a prototype into a running  
system – is the sharp end of service design. Some  
commentators have criticized service design for being  
weak at implementation, and it is easy to understand  
these objections.  
Many early service designers came from graphic or  
product design where, if they kept within set technical  
parameters, the realities of production did not concern  
them much. Or clients did not include implementation  
in the scope of the project, even if the designers wanted  
to address it. Perhaps because of this background, their  
mode of working might have been uncharitably per-  
ceived as\: “Here is your design and an invoice, good luck  
making it happen.”  
Service design today is different. Service designers  
are invited to support projects end-to-end and a growing  
number of implementation projects even adopt a service  
design approach to replace their traditional project  
­ management methodologies from start to finish.  
In any case, if our goal is to create a change which  
affects end customers, employees, processes, and even  
the business model, implementation always must be an  
indispensable core part of our work. This is Service Design Doing  
# 8.1 FROM PROTOTYPE TO PRODUCTION  
8.1.1  
COMMENT  
“Cost and sales supervi-  
sion, resource planning,  
and similar topics related  
to facts and figures are a  
crucial element of service  
implementation.”  
— Julia Jonas  
What is implementation?  
Implementation describes the step beyond experimenting  
and testing, to production and rollout. The implementa-  
tion of service design projects can involve various skill sets,  
such as change management for organizational procedures  
and processes \(including training, coaching, recruitment\),  
software development or engineering for the production  
of physical objects, but also architecture and construc-  
tion management for the creation of environments and  
buildings. Despite the different contexts, there are several  
similarities between these fields of implementation.  
The boundaries between prototyping, piloting, and  
implementation are fluid. Full implementation might  
need us to initiate a large technical process, even refit  
a production line – steps which are very expensive to  
change later. Or implementation might just be a case of a  
handful of people doing their jobs differently. Whatever  
the scale of the change, there are some common patterns  
as we move into “everyday business”\:  
→  
Switching to production systems  
New services or new products,01 whether ­ physical  
or digital, run within the real context, in a given  
­ environment and system.  
01 The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In academia,  
products are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually bundles of services and  
physical/digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as referring to something tangible, we prefer to  
speak of the term physical/digital products. Read more on this in the textbox Service-dominant logic in 2.5.  
→  
W orking with actual employees  
Employees that were not involved in the service design  
process now have to execute new processes, even though  
they might not truly believe in them.  
→  
Main focus on business goals  
Services and physical or digital products are sold at full  
price. The main focus shifts toward core business goals  
and away from innovation.  
→  
Integration into existing \(eco\)systems  
The services or products, whether physical or digi-  
tal, are embedded into existing \(legacy\) IT systems,  
­ environments, and legal frameworks, as well as function-  
ing partner ­ networks and \(eco\)systems.  
→  
Integration into existing KPI frameworks  
New business metrics are integrated into existing and  
regularly monitored KPI frameworks.  
→  
“Business as usual”  
The customer no longer perceives the offering as beta.  
Employees no longer perceive it as pilot.  
→  
Iterations/changes/adaptations get more expensive  
As we progress toward implementation changes become  
increasingly difficult and expensive. Therefore, organiza-  
tions tend to avoid changes at this stage. 08 Implementation  
272/273  
# Pilots\: Prototypes  
# or implementation?  
In a way, a pilot is a prototype of implementation, as it faces many  
of the challenges of communicating processes and intent to people  
who were not part of the earlier parts of the design project.  
Pilots are the small-scale operation  
of new services and processes in a  
localized context. They can be seen as  
an overlap between prototyping and  
implementation. A pilot reveals many  
challenges a prototype faces during  
larger rollouts, as it includes employ-  
ees who have never seen the concept  
before, as well as paying customers in  
a normal business context. We learn  
not only about how the service will  
work, but how it might be introduced  
and how it will affect other running  
services and systems.  
On the other hand, a pilot is  
unlike full implementation. It is still  
a context for experimentation and  
learning, a test bed for trial and test-  
ing.02 Everything is very new, the staff  
inexperienced, and some parts of the  
service might still be fakes or work-  
arounds outside the standard business  
systems. More importantly, the design  
team are fully focused on the activity,  
and are always nearby to explain the  
“how” and – perhaps more important-  
ly – the “why.” In the wild, they will not  
be so near at hand. Management focus  
is also usually quite strong, which can  
have a noticeable effect on the staff  
members taking part. ◀  
02 See 8.6.4, Case\: Creating measurable business impact through piloting  
and implementing service design projects, for a great example of the  
crucial role of piloting in gathering hard economic data to support your  
service design work. This is Service Design Doing  
8.1.2 Planning for human-centered  
implementation  
It is often valuable to consider your implementation  
activities as a separate project within your service  
design project. In this implementation project you need  
to consider frontline and backstage staff, and all im-  
plementation partners, as your primary target audi-  
ence. Think about\:  
→ Research  
Who is or needs to be involved? What will the rollout/  
implementation experience look like? What are key  
obstacles or needs that need to be addressed?  
→ Ideation  
How might you create a great implementation or rollout  
experience? How might you effectively build the final  
offering? How might you scale?  
→ Prototyping

# 8.2 SERVICE DESIGN AND  
# CHANGE MANAGEMENT  
AUTHOR  
Jürgen Tanghe  
Some service designers consider their work done once  
they have proposed a new concept, in the form of a man-  
agement pitch, a service blueprint, or a \(working, func-  
tioning\) prototype. They fail to fulfill the last phase of the  
service design process. This situation is akin to a product  
designer designing the most beautiful, ergonomic, func-  
tional, and ecological chair …then failing to produce it.  
Artifacts of services come in a variety of forms, in-  
cluding physical, like a document or check-in desk, and  
digital, like a website or app. Also, in most services there  
is a human interaction element that is the essence of ser-  
vice\: someone \(the service provider\) helping somebody  
\(the customer\) to achieve something.  
This means the organization and the people in the  
organization become the “material” you are producing  
the service with. This section will help you work with  
this them to get your design fully implemented.01  
Design involves desired behavior  
Explicitly or implicitly, a designed service always  
­ involves establishing a desired way for both the cus-  
tomer and the service provider to behave. Therein lies  
the challenge for change management in service design.  
01 The importance of design doing, craft, and material knowledge for making is nicely described by Jon Kolko.  
See Design Thinking Foundations \(2012, January 26\). “Design Thinking vs. Design Doing,” at https\://vim-  
eo.com/35710033.  
274/275  
8.2.1  
How can we make people change their behavior, so that  
it is beneficial for the customer experience? Many tradi-  
tional banks are redesigning their retail experience, for  
example, by creating a more open layout. But this only  
works when bank employees also change – they need to  
be more hosts than bankers, more advisors than tellers.  
Know how people change  
The reality is that organizations themselves don’t change;  
only people do, and ideally an organization supports  
that behavior. This means that the only real measure of  
change is\: “Do people act differently?”  
Be change  
While many claim that people hate change \(“the only  
person who likes change is a baby with a wet diaper”\),  
the truth is more complex. People change constantly,  
and they love some changes. Oftentimes, people are even  
willing to make big life changes to meet a goal, such as  
relocating to work for a particular employer.  
You can’t change people\: Set up the context  
for change instead  
Behavioral change is both simple and complex. On the  
one hand, people change all their lives, all the time – it is  
a rather natural activity. On the other hand, ­ deliberately This is Service Design Doing  
changing can be difficult, even if the stakes are really  
high. Just look at how difficult it is for people to adopt a  
healthy lifestyle even if they really want to or when their  
lives are at risk.  
The probability of people changing their ­ behavior  
­ depends on three factors\: \(1\) how much they under-  
stand that they must change, \(2\) how much they want  
to change, and \(3\) how much they can change. In other  
words\: MUST\*WANT\*CAN or Drive\*Motivation\*Ability.  
These three factors hold the ingredients to make individual,  
­ lasting behavioral change in organizations happen.  
With this formula in hand we can draw up the  
circumstances and context that give people the biggest  
chance of changing their behavior in a way that is beneficial  
for the service. Chances of success are biggest if we can\:  
→  
Start with motivation.  
→ Do one small, specific, but significant thing  
differently.  
→ Adapt the environment to make it as easy as possible.  
→ Establish a relationship with a group of people  
accustomed to that behavior.  
→ Grow from there to a new definition of your identity.  
Understanding what will change  
Before you can make any form of change ­ strategy,  
you need to understand the consequences of the  
new service to the organization. What will need to  
work ­ differently in the organization for the service  
to become real?  
8.2.2  
One classic and easy-to-apply analysis framework  
is Leavitt’s Diamond, a model that is composed of four  
elements\: task, people, technology, and structure. In  
essence, this model proposes that for an organization  
to be successful, the four elements need to be aligned  
and balanced. Imagine you have a sandwich bar, serving  
fresh, made-to-order sandwiches\:  
→  
Task\: This describes what the staff is ­ expected to  
do. What is the job of each of the roles? In the sand-  
wich bar, you might have someone to take orders,  
somebody to make the sandwiches, and somebody to  
collect the money.  
→  
People\: Think about the people you need in your  
organization. What knowledge and skills do they need,  
and do they require any formal training or education?  
How many people do you need?  
→  
Structure\: Structure is about how the organization  
is organized. This includes how departments are struc-  
tured, but also what is measured and monitored, and how  
decisions and made? To be efficient, you could imagine  
that the decision rules would be flexible enough to allow  
staff to accommodate special requests for a sandwich that  
isn’t listed on the menu \(if the bar has the necessary in-  
gredients\) – staff shouldn’t need to ask for permission to do  
this. Also, you will probably have some kind of monitor-  
ing system to assess customer satisfaction, the freshness  
of the food, and maybe the success of the daily specials. 08 Implementation  
→  
Technology\: These are all the tools, digital and  
analog, that are needed for the staff to perform their  
tasks efficiently and effectively. In our sandwich shop,  
this would include a decent knife and a cash register, but  
also maybe a checklist with instructions for how to make  
that daily special.  
As a service designer, you can use this framework in  
multiple ways. First, you can see if you have thought  
of all the aspects of the service system. Second, any  
change introduced to the organization will impact one  
or more of these four elements; you can use this frame-  
work to map them, and thus to manage all of those  
­ potential impacts.  
There are several ways to do this impact analysis.  
However, it is always important to involve the ­ people  
STRUCTURE  
TASK TECHNOLOGY  
PEOPLE  
Leavitt’s Diamond\: an analysis framework  
to understand elements of change  
276/277  
who can judge the impact, because they know the  
­ current status. You can do this type of impact analysis\:  
1 As a checklist for yourself  
Of course, you can just go over your concept and reflect  
on the impact on the different elements. This might work  
if you know the organization really well.  
2 Based on a service blueprint  
If you are accustomed to working with a service  
­ blueprint, it is a good basis for an impact analysis. Look  
at all the staff actions, and assess how they will be differ-  
ent from now, what support the staff will need, and what  
could go wrong. With the right people in the room, this  
is an interesting use of a blueprint in a workshop.  
3 Using interviews  
Based on the model, you can ask people what they think  
the impact would be. It is essential that they understand  
the concept well to make that judgment.  
4 As part of prototyping and testing  
You can integrate this model into your ­ evaluation routines  
when prototyping and testing. In that way, you can not  
only test the desirability but also the feasibility of your  
prototype, and let it evolve to more fidelity.  
Beliefs and emotions  
There are two more things you should remember about  
change. First, for a long time we thought that the key to get-  
ting people to change was answering “What’s in it for me?”

EXIT AND RE-ENTER  
AT ANY STAGE  
This not only is a very transactional way of looking at peo-  
ple, but has also been proven to be wrong. Actually,  
once you can establish the need for change and a minimal  
level of motivation, the most important question that peo-  
ple have is “How can I do this? How can I be good at it?”  
The psychologists Carlo DiClemente and James  
Prochaska developed the transtheoretical model \(TTM\)  
of behavioral change. As the graphic shows, most of  
the steps are related to the belief that you are able to  
make the change.  
Second, we need to remember the power of emotions.  
Emotions are the biggest driver of behavior; that is where  
the energy comes from and that is where action starts.  
It can be very hard, or nearly impossible, to convince  
people to take action or change based on pure rational  
­ arguments. One of the strengths of designers and design  
thinkers is being in contact with the emotions of people  
in an organization, and this strength should be utilized  
in change management efforts.  
Based on this knowledge, there are three key tactics  
that are very powerful to both deal with organizational  
impact and support behavioral change\:01  
1 Use a human-centered and  
stakeholder-focused approach  
Just as you would do a stakeholder map of the ser-  
vice environment, it is essential early in the project to  
map the internal stakeholders. You can use Leavitt’s  
Diamond to get more richness in the descriptions of  
your ­ stakeholders’ organizational positions. Also, use  
the same empathy you used toward the customers to  
really understand your stakeholders. There is a lot of  
writing about “resistance to change” or “unwillingness.”  
Sometimes there is a real resistance or unwillingness  
because of a political agenda or personal ambitions, but  
in many cases people have \(from their perspective\) very  
good and valid reasons to oppose changes that others are  
trying to impose on them. You can find those reasons, if  
you are willing to use your empathy.  
01 See 8.6.1, Case\: Empowering employees for sustainable implementation of a service design project, for an example  
of how some of those key tactics can be successfully applied to achieve outstanding service. 08 Implementation  
278/279  
2 Participation and co-creation  
Working co-creatively is one of the key principles of  
­ service design. Not coincidentally, participation in de-  
cision making has been proven to be essential in change  
management because basically there is a reverse cor-  
relation\: high participation leads to low resistance; low  
participation leads to high resistance. This means you  
should see co-creation as part of both the creation and the  
implementation process; in addition, you should make  
deliberate use of those co-creative sessions to prepare the  
organization for implementation. One of the challenges is  
scaling. You cannot invite the whole ­ organization to join  
a co-creation session, so you need to help the participants  
use their experiences within their own teams. You might  
also want to run more sessions than might be strictly  
necessary for your design process.  
3 \(Visual\) storytelling  
For all the ingredients that support change – transferring  
a sense of necessity, creating emotional appeal, giving  
instructions on what is the right thing to do – there is a  
method that people have been using since the beginning  
of human development. That is the power of the story.  
Stories and the heroes in them are also one of the basic  
elements of an organizational culture.

# 8.3 SERVICE DESIGN AND  
# SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT  
AUTHOR  
Klaus Schwarzenberger  
How to create and maintain a meaningful  
development backlog  
In this section we will explore how to connect ­ service de-  
sign methods with popular agile approaches in software  
development and engineering. Service design helps an-  
swer one of the most challenging questions at hand\: what  
should we actually build and how should it be prioritized?  
As most agile methods today focus on the engineering  
team and the actual implementation, it’s service design  
that helps to fill the backlogs with meaningful stories.  
Today, almost all customer experiences include a  
digital experience at some point. The hard part is to  
­ harness those different channels and technologies and  
build a product or service that actually serves the custom-  
er’s needs. Quite often, utilizing technology of all kinds  
makes stuff harder to use. Take, for instance, the early days  
of “car apps” that enabled you to open your car without a  
key. Instead of just pressing a button on the key \(one step\),  
users had to get out their phones, unlock them, open the  
app, and press a button \(four steps\) to achieve the same  
thing. This system had other flaws too\: what are users  
supposed to do when their phones run out of battery, for  
example? The same applies to the Internet of Things \(IoT\)  
and connected devices. It’s a cool thing if you are able to  
turn on a light with your phone, but again, an empty bat-  
tery or broken phone can make the whole thing useless.  
Because services and software are intangible and  
often inherently complex, it is crucial to make sure that  
all stakeholders are on the same page and involved in  
the process right from the start. If this principle were  
boiled down it would be\: seeing is believing. Everybody  
in the team must do user research. To fully understand  
the customer’s needs and provide a suitable solu-  
tion, user stories, roadmaps, and fancy descriptions  
are not enough.  
The alternative can be as easy as adding your lead  
developers and designers to the support email ­ channel  
to make sure they see where customers get stuck. On top  
of that, empower them to actually make decisions based  
on their research results, and feature discussions will  
change immediately.  
8.3.1  
Basic factors  
There are some basic “hygiene factors” that should be  
considered before you start applying a service design  
process to software projects. Some of them are technical,  
but most are more “people stuff.”  
We won’t go into too much detail when it comes  
to the technical bits, since they may differ from indus-  
try to industry. 08 Implementation  
Agile  
In software engineering the rise of Agile started in 2001,  
when Kent Beck et al. released the Agile Manifesto.01  
But before that, the CHAOS Report,02 initially published  
by the Standish Group in 1994, brought awareness of  
failed projects in software development. The problem  
was that the same project management approaches that  
worked in the construction industry were used for soft-  
ware projects, but the complexity and changing require-  
ments made a mess of things.  
Instead of trying to plan ahead \(and ­ constantly  
­ rewriting the script as unexpected developments arise\),  
the Agile Manifesto was a starting point for a different  
­ approach. Different methods, like Scrum, XP, ASD,  
Crystal, and APM, arose. Over the last couple of years  
most companies have followed one or a combina-  
tion of these approaches with different levels of rigor.  
Everybody tweaked the methods to their needs, but no  
one admitted that they had “their own” system.  
In 2015 Andy Hunt introduced the GROWS  
Method,03 which actually boiled down all the different  
agile methodologies to their core principles. It’s a set of  
methods from which a team can pick and choose for  
a given situation. No matter whether you are run-  
ning a clean implementation of one of those meth-  
ods or making your own version, they are based on  
these principles\:

→  
Adhering to timeboxes \(sprints, iterations\)  
→ Maintaining a backlog of some sort \(a list of ­ features  
that is prioritized\) for the next iteration  
→ Following a meeting structure to collect feedback  
\(daily stand-ups, weekly planning sessions, retro-  
spective meetings\)  
Lean  
Lean is more a mindset, and in our company we call it  
“entrepreneurial common sense.”04 In a nutshell, it’s the  
organizational foundation for working with Agile. It em-  
phasizes early feedback, experiments, and “cheap” failures.  
“Fail early, fail cheap” is one of its mantras. We think it’s  
important to mention because it is really easy to be agile,  
but not lean. This means you can work in a way which is  
perfectly aligned with the Agile Manifesto while not actu-  
ally aiming for a minimum viable product, collecting early  
user feedback, or following tracer bullet development.  
Minimum viable product  
A minimum viable product \(MVP\) in software  
­ development is a piece of software that contains just  
enough features to be deployed and tested by real users.05  
The idea is to boil down a product to the core problem  
that it solves and aim to find a minimum solution to the  
problem. It should be just useful enough to find out if the  
assumptions about the product idea are true, and how  
to improve it. Defining an MVP usually requires a lot of  
04 05 There’s an awesome German word for “entrepreneurial common sense”\: Hausverstand.  
Ries, E. \(2011\). The Lean Startup\: How Today’s Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically  
Successful Businesses. Crown Books. This is Service Design Doing  
discussion. What can help is to define the job that the  
user actually has to do \(job to be done\) as the job story,01  
derive the MVP from that definition, then ­ validate the  
need with potential users. Work on a solution and create  
a sh!tty first draft. Ask again. Iterate on it. And accept  
that your assumptions will change.  
However, keep in mind that you should still apply  
at least some basic technical hygiene factors when it  
comes to building a software prototype. The boundaries  
between throwaway code and actual production code  
can be blurry. If a tracer bullet development turns out to  
be a huge success, if you are not careful you might end  
up with temporary code runnning in production.  
Early user feedback  
For early user feedback you don’t actually need an MVP.  
User feedback starts long before you have a digital product  
at hand. It can be a cardboard prototype, a desktop walk-  
through, a paper prototype, a click dummy, or anything  
else that is detailed enough to ask potential customers  
what they think about it. Make early feedback a habit and  
aim for testable products after every iteration.02Again,  
this is not something that only product managers should  
do; designers, engineers, and team members from other  
disciplines should be involved as well. Create teams of two  
or three people from different disciplines and give them a  
task – for instance, to collect feedback on feature X, or test  
assumptions on prototype Y. Then ask them to present  
01 02 Klement, A. \(2013\) “Replacing the User Story with the Job Story,” at https\://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-  
with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27.  
For an overview of prototyping methods see 7.2, Prototyping methods.  
their research results to the rest of the team. This is an  
ideal foundation for ideation and again prototyping.  
Tracer bullet development  
Let’s face it\: some service innovations lead to technically  
challenging solutions. In order to tackle those big prob-  
lems early on \(and make sure they are solvable\), it’s best  
to follow the tracer bullet approach, initially published  
by Andy Hunt and David Thomas.03 In their book, they  
propose that tracer bullet development is comprised of  
two components\:  
1 Address the most technically challenging tasks  
as soon as possible.  
2 Deliver a useful result as soon as possible.  
We will focus on the first of these, since the second is ad-  
dressed via early user feedback and MVP development.  
Just as a tracer bullet gives an idea of the target area, the  
term in software engineering involves trying different  
approaches to challenging ideas as soon as ­ possible,  
trying to figure out which one “might” work.  
While prototypes are often just mocks that imitate  
functionality, a tracer bullet is “fired” to, for example,  
check the range of certain Bluetooth technologies very  
early in an IoT project. It contains code that might run in  
the ­ final product. A tracer bullet is the engineers’ version  
of a wireframe that is tested with users. It gives an idea of  
what might work and what doesn’t – no more, but no less.

03  08 Implementation  
Technical hygiene factors  
Rapid development, short iteration cycles, and the im-  
mediate application of changes pose huge challenges for  
the technical foundation of a project. When you apply a  
test-driven development approach to a very early \(and  
still likely to change\) prototype of an idea, you are facing  
a trade-off between maintainability and the risk of wast-  
ing time and money.  
What can you – as a service designer – learn from these  
approaches? How do you do service design reviews?  
How do you keep track of changes in your designs?  
Have you set up or automated essential tasks to be able  
to prototype more quickly and collect feedback faster?  
It is hard to go into detail here, since the technical hy-  
giene factors differ from one programming language to  
another and are specific to your technology stack. There  
are, however, four technical factors that every project of  
any status should have implemented\:  
→  
→  
→  
→  
Code versioning  
Code reviews  
Build automation  
Documentation \(even if it is hard to do\)  
These are the minimum standards to incorporate in any  
project involving software, even at a very early stage.  
In later stages of a project, those technical ­ standards  
need to be elevated to a higher level and may include  
the following\:  
282/283  
→  
→  
→  
→  
→  
Style guides  
Dependency management  
Test-driven approach  
Log, error, and performance monitoring  
…  
There is no definitive list of factors to implement at  
a particular stage. Just be aware of them and make  
conscious decisions on whether you want to implement  
certain standards.  
8.3.2  
Implementation  
This section describes a typical lifecycle in a software  
project. It works both for an early-stage idea that is being  
tested for the first time and for the continuous improve-  
ment of a product. We will discuss implementation-spe-  
cific concerns for software projects.  
Preparation  
Before starting a new iteration, you must define the  
scope. A good way to frame it is to define a user job; for  
example, “When I drive from my hometown to work,  
I want to be automatically notified about any traffic  
jams so that I can get to the office on time.” Rather than  
focusing on specific target groups, the idea of user jobs is  
that anybody could be in that situation at some point. It  
moves away from the classic concept of user stories that  
define scope by focusing on a specific target group that  
wants something \(“As a millennial I want notifications This is Service Design Doing

and focuses more on the context itself, instead targeting  
particular situations that all users might experience. It’s a  
foundation and usually the job will change, or new jobs  
will be added. At this stage, it is a starting point.01  
01 See Writing user stories in 5.3.  
While traditional sprints in software engineering are  
timeboxed and take two or four weeks, the activities in-  
troduced here can have different lengths. The time need-  
ed for research, for example, depends on the complexity  
of the research question being tested. On the other hand,  
ideation is something that is usually done within a day.  
If you aim to integrate service design into software  
engineering long term, it’s best to divide parts of the  
processes into team activities and individual activities.  
Workshops are an exhausting activity not just for the  
facilitator, but specifically for developers. Carefully  
separate activities like prototyping into team activities  
\(mini-hackathons\) and individual tasks \(tracer bullet  
development\) and give each team member time to work  
on their own before jumping back to team activities. 08 Implementation  
Idea wall  
Look out for any ideas that pop up, either during ­ research  
for a different topic, in interviews with ­ customers, or sim-  
ply because you have used your prototype/­ software your-  
self and come up with an idea. You’ll soon need a physical  
or virtual place to store your ideas and to collect user feed-  
back that supports those ideas or contradicts them\: an idea  
wall. Do a review of your idea wall before every iteration.  
Ask your team \(or even better, your customers\) to vote for  
their favorite ideas, and then prioritize and create job sto-  
ries for each of those ideas that will go into development.  
Unless you implement faster than you generate ideas, you’ll  
end up with a prioritized job story backlog. Before each  
iteration, choose the ones that you want to focus on during  
the next development cycle, again either by asking your  
team or your customers to vote for their favorites.  
Research  
When we start out with a user job, we follow a deductive  
approach. So, we have an assumption, and we search our  
database, logs, interview documentation, and other cus-  
tomer knowledge for data that falsifies our hypothesis.  
This can be a limiting factor because we might skip data  
that is unrelated but still very important.  
In contrast, an inductive approach forces you to  
crawl your data for deeper structures. This can be as easy  
as checking recent support emails \(say, going back about  
two months\) to look for patterns that are mentioned  
more often or in combination with each other.  
No matter which method you choose to imple-  
ment, you’ll need to find several team members that are  
284/285  
responsible for the research phase. Ideally those people  
should have different backgrounds – for example, pair  
a backend engineer with a designer and let both indi-  
vidually do research on a topic. Make sure to brief them  
properly\: research is not about “finding data that fits my  
idea.” That’s why deductive approaches can be risky. You  
have to find out what works best in your team. At the  
beginning, they might be overwhelmed by an ­ inductive  
approach. While only a few are responsible for the  
­ research, bring the whole team on board if possible and  
let them contribute to the research results.  
Usually research will have already started in the im-  
plementation/prototyping phase of a previous iteration.  
While it is important to focus on the research for the up-  
coming iteration, you should not forget the big picture.  
Usually after every second, third, or fourth iteration we  
ask ourselves\: Are we still on track? Do we need to shift  
priorities? Did anything new and important emerge that  
changes our \(bigger\) plans? Team members then collect  
data from any available source, like\:  
→ Research data and insights from previous  
sprints or activities  
Support conversations  
Interviews with existing/potential customers  
Usage data about an existing product  
Analytics data from websites  
External sources like studies  
Desk research about competitors or the market  
→ Conversations at conferences,  
meetups, and the like

EXPERT TIP  
“If you have a running  
product out there, you  
could also try preto-  
typing\: add a button for  
that fancy new feature  
idea, but instead of  
implementing the actual  
functionality just add a  
feedback form that asks  
your customers what they  
would expect to find. You  
will easily find out two  
things\: Will anybody click  
at all? And if so, what did  
they expect to happen?”  
—  Klaus  
Schwarzenberger  
The data is collected on a research wall in preparation for  
the next activity\: ideation. Research works best if your  
team members have some time to do it. Depending on  
the size and complexity of the job/topic, allow up to four  
weeks for data collection.  
To present the research results, have each of the team  
members that were involved in the research activities de-  
fine their three to five key findings individually. Compare  
and discuss these together, and try to boil them down to  
five key findings.  
Every single one of the following steps will contain  
another research/feedback activity at some point.  
Ideation and mini-sprint  
Set up a workshop and block off one day for it. Get  
­ everybody on the project team into one room. Present the  
research results to your team and let them know every-  
thing that you’ve learned. Answer all their ­ questions, and  
also let them know about any doubts and limitations you  
have uncovered. This part usually takes up to one hour.  
Now divide the team into several groups of two to  
four people. Give each team the chance to discuss the  
results and their views on them. Next, generate as many  
ideas as possible using whatever method you prefer. A  
round of 10 plus 1001 works well and is a good combination  
of individual work and team effort.  
At the end of the first ideation step, each team should  
come up with one idea to continue with. Depending on  
their knowledge about service design, a next step could  
01 See 10 plus 10 in 6.4.  
be a journey map, a first paper prototype, or anything  
that illustrates the idea and makes it testable. Each team  
should aim for a sh!tty first draft.02 Ideally, they will have  
the chance to test their first prototype with one of the  
other teams to see if it solves the problem.  
At the end of this activity you will have gone through  
ideation, prototyping, and some research. Usually in  
software teams, these workshops are held on a monthly  
basis, depending on the status of the research activities.  
Software prototyping  
Prototypes are there to be tested.03 Depending on the  
technical dependencies, prototyping activities are all  
about either tracer bullet development \(to figure out  
which approach might technically work\) or gathering  
early user feedback and data. So at the end of this itera-  
tion there should be a working digital prototype that can  
be tested with real users. The next step can be another set  
of research and ideation activities, or if the feedback is  
positive\: implementation.  
Depending on the complexity, this prototype can  
be the actual implementation or a rough sketch of an  
algorithm that is intended to solve a complex problem  
without touching edge cases of any kind. From a graphical  
point of view we can differentiate between low-fidelity  
\(lo-fi\) prototypes and high-fidelity \(hi-fi\) prototypes.  
Aim for lo-fi at first and add more details during the  
actual implementation.

EFFORT FOR PLANNING/PROTOTYPING/ITERATING  
Build and implement  
It is essential to have a solid framework for your ­ research,  
ideation, and prototyping activities when working on  
any bigger feature \(they are usually called “epics”\) that  
is going into implementation. This section ends where  
most resources on Scrum, Kanban, and so on usually  
begin\: with the product backlog. After finishing research,  
ideation, and prototyping, the results should be sum-  
marized in a requirements document. Together with  
the engineering team, schedule a planning session to  
286/287  
MANAGING  
COMPLEXITY  
Tracer bullet development is invaluable to get a first glimpse  
of ­ technical feasibility in complex projects. One or two  
­ developers explore potential solutions for the most challenging  
problems. The result is not “production-ready” code but  
a better understanding of the problem.  
It is actually a form of prototyping; even if it fails it  
produces valuable results.  
create a list of tasks or stories that need be worked on to  
fulfill the requirements in the epic. Then follow which-  
ever approach works best for your team and iteratively  
­ implement the features. Define deadlines, estimate the  
effort, and make sure that any area of uncertainty is  
touched as soon as possible to avoid blockers at the end  
of the development cycle.  
Aim for a demo day at least once per week where  
product managers and lead developers check in on This is Service Design Doing  
the progress and give early feedback. Again, seeing is  
­ believing. By collecting early feedback from stakeholders,  
you can avoid expensive feedback loops right before the  
feature release. The aim of every iteration should be a  
running, usable piece of software.  
Release  
The complexity of your release management activities  
will depend on the stage of your project. While in early  
prototyping you might just throw away everything and  
start from scratch, this will not be possible when users  
are relying on your product. What is a “test” for you is a  
finished product for them. As soon as you start to have  
users actually using your service, consider the following\:  
→  
Have a testing routine\: No matter if you go with  
automated tests from the start, have someone testing  
the features, or do it yourself, document your testing  
routine and do it carefully to avoid critical bugs ­ appearing  
in production. Ideally, set up a “staging environment”  
where people can test everything, like for the “real  
thing” in production.  
→  
Communicate properly\: Let users know  
what’s going to happen. Will the update break some-  
thing they were used to? Will your service go offline  
for some hours?  
→  
Make releases robust\: Whether you’re building a  
­ mobile app, a hardware product with integrated software,  
or a web-based tool, make sure that releases won’t wreck  
your nerves. You should be able to easily roll back if some-  
thing goes wrong. You should be able to release a new ver-  
sion within a couple of minutes and without downtime.  
Ideally, no manual work should be required for each new  
release, except pressing the button.  
→  
Ask for feedback as soon as possible\: Again, this  
point can’t be stressed enough.  
Making the change  
Giving a common ­ language to teams is the biggest im-  
provement that service design brings to software engi-  
neering. Scrum, Kanban, XP, and other methodologies  
focus on the ­ engineering part while service design helps  
to answer the questions of what to build and how to  
prioritize that work. For people accustomed to being on  
the receiving end of requirements documents, the team  
approach can be quite uncomfortable.01 When you are in a  
facilitator role, try to aim for a slow transition with lots of  
guidance in the beginning, slowly making the tasks more  
open and challenging.  
01 See 8.6.3, Case\: Implementing service design in a software startup, for an example of how to implement the idea of  
an iterative process across your entire team. 08 Implementation

# 8.4 SERVICE DESIGN AND  
# PRODUCT MANAGEMENT  
AUTHORS  
Patricia Stark  
and Erich Pichler  
One way to describe the essence of product management  
is shown in the product management Venn diagram by  
Martin Eriksson. You, as a product manager, are right in  
the center of negotiating the user needs \(user experience  
or UX\) against technological feasibility, business targets,  
and the strategic goals of the company.  
For a great UX and to achieve the business goals,  
the role of services within the value ­ proposition is be-  
coming increasingly important. As a result, the role of the  
product manager is expanding from managing the prod-  
uct to managing the whole value ­ proposition, including  
all the different services, over the product lifecycle.  
The following sections outline the different phases of  
the product lifecycle, as illustrated in the diagram. They  
provide an overview of major challenges, typical tasks  
for a product manager, and some industry examples. In  
addition, possible use cases for applying service design in  
each phase are described.

Imagination phase  
The very first phase in product management is all  
about imagining the future. You need to explore your  
­ current business model and strategy with regard to  
new solutions. The challenge is to find potential areas  
of ­ innovation to generate value for your existing or  
future customers.  
These areas will need to be aligned with your  
company’s vision for the future. There is no one-size-  
fits-all approach and no turnkey solution when it comes  
to innovation. In a project manager’s reality, there may  
be many reasons to urgently need something new, like  
perhaps a new competitor, a decrease in turnover, new  
technologies, or the end of life of an existing product.  
As a product manager, you are expected to have a  
deep understanding of your customers, but also of the  
industry, data, and business. In order to get a deep-  
er understanding of your customers and users and  
­ quickly evaluate ideas, service design or design thinking  
­ methods and tools play a major role in modern ­ product  
management. Based on research and exploration,  
customer journey maps, personas, and early prototypes  
are often used in an industrial context and are the basis  
for any development. Although prototypes are built and  
refined in all phases of the lifecycle, the service design  
concept of early, rough prototyping adds value at this  
stage. The more concepts you can test and learn from  
in this early phase, the more likely it is that the right  
­ problems will be solved later on. This is Service Design Doing  
# Lessons learned  
# from service design  
BY PATRICIA STARK  
Beijing on a sunny morning in  
spring 2009. I got up early to  
see our product, an ATM ma-  
chine, in a newly opened bank  
branch close to the hotel where  
I was staying. I was a young  
product manager responsible  
for the Chinese market and  
curious to see the new ATM lo-  
cation. The branch had already  
opened a few weeks before, so  
when I arrived I was surprised  
that the transportation legs  
\(needed to allow transportation  
by forklift\) were still installed  
on the ATMs. I was astonished  
for three reasons. First, the only  
purpose of those legs was for  
transportation; second, because  
the market requirement was to  
lower the user interfaces of the  
ATMs because users in China  
are a different height to users  
in Europe; and third, because  
Europe has rules and regulation  
about how an ATM has to be  
fixed to the ground. As I found  
out later that week, new ATMs  
in other Beijing branches were  
also still on these installation  
legs. I was curious to find the  
reason, so I talked to various  
people until I found the answer\:  
the way of cleaning in China.  
Cleaning staff simply pour out  
a bucket of water and then  
wipe the floor. So, if they had  
removed the transportation  
legs, the ATMs would have  
been flooded on a regular basis.  
It took some time to realize that  
a deeper customer understand-  
ing, stakeholder maps, and  
customer journeys would have  
already brought this insight to  
light at the imagination stage. ◀

Definition phase  
Yet, before the actual realization phase starts \(which  
often comes with a standardized process with a rather  
rigid project milestone concept and tight schedule\),  
there is typically a definition phase, which can have the  
form of a pre-project. At this stage you need to verify the  
concepts, build further prototypes \(e.g., for new inter-  
action concepts, new technology, new materials etc.\),  
test them, and alter them. Within this phase the product  
manager builds the foundation for future developments.  
According to Vijay Kumar, “The next challenge is to  
combine compatible and valuable concepts into reliable  
and ­ systemic solutions that are actionable for future  
successful implementation.”  
02  
A product requirement document has to be ­ created  
for further development. This document contains all the  
requirements a certain product has to fulfill and helps  
everyone in the later development better understand  
what the product is expected to do. Depending on your  
preferences, this can be a “real” ­ document, a spread-  
sheet, or a dedicated software solution. Besides customer  
requirements, as a product manager you have to prepare  
a holistic picture of the future ­ solutions and combine  
concepts. Thus, the product requirement document  
also includes the context – like industry standards \(e.g.,

size of machines, maximum weight etc.\), any relevant  
regulations \(e.g., regarding security or usability\), and  
also the business side. These requirements should also be  
accompanied by the prototypes and the learnings from  
early evaluation.  
This definition phase \(or pre-project\) is the basis for  
your realization phase, where the actual development of a  
physical product and/or service takes place. The definition  
phase is often conducted with a smaller team, but when it  
comes to realization the number of people involved increas-  
es rapidly, as do costs. Consequently, no matter whether  
your company has a waterfall approach or a more agile one,  
at some point you need a schedule, budget, and staff.  
The deliverable of the definition phase is typically a  
product requirement document, tested prototypes, and a  
project plan for the realization phase.

When it comes to the development of new products,  
speed is of great importance. “Because we pursue inno-

faster that great ideas get to market, the faster we earn  
money, build our brand, and extend our reach into the  
future.”

Generic product development process  
SYSTEM  
DESIGN  
TESTING AND  
REFINEMENT  
Yet, many companies still struggle to apply these  
concepts to the development of physical products. The  
reasons are manifold\: sometimes it is just not possible to  
split the final solution into smaller pieces \(think about  
some big machines in the recycling industry, for exam-  
ple\) or test it without the whole system. Many companies  
have introduced standardized processes for recurrent  
tasks and consequently follow a classical, milestone-driv-  
en project management approach for the development of  
physical products.  
A generic product development process during the  
phase of realization might look like the figure above, yet in  
practice it is never that linear and has iterations in it as well.  
During realization the role of the product manager is  
crucial. One of the most important tasks is to constantly  
remind the development team of the user needs. Due to  
the growth of service design, more and more product  
managers are using personas in the early phases of product  
definition. One approach that has turned out quite well  
in practice is to have members of the development team  
PRODUCTION  
RAMP-UP  
adopt these personas during realization. Basically, each  
team member adopts one persona and has to take care  
of that persona’s needs during the entire development  
process. In this context not only personas for customers  
are used, but personas for all kinds of stakeholders. In  
the case of an ATM, there might be personas for a service  
technician, a bank employee, or a third-party software  
provider. Whenever a new concept is reviewed or a  
milestone approached, each team member can assume  
the role of her persona and give feedback in the persona’s  
name. This is a simple but effective method to apply a  
service design tool during the realization phase.

Support/use phase  
When your product or solution is out in the market, you  
focus on market success and making profit. One model  
which can help you to decide which tasks are necessary 08 Implementation  
for your product to stay successful is the classical mar-  
keting lifecycle model.  
It distinguishes between different \(sub\)phases during  
the period when the product is offered to the market  
\(the sales period\). As a product manager it is crucial to  
­ monitor market success and to trigger the right actions  
during the market lifecycle in order to keep your product  
­ successful. In addition, you have to decide when a new  
product generation should be developed. Nevertheless,  
you have to keep in mind that in reality the lifecycle curve  
of your product might look very different from this  
idealized version and depends a lot on developments in  
the external environment \(new competition, new regula-  
tions, overall economic situation, and more\).  
As outlined in the remainder of this section, your  
tasks as a product manager will vary during the lifecy-  
cle stages, and each stage offers chances to use different  
service design tools.01  
1 Market introduction  
When introducing a new product you will need to get  
references, improve your sales channels, and probably  
eliminate teething troubles in your products. You can  
surmount these challenges if you have additional services  
ready, not only the product itself. Your sales channels  
should be properly trained and ready to provide you with  
customer feedback. You should be able to offer the right  
consulting and support to your customers so that they  
01 The service design approach should not be limited to your product management activities. See 8.6.2, Case\:  
Implementing service design to create experiences, momentum, and results in sales, for an example of how design  
thinking and doing can transform the way your sales team engages with your customers.  
292/293  
feel confident using your product as early adopters. An  
important tool to improve your offering at this stage is  
the customer journey map; monitor this closely so you  
can improve the customer experience by learning from  
your early customers. The example in the next section  
illustrates the importance of developing services related  
to the introduction of a new service and the impor-  
tance of designing these services based on the needs of  
all stakeholders.  
2 Market growth  
Growth means that your product has gained traction.  
You now want to accelerate the growth rate. How could  
you grow your market share faster? How could you find  
new sales channels and optimize your offer for these new  
channels? How could you improve your customer rela-  
tionships and your visibility? These are the questions you  
have to ask yourself. With new sales channels and new  
customers, you will feel the need to adapt and improve  
your product \(new features, new variants\). Think outside  
of the “product box” and consider services which could  
support these goals. Individualization becomes more and  
more important at this stage. After this, you will have to  
start again with the exploration of new customer groups  
and new applications for your products.  
Example\: An Austrian company developed a new  
innovative portable welding device, the first in its class.  
But after the market introduction they realized that peo-  
ple were reluctant to use the device and their ­ customer  
base was growing slowly. So, the product manager  
decided that he had to offer more than just the product This is Service Design Doing

to ­ customers and that another close look at the users was  
­ necessary. As part of a service design project, the com-  
pany gathered new user insights and developed concepts  
for additional services. Now they offer a whole solution  
consisting of the welding device, an accompanying  
software service for better and easier adjustment of the  
device, and a ready-to-weld transportation package. With  
these additional services and offerings they have been able  
to significantly increase their market growth.  
3 Market maturity  
You have reached a good market share and you are  
making sufficient profit with your product. But it would  
be a mistake to think everything is fine and you can  
lean back. Now you will have to deal with competition  
in the market. You will have to defend your market  
share and find measures to differentiate your offer from  
the competition and keep your business as profitable as  
before. Now the time has come when you should start  
thinking about your next-generation product. To in-  
crease the lifespan of your product, it might make sense 01 Polli, R., & Cook, V. \(1969\). “Validity of the Product Life Cycle.” The Journal of Business, 42\(4\), 385. 08 Implementation  
# Lessons learned  
# from service design  
BY PATRICIA STARK  
After my first workshop on service design  
with Prof. Birgit Mager from Cologne  
University, I immediately wanted to  
implement the approach. So I asked  
the sales staff at my company to orga-  
nize a few meetings with some friendly  
customers to create some customer  
­ journey maps together.  
These workshops were quite  
­ interesting. The most important pain  
point for the employees turned out to  
be the amount of time they spent ex-  
plaining new ATM machines and their  
functions to customers. They said that  
they were unable to do their actual  
work because they were standing in the  
self-service area explaining all day. At  
the workshops it became clear that they  
wished for some assistants to explain new  
functions at ATMs.  
So, we quickly recruited a dozen  
students from all over Austria, trained  
Co-created  
customer journey map  
them intensively at our headquarters, and  
then offered our customers \(the banks\) a  
service which provided assistants when  
they ordered new ATMs.  
How often do you think this service  
was sold? Not once. It turned out that our  
research had missed some important points.  
One was that bank managers don’t want  
non-employees \(our students\) to approach  
their customers. We iterated and went back  
to ­ exploration. We conducted contextual  
interviews and observed customers in the  
banks’ ­ self-service areas. The main finding  
was that if the bank employees are familiar  
with the ATMs and excited about their  
functions, the customers will be much more  
likely to use the machines as well.  
294/295  
So, instead of developing a new training  
program which showed employees how to  
best explain new functionalities, how to  
argue why ­ customers should use ATMs,  
and so on, we simply made a basic flyer  
aimed at employees. We briefly explained  
the content of the training and wrote that  
we wanted to train the bank employees  
at our premises to get them excited about  
the ATM and the ­ company behind it.  
Drumroll! Within a couple of weeks,  
our sales staff were selling the service  
purely on the grounds of this flyer \(which  
was our prototype\). And since then the  
fully developed course has become a suc-  
cessful product-related service during the  
introduction phase. ◀ This is Service Design Doing  
to relaunch the existing product or reposition your offer.  
By developing new, associated services and new revenue  
models you might be able to find new ways to differenti-  
ate your offer from the competition.  
4 Market decline  
The product is no longer attractive in the market.  
There are still customers buying it, but the profit is  
shrinking. Now your main goal is to avoid losses and  
hopefully prepare for the introduction of the next  
generation. To avoid losses you can reduce the inter-  
nal and external support costs by eliminating product  
variants. You should also think about how you can  
keep or increase your service profits – for example,  
you could offer updates and retrofit solutions to the  
existing customers.  
5 Support  
The use/support phase does not finish with the sales  
decline. Customers are still using the products and they  
still expect some product support \(repair, spare parts,  
retrofit solutions, and more\). So, work together with the

generation of solutions.  
Be aware that these stages might look different for your  
product. Nevertheless, service design offers product  
management a variety of tools and methods to make  
products even more successful during their lifecycle.

Retirement/disposal phase  
The product has reached its “end of life” and the  
­ customer disposes of it. You should use this last touch-  
point in the customer journey to introduce your new  
product generation and support the disposal process  
with useful services.  
The role of services for product management  
To sum up, the production, use, and circulation of  
­ products cannot be separated from associated services.  
Firms must not only focus on products or services,  
but should develop service–product combinations \(solu-  
tions\) to generate multiple revenue streams.  
The transition from a product manufacturer to an  
organization that also offers services is challenging.  
It might implicate organizational and business model  
changes, new value propositions to customers, different  
pricing strategies, and innovative approaches to making  
services marketable.  
Thus, today’s product managers have to discover  
new mindsets and methods, such as service design, to  
to generate tomorrow’s solutions by combining existing  
know-how and capabilities within the organization and  
along the whole supply chain.

# Lessons learned  
# from service design  
BY ERICH PICHLER  
When I was product manager for an ATM  
product line we faced the challenge that the  
existing product generation had been on  
the market for more than five years and the  
development of the successor product had  
not started yet.  
Our competitors had started to offer a  
new product generation and the ­ competition  
was becoming much stronger. So we decided  
to relaunch the existing product line. We fo-  
cused on two new aspects\: improved security  
and ­ economy. But the opportunities for tech-  
nical ­ product improvements were limited, so  
we had to offer not only the adapted prod-  
uct but also a complete new package with  
additional services. We offered new security  
services bundled together with the product.  
The relaunch was a success and we were  
able to keep the product competitive in the  
market for another five years. ◀ This is Service Design Doing  
# 8.5 SERVICE DESIGN AND  
# ARCHITECTURE  
AUTHOR  
Minka Frackenpohl  
This section sets out to connect two disciplines that  
originate from a similar background. However, the way  
they are performed is quite different. The aim here is to  
identify opportunities where architecture and service  
design can learn from each other and outline chances  
for them to merge.  
When graduating from architecture school in 2009,  
I presented a basic architectural structure. It consisted of  
a foundation slab and a concrete core, containing a bath-  
room, a kitchen, and a staircase. As well as the structure,  
a process was described to complete the basic house.  
In this process, the future inhabitants could build their  
houses themselves and develop them individually based  
on their needs and at their own pace. After the hand-  
over of this basic house to the residents, the new owners  
would decide how to use the building services offered.  
Within this service, clear anchor points were designed  
for the users to add material and build up knowledge  
or expertise. Overall, this project aimed at building the  
capacity of an ethnic group. The service created various  
touchpoints for inhabitants to use when needed.  
My auditors greeted me with incomprehension.  
Why should people design and build their own houses  
when there is an expert \(i.e., the architect\)? This experi-  
ence illustrates the dilemma of architecture\: the claim of  
an almost universal knowledge of the subject and about  
the future users. User needs are rarely identified prior  
to planning, nor are stakeholders part of the design and  
planning process. This means their needs and creative  
input are seldom included in the development of a build-  
ing. Classic architecture is understood as a manifested  
singular, to be used in its current form rather than being  
part of a process, used as one piece of a service ecosystem.  
The usage of a building may, however, change over time.  
Future-ready buildings need to be developed employing  
holistic building processes.  
In many countries, the architectural process is  
­ divided into clearly defined phases, structuring the ­ classical  
architecture project. The Royal Institute of British  
Architects \(RIBA\) has defined seven work stages, which  
are ­ described in the Plan of Work Framework. They reach  
from preparation \(appraisal and design brief\) to use and  
aftercare \(post-practical completion\). Within this frame-  
work, however, there is still a need for some additional  
aspects that may lay the groundwork for enriching the  
profession of architecture. The equivalent phases are  
obligatory within the service design process and rich with  
highly developed methods and tools\: a change of mindset  
from a singular to being one part of a system, identifica-  
tion of user needs, co-creation, and prototyping.  
In the following sections, six stages will be ­ described.  
These describe joint phases of the architectural or service 08 Implementation

design process and are matched to both or one of  
them. They identify possible areas for enriching the  
architectural practice with approaches and tools from  
service design.  
8.5.1  
Stage 1\: Mindset change  
The first stage sets the groundwork. Architecture has  
been viewed since modernity as a single static building  
or conglomerate of various forms. There is a great oppor-  
tunity in perceiving architecture as a process rather than  
a static building. In service design, we look at the whole  
system as the product, whereas in architecture the one  
product is the building. In order to make architecture  
part of a service ecosystem, the built environment must  
be redefined as one touchpoint and the building itself as  
a physical manifestation.  
Stakeholder maps can be used to make sure all the  
people involved in the lifecycle of a building \(everyone  
involved in designing, building, using, monitoring\)  
are represented. This helps to set the groundwork for  
integrating all \(built\) needs during the process. Creating  
an architectural customer journey of people using  
the building identifies touchpoints, whether service,  
product, or built.  
We worked with the team from Cowoki,01 a Cologne-  
based startup that provides coworking combined with  
childcare. During this project, we defined the journey for  
01 See http\://www.cowoki.de. This is Service Design Doing

various users of their service and set the focus on what  
the built space needed to provide in order to match the  
needs of different user groups \(e.g., community space,  
quiet areas, and telephone boxes\).

Stage 2\: Needs assessment

different spaces within the coworking space serve the  
needs of a coworker and a child.01

“Living and Residing as Seniors in Rural Areas.”03  
As architects, we should aim to deliver the best solution  
for the buildings’ users. For this reason, it is funda-  
mental to understand their specific needs. In the 1960s,  
the ­ concept of programming, or briefing, evolved in  
America.04 Programming is called Phase 0 in the archi-  
tectural process and different tools are used during this  
phase to gain knowledge about the later users of a build-  
ing. It is a research and problem-solving process, used to  
identify, examine, and elaborate various needs within a  
design project. Methods used are brainstorming, contex-  
tual interviews, benchmarking, building inspections, and  
relationship graphs. Programming is now part of the first  
phase within the American Institute of Architects’ service  
catalogue. However, in other ­ countries, such as Germany,  
it is not yet part of the official framework. This makes  
it difficult for a potential client to understand why to  
commission this extra step, and it is seldom assigned. In  
addition, if assigned, there are no recommendations for  
action or a structured approach to take the client along.

tectural Programming\: Creative Techniques for Design Professionals, McGraw Hill Professional. And see Sanoff,  
H. \(1977\) Methods of Architectural Programming. Dowden, Hutchinson & Ross. 08 Implementation  
As an example from the design perspective, IDEO  
worked together with the architect and staff members  
at the Stanford Center for Innovations in Learning. This  
project showed how the architectural process and the  
assessment of user needs can be united. The team did  
six weeks of research, including on-campus interviews,  
photo surveys, and shadowing, to understand the work  
process of the students and the Center’s staff and faculty.  
“This work informed the design documentation IDEO  
delivered, including visualizations of every aspect from  
architecture and furnishings to information systems and  
protocols of use.”05  
8.5.3  
Stage 3\: Creation  
When talking about new or creative methods in archi-  
tecture, user engagement within the pre-design phase is  
often mentioned \(as described earlier\). But what about  
integrating the stakeholders into the design phase and  
handing over the pen?  
Considerable efforts have been made to integrate  
stakeholders into the process of urban planning, reaching  
back to the 1940s, when the British government used  
reconstruction after World War II as an opportunity to  
engage the public. Planners created new techniques to  
05 IDEO \(n.d.\) “Multistory Teaching Environment.” Retrieved September 9, 2015, from http\://www.ideo.com/

communicate with laypeople such as mobilizing publicity,  
measuring public opinion, organizing exhibitions, and ex-  
perimenting with new visual strategies.06 For co-creation,  
various tools are conceivable \(e.g., idea generation, design  
scenarios, or storyboards\).  
In the book Architecture Is Participation \(Partizipation  
macht Architektur\), the Berlin-based ­ architecture compa-  
ny Baupiloten introduced their methods for participatory  
design.07 “Negotiate the dream space” is one method they  
work with. This board game uses activity and atmosphere  
cards to co-design space. In their project “Living and  
Residing as Seniors in Rural Areas,” stakeholders “ne-  
gotiated a future life in the country. Initially each player  
developed a vision for their personal area and then they  
negotiated the communal facilities for all of them, there  
was both a great need for privacy as well as a willing-  
ness for neighborly interaction – such as through the  
connection of two units by a common area for com-  
munal cooking and eating.” By creating a Dream Space  
Map, needs for spatial relationships and atmospheric  
­ qualities are revealed.

8.5.4  
Stage 4\: Testing  
Building architectural models is essential to every building  
project. Working models are built to study aspects of an  
architectural design or to communicate design ideas.  
Thus, an architectural model might be something used as  
a first quick prototype. Models are, however, rarely used  
in this way in daily architectural practice. Mostly they are  
built during the very last design phase and act as a visu-  
alization and sales tool for the finished design. Looking  
at it from a design thinking perspective, the possibilities  
of a prototype are manifold. By ­ introducing early-stage  
modeling, the design inevitably ­ benefits. Working models  
help the architects to understand their own designs better  
while supporting communication with the stakehold-  
ers and hence strengthening the ­ process and the trust  
between the parties. Tools used may include architectural  
staging, LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY®, or building prototypes.  
Baupiloten uses an exploration game they call “Test  
scenarios.” The game uses spatial modules in a specific  
architectural scale. “The aim is to enable users to adjust  
their needs and desires within the future built environ-  
ment, using these building blocks, which transfer easily  
into the design process because of their scale.”01  
As another “doing” example, we undertook a ­ semester  
project in cooperation with Deutsche Telekom. The stu-  
dents were to create ideas on smart housing, and pro-  
totyping was one part of the process. By creating proto-  
types, the students produced very deep, detailed ideas,  
01 Hofmann, S. \(2015\). Architecture Is Participation\: Die Baupiloten\: Methods and Projects. Jovis.  
and the concepts were truly enriched compared to the  
previous outcomes.  
8.5.5  
Stage 5\: Building  
After the building is planned, the architect functions as  
the touchpoint for contracting the craftspeople. Offers  
are collected, tested, and evaluated. Bidders are negotiated  
with and orders are placed. Additionally, the architect  
takes on the cost control of the building process. Once all  
tradespeople have been hired, the architect coordinates  
and ­ supervises the implementation. One could say that  
building is a rather technical phase. So where are opportu-  
nities for service design in this stage?  
A helpful tool that is often used is a “catalogue of  
intersections.” This catalogue details the planning pro-  
cess and the intersections between all involved parties.02  
Though it is not part of the officially mandated working  
documents, this helps keep an overview during the long  
building phase. Combining the catalogue of ­ intersections  
with a stakeholder map can have great effects on the  
smooth working of the building process.  
The craftsmen form an important interest group at  
this point of the architectural process. They are depen-  
dent on the architect’s planning, as well as obliged to  
fulfill standards within their fields of expertise. Speaking  
to them and enquiring what they need to render the best  
service they can should be in the architect’s interest as  
02 Fritsch + Tschaidse Architects, Munich. A  
08 Implementation

B  
well. However, the official requirements regulate ­ contact  
between architect and craftsmen solely in terms of tech-  
nical implementation. A structured assessment of the  
craftsmen’s needs and a clear definition of the intersec-  
tions between the trades can improve the process. For  
example, if there is a technical innovation within one  
craft, this novelty might have an impact on the design of  
the building and the architect might benefit from receiv-  
ing early information on it.  
The later users of the building don’t play a role ­ within  
the building phase. If you look at it from a technical  
point of view this seems quite logical. On the other hand,  
this stage marks the first visible touchpoint of the later  
building. At this point, users are eager to get engaged  
and receive information. This is a good time to reinvolve  
those parties, either by showing them the actual proj-  
ect status, confirming their needs \(to abe able to adopt  
possible changes in the detailed planning as soon as  
possible\), or even conducting a late co-creation work-  
shop targeting aspects which can still be changed \(e.g.,  
detailed planning, interior design\).

B Children building up a model for their own play area in “Le  
Buffet kids restaurant” based on their needs and imagination.03  
Stage 6\: Monitoring  
The last phase of the architectural process, monitoring,  
defines the use and aftercare activities after the building is  
finished. For example, for office buildings it is common to  
02 Photo\: HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd, in cooperation with Deutsche Telekom, Germany.  
03 Photo\: Baupiloten, Berlin. This is Service Design Doing  
hand over an operations and maintenance manual to the  
owner. This is a technical report which contains things like  
care instructions for the floors or operating instructions  
for the ventilation system as well as the built drawing.  
It generally does not include the human factors of using  
the building \(e.g., why certain decisions were made and  
how rooms can be used flexibly\). There is a lack of transfer  
from the findings of the needs assessment stage to the  
implemented use of the building. Within the German  
HOAI \(the schedule of services and fees for architects  
and engineers\), two obligatory services are described\:  
­ assistance in the release of guarantees and the compilation  
of graphic and textual documentation. As an additional  
special service, the architect may offer site ­ inspections for  
user groups after handover. However, this is the sole \(per-  
haps contracted\) post-build opportunity for the architect  
to re-engage with users. After this, once the building is  
in use, any earlier efforts in integrating stakeholders and  
especially users by assessing their needs are not reflected.  
Changes and the in-use evaluation of residential and  
office buildings, for example, are not part of the classi-  
cal architectural contract. Once a building is finished,  
the decisions made in planning are set in concrete. In a  
­ finished building one can’t easily remove walls or change  
the structure as one can within a classical service. Thus,  
how would a post-occupancy evaluation be of value?  
There are at least two reasons to expand the classical  
architectural process here. First, catching up with users  
helps manage the expectations set earlier and opens  
an exchange for ongoing improvements to the build-  
ing. Involving users could be done through feedback  
workshops using methods such as walkthroughs or “a day  
in the life”. In addition, it is a great opportunity for the  
architect to learn for the next project.  
8.5.7  
On the other side\: What can  
service design learn from architecture?  
Although this section focuses on improving the  
­ architectural process by integrating service design skills,  
there are options for service design to learn from the field  
of architecture.  
The title “architect” is protected, and it may only  
be used after intensive university study and evidence of  
practical experience. This ensures a consistent quality of  
delivered services. Due to the presence of architectural  
associations, architects have a united voice that allows  
them to address their needs in order to work profession-  
ally. The performance of the architect is structured within  
the work phases and the fees for the respective work  
phases are set in fee scales \(e.g., HOAI in Germany\).  
As these structures do not exist in the field of \(service\)  
design, there is a chance to establish an equal standard of  
quality in work and results.  
We have seen that there are various fields of op-  
portunities for service design doing in architecture.  
If ­ designers are able to dismantle the fixed structures  
within the architectural process, there are many possibil-  
ities to enable innovative space solutions that represent  
great physical touchpoints within service ecosystems.

IMPLEMENTATION OF A SERVICE DESIGN PROJECT  
# Best ride there is! How to create and maintain  
# a perfect customer experience  
AUTHOR  
Mario Sepp  
Founder, Gastspiel  
Edelweiss Bike Travel set out to  
orchestrate an even better experience  
for their customers. With the help of  
Gastspiel, Austria, they analyzed and  
improved their end-to-end customer  
journey. The most important factor  
was employee training.  
Initial situation\:  
A healthy company  
with tradition  
Edelweiss Bike Travel – the world’s  
leading company in guided motor-  
cycle tours – has been providing mo-  
torcycle and scooter touring around  
the globe since 1980. Around 50,000  
customers – mainly from the United  
States, Brazil, Canada, and Germany  
– have been on an Edelweiss tour.  
Featuring the latest motorcycles, 12  
different tour categories, from basic  
tours to luxurious vacations, are  
offered in 75 locations.  
Design challenge  
and project goals  
Edelweiss Bike Travel certainly  
provide great customer service, but  
it is “legendary” service that they  
strive for. Only when their clients’  
expectations are exceeded is a tour  
considered a success.  
The service design challenge\:  
after 35 years of doing motorcycle  
tours around the globe, Edelweiss  
Bike Travel decided to revamp and  
standardize the customer experience  
on all of their tours. The company  
was continuing to expand and the  
growing number of tour guides  
from all over the world – who are  
all freelancers – posed a real chal-  
lenge to staging a continuously  
consistent customer experience for  
the equally growing number of new  
and loyal clients.  
In particular, feedback from  
regular clients – who often booked  
the same tour a second or even a  
third time and sometimes brought  
along acquaintances and friends to  
whom they had previously warmly  
recommended Edelweiss Tours –  
clearly demonstrated what enormous  
influence each individual tour guide  
ultimately has on the perceived qual-  
ity of the customer experience.  
But there was yet another factor  
that was rapidly gaining increasing  
importance. Since Edelweiss Bike  
Travel is the official partner for  
BMW, Ducati, Triumph, and Harley,  
it’s important to recognize that these  
companies insist on a perfectly  
orchestrated customer experience for  
the clients when their motorcycles  
are used on the tours.  
“We just don’t run tours, we want to de-  
liver the ultimate customer experience –  
and that is before the tour, during the  
tour, and of course after the tour!”  
— Rainer Buck, Managing Director,  
Edelweiss Bike Travel CASES 08 Implementation  
The agency’s approach\:  
A classic service design process  
Gastspiel was selected to develop  
and co-create – together with a  
prestigious team from Edelweiss –  
the new “Edelweiss Customer  
Experience.” After in-depth design  
research \(which was carried out  
in the form of observations and  
ethnographic methods as part of  
the preparation, implementation,  
and follow-up of different motor-  
cycle tours\), devising and drafting  
a stakeholder map, the mapping of  
the customer journey and develop-  
ment of associated personas, and  
the design and implementation  
of the new customer experience  
finally took place.  
Besides various improvements  
to the customer journey before and  
after the tour, the spotlight was clear-  
ly on the tour itself. Management  
recognized that the tour guides  
and their behavior are the absolute  
“make-or-break factor” for the indi-  
vidual guest experience. To launch  
and embed the new “Edelweiss  
Customer Experience” in a sustain-  
able way, a new Tour Guide Training  
program has been implemented.  
How implementation  
worked in detail  
The service design process has  
evolved tremendously over the last  
few years, but the biggest challenge  
has always been the sustainable  
implementation of the designed cus-  
tomer experience measures through-  
out the whole organization.  
Employees with direct customer  
contact in particular have to be in  
the position to stage the designed  
customer experience in their daily  
routine, regardless of their length of  
affiliation with the company\: “We are  
what we repeatedly do.” To overcome  
this challenge, we have created a new  
method of video-based service train-  
ing, where employees are not only  
taught to stage the perfectly designed  
customer experience step by step, but  
can also instantly experience the im-  
pact of these steps on the customer.  
The service training video,  
which is divided into individual  
training segments, shows all the  
previously mapped out processes and  
procedures in real-life situations be-  
tween company and client along the  
entire customer journey. Within the  
scope of the Tour Leader Training,  
308/309  
a common reflection on the just –  
viewed situation was carried out after  
each video chapter and the most  
important details were recording. An  
appropriate “Quick Reference Guide”  
was developed, containing all the rel-  
evant information in compact print;  
this is carried by each tour leader for  
safety reasons, ease of reference, and  
in general in aid of carrying out all  
the appropriate tasks during a tour.  
Talking to the employees  
It is of utmost importance to stress  
the emotional aspect of the custom-  
er experience and make employees  
directly and equally experience what  
enormous importance each custom-  
er experience means to the company,  
and what incredible responsibility  
each employee carries and must  
therefore fulfill.  
Anything that touches people  
on an emotional level will remain

you made them feel good.  
Measurable results after  
employee training  
The feedback Edelweiss received from  
their customers from the first tours  
thereafter was overwhelming – and it  
was proved once again\: great custom-  
er experiences create great business  
results. After completion of the proj-  
ect, Edelweiss Bike Travel was able to  
celebrate the most successful business  
year since its inception in 1980!  
Key insights and learnings  
Compared to static pictures, mere  
text, or spoken information, the video  
medium provides a far greater den-  
sity of information, especially when  
individual modules are used. The  
tailor-made service training video –  
which was made authentic by filming  
actual clients and employees in re-  
al-life, everyday situations – not only  
depicts the training content in a visual  
and vivid manner but also conveys it  
on an emotional level, which in turn  
positively enhances the acquisition of  
knowledge and results in a signifi-  
cantly improved and sustainable  
anchoring of the learned content.  
To communicate the required  
ways of conduct, necessary expla-  
nations, and specific actions and  
behaviors desired by the tour opera-  
tors a sophisticated didactic concept  
was developed which was ultimately  
implemented in accurately adapt-  
ed audiovisual material and finally  
compacted in the training video. The  
employees are consistently shown  
the correct procedures and each in-  
dividual employee is guided by them  
in practice, obviously within their  
personal scope.  
310/311  
“What I get out of this – more than  
anything – after all the tours I’ve  
done, is the people. Not only the  
riders, but the tour guides. I just love  
this. So the combination ...it’s the  
people more than anything. And I  
want to thank everybody for making  
my life more whole.”  
— Customer, Edelweiss Bike Travel  
That way the company facilitates, for  
both new and longtime employees,  
a better understanding of which  
services are relevant at any given  
time and in any given manner for a  
perfect customer experience and fur-  
ther assists them by showing them  
how they can successfully implement  
these services in their immedi-  
ate everyday work.  
Because nothing must be left to  
chance, it is important nevertheless  
that any course of action must be  
perceived as authentic. Quite a chal-  
lenge indeed! Especially in the field  
of soft skills, relevant video segments  
depicting interpersonal situations can  
be experienced in an emotional and  
authentic way as opposed to viewing  
mere text or graphic illustrations. This is Service Design Doing  
In particular, the fact that the  
team of tour guides comprises peo-  
ple of different nationalities makes it  
all the more important to ensure that  
each one of them equally under-  
stands the relevant training content.  
In fact, we were able to see the effects  
of the new service training video  
even before the first tour leader  
training sessions were carried out.  
Gaining internal pride  
for the results  
The presentation of the completed  
video to the owners, management,  
and the members of the project team  
met with equally incredible emo-  
tional reactions in all – they were  
truly moved, touched, and most of  
all incredibly proud! Proud of “their”  
company, proud of their personal  
performance and that of the entire  
team, and proud of their commit-  
ment and the honest effort of their  
employees in their daily interac-  
tion with clients.  
Team emotions as driving factor  
One thing is clear – such strong  
emotions are a huge motivational  
factor and strengthen loyalty to the  
company. It was therefore all the  
more gratifying that we received  
this “I’m really proud to be part of  
the Edelweiss Bike Travel Team!”  
as unanimous feedback from all  
employees at the end of the training  
sessions we conducted. This spirit  
of togetherness and the employees’  
convinced attitude and feeling of  
loyalty toward their company and its  
services are obviously also felt by the  
customers of Edelweiss Bike Travel.  
And it is exactly that which is with-  
out doubt the best and most sustain-  
able basis for authentic and therefore  
unique customer experiences!

EXPERIENCES, MOMENTUM, AND RESULTS IN SALES  
# Transforming customer and  
# seller experience  
AUTHORS  
Jurgen De Becker  
Vice President,  
Global Solutions  
Consulting, Genesys

Senior Director, Content  
Strategy, Genesys  
Today’s digital revolution has fueled  
enormous customer engagement ex-  
pectations. Nowhere is that more clear  
than in the contact center, where cus-  
tomer engagement models have rap-  
idly transformed. Genesys, a popular  
global customer experience platform,  
knows this very well from 25 years  
of empowering companies to create  
exceptional omnichannel experiences,  
journeys, and relationships. With over  
4,700 customers in 120 countries,  
Genesys orchestrates over 24 billion  
contact center interactions per year in  
the cloud and on-premises.  
However, with its fast growth  
\(acquiring 12 companies in 4 years\),  
and entry into new market segments  
while expanding its portfolio, Genesys  
needed to transform its model for  
working with customers. A small core  
team was formed, with leaders from  
marketing, sales, and services, to solve  
what became a service design chal-  
lenge. Genesys needed to accelerate  
customers’ time to value and improve  
their buying journey by bridging the  
company’s technology and expertise  
across all customer-facing teams. In  
particular, sales and services teams  
needed to drive repeatability and stan-  
dardization with a common method-  
ology and toolset, while also helping  
customers visualize and improve the  
customer experiences they deliver.  
The challenge of  
increased complexity  
For many companies, success is now  
about delivering connected customer  
experiences across multiple jour-  
neys and channels, including phone,  
interactive voice response \(IVR\)  
systems, email, social media, web  
chat, text, mobile applications, video,  
and other IoT automated services. At  
the same time, customers perceive  
value based on business outcomes,  
not necessarily the price of an of-  
fering, and they make comparisons  
312/313  
to the best experiences they’ve had  
in any industry.  
Anticipating these market shifts,  
Genesys’s portfolio grew rapidly and  
its sales model began to evolve from  
a product-based to a solutions-based,  
consultative approach. But these  
changes introduced more complexity  
and inward, rather than outside-in,  
thinking. This complexity started  
affecting customers’ experiences in  
their buying journeys, and the col-  
laboration between Genesys teams.  
A cross-functional team of  
sales, marketing, and services lead-  
ers created a mission to optimize  
both customer and Genesys out-  
comes with a consistent approach\:  
creating and delivering memorable  
“wow” customer experiences. The  
SMART Method project was born,  
and it became a corporate trans-  
formation program, sponsored  
by the CMO and global sales and This is Service Design Doing  
services leaders to break through  
departmental silos.  
Creating memorable  
“wow” experiences  
The first steps in change are often the  
most difficult ones, and this was true  
for the SMART Method. Stepping  
into the customer’s shoes and mov-  
ing beyond the limitations of current  
internal tools and processes for sales  
and services teams required a com-  
pletely new mindset.  
A key event in bringing the core  
team together was completion of  
the “This is Service Design Doing”  
course. The shared experience  
brought customer centricity to the  
forefront of all discussions, and  
shaped our use of common tools  
and language. Thereafter, conference  
rooms were decorated with journey  
maps, stakeholder maps, and service  
blueprints. The technique of “octo-  
pus clustering” even became part of a  
sales training exercise.  
The “Double Diamond” \(Design  
Council, UK\) was an inspiration for  
the SMART Method’s core design  
process, which starts with extensive  
research. The team confirmed the  
most important experience gap in  
the buying journey\: the touchpoint  
when the customer requirements  
are being identified. While custom-  
ers appreciated the Genesys CX  
vision, they perceived it as complex  
and often missed insights about  
how to achieve business outcomes.  
Therefore, the first design challenge  
focused on providing quantifiable  
value and a clear path to the target  
state. This became the basis for mul-  
tiple iterations and prototypes.  
The resulting service design–led  
approach specified that the sales  
team and the customer analyze the  
end customers’ journeys together.  
Products become a means to an end,  
which is to help companies deliver  
great customer and employee experi-  
ences, with efficient operations. The  
historical focus on product features  
faded to the background, while  
building relationships, reimagined  
journeys, and great business out-  
comes gained the spotlight.  
Implementing small steps to  
build momentum and results  
Within six months of its inception,  
the SMART Method was introduced  
to the entire Genesys sales team  
during the annual sales conference.  
With the support of service design  
thinking \(and doing\) experts, we  
provided context and insights into  
the design process. The feedback was  
very encouraging, with 88% of the  
sales team agreeing that this method  
would reduce the customer’s time to  
value and create new experiences.  
After this introduction phase,  
the cross-functional team worked  
to guide expectations during the  
implementation with the Genesys  
teams. One of the first challenges  
we encountered was overcoming  
the sales team’s hesitance of entering  
design doing conversations with  
customers, or the question “Am I  
creative enough?” We discovered  
that a design doing approach led to  
even better customer conversations,  
with customers sharing meaningful  
details and stories. Early experience  
also revealed that sometimes being  
simple and pragmatic is all you need.  
Finally, we learned how important  
it is to find the right journey when  
working with customers.

many journeys, and design thinking CASES 08 Implementation

B This is Service Design Doing  
allows us to imagine many future  
possibilities. However, we needed to  
identify the most relevant journey  
in a customer’s situation to start  
design doing, and not lose momen-  
tum. Working together in an agile  
manner, taking many small steps and  
learning across the sales team with  
some pilot customer projects, led to  
great initial results.  
As the program grew, an import-  
ant next milestone was to establish  
a small, dedicated team to facilitate  
design thinking in the customer  
lifecycle and implement new tools  
for sales teams. This team not only  
focuses on optimizing experience,  
but also on building and sharing  
knowledge across the sales and  
services teams. Each co-creation  
process conducted with customers  
generates valuable insights where  
new service capabilities can be added  
to the solution portfolio. Establishing  
a center of excellence was a critical  
step in implementing the program  
and making design thinking a  
core discipline.  
Although the SMART Method  
is still in its infancy, we are achiev-  
ing positive results. Service design  
has helped Genesys transform to  
creating more intuitive, personalized  
customer \(and sales\) experiences.  
What started as a small stealth-mode  
initiative has quickly gained momen-  
tum in helping the company reduce  
complexity, break down silos, and  
bring a thoughtful, human approach  
to our business.  
“Service design has transformed  
how Genesys teams engage with our  
customers. We have changed the  
conversation with journey mapping  
becoming the vehicle to discover and  
co-create new, innovative customer  
experiences together. This approach  
has proven to be very effective, and  
clearly helps our customers transform  
how they create great customer expe-

Starting a business with service  
design in its DNA  
When we published our book This Is  
Service Design Thinking, we promised  
an app to work with the Customer  
Journey Canvas. However, we quick-  
ly discovered through contextual  
interviews and workshops that our  
initial idea was not enough. We un-  
derstood that users need more than  
just a digital version of our paper  
canvas. They need a tool to quickly  
create entire journey maps that they  
can share and use in workshops – an  
insight that guided us throughout  
the whole development process.  
Based on feedback we received from  
our consulting clients and the wider  
service design community, we real-  
ized that we need to build web-based  
software that allows users to create  
professional journey maps \(e.g., after  
a workshop to share with all partic-  
ipants and as an input for further  
iterations\). What started as a simple  
side project to our service design  
consulting developed into a startup.  
We even had a business plan …  
Smaply became a web-based tool  
to visualize personas, stakeholder  
maps, and journey maps. This case  
focuses on our prototyping process  
and how we prototyped, tested,  
and changed our business model  
over the years.  
Starting bootstrapped  
Boosted by the sales of our book  
and the resulting interaction with  
service designers from across the  
globe, we felt the timing was right.  
In 2011 journey mapping started  
to become mainstream. In 2012,  
our founding team combined the  
most needed skills for a software  
startup\: technology \(Klaus\), design  
\(Jakob\), and management \(Marc\).  
We were able to handle most tasks  
ourselves and had very close access  
to our potential users and ­ customers.  
This made initial researching,  
prototyping, and testing very quick  
316/317  
and cheap. The actual concept and  
business model were still subject to  
permanent change.  
We started with many assumptions  
based on our own service design con-  
sulting experience, but still needed to  
validate these through research.  
As we needed to stay flexible, we  
combined our agile development  
process with a team-wide iterative  
service design process. So, not only  
was the software itself developed  
in repeating loops, but we also  
developed our underlying business  
model iteratively.  
As the service design communi-  
ty was quite interested in our project,  
we originally planned to finance the  
development of Smaply through  
crowdfunding. Unfortunately,  
international crowdfunding plat-  
forms didn’t support projects based  
in Austria in 2012. We had the naive  
notion to set up a crowdfunding This is Service Design Doing  
platform ourselves. Unfortunately,  
we were fighting legal boundaries in  
Austria at that time and had to dis-  
card this approach for legal reasons.01  
To finally get started, we decided to  
bootstrap Smaply and finance every-  
thing out of our own pockets.  
Developing our business model  
We planned Smaply as a clas-  
sic Software-as-a-Service \(SaaS\)  
product. The interesting aspect  
about these business models is their  
scalability\: you maintain relatively  
stable costs, no matter how many  
products you sell.  
One crucial aspect of SaaS busi-  
ness models is their pricing. In the  
beginning, our pricing was based on  
gut feeling. We are experienced SaaS  
users ourselves and asked ourselves  
what we would pay for this kind of  
software. So, we created a “Starter”  
and a “Regular” plan for €10 and €25  
per month, respectively. The idea was  
simple\: if we convinced 200 cus-  
tomers to buy the Regular plan, we’d  
be able to cover our basic costs. We  
had no employees at that time and  
01 The legal situation has since changed, and crowdfunding and crowd  
investing are now becoming popular in Austria.  
planned to develop a first version of  
the software ourselves.02  
Selling alpha and beta access  
Of course, we didn’t just rely on our  
gut feeling when it came to market  
potential and product/market fit.  
Through early iterations and research  
phases during our closed alpha  
with selected users from the service  
design community, we already knew  
that the tool served a need for com-  
panies and agencies doing service  
design.03 One research question we  
had though, was “Is this need big  
enough that users would actually  
pay for it?” To answer this ques-  
tion we took a more radical step  
and did some research through  
value prototyping.  
We set up a prototype to test the  
market response and price sensitiv-  
ity. We offered 100 “alpha accounts”  
for €30 each. This basically meant\:  
“Hey, you can check out our sh!tty  
first draft, but you have to pay for  
it! We were surprised when these  
accounts sold out in 24 hours, and  
decided to offer another 100 beta ac-  
counts for €50 each a few weeks later,  
experiencing similar success. Selling  
alpha and beta accounts helped us  
to identify and connect with our  
most engaged users.  
02 03 Four years later, we are a team of 20.  
In 2012/2013, we described the value proposition of Smaply as “Create  
professional journey maps in minutes.” We described the user need  
we tried to fulfill as “Users need to quickly create presentable journey  
maps and be able to change these when they iterate with geographically  
dispersed teams.” As our core target groups we defined “agencies and  
companies doing service design.”

Building a community  
In 2013, we had about 50 invited  
closed alpha users, 100 paid alpha  
users, and 100 paid beta users. On  
that basis, we tried to establish a  
long-term relationship with the most  
engaged users. That basically meant  
we talked to everyone. Some users  
were thrilled when we sent them  
long and honest answers to their bug  
reports and feature requests, or when  
one of their ideas actually made it  
into the final product.  
One core aspect of building a  
community was thinking beyond  
the mere software. We started to  
offer free downloads of persona,  
stakeholder map, and journey map  
templates for paper-based work-  
shops, but also sold ready-made  
paper templates through our online  
shop “Mr.Thinkr.” We rewarded  
our most engaged users with some  
free templates as physical evidences  
of the software.  
Iterating product and pricing  
We launched the public version of  
Smaply in December 2013. Within a  
few days we had the first few custom-  
ers on board – most of them were  
alpha and beta users who converted  
their accounts. As we couldn’t handle  
everything ourselves anymore, we  
hired our first two employees in  
2013\. With increasing costs, we had  
to work on our business model and  
pricing. However, we wanted to  
make sure that our customers would  
have the feeling that Smaply was  
“worth it,” so we asked a few of them  
for their opinions. Backed with their  
feedback, we increased the pricing  
in 2014 to €25 for the Starter plan  
\(limited to three projects and just  
one user\) and €50 for the Regular  
account \(unlimited projects and  
optional additional users\).  
Our initial concept was based  
on the idea of providing users with  
maximum guidance. This approach  
also includes limitations for users,  
like\: “You cannot do this because it  
doesn’t make sense.” As our users got  
more and more skilled, we increas-  
ingly received complaints about  
this model. Users wanted to build  
maps in a more flexible way. We kept  
telling them how to work around  
problems, collecting more and more  
use cases. After two years of very  
iterative software development our  
code base looked like a patchwork  
rug. So, we decided on a complete  
rewrite of the software. Even though  
this was a major investment, this  
would increase stability and enabled  
us to finally tackle the flexibility issue  
of Smaply. We tested many new ideas  
with our most engaged users – often  
just roughly scribbled interface ideas  
on paper. Internal insight workshops  
brought together the learnings from  
our entire team through a healthy  
mix of analyzing research data, creat-  
ing insights, generating ideas, paper  
prototyping, and creating digital  
mock-ups for further usability tests.  
Connecting features with  
pricing in plans  
Through intense dialogue with our  
users, we were able to learn about fea-  
tures and functions that appeared tru-  
ly desirable. We were pretty surprised  
when users stated that a predefined  
storyboard image set \(a rather simple  
thing for us\) was much more import-  
ant than real-time collaboration \(a  
really complex thing to build\).  
Our most crucial instrument  
to understand needs and design  
features and pricing at the time \(as CASES 08 Implementation  
well as today, after some growth\) was  
a rather simple one\: everyone in the  
team has meaningful conversations  
with our users. We don’t have a dedi-  
cated support team.  
Everyone talks with users\: the found-  
ers, the developers, the marketers, etc.  
In our company, we all deal with  
support, usability tests, software  
demos, bug reports, complaints, and  
the like, following our own slogan\:  
“Talk to your f\*\*\*ing customer!”.  
This means everyone knows what the  
most prominent user needs are, and  
we discuss these every two weeks.  
We collect ideas for improvements,  
new features, plans, and pricing on  
our idea wall and regularly prior-  
itize these with an idea portfolio  
based on impact on the users and  
impact on our business. This is how  
we co-create our backlog for future  
software development.  
Growth  
In March 2016, we stopped insist-  
ing on credit card details when new  
users signed up for Smaply. We un-  
derestimated how much this change  
would affect the signup rate\: our new  
signups per month increased instant-  
ly by 1200% - and just two weeks  
later our servers crashed. A poster  
in our office reminds us of this day,  
but we were able to learn from our  
mistake and set up a new server  
infrastructure for faster growth.  
Lessons learned  
Our whole development process is  
now based on the iterative activities  
of exploration \(talk and work with  
users\), ideation/prototyping \(build  
simple prototypes and test them as  
soon as possible, and implemen-  
tation \(get it out and directly start  
testing again\). This is part of our  
company culture and we strongly be-  
lieve that our success so far is deeply  
rooted in this approach.

Create a feeling of owner-  
ship among your custom-  
ers and maintain a close  
dialogue with your most  
engaged critics – even if  
they have bad manners.  
Implement the idea of an  
iterative process across  
your entire team. Make it  
clear that there is no “final”  
version of your product. Be  
prepared for the fact that  
people don’t like that feeling.  
Accept that you don’t know  
that much about real use  
cases of your product. Don’t  
rely only on numbers. Ask  
humans.  
Stick to your principles. It  
is essential to talk to people  
and co-create with them –  
but you are responsible for  
the big picture, and for the  
nifty details.

Oslo is facing one of the major global  
challenges – a rapidly growing aging  
population who will need some  
provision of care. The city service  
providers needed to find ways of  
managing demand while ensuring  
that quality is not only maintained  
but, if possible, improved. They  
asked Livework to help them define  
a vision for elderly care in 2025  
that would be achievable, sustain-  
able, and inspiring.  
The agency approach\:  
The first phase is  
always “understand”  
To complement the council’s exten-  
sive data, Livework set about gaining  
insights via qualitative research. We  
conducted over 40 in-depth inter-  
views with end users, their caregiv-  
ers, admin staff, and care workers.  
We also made use of more covert  
techniques, including shadowing city  
staff engaged in home visits.  
Desk research was also essential  
to widen our perspective and gain  
inspiration for different approaches  
from other sources. We conducted  
trend analyses in health and elderly  
care and researched best practices,  
looking at provisions in other coun-  
tries. We also conducted an analysis  
of the economic impact of key needs  
and triggers, ensuring that service  
design walked hand in hand with the  
business perspective.  
Developing and  
testing new approaches  
After mapping existing customer  
journeys and running workshops  
with various stakeholders to gath-  
er further insights and generate  
ideas, we developed several tools  
which were integral to the project.  
The planning tools were used by  
all the various providers of elderly  
care, when they were planning their  
treatments. These enabled them to  
work across silos, using the same  
user needs–based tool irrespective of  
whether they were from the mental  
health department or the hospital,  
focused on nutrition or physiother-  
apy. The tools were designed not  
just to plan and deliver treatment in  
the immediate term but to plan and  
achieve longer-term goals, discussed  
and defined with the users.  
We mapped users’ needs on a  
matrix which clarified areas where  
needs could be better met, and creat-  
ed further potential customer jour-  
neys. A set of nine service principles  
was developed to inform and guide  
the future delivery of services.  
Piloting was done in parallel  
with business as usual, testing new  
service propositions backstage and  
frontstage, gathering insights from CASES 08 Implementation

the staff that deliver elderly care  
and their end users. A key desirable  
outcome was ensuring that people  
remain able to live independently  
for as long as possible, and this was  
achieved by designing systems that  
enable the council to target their  
services to meet individuals’ needs  
more accurately and efficiently gain  
the best outcome for both the mu-  
nicipality and the users.  
“Putting the user at the center was  
definitely the right thing to do. It gives  
us the opportunity to truly work dif-  
ferently in the future, \[to\] accomplish  
major cost reductions at the same  
time as we improve the quality of the  
services and user experiences.”  
— Bjørg Torill Madsen, Director and Project Lead,  
Nursing Home Agency, Oslo City Council  
A future-proof plan with  
immediate benefits  
Analyzing the impact of the pilot  
enabled us to make the projected  
savings analysis for future imple-  
mentation. One pilot alone produced  
savings that covered the cost of the  
project. Of course, the significant  
financial savings are a big win – but  
just as importantly, the user experi-  
ence was reported as being im-  
proved\: a more considered, tailored  
approach to care that takes into ac-  
count individual needs and respects  
individuals’ wishes.  
We continue to support the  
client by attending stakeholder meet-  
ings where policy decisions are made  
about elderly care provision and  
presenting our project. The original  
pilot was done in three boroughs and  
the tools and methods developed are  
now being shared across the other  
boroughs that make up the Oslo  
municipal district.  
KEY TAKEAWAYS

04  
Reducing costs doesn’t mean  
reducing quality of care.  
Finding the balance be-  
tween pragmatic solutions  
and utopian ideals requires  
patience.  
Piloting \(again and again\)  
is key.  
How you present your  
insights and proposals can  
be as important, if not more  
so, as the work itself. In this  
case, having “the numbers”  
\(hard economic data\) to  
back up our work was cru-  
cial.  
05  
The road from having a  
vision to implementation  
is long. We are continuing  
to support the client into  
the future of implementing  
services, after the project’s  
“close,” because we want to  
see them succeed. CASES 08 Implementation

# MANAGING ITERATIONS  
In this chapter, we’ll take an in-depth look at how the  
core activities of service design – research, ideation,  
prototyping, and implementation – can be planned and  
managed as an iterative service design process that fits  
your project, your stakeholders, and your team. Here are  
a few familiar points from Chapter 4, The core activities  
of service design, to keep in mind\:  
→ Make sure you solve the right problem before solv-  
ing the problem right\: Always challenge your initial  
assumptions. This is what sets design approaches  
apart\: rather than jumping right in – which also of-  
ten leads to obvious solutions – you first take a step  
back. You make sure you identify and understand  
the right problem before you move on to solutions.01  
→ Think in diamonds\: Divergent and convergent  
­ thinking and doing are key when managing a service  
design process. Which of the activities or methods  
you use are divergent or convergent? What is the re-  
quired mindset in terms of divergent and convergent  
thinking? Which mode should you be in just now?02  
→ Iterate and adapt\: The service design process is  
­ never a linear process. In fact, it’s quite the opposite.  
01 02 See 4.3.2, Make sure to solve the right problem before solving the problem right.  
See 4.3.1, Divergent and convergent thinking and doing.  
03 04 05 A service design process always needs to be explor-  
ative and iterative. You have to adapt to what you  
learn along the way, building on a series of more or  
less repeating, deepening, explorative loops\: itera-  
tions. Practically, this means creating a rhythm of  
planning, doing, reflecting, then re-planning.03  
→ Look beyond the individual tools and methods\:  
The service design process is more than a simple  
combination of its individual parts. Continuously  
reflect\: How do the individual activities play to-  
gether? How does the quality of the output of one  
activity affect the following activities? How can you  
build an ­ overarching project structure that creates  
trust in the process but also creates predictability for  
your organization without giving up on the iterative  
and explorative principles?04  
→ Now, build your own\: This is a process framework,  
not a step-by-step checklist. We challenge you to  
build your own customized service design process  
and give it a go. And we also challenge you to stay  
critical of your own process. Always ask yourself\:  
What worked? What didn’t work? Why didn’t it  
work? How might we do it ­ better next time?05  
See the textbox Adapt and iterate forward in 4.4.

# 9.1 UNDERSTANDING THE SERVICE DESIGN  
# PROCESS\: A FAST-FORWARD EXAMPLE  
Let’s revisit the core service design activities in a short  
exemplary ­ walkthrough to get a better feel for how they  
connect and work together. Imagine you have discov-  
ered that the ­ customer experience feedback rating \(insert  
your favorite KPI here\) of your business unit has dropped  
substantially. Your boss is worried and triggers a project  
within your organization to address the issue, and you  
decide to use a service design approach to tackle the  
project. Here is one path you might take.  
Planning and preparation  
To get started, you put together a rationale for why you  
have chosen service design.  
01 You find a suitable man-  
agement sponsor and a great team, securing you the  
necessary organizational support and management buy-  
in.  
02 After a careful inquiry and analysis of the project  
stakeholders and the wider ecosystem03 and their expecta-  
tions for the project, you start planning a service design  
process04 for them as well as for your core project team,  
adapting the approach to the context and the realities of  
your people, organization, and industry. You put in place  
an initial management and communication structure  
01 02 03 04 See Chapter 1, Why service design?, for inspiration.  
See Chapter 12, Embedding service design in organizations, for more information on how to establish service  
design inside your organization beyond management buy-in, raising awareness, and building up proficiency.  
See 9.2.3, Project team and stakeholders.  
See 9.2, Planning for a service design process.  
to navigate and manage the service design process05 on a  
daily basis and then officially kick off the project. You are  
now ready to dive into the content work.  
Research06  
Your first challenge is that the change in your feedback  
rating by itself does not tell you why it went wrong. So  
clearly, you need to look deeper, beyond the numbers.  
You ask yourself\: What do I need to learn? What do I  
need to find out? What is my research question?07 Then  
further\: Where and how can I answer my research ques-  
tion? Whom do I need to talk to or work with?08  
A great way to do all this is to go and find out, to  
leave the safe haven of the meeting room and get in  
touch with reality as quickly and as much as possible.  
To avoid a one-sided or biased approach, you use a  
mixture of different research methods; you might try  
the service yourself,  
09 observe,  
10 and do interviews11 with  
customers, frontline staff, management – talk to as  
many stakeholders as possible. And don’t forget your

Getting a project off the ground  
basic desk ­ research\:  
12 Have any of your questions been  
answered before? Is there any existing data you could  
use to inform your research? Who are the giants whose  
shoulders you can stand on?  
These activities provide you with a wealth of  
­ material about the initial challenge and your initial  
research questions – a lot of real-world data13 to challenge  
your assumptions. You might have gathered photo and  
video footage from interviews or observations, original  
quotes from users and staff about pain points with an  
existing situation, basic step-by-step documentation  
of their service experiences, deep knowledge about the  
context in which the user or customer is experiencing  
your service or product14 \(whether physical or digi-  
tal\), and so on.  
However, this big pile of data and inspiration can be  
overwhelming. To make it accessible and manageable  
you need to break it down. One common way to do this  
is to create a research wall15 and organize the data into  
mind maps \(after you have identified useful categories16\),  
14 12 13 See Preparatory research and Secondary research in 5.2.  
See Data triangulation in 5.1.3.  
15 16 The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In academia,  
products are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually bundles of services and  
physical/digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as referring to something tangible, we prefer to  
speak of the term physical/digital products. Read more on this in the textbox Service-dominant logic in 2.5.  
See Building a research wall in 5.3.  
Structuring the data using project-specific frameworks that emerge from the data itself can help you to under-  
stand the situation better and give you a fresh eye for the actual problem you need to solve. This is Service Design Doing

system maps01 or journey maps.  
02 Here, journey maps visu-  
alize the key experiences found during research, and help  
you to ­ identify critical steps in each journey.  
After you have had a hard look at all the data, you try  
to find patterns in your data\: What are the actual needs,  
pain points, or wishes of the people involved? What  
are your key insights03 about your users or customers  
that might help you to create a great service? What are  
the underlying \(business\) problems and opportunities?  
But also\: what might be better questions?  
You might have to collect some more data to fill in  
those gaps, refining your insights or creating even more.  
After a few research loops, the newest data does not  
bring additional insights to your research questions –  
and you move on.  
You can now use this knowledge to reframe your  
initial challenge statement\(s\), thus making sure that you  
are solving the right problem and addressing the right  
opportunities.

Ideation04  
During your research activities, you have ­ consciously  
restricted yourself to exploring the problem space.  
Now that you have identified a real opportunity or  
­ challenge, you can move into solution space.  
Your key question now is\: how can I generate as many  
ideas as possible to maximize my chances of ­ success? In  
order to achieve this, you look at the problem and assess  
who you need to invite05 to contribute and co-create. And  
then you choose a matching mix of ­ methods to leverage  
the participants’ knowledge and skills. For example, you  
break down your challenge into a set of trigger questions  
\(“How might we …?”\)06 and use brainstorming or brain-  
writing,  
07 10 plus 10 sketching,  
08 and bodystorming09 to  
generate many, many, many ideas. At this point, judgment  
\(e.g., in terms of feasibility\) is momentarily deferred to  
maximize your output during this stage.  
04 See Chapter 6, Ideation.  
05 Ownership is key. As a rule of thumb, invite people who know about it, who have to do it, or who can stop it. See  
9.2.3, Project team and stakeholders, for more details.

The next step is to work through all of those ideas  
and evaluate which ones should be developed fur-

large number of concepts is the idea portfolio,  
01 where  
all ­ concepts are rated by two simple criteria02 – often  
their impact on customer experience and their feasibility.  
The idea portfolio helps your team to focus their discus-  
sions and supports the decision-making03 process. Which  
ones are the concepts you would like to take forward and  
explore more deeply?  
01 02 See Idea portfolio in 6.4.  
Note that while the criteria mentioned here have proven to be useful, it often is the discussion you have while  
using the tool that is as important as the tool itself. Also, those criteria might change depending on your  
project. See Idea portfolio in 6.4 for more details.

EXPERT TIP  
“Try prototyping multiple  
touchpoints together to  
show the value of design-  
ing across channels and,  
likely, silos.”  
—  
Jamin Hegeman  
Prototyping04  
You now have some promising ideas or concepts. That’s  
great, right? The problem is that up until now, all those  
ideas live in the Land of Ideas – where everything works.  
The bad news is, we do not live in the Land of Ideas,  
and neither do our customers. We need to face \(­ business\)  
reality. Thus, you take your ideas and ­ concepts into  
the real world by prototyping and testing ­ assumptions  
with real users and other stakeholders before it gets too  
expensive. A design process aims to find out what works  
and what does not as early in the process as possible.  
This makes the design process not only faster, but also  
more cost effective.  
You might start by creating explorative prototypes05 to  
better understand the important aspects and implications  
of an idea. You might do some evaluative prototyping06  
\(e.g., to validate your core value proposition\). For both  
these approaches, you will employ tools like \(service\)  
walkthroughs,  
07 service advertisements,08 digital prototypes,  
09  
or cardboard prototypes.  
10 You build, use, and learn from  
your prototypes, you break them, you rebuild them again.  
You open new doors and along the way create many  
valuable insights about your future service, but also you  
develop much better questions.

334/335  
Implementation11  
After some iterations, you have achieved a handful of  
working prototypes supported by working business cases  
and positive feedback from actual users. The activities  
during implementation now depend heavily on your  
project and what exactly you need to implement. Do you  
need to change internal or external operative processes,  
organizational structures, or procedures?12 Do you need  
to develop and roll out software?13 Do you have to develop  
and produce physical products14 or change spaces and  
architecture?15 Or do you need to implement a mix of all  
of those measures in parallel?  
The answers to these questions will guide the  
methodologies you apply during your implementation  
activities. Implementation will often involve a lot more  
people starting to work on the project. And also, as every  
practical aspect of the service has to be created, tested,  
and implemented, there still is a lot of conceptual and  
design work left. This tends to take over the major share  
of a project.16 In itself implementation also includes  
research, ideation, and prototyping. Often the only  
difference is which stakeholders are involved, as you start  
working with real employees on real stages with more  
depth and fidelity than before.  
11 See Chapter 8, Implementation.

See 8.3, Service design and software development.  
See 8.4, Service design and product management.  
See 8.5, Service design and architecture.  
While your mileage might vary, many service design projects often experience a strong focus on change  
management and training during implementation. This is Service Design Doing  
# Iterations  
Your prototyping activities create new  
insights and questions which make  
you step back again and initiate further  
iteration. You do some more research on  
those questions. You take on some of the  
new insights for more ideation. And you  
do more prototyping to explore and eval-  
uate those new concepts further, until  
you can filter down to solutions you  
want move on with.  
Incidentally, the same can happen  
within or after any of your service design  
activities. Your ideation activities might not  
just prepare ground for ­ prototyping but also  
uncover new topics and new directions for  
more research. Your ­ research might reveal  
ideas that you take to prototyping straight  
away, but also give you more hypotheses  
and questions. And the same thing happens  
during implementation activities as you get  
concrete on so many levels.01  
01 Y ou can find iterations within almost any scope of the service design process.  
Iterations might happen within a method \(e.g. iterating a customer journey to  
make it better\), within a core activity \(e.g. research or ideation loops\), or between  
core activities, sprints, or even projects. See 9.2.4, Structure\: Project, iterations,  
and activities, for more details on different iterative structures for your own  
service design process.  
Almost any activity can  
create new insights and  
questions which make  
you step back again and  
­ initiate further iteration.  
Another important aspect is that  
you are not trying to iterate on one  
­ single concept or early prototype that  
you then implement in a long and  
expensive implementation project.  
This puts a lot of pressure on that  
concept – and in turn on your project  
team. Instead, you try to avoid putting  
all your eggs in one basket. You keep a  
selected range of options in the game  
until you can make a reliable enough  
decision about which ones to take for-  
ward.02 This not only reduces risk but  
also maximizes learning and thus the  
quality of your design. ◀

# 9.2 PLANNING FOR A  
# SERVICE DESIGN PROCESS  
EXPERT TIP  
“Exploring the brief  
together with the project  
sponsor is important,  
since you can get a good  
feeling of both expec-  
tations and possibilities.  
Sometimes this can  
lead to the rewriting and  
rescoping of a brief.”  
—  
Simon Clatworthy  
In this book, there is a conscious distinction between  
“planning of” and “planning for” a service design process  
or project. We usually talk about “planning for” because  
there are many details and activities in a service design  
project that you can prepare for, but cannot plan with  
precision beforehand. You will notice, however, that it  
is possible to set and keep milestones and – at the same  
time – keep an open mind to adapt the project as you go  
along. The planning of a service design project is actually  
the first iteration of your service design project.  
When planning for your service design process,  
your activities must fit within given business constraints,  
as you always have to consider how to best allocate  
time, money, and human resources within the ­ project.03  
Specifically, planning for a service design process  
­ includes various activities which we will explore further  
in the following sections\:  
→ Clarifying the brief  
\(including purpose, scope, and context\)  
→ Doing some preparatory research  
\(to inform your planning process\)  
→ Making decisions about project team and stake-  
holders, project structure \(i.e., planned iterations  
and activities\), project phases and milestones,  
­ outputs and outcomes, multitracking, documenta-  
tion, ­ budgeting and mindsets, principles, and style  
Keep in mind that you might not need all of these, and  
you might not need them in this order. This is not a  
step-by-step manual but more a checklist to ask the right  
questions when planning for your process.

03 In this book, we often speak about the service design process or service design projects almost interchangeably.  
In response to that, service designer and book contributor Matt Edgar argued that calling your service design  
work a “project” could limit its impact. Instead, we might want to consider terms like “engagement,” “interven-  
tion,” or “activity” to better reflect service design’s formative, iterative, and open-ended potential through the  
whole service lifecycle. Edgar, M. \(2016, October 11\). Personal interview.  
Brief\: Purpose, scope, and context  
The brief defines the actual starting point of your  
­ project and tries to capture the explicitly defined or  
implicitly assumed overall expectations about ­ purpose,  
context, scope, and objectives. This also includes  
boundary conditions for the project in terms of budget,  
time, and other resources \(and beyond\). Often, ­ however,  
you will not be approached with a perfect brief. Rather,  
people might have identified more of a rough starting  
point; an unmet need, a wish, a problem, or a seemingly  
brilliant idea like “We need to reduce the call volume in  
the call center by 10%,” “Develop that new service idea,”  
“We have this new technology, come up with something This is Service Design Doing  
# A design process does  
# not end with a concept!  
The later phases in the service design process are quite  
often neglected or misunderstood. Just to be clear. “It  
ain’t over ’til it’s over”01  
– a service design project does  
not end with a concept or a shiny presentation but with  
an implemented and operational service.  
There is sometimes a misunderstanding when  
concept-specialist service design agencies deliver only re-  
search and concept work as part of a client’s overall project.  
The agency will interpret the creation of the concepts as  
their own implementation stage, while the client organiza-  
tion still sees itself in the conceptual or prototyping stage.  
It is important to keep in mind that a full service  
design project usually begins with an initial brief, and  
while the role of the service designer might change after  
the implementation of an initial solution, the iterations  
continue well beyond.02 Then, the operations team is  
often on board and is scaling and adapting the solution  
to the ever-changing circumstances of the day-to-day  
business. More and more, service design becomes an  
ongoing activity embedded in the organization.03 ◀

“Fix the 20% drop in our NPS score,” “Improve the

idea to clarify those together with the project sponsor  
and your team so everybody has a clear understanding\:  
→ Purpose\: Why do we want to work on this chal-  
lenge? Where does the challenge come from?  
→ Scope/objectives\: What do we want to achieve?  
What do we want to avoid?  
→ Context\: What is the context in which we want  
to achieve this? Where and when should the  
project happen?  
→ Resources\: What is the budget available? Who  
needs to be involved? Who will be able to contrib-  
ute? What tools or materials are available?  
→ Time\: What are the expectations in terms of  
­ milestones and deadlines?

ecosystem,05 and potential research and development di-  
rections. This bit of research should deepen your insights  
about the content challenge as well as your understand-  
ing of the context, perceptions, and internal conflicts, or  
interplays that may emerge during the overall project.  
Data collection for planning  
Start with the inputs from the initial brief and do a quick  
brainstorm of potential research questions. It is not  
necessary to present them in a beautiful way, as they will  
only serve to support your planning session.  
Select a couple of key questions and start your  
preparatory research sessions. It is important to remind  
yourself that this is not yet about doing the research and  
solving the challenge but planning your research and the  
rest of your service design process. You need to ­ gather  
just enough data and insights to be able to set up a  
­ workable process structure.  
If you have a bit more time for your planning, you  
can also add data from additional methods that deliver  
fast first results – for example, current-state stakeholder  
mapping, secondary research, autoethnography, online  
ethnography, or first \(contextual\) interviews.

Assessment of potential development directions  
Based on the data from your preparatory research, you

need to work on as likely outputs and outcomes, as well  
as whom you might need to involve during ideation,  
prototyping, and implementation. Of course, this can  
and will change as you go through your project, but it is  
important to have this first idea to discuss and allocate  
reasonable budgets, time, and resources. Hence, no  
matter what you find \(or don’t find, for that matter\), it  
is key to truthfully acknowledge the level of uncertainty  
with respect to ­ potential types of solutions. For example,  
if you know your project scope involves updating an  
existing app, you can plan and budget in the appropriate  
resources from your UX and development teams. But if  
you cannot yet tell what type of solution you will be im-  
plementing, it might be helpful to plan and budget for a  
pilot project, giving you the time and resources to clarify  
more concrete development directions first.  
9.2.3  
Project team and stakeholders  
Assess who might be affected by your project and whom  
you need to include in which activity. This should be based  
on the insights from your brief as well as on your prepa-  
ratory research and any initial planning efforts. “Where  
does the project brief come from?” and “Who needs to  
implement this?” are just two important questions you  
should always ask yourself when you start a project in an  
organization. You might, for example, learn about similar  
projects and identify people who were previously involved.  
They might be able to assist you in selecting your project  
team and managing important stakeholders. This is Service Design Doing  
# Dealing with constraints  
 The more freedom you have, the more structure you need!01  
When planning and managing a ­ project,  
you will often be hit by constraints.  
You will work with limited resources  
\(­ especially budget or access to people\),  
with tough deadlines and an ambitious  
scope or objectives. To make things  
worse, those constraints will influence  
each other. If you want to be cheap and  
fast, you might have to limit your project’s  
scope or quality. If you need to achieve  
an ambitious scope at high quality, it  
won’t be cheap or fast. The rule of thumb  
is that you can fix one or two of these  
constraints, but need to stay flexible on at  
least one of them.02  
01 02 Interestingly, this parallels what we find with seasoned improvisers, jazz  
musicians, or teachers\: “Without the structure you do not have improvisation,  
you have anarchy or indulgence. Without the freedom you have suffocation.”  
See Jackson, P. Z. \(1995\). “Improvisation in Training\: Freedom within Corporate  
Structures.” Journal of European Industrial Training, 19\(4\), 25-28.  
See 9.5.1, Case\: Creating repeatable processes to continually improve services  
and experiences at massive scale, for a great example of accepting that services  
and experiences will never be perfect, but can be continually improved – with  
constraints on an Olympic scale.  
In many traditional projects the scope  
is fixed. That works well if the scope is  
built around a deterministic challenge.  
But every time you discover it is not as  
defined as you thought, the approach  
­ becomes painful. You can either hurriedly  
add more resources in an attempt to fix  
it \(making it more expensive\), or you  
might have to shift the delivery date  
\(putting a dent in your reputation as a  
project manager\).  
Specifically, this approach does not  
work for service design, where you often  
challenge and change the scope of a ­ project  
right from the start \(“Make sure you  
solve the right problem before solving the  
problem right”\).  
This poses a new problem\: if you are  
dealing with complex challenges it is now  
very easy to lose track of all the different  
insights, opportunities, or ideas. You will  
soon waste a lot of time and resources,  
and your team might start to pull in  
­ different directions.  
Keeping the scope variable adds a  
high degree of freedom to your project  
that needs to be managed very carefully.  
You will need to add structure which  
will allow for the necessary freedom in  
scope while letting you plan and manage  
the process. One proven model is the  
agile approach to planning, with a clear  
planned iteration or sprint structure.03  
This fixes both time and constraints,  
allowing you to work efficiently until your  
scope becomes more defined. ◀

structure in 12.4, Design sprints.

them and to leverage their knowledge, skills, and talents.

Core project team  
The role of the core project team is to manage and support  
a project and to facilitate the design process through  
appropriate workshops and activities. You are aiming for  
a good mix of service design skills and subject matter  
expertise. However, not everybody on the core project  
team needs to be an expert in service design. Similarly, not  
­ everybody needs to be an expert in your industry or to  
have a deep knowledge of your organization.01 For a single  
service design project, the core project team usually con-  
sists of a handful of people, but it can be as small as a team  
of one \(e.g., working as a coach within an existing project  
structure\) or as big as a football squad \(e.g., running and  
implementing a project for an internal or external client\).  
Decide which of the following roles are relevant to  
your project and organization, or if you need to create  
new ones \(note that each member of the core team might  
take over multiple roles\)\:  
→ Service Design Management Lead\: Plans and  
­ manages the overall service design process and  
­ manages the project team

and provides design support or facilitation of  
­ co-creation workshops  
→ \(Service\) Design Lead\: Focuses on content and  
quality of service design outputs and deliverables;  
shapes and delivers design concepts  
→ Business Lead\: Ensures business viabili-  
ty of ­ developed concepts; deals with business  
models, KPIs, benchmarks, business strategy,  
­ competitor analysis, etc.  
→ Technology Lead\: Analyzes technology  
­ require­ ments, ensures feasibility of new concepts,  
­ and manages and supports prototyping efforts  
→ Change Lead\: Focuses on the human ­ perspective;  
assesses the impact on staff and customers from an  
­ individual and organizational change management  
­ perspective, and develops fitting change solutions  
→ Project Manager\: Keeps the team on track;  
­ manages the service design process in terms of  
budget, ­ deadlines, and reporting; administratively  
backs up the project team  
→ Project Owner/Sponsor\: Takes responsibility for  
strategic direction and budget – the person who  
assumes this role is often a key decision maker COMMENT

Extended project team  
Most projects are also supported by an extended project  
team\: a larger group of people with specific competen-  
cies that can be involved in specific sections or activities  
within the project.02 Hence, the team size of an extended  
project team can vary over time and even change from  
workshop to workshop. Consider including\:03  
→ An internal selection of cross-functional members  
to ensure a holistic perspective.  
→ External method or subject matter experts to  
­ manage the competencies that your ­ organization  
does not have \(e.g., ethnography, UX, change  
­ management, architecture, etc.\).  
→ Departments and/or external stakeholders that are  
responsible for earlier or later parts of your project,  
but also involved in daily operations.  
→ Key decision makers from your organization. The  
success of your project might not just depend on  
the quality of your output but also on the hierar-  
chical position of the decision makers who support  
it. Put careful thought into how to integrate them  
closely into your project team from the beginning.04  
Also see 12.2.2, The extended project team.  
Convincing people to contribute can be a challenge. See Onboarding and communicating with co-creators in  
9.3.2 for more on how to address common questions stakeholders have when they join a new project.  
When important stakeholders are pushing their own ideas into a project, you might experience the ugly baby  
bias\: everybody says, “I’m not going to be the one who tells our CFO that her baby is ugly.” One way to address  
this is to embrace their ideas, but then – as soon as possible – adapt your plan to push them into a prototype  
and test them with real users. The stakeholders then see their concepts fail with their own eyes \(or succeed, but  
then it was you and your team that needed that validation\).  
02 03 04 342/343  
→ Users or customers, as ambassadors of their  
­ stakeholder group. This allows quick research and  
prototyping without a lot of planning.  
→ Generally, any people who are directly affected by  
the project, or who have the power to stop it.  
It is crucial that you involve affected staff as early  
as ­ possible in the design process of their future ­ daily  
work routines. This makes them co-owners of the  
new solution, a status which will help implementation  
and acceptance.  
9.2.4 Structure\: Project, iterations,  
and activities  
Your project structure lays out how you want to create  
and advance the expected outputs and outcomes as  
defined in your brief.  
Each higher-level iteration involves at least some  
­ activities of research, ideation, and prototyping. Just  
like in build-measure-learn cycles,05 you create potential  
solutions in the shape of prototypes or implemented  
services, use them, and systematically learn from them.  
This implies that you most likely need to adapt your  
original planning or even change as you go along.  
05 Build-measure-learn cycles can be traced back at least as far as Galileo and the dawn of the scientific method,  
with incarnations like the Deming cycle from the 1950s or the more recent Lean Startup. See Moen, R. \(2009\).

# \(Co-\)team building  
It is important to decide how to prepare  
your \(core\) project team to work together.  
Should this cooperation be planned or  
emergent? Should the team be involved in  
and co-create process, strategy, planning,  
management, and execution? Here are  
a few points to consider when you are  
aiming for a great team\:01  
→  
Create a safe \(team\) space  
To be able to adopt this new way of think-  
ing and doing, decide how you can create  
a \(psychological\) safe space for each indi-  
vidual on your team – as well as for your  
team within your organization.02  
→  
Give structure and orientation  
Always clearly explain the goals, back-  
ground, and vision of the project when  
onboarding new team members so they  
can understand their role and the impact  
of their contributions to the project and  
the bigger organization.03 Decide how  
to \(co\)create and share project plans/  
roadmaps and how you are going to up-  
date them as you go along. Also decide on  
roles and clarify interdependencies within  
the team\: Who is going to be ­ responsible  
for what? Are there ­ interdependencies be-  
tween different team members? How will  
you communicate who is working on  
what at any given time?  
→ Decide on how you work  
and how you decide  
Consider sharing personal preferences  
and work styles within the team and  
adapting your planning accordingly. To  
reduce potential problems during the later  
process, decide early on how you are go-  
ing to make decisions or resolve conflicts.  
This includes decisions on the content  
as well as decisions on the team and the  
way you work.04  
→  
Reflect and learn  
Decide how to establish a clear and  
constant feedback routine within your  
team on \(a\) the work you are doing05 and  
\(b\) how you are doing the work.06 Learn  
from the feedback and act upon it. Short  
feedback cycles make sure that problems  
are addressed early enough, before they  
hurt. Consider keeping a record of your  
lessons learned.  
→  
Co-create a suitable kickoff  
Especially with new teams, the first shared  
steps can be crucial. Team ­ culture, once  
set, can be hard to change. Take your time  
to address and design those first steps in  
your project ­ accordingly. Consider how  
­ co-creative project planning ­ sessions or  
­ kickoff workshops can be used to share  
­ expectations,07 create buy-in, ­ establish  
trust, and ignite motivation within your  
\(core\) team.08 ◀

PLANNED ITERATIONS  
Consider breaking up your project into a planned sequence of smaller  
projects to deal with uncertainty and reduce the risk involved.  
Breaking up your project  
It can be helpful to break up your project into a planned  
sequence of smaller projects to deal with uncertainty and  
reduce the risk involved. Sometimes a short but well-  
prepared iteration like a five-day service design sprint  
can be enough to have a great impact on your results.09  
This structure introduces clear points for reflection and  
decision in between projects that allow you to stop a  
certain development direction early if necessary.10  
The different projects can also put a different  
­ emphasis on certain service design activities com-  
pared to others. The following options are certainly  
not a complete list, but might help to give you some  
­ basic orientation\:

Strategic research and innovation projects  
If you are quite far forward in your innovation funnel,  
you might want to set up a strategic research project.  
Strategic ­ research and innovation projects are usually

10 Often you will observe a reluctance in organizations to kill projects. One of the reasons is that there are many  
stakeholders who might feel they will lose face, because they started the project it in the first place or because  
they invested time and resources. Breaking up a project from the start makes this decision easier, as it is clear  
that there will be decision points coming up. Also, the team will be able to reach a feeling of closure as the  
previous project has officially been finished.

not ­ intended for implementation, but instead help to  
create meaningful starting points for more incubation,  
or implementation-oriented service design projects.  
Their main focus is clearly on research even though they  
end with a first couple of steps into solution space –  
for example, creating validated opportunity areas,  
­ lighthouse concepts on a prioritized idea portfolio, and  
first early communication prototypes to make those  
­ concepts more tangible.  
→  
Incubation projects  
If you are trying to explore and validate the market  
potential of one or more concepts, it makes sense to split  
your project into a sequence of incubation projects with  
growing budgets and resources. Incubation projects have  
a strong focus on experience prototyping, which delivers  
real data about the risks and market potential of each  
string of concepts.  
Implementation projects  
If the solution space is ­ sufficiently defined, you can plan  
straight for prototyping and implementation in a series

most of the time and resources will go into implementa-  
tion activities.  
If you cannot yet see the shape of a potential  
solution,01 there is no way you can safely create a sound  
implementation plan or project. This would depend too  
much on the intermediate results of your research and  
prototyping activities. Start with a strategic research/in-  
novation ­ project or incubation project first.  
Planned iterations  
Within your project, planned iterations are iterations  
you promise to do and deliver on time and within  
budget/­ resources.02 Each planned iteration consists  
of three parts\:  
1 Iteration planning  
2 Service design activities  
3 Reflection on content and process  
Planned iterations are the predictable timeboxes you set  
up for your design activities – a safe space to do, learn,  
01 This does not mean you need to know what the exact solution will be. It only means, for example, that you  
know that you will need to build an app for a specific system, or create a change initiative within a certain part  
of the organization, so you can roughly plan for software development resources or change management skills.  
02 See 12.4, Design s, for an overview of how planned iterations can be used within  
design sprints to go beyond individual projects. 09 Service design process and management  
# When to involve  
# service design experts  
BY GIOVANNI RUELLO  
At Bosch, a “user experience relevance  
check” must be performed before start-  
ing any standard development process.  
This ­ assessment by project managers  
is mandatory whatever the goal of the  
project \(services or products, wheth-  
er physical or digital\). If the result of  
the check reveals relevance to user  
experience, design experts are engaged  
in order to identify activities that can  
be executed as an integrated UX or  
service design project.  
The design team has first talks  
with the specific division in order to  
understand the scope of the “techni-  
cal” project and identify user-centered  
design activities that could be exe-  
cuted as “integrated” UX or service  
design project.  
Such activities are categorized as  
“user experience design” or “service  
design” ­ projects. In order to prevent a  
clash of working cultures, mindset, or  
­ terminology, the design team is free  
to decide on a different label and just  
refer to the scope as “­ improvement  
of the experience,” no matter if the  
project is concerned with the use  
of new products and ­ services or the  
establishment of a customer relation-  
ship. This re-labeling is not just related  
to the terminology, but also ­ reflected  
in the activities and tools used in  
the design phase.  
While executing the project,  
the core design team might prefer  
to add the user perspective on top  
of established production methods,  
rather than imposing specific design  
frameworks. In this case, elements  
of service blueprinting, stakeholder  
mapping, and value mapping can be  
346/347  
combined with typical product or  
software development processes. They  
can be visualized together as “user or  
empathy enhanced tools.” For exam-  
ple, instead of a customer journey, the  
design team could develop a sequence  
of user stories that are connected to a  
journey but are close to our custom-  
er’s working processes and therefore  
easier to grasp and more actionable.  
By doing so, it is possible to provide  
non-designers a better understanding  
of the product lifecycle, process de-  
pendencies, and stakeholder synergies  
needed to achieve specific targets  
along the process phases, as well as the  
ultimate goal. ◀ This is Service Design Doing

How you

The Squiggle\:01  
This famous illustration shows how people can experience the  
design process as strange, almost chaotic. Using planned iterations helps to  
bring a solid structure but at the same time leaves enough space for exploration.

Planned versus actual iterations\: Planned iterations create a formalized uber-structure for  
planning, service design activities, and reflection to stay iterative and adaptive at all stages of  
your service design process.  
and adapt. They are the primary iterations you need to  
focus on during your planning activities as they also  
define ahead of time when you will invite stakeholders  
from outside the project team for co-creation and deci-  
sion making. A prominent example of planned iterations  
is the sprint structure you find in agile software develop-  
ment methodologies like Scrum.01  
With planned iterations, you create a formalized  
uber-structure which establishes a set rhythm of  
planning, service design activities, and reflection to  
stay iterative and adaptive within your service design  
process. This keeps your team on track, and especially

design and software development. helps stakeholders who are not accustomed to this  
way of working.  
Still, people who are experiencing service design  
for the first time \(or looking in from the outside\) can  
perceive it as arbitrary and almost chaotic. “Explorative  
and iterative work” is often misunderstood as “playing  
around and doing what you want.” Planned iterations  
help you to actively address and manage this perception.  
The amount of freedom – or “wiggle room” – within  
your planned iterations depends on the experience of  
your design team. If you are working with inexperienced  
designers or an interdisciplinary team not accustomed to  
this way of working, keep the planned iterations tight and  
closely coach them through them until they pick it up.03  
03 Y ou can – where the cost of any major change is still low – use planned iterations formally or informally. In the  
end, it is up to you how much of the underlying structure you are going to share beyond your core project team. EXPERT TIP  
“It’s not just difficult  
to visualize, it’s some-  
times difficult to follow,  
unless you are used to it.  
Designers jump forward  
and backwards, zoom  
in and out, always on  
the hunt for something  
new, something that can  
inspire an innovation. If  
you are used to structure  
in everything, this may be  
challenging and difficult  
to follow. But ... there is  
method in the mad-  
ness – give it time.”

09 Service design process and management  
If you are working with experienced designers, you  
can trust them to iterate within the given boundaries as  
necessary. The typical length of planned iterations often  
ranges between two to four weeks.  
It is important to make space regularly for reflection  
sessions focused on your process and future iteration  
planning, taking time to adapt to what you have learned  
so far. Usually, reflection sessions are put at the end of  
a planned iteration. With shorter iterations they can be  
quite informal, but make sure you always also conduct  
formal review and planning sessions at least at the end of  
higher-level iterations.  
In your reflection and iteration planning, you need  
to consider the content, tools, and methods as well as  
the way you collaborate within your team\: What did you  
learn in terms of your project content, and what needs to  
happen in the next iteration in terms of tools and meth-  
ods? How was the collaboration in the team and what  
can you do to become more effective as a team? 04  
The key driver for cyclical and iterative methodolo-  
gies like the service design process is the desire to reduce  
the risk at each single step while at the same time maxi-  
mizing learning to make subsequent steps more efficient.  
Planning core activities  
The most important aspect of this part of the planning  
process is to create a preliminary plan which accounts  
for continuous iteration planning and content/process  
This closely follows one of the principles of the Agile Manifesto\: “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how  
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.” \(Source\: “Principles Behind the  
Agile Manifesto” \(n.d.\), at http\://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html. See Chapter 8, Implementation, for a more  
thorough discussion on the similarities between agile approaches and service design.  
04 348/349  
reviews along the way. These activities will become the  
cornerstones of your adaptive and iterative process. In  
the following pages, we sketch out how to create a more  
detailed picture of your research, ideation, prototyping,  
and implementation activities. Initially this will help you  
to put together a proposal, including a roadmap, a list of  
resources you need, and a budget. Later on, this becomes  
a living document as you adapt and improve.  
The planning of your service design activities is also  
iterative in itself. So, plan your first iterations quickly,  
then come back and adapt and improve. Chapters 5–805  
give you in-depth descriptions on how to plan your  
research, ideation, prototyping, and implementation  
activities when you are about to do them. During the  
process of planning, however, you need to balance the  
uncertainty at the time of planning \(pre-project\) with  
the need for just enough detail to at least be able to  
create a budget and key milestones. For each iteration,  
it is helpful to be able to communicate a clear picture of  
how you want to work, creating trust in your process and  
your project team.  
Be aware that at some stage it might ­ become point-  
less to plan for an iteration which is too far into the fu-  
ture – even if your client is pressing for it. In those cases,  
it might be helpful to sketch out an exemplary project  
framework based on a typical service design process,  
knowing that you only will be able to properly plan it  
when you get there.

PLANNED ITERATIONS VS.  
FORCED ITERATIONS  
In the forced iteration model, necessary changes are only forced onto the team by imminent  
implementation deadlines. The team is mostly reactive; changes are expensive.  
Using systematic research, ideation, and prototyping loops, the planned iteration model  
pushes design changes toward the beginning of the project. The team operates proactively;  
the cost of changes is low.01  
Plan for research  
01 → Review your initial research question\(s\), preparato-  
ry research, and high-level iteration structure.  
→ Select research methods\: Line up a sequence of  
research methods and decide how to analyze and  
visualize them. Roughly guesstimate typical setups  
in terms of sample selection, sample size, researcher  
team, data types, and triangulation strategy.  
Adapted from Pugh, S. \(1991\). Total Design\: Integrated Methods for Successful Product Engineering.  
Wokingham\: Addison-Wesley, p. 206.  
→ Consider potential researchers\: Briefly refer back  
to your stakeholder map or do a quick informal  
brainstorming on potential stakeholders. How  
much of the research can be done by the project  
team? Where do you need external help?  
→ Split activities into planned research loops\:  
Sketch out how you want to arrange the select-  
ed methods into different research and analysis/  
visualization sessions and how they feed into  
each other. Add adaptive iteration planning and  
review sessions.  
Plan for ideation  
→ Review your initial assessment of potential  
­ development directions.  
→ Consider potential participants\: Very briefly  
\(as this will certainly change after your research  
activities\) refer back to your project stakeholder  
map or do a quick informal brainstorming on  
potential experts or stakeholders for key op-  
portunity areas.  
→ Select methods\: Line up a sequence of ideation  
and decision-making methods to fill your idea  
portfolio and select them. Guesstimate how  
many ideas you might want to take forward  
into prototyping. EXPERT TIP  
“During planning, keep  
in mind that the project  
members and co-cre-  
ators are embedded in  
organizational struc-  
tures\: your activities may  
have unforeseen effects  
going beyond your  
project environment. To  
avoid friction, carefully  
consider how these  
individuals perceive your  
service design activities  
and what effects their  
experiences may have.”

Sketch out how you want to line up the selected  
methods into different ideation and decision-mak-  
ing sessions and how they feed into each other. Add  
adaptive iteration planning and review sessions.  
Plan for prototyping  
→ Review your initial assessment of potential  
­ development directions.02  
→ Assess what you might have to make\: Remember  
that at this point you might only be able to plan for  
approximate types of prototypes \(e.g., if you already  
know you are going to work on an app, a consult-  
ing session, a physical product, etc.\). It might also  
be impossible to say what needs to be prototyped  
just yet. However, in many projects the expect-  
ed outputs are quite well defined and can guide  
your planning. It might be important to assess the  
uncertainty of your planning so you can adjust as  
you move forward.  
→ Select explorative and evaluative ­ prototyping  
­ methods and plan supporting research\: Line up a  
sequence of explorative and evaluative prototyping  
­ methods. Roughly guesstimate the typical fidelity,  
multi­ tracking, context, audience, and audience size  
02 See Assessment of potential development directions in 9.2.2.  
350/351  
for each of those methods. Remember to select  
supporting ­ research methods to learn from for each  
of your ­ prototyping activities.  
→ Consider potential prototyping skills and  
team\(s\)\: Do a quick informal brainstorming on po-  
tential skills you need and experts or stakeholders  
who have those skills to create the prototypes you  
need. Plan for interdisciplinary prototyping teams –  
who can make almost anything – at early iterations  
and include specialized skills later on.  
→ Split activities into planned prototyping loops\:  
Sketch out how you want to line up the selected  
­ methods into different explorative and evaluative pro-  
totyping sessions and how they feed into each other.  
Add adaptive iteration planning and review sessions.  
Plan for implementation  
→ Assess what you might have to make\: Planning  
implementation means planning based on assump-  
tions of what you might have to make. This will be  
based on your guesstimations of the prototyping  
activities and will share a similar uncertainty.  
→ Consider potential implementation skills and  
team\(s\)\: Break down the implementation task into  
the involved disciplines. Do a quick informal brain-  
storming on potential skills you need and experts This is Service Design Doing  
or ­ stakeholders who have those skills to implement  
the project as it is planned today. Just like when  
you are planning for prototyping, it is often useful  
to plan for a core interdisciplinary implementation  
team – who can plan and manage almost anything –  
at early implementation iterations and move toward  
more specialized setups later on. Those might  
change, but having the interdisciplinary team at the  
beginning buys you the necessary time to adapt and  
communicate any changes as early as possible.  
→ Involve specialists to do implementation plan-  
ning\: Line up seasoned project managers to give  
feedback on planning the implementation part\(s\).  
Co-create individual implementation plans together  
with the specialists.  
→ Split activities into planned iteration loops\:  
Sketch out how you want to line up the selected  
­ methods into different implementation loops and  
how they feed into each other. Add adaptive itera-  
tion planning and review sessions. As implementa-  
tion activities are often done in parallel, make sure  
you sync those activities and continuously check the  
progress of single work packages against the holistic  
customer experience.  
At any given stage, the higher the uncertainty in the  
outputs of your design process, the more parallel  
concepts or prototypes you should keep in the game.  
9.2.5  
Multitracking  
Decide how many insights, ideas, prototypes, or services  
you want to work on. In bigger projects, it often makes  
sense to multitrack your iterations – for example, split  
the team and work in parallel.  
Multitracking can be used to reduce risk by exploring  
a certain number of concepts or prototypes instead of  
just one. Not putting all your eggs into one basket allows  
you to strategically deal with uncertainty in your concept  
portfolio and manage the expectations of stakeholders.  
Essentially, by working in this way you replace the  
old model of making one big bet on one concept with a  
series of smaller bets on a handful of promising proto-  
types. This reduces the risk associated with each individ-  
ual decision and substantially reduces the risk associated  
with your overall innovation and design project.  
Later, when you are closer to implementation, you can  
use multitracking to divide the work on different elements  
that need to be implemented into parallel work streams  
to speed up the time to delivery. For example, ­ creating the  
interior design for a shop environment, ­ creating training  
sessions for the staff, and implementing a support app can  
certainly run in parallel. Depending on the complexity  
of the development tasks, each work stream can also run  
at a different iteration speed. To keep the different work  
streams on track, regularly align the progress and make  
sure the output fits together.01

COMMENT  
“While it’s tempting to  
want to check off the box  
and move on, designing  
a service is never done.  
It’s only over when you go  
out of business.”  
—  
Jamin Hegeman  
Project phases and milestones  
Gantt charts, project phases, and milestones are the  
currency of traditional project management. They have  
their roots in the world of more or less deterministic  
projects that could be planned and executed using basic  
work-breakdown structures, analyzing work package  
dependencies. While we strongly suggest you avoid using  
Gantt charts to plan and manage your project, you might  
still have to deliver milestones and a roadmap to comply  
with internal requirements.02  
One way to deal with this situation is to use a  
black-boxing approach. You try to encapsulate the activ-  
ities of your service design process in such a way that –  
from the outside – it almost looks like any other project.  
Ask yourself\: how might we adapt our service design  
process to fulfill the \(reporting/planning\) requirements  
for projects within our organization, without giving up  
the iterative and adaptive nature of the service design  
process? Be careful with black-boxing service design  
projects, though, as it is just a workaround. It might be  
a starting point for service design within an organiza-  
tion, but it should not be the default.  
The approach you choose will depend on your own  
experience and the previous experience of stakeholders  
with iterative and adaptive development approaches.  
Here are a few starting points.  
02 As an outside agency – especially when you are called in for your expertise – you might make it an explicit  
point and take it as an opportunity for a change intervention\: to challenge existing structures and do it the  
service design way. However, as a single designer or a small team within a big organization you might need to  
work differently \(e.g., black-boxing your service design approach to initially fly under the radar, so to speak\).  
352/353  
Identify and map project phases  
Have a look at periods of iterations within your design  
process where you can identify a dominant activity or  
scope. Mark them as overarching project phases for your  
project. Often they combine a distinct mix of activities,  
methods, and deliverables. Map them to align with  
existing iterations. Sometimes it is useful to play with  
the naming of your project phases to match with existing  
terminology. For larger service design projects, mapping  
project phases onto your service design process can also  
be used to give a sense of orientation and progress. Here  
are some examples of project phases\:  
→ Preparation phases, setup phases, scoping phases,  
or initial iterations often include project planning  
and prep research, but sometimes also some first  
research, ideation, and even prototyping activi-  
ties. You might even do a very quick first iteration  
including all these activities to better plan the  
entire project.  
→ Discover phases, insight phases, pre-project  
phases, or research phases might package ear-  
ly, research-heavy high-level iterations, but will  
usually also contain some ideation and light-  
weight prototyping.  
→ Concept \(development\) phases, design phases, or  
ideation phases might package ideation-focused  
high-level iterations but will also contain research  
and at least some lightweight prototyping. This is Service Design Doing  
→ Prototyping phases, build phases, or incubation  
phases allow you to package prototyping-focused  
high-level iterations, but might also include some  
­ research and ideation activities.  
→ Internal alpha, local beta, beta, or rollout phases  
allow you to plan phases around user engagement  
or the user learning curve.  
→ Delivery phases, implementation phases,  
­ pilot phases, or rollout phases allow you to  
package different implementation-focused  
high-level iterations.  
→ Operation phases or in-production phases  
allow you to package the continuous improve-  
ment iterations of the standard daily operations  
after your go-live. Service design is then set up as  
an ongoing activity in an organization and brings  
­ holistic cycles of research, ideation, prototyping,  
and implementation activities to the daily opera-  
tions of your service.  
Set outputs and milestones  
Milestones mark specific points on your project timeline  
at which you reach an agreed status. They often are also  
the points in a project where you present to or involve  
a wider audience and communicate the progress and  
status of your project.  
Set up your milestones to match your planned  
­ iterations – and carefully manage the expectations of  
what you can or cannot deliver at those points. The out-  
puts you promise should be specific, measurable, and re-  
alistic and will often be called deliverables here.01 Typical  
milestones include\:  
→  
→  
→  
→  
→  
→  
Intermediate research report done  
Key insights identified and prioritized  
Opportunity areas identified and prioritized  
Ideation sessions done with key stakeholder groups  
A defined number of ideas generated  
A defined number of detailed concepts developed  
→ A certain number of low-, mid-, or high-fidelity  
value/look-and-feel/feasibility/integration proto-  
types tested and feedback analyzed  
→ A certain number of prototypes tested with real  
customers and feedback analyzed  
→ Business cases for a defined number of pro-  
totypes validated  
→ Pilot with frontline staff done and analyzed  
In contrast to traditional projects, your deliverables stay  
living outputs. They will grow further and change as  
you go forward.  
In some organizations these milestones might be  
squeezed into an existing stage-gate process, often con-  
sisting of phases like discover, scope, plan, develop, test,  
launch, and review. Even if this is not ideal, it unfortu-  
nately often reflects business reality. Between these stages,  
01 Keep in mind that the examples given here are milestones when working in agile, adaptive mode. Later in a  
project, when you are working with a fixed-scope model, they might get more specific. To read more about how  
people perceive design processes, see Planned iterations in 9.2.4 and the textbox Dealing with constraints. 09 Service design process and management  
there are gates – decisions on whether a project will get a  
\(conditional\) go, be put on hold, be recycled, or be killed.  
Be aware that if you “black-box” an iterative structure  
with labels like these, you’ll still need to meet existing  
hard criteria at each gate to get a go for the next stage.  
Often, you can define “must-have” and “nice-to-have”  
criteria for each project stage. Try to define the criteria  
mentioned in this chapter as “must-haves,” since you can  
be certain you will meet them if you follow the process.  
9.2.7  
EXPERT TIP  
“Carefully manage  
expectations throughout  
the innovation process.  
Otherwise, especially  
after intensive innovation  
workshops, clients will  
demand that the specific

developed be delivered

Outputs and outcomes  
Going beyond the tangible  
Many service design activities will have tangible outputs  
\(e.g., research data, documented insights, idea sketches,  
prototypes, research and project reports, etc.\). However,  
as we have seen throughout the previous chapters,  
sometimes the more intangible or implicit outcomes of  
your design activities will be more important for you.  
For example, early prototyping activities might primarily  
be used to create a shared understanding and align-  
ment amongst the interdisciplinary project team – and  
are not just done for the ideas.02 Or take qualitative  
­ research\: while you collect a lot of concrete data on your  
research wall, one of the key goals might be to create  
empathy with your stakeholders within the design  
and management team. That’s not something you can  
put into a report.  
02 See Prototyping to communicate and present in 7.1.1.  
354/355  
Even though the rest of your organization will  
usually be looking at the tangible outputs, it is equally  
important to carefully assess and plan your intangible  
outcomes. They often turn out to be the driving factors  
for successful co-creation, reducing resistance within the  
organization and increasing your chances to implement  
in the long run.  
Flow of project knowledge,  
ideas, and insights  
Key intangible outcomes \(like empathy and deeper  
contextual knowledge and understanding of the stake-  
holders, the problem, and potential solutions\) are almost  
inseparable from the people who developed these in your  
team. While some stakeholders are part of the project  
from ­ beginning to end, many more will only join for  
some parts of the journey. This offers an opportunity for  
new ideas and perspectives and raises the challenge of  
passing on the important knowledge so they can mean-  
ingfully contribute. When people leave the project there  
is also a danger of losing essential parts of that hard-  
earned empathy, deep knowledge, and understanding.  
Plan to keep the flow of knowledge and empathy intact by  
­ building an unbroken chain of people across the project,  
supported by tangible documentation.  
It can be helpful to map out the flow of people, key  
outputs, and outcomes across your design process to  
better understand where empathy, deep knowledge, and  
understanding are generated and how they are passed on  
to upcoming steps – through people or through tangible  
outputs like documentation or prototypes. This is Service Design Doing  
RESEARCH  
In a “classic” project handover empathy  
is lost during the handover – for example,  
when implementation merely builds on  
a consolidated research report.  
A  
FLOW OF  
EMPATHY  
Handover through documents will not  
carry over empathy. Keep up the flow  
of empathy by keeping key people in the  
project from beginning to end.  
IMPLEMENTATION  
. . .  
Keeping a core project team avoids handovers  
and preserves the flow of empathy. At least  
one person responsible for implementation  
takes part in research, and at least one per-  
son responsible for research participates in  
implementation.

Documentation  
Decide early how you are going to organize and create  
your written01 project documentation. Check \(e.g., with  
your project sponsor\) whether or not there are any  
requirements on form and content. Depending on the  
industry you work in, there might be strict rules and  
obligations. Documentation can be tedious and hard  
work, especially if it is done in retrospect, so plan this  
well ahead of time. Build it into the activities themselves  
as much as possible, or at least do it while your memory  
is still fresh.  
01 By written documentation, we actually mean any kind of tangible documentation. Often this will be text and  
images, but it can be supplemented by other formats like video or interactive media as well.  
Document your process and decisions  
The service design process is adaptive and iterative. As  
you are constantly reviewing your progress and making  
changes, the real process will deviate from your original  
plan. As you go along, create concise documentation of  
the changes you made and the underlying reasons. This  
can be as simple as filing handwritten meeting min-  
utes, or just taking photos of flipcharts or sticky notes  
that contain those details. However, it might also be  
necessary to prepare a glossy slide deck to run a deci-  
sion past the board or to follow an official template for  
change requests.  
Important decisions that are undocumented might  
be challenged, creating unnecessary discussions or, in  
the worst case, forcing you to do over. EXPERT TIP  
“It takes the whole  
organization to create  
and deliver services to  
market. The intangible  
benefits are equal to,  
if not more import-  
ant than, the tangible  
outcomes, as without  
understanding and  
alignment, your team  
may contribute to cre-  
ative pollution that never  
gets implemented.”

09 Service design process and management  
Document your tangible outputs  
Most activities in the service design process have ­ tangible  
outputs which in turn act as the inputs for the next  
set of activities. These outputs are important for your  
documentation as they allow you to trace back outputs  
like prototypes to the underlying insights from research  
or even back to the original quotes from your research  
data.02 A simple indexing system can help to connect the  
original data from your research to your prototypes or  
implemented solutions.  
If a piece in the chain is challenged, you can retrace  
some steps and re-examine the underlying assump-  
tions or conclusions, or explain where it came from and  
who contributed.03  
Keep the documentation accessible  
You should decide up front how and where to store  
your tangible outputs so you can make them accessi-  
ble quickly at any stage later in the project. In smaller  
projects, a big project room with plenty of wall space  
might be enough. There, you can sort all the assets onto  
your research wall and idea/concept wall and exhibit  
your prototypes on tables or in a distinct area. In more  
complex projects, you should still keep a physical project  
space for key assets, but also plan for a structured virtual  
space where you keep the complete dataset.04  
02 03 04 See Indexing in 5.1.3 for more information on indexing data. See also 5.4.1, Case\: Applying ethnography to gain  
­ actionable insights, for an example of how this works in practice.  
Be careful\: a complete documentation trail sometimes can amplify a “not invented here” syndrome within the  
project team. New ideas are dismissed too quickly because they have not been through the whole process. It is  
key to acknowledge bias and stay open to new ideas and challenges. However, always keep track of those gaps  
or missing links to your insights and research data and close them if it becomes necessary.  
For more on team spaces, see Chapter 11, Making space for service design.

As tangible outputs are the physical evidences of your service design process, your documentation trail becomes

Jamin Hegeman  
Documenting the intangible outcomes  
Decide which of your intangible outcomes you want  
to add into the official documentation, and how. Many  
organizations have a bias toward the tangible outputs,  
and making sure you document the intangible outcomes  
can help you shift that focus toward a more balanced  
view. For example, you might include photos and use  
­ storytelling from a high-energy prototyping jam to un-  
derline the effects on interdisciplinary collaboration and  
alignment on shared goals \(“We have never seen them  
work together before!”\).  
Be careful though, since this is not always easy to do.  
Some of the effects can be quite subtle or hard to show.  
Reflect on this within your core project team and strate-  
gically include the parts you feel comfortable with.  
9.2.9  
Budgeting  
After completing the first planning cycle, you should  
have a good first idea of your core project and planned  
iteration structure, an initial baseline of core activi-  
ties, and a sense of the size of your core and extend-  
ed project team.  
Also, you can guesstimate the amount of travel, ma-  
terials, and external services that are required. This gives  
you plenty of input for an initial draft of your budget. In  
that sense, budgeting for a service design project can be  
really easy, or it can be as hard as in any other project.  
Here are a few tips\:  
01 See Indexing in 5.1.3. 09 Service design process and management  
→ Always start with a ballpark figure. If you have a  
target range, you can make sure you are not over or  
under planning. Then get more detailed. Iterate.  
→ Break up big budgets to reduce risk. If you aimed  
too high, consider breaking up the project into  
a sequence of smaller projects with increasing  
risk and budget. If you are too low, add depth or  
more iterations.  
→ Consider budget thresholds. Make sure to check  
the budget thresholds of the organization you are  
­ working in/with. What is the maximum budget  
your project sponsor is allowed to sign off? If you  
have to aim higher, who else will have to be in-  
volved \(and convinced\) to sign off that budget?  
→ Plan with typical content. As you cannot plan later  
iterations in detail, budget for typical work ­ packages  
instead which are – from your experience – within  
the parameters of your project brief and the expect-  
ed ­ output and outcome.  
→ Use group estimates. Seek out experts and  
­ experienced project managers to help estimate  
efforts and resources for each of your planned itera-  
tions. Use lightweight methods like planning ­ poker02  
to create meaningful discussions and arrive at realis-  
tic group estimates to remove individual bias.  
02 See Cohn, M. \(2005\). Agile Estimating and Planning. Pearson Education.  
358/359  
# Tips for working on a  
# shoestring budget  
→  
Start small.  
→ Select an appropriate project  
to start with.03  
→ Be clear if the project goal is for you  
to learn, or to convince others.  
→ Don’t expect others to change before  
you have. Follow the principles with-  
in your own circle of influence.  
→ Use undercover budgets\: asking for  
time is easier than asking for money.  
→ Practice guerilla co-creation\:  
go informal, do undercover  
­ coffee-corner workshops.  
→ Ignore labels and piggyback on  
existing initiatives. ◀  
03 Service design is not suitable for every challenge. It is most fertile if applied to  
wicked or ill-defined problems \(especially if someone has failed to solve them  
before\), rather than deterministic problems. This is Service Design Doing  
→ Plan with an appropriate buffer. Often people try  
to build in a buffer across the board to cater for  
unforeseeable challenges. While you can take the  
deviations from your mean estimates as an indica-  
tion, 20% seems to be a frequently used value – but  
your mileage might vary. If your project budget is  
estimated by multiple people \(e.g., subproject leads\)  
make sure you are not adding buffers onto buffers.  
→ Manage expectations. Make sure people under-  
stand that the content within your iterations needs  
to be flexible. Your budget accounts for overall time  
and resources, but you must to have a certain flex-  
ibility in how you actually spend your budget and  
allocate your people within the process. Clarify how  
to handle those changes.  
→ Understand calls for tender. For big projects,  
make sure you have a clear understanding of the  
sourcing procedure/tender process of your client  
organization. Purchasing departments will try to  
haggle and bring the price down. Decide whether  
or not you want to play their game and set your  
prices accordingly.  
9.2.10  
Mindsets, principles, and style  
Think about the “soft” side of how you do things. On  
paper and even in terms of the method mix, many  
design processes look the same. But people are different,  
including the people working on your service design  
project. You will find a broad variety of mindsets, prin-  
ciples, and styles. While most practitioners with experi-  
ence in service design share a common mindset and set  
of core principles, there will still be small but important  
differences. What is the vibe of the facilitation? Are you  
all speaking the same language? How do you interpret  
your role as a service designer?  
Depending on the ecosystem you are working in  
and your role, there is broad range of styles that you can  
bring to the table. Are you the engaging ones in suits or  
the thoughtful ones in turtlenecks? Is your background  
in design or do you come from the technology or busi-  
ness side of service design? Are you an external agency  
that offers to create and implement breakthrough proj-  
ects with a team of experts? Or are you a service design  
coach who enables people inside the client organization  
to do service design on their own? Or a project owner  
inside an organization who needs to figure out how to  
work with colleagues?  
If you are shopping for an agency or consultant, this  
might be one of the key points for consideration\: Is there  
a cultural fit between my organization and the agency?  
Or, if you are implementing a service design project  
­ within your own organization, what will be your way?01  
01 A lot of the softer side has to do with your style of facilitation. See Chapter 10, Facilitating workshops,  
for more information. 09 Service design process and management

Iteration planning  
Iteration planning regularly adapts your planned itera-  
tions and roadmap to the learnings of any previous activ-  
ities. After completing a planned iteration, use a sped-up  
version of the planning process described in the previous  
section as a base to update your planning. Where nec-  
essary, use the planning sections in Chapters 5 through  
8 to do detailed planning of core activities for in-depth  
research, ideation, prototyping, and implementation  
iterations. Typically, for most iterations of your project  
the iteration planning session of the next iteration will be  
combined with the iteration review of the previous one.  
A planned iteration structure with fixed dates for  
iteration planning and review also helps to manage the  
ideas and change requests you will receive from project  
sponsors and stakeholders – often on a daily basis. Those  
requests can wreak havoc on your project if not managed  
carefully. Communicating a clear structure of review  
and planning sessions can help to channel most of those  
requests. If the next session is not too far off, people are  
often happy if their new ideas and change requests are  
officially documented, assessed, and prioritized during  
the next planning session.

# The daily stand-up  
A daily stand-up is a regular daily  
meeting of your core team to quick-  
ly talk about what is happening and  
align the plans for the next 24 hours.  
It mainly helps to improve communi-  
cation within your project team and  
uncover and solve problems as early as  
possible. The rules are simple\: you meet  
\(standing up\), and everybody shares  
where they are going next and if they  
need help. It’s over in 15 minutes. You  
repeat this every day at the same time.01  
Here are a few recommenda-  
tions based on recent research02 on  
daily stand-ups\:  
01 02 This becomes even more important when you are working within a  
remote team. In those cases, use a stable videoconferencing system to  
set up your daily meetings.  
Stray, V., Sjøberg, D. I., & Dybå, T. \(2016\). “The Daily Stand-Up Meeting\:  
A Grounded Theory Study.” Journal of Systems and Software, 114, 101–124.  
→  
Focus on the future only.  
This is not about boring status reports  
\(see below\).03 Prompt your participants  
to ask themselves, “What will I do next  
to help our team achieve its goals?” and  
“What problems do I know of that may  
prevent progress?” Allow others to help  
you answer these questions.  
→ Don’t talk about progress.  
Visualize it.  
Tangible visualizations like burn-  
down charts that you put up in your  
workspace can efficiently render  
boring status reports unnecessary. The  
project’s status is constantly visible to  
everyone. Save the time for solving  
actual problems.  
03 The previously cited research shows that “What have I done since we last  
met?” should not be included in a daily stand-up. It often turns the stand-  
up into a boring status report, taking away from discussions on how to  
resolve real issues.  
→ Do discuss solutions.  
But do it briefly.  
Identify problems and try to solve or  
discuss how to avoid them. This is  
actually regarded as one of the most  
valuable activities in a stand-up meet-  
ing. But if the problem is too com-  
plex to solve in the given time frame,  
agree on a follow-up meeting to work  
on it with the right people. Do not  
break the timebox.  
→  
Minimize disruption.  
Choose a time and place that’s least  
disruptive for your participants, so no  
one has to wait or kill time. Pre-lunch  
often is the best time for a stand-up.  
Most people are there even if they had  
to work late the day before, and the  
prospect of imminent food will natural-  
ly keep the meeting short.04  
04 There is another advantage of having the meeting before lunch\: people might  
have informal conversations over lunch and can easily arrange follow-ups or  
in-depth sessions when necessary. 09 Service design process and management  
362/363  
9.3.2  
→  
Be on time. Keep it brief.  
Start punctually. Swiss time. We mean  
it. Wait for no one. And the meeting  
should be 15 minutes or less. When  
the 15 minutes are over, stop. If there’s  
nothing more to say before the 15 min-  
utes are over, stop too.  
→  
Don’t facilitate.  
Try to teach your team the format,  
but then withdraw. The daily stand-up  
should turn into a self-organized ritual.  
Also avoid determining who should  
talk. This often leads to a one-way  
communication between the facilitator  
and the group. Instead, throw a die,  
then go \(counter-\)clockwise from there.  
This supports an egalitarian discussion  
within the group. ◀  
Iteration management  
Manage focus between big picture and details  
One of the key elements of service design is the constant  
switching between different aspects of the service – from  
the big picture to the details. Practically this means, for  
example, going back and forth between a focus on details  
\(like single steps of the customer journey or even specific  
user stories or jobs to be done\) and the orchestration of  
the end-to-end customer journey across all those steps.  
Make sure to balance your attention between working on  
single touchpoints versus consistent and iterative devel-  
opment of holistic service experiences.  
When you are managing a service design process,  
it is important to do this systematically. Decide which  
perspective might be most valuable as a next organic step  
in your process \(e.g., customer experience, stakeholder  
network, business model, organizational feasibility, or  
technological feasibility\). But then also check the effects  
of the changes you’ve made on the service as a whole.  
This is especially important when you have split up the  
project team and started to work in parallel. Build those  
checks into your regular project structure – for example,  
by attaching them to specific milestones in the process.  
Manage problem and solution  
The same back-and-forth applies to the interdependence  
of problem and solution. When navigating through your  
iterations, make sure to keep a constant eye on both your  
potential solutions and whether they trigger new prob-  
lems which might lead to new, better solutions. These This is Service Design Doing  
EXPERT TIP  
“Over time, not only the  
scope of the project but  
also the environment  
around it may change,  
for example through new  
employees or the launch  
of new projects. It is  
therefore advised to peri-  
odically update tools like  
your project stakeholder  
map to review the overall  
situation and reflect  
on such changes.”  
—  
Julia Jonas  
kinds of iterations can be observed in the design behavior  
of experienced designers and often happen organically.  
If you and your team are new to this, you might have to  
explicitly step back and reflect on where you stand in  
this problem-and-solution space\: “Proposed solutions  
often directly remind ­ designers of issues to consider. The  
problem and ­ solution co-evolve.”01  
Day-to-day project management  
In terms of the daily tasks of project management,  
service design projects are not much different than other  
projects. Here are a few tips to help you stay sane\:  
→  
Do. Now.  
Service design is about doing. Refer to Chapters 5, 6, 7,  
and 8 for tips on how to do and manage specific activities.  
→  
Talk briefly. But talk often.  
If you do not align with your fellow project team members,  
things can quickly go astray. But outside your core service  
design activities, try to keep coordination efforts lean and  
efficient. Consider introducing a daily stand-up meeting  
\(see textbox\) to align the team on a day-to-day basis and  
make sure problems get identified and solved quickly.  
→ Make process and progress visible –  
preferably physically.  
One of the biggest problems in projects arises when  
activities are stuck and no one notices. Create visual  
Kolodner, J. L., & Wills, L. M. \(1996\). “Powers of Observation in Creative Design.” Design Studies,  
17\(4\), 385-416.  
01 process and progress boards and put them up in your  
workspace so everybody can see them and trigger action  
if necessary. Of course, if you are working with a distrib-  
uted team you might have to switch to a virtual solution.  
But the rule stays\: make sure it does not get buried in a  
file folder far, far away, but becomes visible in a pop-  
ular virtual space \(e.g., the start page of your internal  
social network\).  
→  
Keep your rhythm.  
When a project hits a tricky problem, it can be tempting  
even for experienced designers to lengthen the current  
iteration until team members feel they have the per-  
fect solution. Resist this temptation! Timeboxed itera-  
tions with regular reviews02 are even more valuable at  
times like this.  
→ Orchestrate quiet times and times of intense  
collaboration/exchange.  
Service design can be used to seek solutions for wicked  
problems. This can be hard and requires a deep under-  
standing of the matter. Try to create safe spaces of uninter-  
rupted work time for people to dig into those challenges.  
During those periods, prefer asynchronous communi-  
cation like email over instant or face-to-face communi-  
cation. At the same time, make sure there are enough  
opportunities for formal exchange \(i.e., workshops\) as well  
as plenty of informal opportunities to just run into each  
other to lower the barriers for personal exchanges.  
02 See Content reviews and Team retrospectives in 9.3.3. 09 Service design process and management  
# “Why should I join your project?”  
If service design \(or whatever you call  
it\) is new to your organization, you will  
have to sell your project twice to each  
participant\: once for the work, once for  
the new way of working. It’s not just a  
new project, it’s a weird one.03  
Here are a few common questions  
stakeholders have when they are invit-  
ed to join or help with a new project,  
and what you can do about them\:  
→  
Why me? Why am I here?  
Explain why you invited them in  
the first place, so they get a sense  
about their role in the process and  
the expectations you have about  
their contribution.  
→  
Is this legit?  
Show that they are not wasting their  
time. Build trust by outlining where  
the project comes from, who sponsors  
it, and which key people you have  
already talked to.  
→  
Aren’t we already doing this?  
Research early on whether there have  
been similar or even just similar-looking  
projects within the company before  
and put your initiative into context.  
→ What do you need or  
expect me to know?  
Assess how much ­ information really is  
necessary to join the ­ co-creative pro-  
cess. Usually not everybody needs to  
know everything. Do not overwhelm  
or confuse them.  
→ How does this help my  
organization? My team? Me?  
The project is your project, but not  
necessarily their project. Put yourself  
into their shoes and try to convey why  
they should care.  
364/365  
→  
What do you want me to do?  
Clearly communicate what you ­ expect  
them to do. Also explain how their  
contributions tie into the overall  
process/project.  
→ What will happen to my  
contributions?  
Use a visualization of your service  
design process to give them a sense of  
what is happening to their contribu-  
tions. Who will work with those outputs  
afterwards? Will they receive credit?  
→  
How can I stay in the loop?  
Regularly update your co-creators on  
what is happening to ensure ­ long-term  
buy-in. This can be a few emails sent  
out at specific points during the  
project, pointers to an online project  
platform, or concise presentations in  
selected meetings. ◀  
03 For more on how to sell service design to colleagues or other  
stakeholders, see Chapter 1, Why service design? This is Service Design Doing  
→  
Choose your context.  
This sometimes is neglected, but try to choose wisely  
where you and your team plan to work. Working on loca-  
tion at your client’s office will be different than just visiting  
every now and again. When do you need to limit external  
exposure? When do you need the \(informal\) exchange?01  
→  
Deal with unavoidable conflicts in a timely manner.  
You will find that the service design approach has many  
built-in strategies that help you to avoid conflicts in the  
first place. You can find them in the overall ­ approach \(e.g.,  
the strategic use of boundary objects or ­ prototypes for  
communication and development of a shared understand-  
ing, and the iterative nature of the process to reduce risks\)  
as well as in specific toolsets.02  
Conflicts that are more emotional or arise from  
interpersonal relationships \(“I just cannot stand that  
guy!”\) are harder to tackle and ­ usually require a different  
skill set. Hence, in the long term, consider training your  
team in conflict resolution up front. That allows them to  
quickly notice and resolve conflicts themselves before they  
interfere with the atmosphere in the team. Consult with  
a professional mediator on how you should proceed or  
check the conflict resolution ­ literature for an overview on  
available options.03  
01 02 03 Also refer to Chapter 11, Making space for service design, for details on setting up a dedicated project space,  
even a temporary one.  
See, for example, 5.3, Methods of data visualization, synthesis, and analysis, and 6.2, Decisions.  
As a starting point, see Brown, D. M., & Berkun, S. \(2013\). Designing Together\: The Collaboration and Conflict  
Management Handbook for Creative Professionals. Pearson Education. See also Shapiro, D. \(2016\). Negotiating the  
Nonnegotiable\: How to Resolve Your Most Emotionally Charged Conflicts. Viking Adult. While it is important to  
learn about conflict resolution, remember that your main focus should still be to build a resilient team that works  
in a positive and engaging way and can handle problems and conflicts with energy and effectiveness \(and even a  
bit of fun whenever appropriate\).  
Onboarding and communicating with co-creators  
Co-creation is at the heart of service design. Over the  
course of a project you might need to onboard many peo-  
ple to your extended project team. Make sure you plan for  
this, as it takes time. You might need to get permission  
before you can invite or work with people from other  
departments or external experts. In any case, almost  
everybody needs lead-in time to make space in their own  
schedule for your project. The people you might want to  
work with are probably not sitting around doing nothing  
and waiting for you to call. You even might have to get  
through their ­ natural defense mechanisms \(“Oh, another  
project …”\) before they will commit themselves to join  
your process – even if it is just for one workshop.  
True co-creation means you also need to create and  
maintain a sense of co-ownership with your co-creators  
beyond their direct involvement. This implies that they  
are not just involved but can also see or at least sense  
the impact of their own contributions later on. Try to  
regularly update your co-creators on what is happen-  
ing. This, in turn, ensures buy-in. There is a real danger  
in a “co-create-and-forget” mentality. Buy-in will only  
work if you keep people in the loop and give them the  
opportunity to see and experience the effects of their  
own contributions.  
Be aware, however, that you still need to carefully  
manage expectations during your co-creation sessions  
so everyone understands that not all contributions will  
make it into concepts or prototypes, let alone the eventu-  
al service solution. EXPERT TIP  
“Onboarding is import-  
ant, but its also worth  
thinking about a pos-  
sible future where you  
will not be so centrally  
involved in the proj-  
ect. Make sure …that  
you have managed to  
hand over all of the key  
premises and findings  
for a successful project  
during your project  
communication. Many  
of these are unspoken  
in a project, and lead  
the project to go off in  
undesirable directions  
once you have left.”

Simon Clatworthy  
09 Service design process and management  
Regardless of how small the contribution is and  
whether it is used later or not, it is always good prac-  
tice to track it and give credit. In its simplest form, this  
involves keeping lists of participants for all the activities  
you do during your process. Decide how you want to  
and can best give credit in your project – considering  
the realities within your organization – so it is actually  
meaningful to your participants.  
9.3.3  
Iteration review  
In an iteration review, you step back and reflect on what  
happened during your last iteration\(s\). You try to make  
sense of what you learned, create options for what you  
would like to do, and make decisions on how to make  
necessary changes to move forward. Typically, iteration  
reviews will be combined with planning the next iteration.  
Content reviews  
At many steps in your service design process, you need  
to do a content review – that is, reflect on the quality of  
your outputs and make decisions based on that. Many  
of the core activities of service design have those key  
­ reflective elements already built in. In research, have a  
look at methods of data synthesis and analysis.04 In ide-  
ation, especially check out the pre-ideation methods or  
any methods on selecting ideas.05 And for prototyping,  
04 05 See 5.1.4, Data visualization, synthesis, and analysis, and 5.3, Methods of data visualization,  
synthesis, and analysis.  
See methods for pre-ideation and reducing options in 6.4.  
366/367  
there is reflection mainly in the evaluative prototyping  
methods and subsequent synthesis and analysis stages.06  
Content reviews are usually done by the core project  
team together with selected stakeholders from the  
extended team. It can be useful to include an additional  
content review as part of your iteration review session  
before moving on to the team retrospective.  
Team retrospectives  
You also need to address your learnings on the process  
itself, your mindset, and the quality of your collaboration  
within the core or extended project team. This is done  
during team retrospectives, usually carried out within  
the core project team.  
There are many ways to do an effective retrospective  
of past iterations, and there are many useful questions  
you can ask. See the textbox Conducting a team retrospec-  
tive for one common approach.07 In a project with people  
working full-time, a more formal iteration review should  
be done at least every couple of weeks.  
Unless there is an escalation or your project sponsor  
requests formal documentation, your iteration planning  
and any of your intermediate documentation can usually  
be quite rough. Create visual notes on flipcharts that  
everyone writes on simultaneously or take photos of  
your sticky notes. It’s important that you do it and learn  
from it. But do not try to make it pretty – it will change  
again too soon.  
06 07 See 7.1.6, Data synthesis and analysis, which essentially again refers back to 5.1.4, Data visualization, synthesis,  
and analysis, and 5.3, Methods of data visualization, synthesis, and analysis.

Retrospective prime directive by Norman L. Kerth01  
A good way to get started is to read the  
prime directive of retrospectives out loud  
to your team.02 Then\:  
1 Remind your team what has  
happened so far, highlighting key  
outputs and outcomes since your  
last iteration\(s\). Consider doing  
the session in your project room,  
where your key outputs are visible or  
easily accessible \(e.g., your research  
or idea walls\).  
2 On a wall, put up these key ques-  
tions\:03 What did we do well?  
What did we learn? What should  
we do differently next time? What  
still puzzles us?  
3 Ask your participants to silently  
write sticky notes answering those  
questions and put them up on the  
wall. If there have been change re-  
quests, feedback, or new ideas from  
outside the core team, add them here  
too. Cluster the answers and clarify  
any notes you don’t understand.  
4 Discuss the clusters step by step.  
Add ideas, learnings, and potential  
changes as you go along.  
5 Ask participants to highlight the key  
drivers that need to be considered  
when doing your iteration planning  
session. Document your results.04 ◀

space for an honest review. Over time, it becomes a ritual.  
To avoid it losing effect, take turns reading it. Always try  
to keep it honest and fresh.

# Continual improvement of the Olympic spectator experience  
# \(when you know it won’t be right on day one\)  
AUTHOR  
Alex Nisbett  
Service Designer,  
Spectator Experience,  
London Organizing  
Committee of  
the Olympic and  
Paralympic Games  
When it finally came to game time,  
the organizers of the London 2012  
Olympic and Paralympic Games were  
clear on one thing\: that it wouldn’t  
be right on day one. Or day two, or  
even day three. In fact, they were well  
prepared for things to go wrong \(they  
did\), and understood the value of  
continual improvement of the spec-  
tator experience.  
As part of the team who designed  
and delivered the spectator expe-  
rience at London 2012, one of my  
roles as Games time approached was  
to design for, and then support this  
continual improvement.  
We created a simple, repeatable  
process to help identify the positive and  
negative experiences across the Games,  
which could be shared with venue and  
functional teams to help them make  
improvements to the services they were  
providing to the 12+ million spectators  
who made it to the Games\:  
1  Listen  
Our research team had already  
planned daily questionnaires, some of  
which were conducted as exit inter-  
views as spectators left venues after  
their events; more were delivered via  
email. The results of this research  
helped us generate a hotspot map  
showing where the main pain points  
were across the venues, along with  
numbers showing how venues were  
performing relative to each other. A  
healthy sense of competition between  
venues seemed totally appropriate!  
Qualitative and quantitative  
Observations from members of the  
spectator experience team in and  
around the venues combined with  
plain common sense from the venue  
teams helped us to define more  
exactly what the problems were and  
why they were happening. Additional  
detail also came from monitoring of  
social media \(the use of geolocation  
tagging meant we didn’t need tweets to  
include the name of the venue\).  
2  Learn  
With so much data from so many  
sports and venues, daily analysis and  
synthesis was critical to help us create  
a high-level daily report \(see the  
image\) for senior stakeholders, plus  
additional details for the venue and  
functional area \(FA\) teams to help  
them make improvements. What we  
saw as the daily challenges and contin-  
ued threats to the spectator experience  
\(the insights\) were matched up to  
practical and achievable improvements  
and mitigations \(the service levers\) to  
create a number of actions which we  
believed would make a difference.  
Daily report  
The daily report delivered to the  
main operations center also included CASES 09 Service design process and management

A The continual improvement engine operated each and every day of the  
games, involving multiple teams in the creation of data, analysis, reporting,  
and finally taking action to improve the spectator experience.  
B Hot spot maps showing relative high and low performers were created each  
day using data from exit interviews and online questionnaires about the  
spectator experience in and around venues.  
C A daily report created by analyzing detailed research results for each  
­ sporting venue and functional area helped those at the main ­ operations  
center, and senior stakeholders, to quickly understand how well we  
were performing.  
D A simple word cloud created from responses to one of the questionnaire  
prompts allowed us to see at a glance how spectators were really feeling.01

scores, ratings, and rankings to help  
identify the high and low perform-  
ers, plus overall trends across the  
Games. The very highest scores  
were in fact on the days when  
Team GB won medals and when  
the weather was at its best, prov-  
ing that sometimes there is more  
to an experience than what can be  
designed into it.  
3 Act  
Tangible actions, including their  
operational details, were refined and  
then prioritized by venue and FA  
leadership, before being shared with  
the teams on the ground who would  
implement them. These actions  
included changes to what already  
existed \(e.g., adjusted behaviors for  
frontline staff, or additional water  
fountains as well as completely new  
additions \(temporary digital signage  
to support new “day pass” ticketing,  
or the design and construction of  
Mascot House for the Paralympics\).  
Prototype early  
Most teams were actually really  
well prepared for the changes they  
were asked to make; in fact, each This is Service Design Doing  
and every team had previously run  
a test event \(a prototype in service  
design speak\) and they were used to  
learning and improving. Some teams  
were less able to make the changes  
required of them in order to increase  
their satisfaction scores – notably  
the catering team.  
4 Improve  
A sense of realism and pragma-  
tism among the teams helped,  
and we were very clear that things  
“wouldn’t be right” from the start.  
This healthy attitude meant that  
we were able to focus on continued  
and sustained improvement from  
Opening to Closing Ceremony, and  
across the transition from Olympics  
to Paralympics. In many ways, the  
Olympics were seen as a warm-up  
for the “Paras,” and indeed, the  
Paralympics benefited from lessons  
learned a few weeks earlier.  
Spectator satisfaction \(met or  
exceeded expectations\) rose from  
90% on day one to 96% at the end  
of the Games. The spectator experi-  
ence team could not claim respon-  
sibility for this, nor could service  
design alone as at the end of the day,  
spectators were there for the athletes  
and to be a part of the “greatest show  
on Earth.” If they had to queue to get  
into the venue or for their fish and  
chips, that wasn’t so bad, as specta-  
tors, especially those accustomed to  
large-scale events, were prepared for  
that. It is the Olympics, after all.  
However, improving the specta-  
tor experience continually, knowing  
that even the last day would be  
someone’s first day, was what we had  
all signed up for.  
KEY TAKEAWAYS  
01  
Accept that services and  
­ experiences will never  
be perfect and can be  
­ continually improved.  
Each and every day  
sees ­ customers getting  
their first and \(so the song  
goes\) lasting impression.  
Don’t miss your chance to  
make a difference.  
02  
Spend time on the  
front line watching and  
­ listening. Become part of  
03  
04  
05  
­ customer-facing teams,  
even for just a day. Know  
what it’s like to deliver a  
service. Make customer  
experience everyone’s  
responsibility.  
Define a deadline –  
create a sense of urgency,  
focus, and real purpose.  
We were regularly  
reminded how many “days  
to go” there were until  
Games time. This was  
initially motivating but sub-  
sequently frightening!  
Everything can be proto-  
typed, even sports events of  
Olympic proportions.  
Finally, if you ever get  
the chance to work on  
your dream project,  
cause, or job, do it. Drop  
what you’re doing and  
go for it; you’ll have no  
regrets.

9.5.2 CASE\: MANAGING STRATEGIC DESIGN PROJECTS  
# Vodafone\: Retail meets service design  
AUTHORS  
Marta Sánchez Serrano  
Head of Commercial  
Strategy and  
Operations, Vodafone  
Jesús Sotoca  
Consultant and  
Strategic Design  
Director, Designit  
Vodafone, one of the world’s  
leading multinational commu-  
nications companies, was ready  
to transform its approach from  
focusing on sales to focusing on  
clients. As part of that plan, the  
company envisioned developing  
a new store concept focused on  
user experience. They wanted to  
interact with customers in a dif-  
ferent way and increase customer  
satisfaction by creating a unique  
experience. Designit came on  
board to help them conceptual-  
ize, design, and implement the  
new service experience in their  
stores in Spain.  
A multidisciplinary team of  
12 people from both Vodafone  
and Designit led the project \(al-  
though more than 90 profession-  
als were involved in the extended  
team\), in which 30 key processes  
in the shop and the back office  
were ­ redesigned. Eight weeks of  
live prototyping were carried out  
after the first implementation.  
Key challenge  
The challenge was broken down into  
350 micro tasks, which ranged from  
creating an express checkout process  
and tablet service to defining new  
incentive systems for employees.  
Therefore, flexible project manage-  
ment was needed, so the team ad-  
opted agile methodologies \(e.g., daily  
stand-up team meetings and weekly  
reporting sessions, design sprints,  
validation sessions at the end of the  
week\) and adapted new tools \(dynam-  
ic lists, instant conversation groups\).  
It was key to gather the team regularly  
in order to balance the outputs of  
each micro task with the holistic view  
of the future customer experience.  
As with every strategic design  
project, the 10-week collabora-  
tion with Vodafone started with a  
research phase. During that phase,  
the Designit team conducted ethno-  
graphic research in Vodafone stores,  
interviewed users and commercial  
agents, held workshops with store  
managers and Vodafone leaders, and  
380/381  
carried out research on trends and  
best practices in retail. Afterward,  
through a few co-creation sessions,  
the team and managers committed  
to developing new store principles, a  
new service experience, and im-  
proved customer journeys.  
Prototyping methods  
At a very early stage, it became clear  
that the project was defined by a “pro-  
totyping challenge.” As the Vodafone  
store was a “new experience,” it was in  
itself a kind of prototype. Using meth-  
ods like role-plays and brief contextual  
walkthroughs in the shop environment,  
the Designit team was able to prototype  
the customer journeys. Many processes  
were modified before and after imple-  
menting them in the store.  
During the prototyping stage,  
the team also created mock-ups,  
digital and physical prototypes of the  
interface’s redesign, and new com-  
munication items such as a queue  
system, screen design, and set of  
commercial posters. This is Service Design Doing

A Modular furniture allows flexibility to easily reconfigure  
the store layout.  
B Sales assistants are not constrained to a specific area.  
Each of them has a tablet with access to Vodafone operations  
software so they can have a closer conversation with clients.  
C The Apptualizador \(Tech Expert\) area is more prominent.  
High desks have been set up to offer customer service, and there  
are pods for payments and activations.  
D Only live devices, no mock-ups. There’s a top 10 table with the  
best-­ selling devices and more than 40 live devices in the shop.  
E The working schedule was optimized according to the store  
­ footfall and in agreement with the store team.  
F Communication is now simpler and more direct. A number of  
messages were simplified. CASES 09 Service design process and management  
Rapid in-store testing of all of  
these ideas allowed the team to quickly  
validate and iterate and to observe and  
measure the success or failure of the  
ideas. For example, Designit proto-  
typed a “self-care kiosk” in the shop – a  
self-service point that allowed the cus-  
tomers to experience several services.  
Through iteration we identified the  
fastest way to be served there.  
During the “live prototyping”  
stage, consisting of in-store tests  
with real customers, the team even  
prototyped different furniture for  
new products in Vodafone’s portfolio  
such as the “connected home.”  
The project team collected quan-  
titative and qualitative data \(attention  
time, impact of using tablets during  
service, time per journey, satisfaction  
per journey, etc.\) that helped them to  
take decisions and to further iterate  
on the design. Those were the seeds  
for defining today’s key performance  
indicators of the Vodafone in-store  
experience. Finally, the team pre-  
pared all the material for the rollout.  
Redesigned store  
At the end of the ideation and pro-  
totyping phases, the store had been  
redesigned in every single aspect. New  
sales and experience models were cre-  
ated, new roles were defined, and new  
back office processes were developed.  
Designit generated a store manual with  
all of the information, documenting  
and detailing every single design speci-  
fication for the new store experience.  
In order to implement the  
service, Designit trained the com-  
mercial agents and coached them  
during the in-store testing. Training  
and teambuilding were emphasized  
to ensure that the new attention  
model was brought to customers as  
Vodafone had imagined it. Finally,  
they spent a few weeks monitoring  
and measuring the implementa-  
tion, ensuring that everything was  
running as planned and fine-tuning  
some of the initiatives.  
Other deliverables that the  
project included were new interfac-  
es for the self-service kiosks and a  
KPI control dashboard for measur-  
ing store success.  
Finally, a new innovation  
methodology was introduced to the  
Vodafone team. Ultimately, Designit  
and Vodafone have achieved three  
main objectives\: reducing waiting  
382/383  
time and service time by half, and  
reducing the number of people  
who leave the store without being  
attended to. As a consequence, there  
has been a significant increase in  
Vodafone’s client satisfaction.

9.5.3 CASE\: USING A FIVE-DAY SERVICE DESIGN SPRINT TO  
CREATE A SHARED CROSS-CHANNEL STRATEGY  
# Itaú’s design challenge\:  
# New brand’s tone of voice for digital channels  
AUTHOR  
Clarissa Biolchini  
Design Consultant  
and Service Design  
Specialist, Laje  
In December 2015, Ana Couto  
Branding and Laje, a Brazilian  
branding agengy and its innova-  
tion cell, were invited by Itaú – one  
of the biggest private banks in  
Latin American – to develop a  
project for them.  
The project’s goal was to help  
Itaú’s team to redefine their brand’s  
tone of voice for digital channels.  
The bank’s team would have to  
co-create their own results. The  
interesting detail of this project  
was the type of challenge to which  
we applied service design tools,  
since our client’s main challenge  
was related to a communication  
problem, not a specific product or  
service issue.  
Ana Couto Branding’s team, for  
which I was one of the main facili-  
tators, created a 5-day design sprint  
for 25 participants from across the  
organization and selected external  
stakeholders. This included partic-  
ipants from different areas of the  
bank and a couple of representatives  
from Itaú’s advertising agencies; on  
top of that we requested 12 end users  
and a research mediator for the tests.  
We worked for a few weeks with a  
team of four people to prepare the  
sprint and align it with the sponsor.  
Itaú is known to be an inno-  
vative company in Brazil, already  
very focused on customer experi-  
ence with a strong design culture.  
As Danielle Sardenberg, Itaú’s  
Marketing Channels Superintendent,  
said, “It was Itaú’s request to have  
a co-creative sprint for this specific  
brand demand, in order to create a  
collaborative approach, with deep  
understanding of the problem and  
excellent results, in a much faster  
time frame, compared to normal  
agency processes.”  
Although Itaú’s internal culture  
is familiar with new co-creative and  
innovative methods, this design  
sprint with a specific focus on brand-  
ing required careful preparation.  
“One of our main challenges during  
the process was finding the right  
design thinking tools that would be  
effective in a co-creation approach to  
redesign the brand’s tone of voice in  
its digital channels,” said Danilo Cid,  
Creative Director and Partner at Ana  
Couto Branding.  
At first, we created activities to  
help the participants empathize with  
the bank customers’ needs, applying  
tools such as digital user-based per-  
sonas, empathy maps, and expec-  
tation maps. The teams co-created  
their customer journeys based on a  
daily use of Itaú’s digital channels,  
and another specific journey focused  
on one digital activity. This allowed  
them to analyze the bank’s digital CASES 09 Service design process and management

A Day 1\: Participants were invited to interact with some  
communication material from the bank.  
B Day 2\: Participants were led through customer  
journey maps.  
C Day 3\: We brainstormed a plethora of ideas on  
words for the brand’s tone of voice.  
D Day 4\: Participants did an energizer in which they had  
to draw their partner without looking at the person.  
E Day 5\: The team helped the participants to  
consolidate the results of the design sprint. This is Service Design Doing  
services in detail, giving us answers  
about the amount of time end users  
utilized the digital channels and  
also the appropriate tone of voice.  
We also used card sorting and a  
“physical voting” method, where  
the participants had to walk around  
in the room to vote “yes” or “no”  
using their body movements. This  
ultimately helped them to define  
some specific criteria regarding their  
brand’s communications, like what  
expressions should or should not be  
used in the bank’s digital channels  
when communicating with clients.  
Regarding the customers,  
Sardenberg said, “Along the process  
we had great insights for communi-  
cation from the perspective of the  
clients.” We realized that the cus-  
tomers prefer red a more direct and  
friendlier tone, compared to the more  
formal one the bank had previously  
used in its communications. During  
the ideation phase, the teams co-cre-  
ated new rules and guidelines for  
the communication touchpoints and  
were able to build prototypes of the  
bank’s communication items, such as  
ads, text replies to the digital devices,  
and customer service scripts. These  
prototypes were tested with real cli-  
ents on the fourth day of the sprint.  
During the sprint days, “Itaú’s  
teams reacted very well to the sprint,  
since the process involved many of  
the bank’s departments that under-  
stood the complexity and relevance  
of the project,” said Patricia Martins,  
Itaú’s Marketing Channels Manager.  
We were easily able to notice the em-  
powerment of the participants and  
their engagement with the project.  
In just five days our team, togeth-  
er with the client’s team, was able to  
deliver the new guideline for Itaú’s  
communication across all digital  
channels and create a shared under-  
standing of the tone of voice across  
all teams involved in the bank’s com-  
munication and sales materials.  
KEY TAKEAWAYS  
01  
A short five-day sprint can  
deliver unexpected results  
and serve as a valuable tool  
to deliver results.  
02  
03  
Service design tools are  
not one-size-fits-all. It’s  
­ important to carefully assess  
and select the right tools  
for your specific project.  
Even though a sprint may  
only take a few days, it  
requires careful, thoughtful,  
and professional preparation  
within a small team.  
04  
Our main takeaway from the project  
was to understand and be able to  
create a more assertive way for the  
bank to communicate, in a friendlier  
and less authoritative tone of voice.  
And from the organizational point of  
view, the project has inspired us and  
made it possible to apply its results in  
the bank’s other divisions.  
— Patricia Martins, Marketing Channels Manager, Itaú  
Service design can be a  
­ powerful tool to create  
a shared understanding of  
communication tone and

# WHY FACILITATE?  
“Co-creation” \(more strictly, co-design\)01 makes  
great sense. In engaging a diverse group of participants  
in a multidisciplinary team, we encourage a rounded  
approach to a project, keep it rooted in reality, and boost  
the buy-in from a wide group of stakeholders who have  
been involved from the beginning. We need that precious  
range of viewpoints and experience.  
If service design is a truly co-creative activity,  
then facilitation must be the key tool of any practitioner.  
This chapter also includes  
Safe space principles in practice 402  
The Status/Control Matrix 414  
But put some folks from marketing, some hotline staff,  
a financial wizard, some techies, some middle manage-  
ment, a couple of designers, a union rep, and a handful  
of customers in a room, then sit back and listen. It will  
immediately be clear that the people speak very varied  
languages, sometimes literally. They might not share the  
same level of education or powers of empathy, abstrac-  
tion, expression, and comprehension. They certainly  
have different ways of working, diverse goals, and varied  
measures of success.  
How can we get the most out of these people, and  
keep them moving forward together in a context where  
they all feel useful, engaged, and might even come again  
next time? How can we even help them get better at what  
they do? Figuring that out is the role of the facilitator.

# 10.1 KEY CONCEPTS  
# OF FACILITATION  
COMMENT  
“The goal of facilitation,  
its primary purpose, is  
content driven and not  
process driven. So, while  
facilitators facilitate,  
they facilitate toward a  
result. On the way, they  
might do some teach-  
ing, some coaching, or  
different interventions  
to keep the group’s  
energy going. But it is  
not enough to deliver  
on process if the results  
are not achieved.”  
—  
Carla Verschoor  
A quick search online or a glance through your busi-  
ness library will reveal a lifetime’s reading on the roles  
of the facilitator.01 But most of this good advice arises  
from the context of meetings and similar work ses-  
sions – largely verbal activities which are usually set  
up to make big decisions. Service design, in contrast, is  
a creative, exploratory, and sometimes physical activ-  
ity which has a very different process and outcome.  
Are the traditional business facilitation approaches  
enough? We suggest adding techniques used in other  
creative and exploratory processes, used by people  
who call themselves the director, servant leader, Joker,  
or difficultator.  
A facilitator has a complex task, as she works at  
three levels simultaneously – process, group, and individ-  
ual. She will facilitate the process, offering information,  
selecting activities, and consolidating results to guide  
the work toward a successful conclusion. She will  
­ facilitate the group, keeping them motivated, engaged,  
and ­ productive while handling conflicts and tensions.  
And she will facilitate the individuals, helping them  
to be more empathic, analytic, creative, or skeptical as  
01 Some experts distinguish between the facilitator and someone who is just facilitating. Others talk about a facil-  
itator, a facilitative individual, a facilitative leader, and a facilitative group. See Doyle, M. \(2014\). “Foreword,” in  
S. Kaner, Facilitator’s Guide to Participatory Decision Making, 3rd ed. Jossey-Bass.  
needed, and perhaps helping them evolve in their skills  
and perspectives. To achieve this, she will need to con-  
sider three key concepts\: consent, status, and neutrality.  
10.1.1  
Consent  
Facilitating a process without the consent of the  
­ participants is an uphill struggle. Most facilitators prefer  
to get explicit consent before going far into the project –  
but that “I’m the facilitator” and simple nod on the first  
morning is never really enough. At first, all the partici-  
pants know about an external facilitator is that she is an  
outsider, probably earns more per hour than most other  
people in the room, and was just seen laughing with the  
boss in the corridor. There is no trust at all, but nobody  
will speak up against her in the glare of C-suite attention.  
Lack of consent is more often not explicit, but is a creep-  
ing sickness of lethargic responses, sideways glances, and  
insupportable objections.  
To counter this, it’s not enough to throw in some  
\(questionable\) team-building exercises like trust falls.  
You will need the participants to truly trust you to guide  
work which is directly relevant to their business, and you  
will be asking them to fail in front of their peers. To build 10 Facilitating workshops  
this trust, many facilitators slowly stack up implicit con-  
sent through a series of small agreements. They might start  
with consensus on the simple stuff like timings, breaks,  
and where to have lunch, then move on to agreements  
on the process and how to make group decisions. Later,  
depending on their style, there might be permission to step  
into disputes, to offer suggestions, even to determine the  
endpoint of the process.  
10.1.2  
Status  
The status of a facilitator is complex. It is multipolar\:  
she might be master of the process, but she is also a ­ servant  
of the group and their bosses. It is variable\: localized within  
a room or project, temporary, and limited even there.  
But as an outsider a facilitator can also say and do things  
which others cannot. Forum Theater02 practitioners call  
their facilitator a Joker,03 and the term fits well for any  
facilitator. Like a medieval fool, a facilitator is disqualified  
from holding real power, so she is free to ask the stupid  
question and name the elephant in the room.  
Most people in organizations “have” status – through  
seniority, personality, and network, or a combination of  
these. For facilitators, it is more useful to see status as a  
tool which can be consciously applied and changed.04  
02 Forum Theater is a facilitated, participatory theater form in which members of the audience explore  
potential strategies by stepping into a play themselves. For a similar technique adapted to service design,  
see Prototyping service processes and experiences\: Investigative rehearsal in 7.2.  
03 See more on Jokers in 10.2.1, Adopting a role.  
04 See 10.4.9, Changing status.  
392/393  
10.1.3  
Neutrality  
There is a great expectation of facilitators to be fair, and one  
of the fastest ways to lose a group’s consent is to behave  
in a way they see as biased. But different facilitators have  
different interpretations of neutrality, especially when it  
comes to content.  
Some facilitators, especially external ones, only take  
care of the process, and remain firmly agnostic to the  
content and the final result. Others are happy to share  
their own knowledge in a carefully neutral way – “I saw  
it done this way at corporation X,” “Professor Y wrote an  
interesting article on that” – but will not make a judgment  
or cast a vote. A third group feel able to grapple fully with  
the content, stating firm opinions while also owning the  
process. Whichever path they choose, facilitators will need  
to remain fair, and pay at least enough attention to the  
content to make sure that the group is making progress  
toward the goals of the workshop.05

# 10.2 STYLES AND ROLES  
# OF FACILITATION  
10.2.1  
Adopting a role  
It is not always necessary or even advisable to “be yourself”  
as a facilitator. Like a manager, a facilitator steps into a  
role, and can choose how that role should be expressed.  
This does not mean pretending to be someone you are not  
\(or copying another facilitator\), as ­ inauthenticity is bound  
to fail. Adopting a role is about deciding which aspects of  
your personality to emphasize.  
Many disciplines offer premade roles which can  
be adopted or adapted for service design facilitation.  
A ­ director in theater or film instructs and coaches her  
­ ensemble toward a new experiential offering.01 Some  
directors have a clear vision of the final result, others let it  
emerge; some are very open to input from the ensemble,  
others are autocratic. But like many design superstars and  
many managers, a director takes primary responsibility  
for the final result – something that few service design  
facilitators would do. This can be a difficult model for  
design teams, as the participants can feel like servants of  
the facilitator, but some aspects of it are very useful – in  
01 Importantly, the director is not usually an actress himself, so he is leading a team of people who are capable of  
things he cannot do. This is very similar to the situation of software development managers, who are not usually  
coders. See Austin, R. D., & Devin, L. \(2003\). Artful Making\: What Managers Need to Know About How Artists  
Work. FT Press.  
particular, taking the audience’s point of view and coach-  
ing team members to play to their strengths.  
Another great facilitation model is the sports coach.  
He is no longer able to do what he asks the athletes to  
do, and perhaps he never could. But he helps identify  
problems and opportunities, guides the team to create the  
strategy, allocates resources and solves disputes fairly, and  
then lets the team’s collective intelligence take the action  
and make the decisions on the field.  
In Scrum, an approach to co-creation most usually  
seen in agile software development, the facilitation of  
the project is cleverly divided into two roles\: the Product  
Owner and the Scrum Master.02 The Product Owner is  
­ responsible for the successful output of the project –  
making sure that the needs of the sponsoring organization  
and the customer are met. He does not interact with the  
development team in technical matters. The Scrum Master  
is responsible for the success of the development process.  
She will “protect” the development team, making sure that  
they they have freedom to work and move forward.  
02 Schwaber, K., & Sutherland, J. \(2016\). “The Scrum Guide,” at http\://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html. COMMENT  
“When we did our first  
jam,03 Nicole and I said\:  
‘OK, which will you be?  
Adam? Markus? Marc?’  
It helped to be inspired  
by others as we went  
into our roles. Facilitation  
involves stepping into  
a role in order to help  
others achieve their  
goals. The freedom you  
have in the tools is  
also a freedom you have  
in terms of how you  
use that role.”  
— Carola Verschoor  
10 Facilitating workshops  
Scrum Masters are sometimes described as “servant  
leaders,”04 in that they serve the team by removing road-  
blocks. This makes them obviously valuable to the team –  
a great example for any facilitator.  
If service design facilitators take inspiration from  
the agile model, they can consciously switch between  
the roles of Project Owner and Scrum Master – perhaps  
in different phases of the workshop – or can share them  
between co-facilitators.  
Just like service design, improvisational theater takes  
a fundamentally unpredictable process and gives it form  
and direction by sticking religiously to some simple  
structures and principles. Among these is the idea of dif-  
fuse leadership, exemplified in the traditions of “Yes, and  
…”05 or “follow the follower.”06 One variety of impro-  
vised exploration, Forum Theater,07 has a facilitator role  
called the Joker which offers useful inspiration to service  
designers. As a Joker, practitioners accept that co-cre-  
ative groups will often try to make their lives easy. They  
will assume that their ideas will be accepted quickly, that  
people will want to use them and will understand them,  
that the sun will always shine.  
A Joker \(or “difficultator”\) challenges these assump-  
tions, representing the harshness of the real world and  
making things trickier for the design team. The name

In “Yes, and …” exercises, an actor takes a colleague’s idea and continues it with “Yes, and …”, adding his own  
ideas to the story. This leads to exciting and interesting scenes. Substitute “Yes, but …,” and the scene goes  
nowhere. See the Yes, and … warm-up method in this chapter.

“Joker” is very well chosen. Just like the Joker in a pack of  
cards, he is fundamentally neutral. He is also changeable  
or apparently capricious, often using dark humor to flip  
between making life easier for the team \(“facilitation”\) and  
the equally important task of making it more difficult by  
forcing the team to be realistic \(“difficultation”\).  
10.2.2  
Co-facilitation  
Facilitators often work alone, but it can be very effective  
to have a facilitation team. With large groups, there might  
be a lead facilitator with responsibility for the entire pro-  
cess while junior co-facilitators might step in for particu-  
lar tasks, keep the records, or assist a subset of the group.  
It can also be fruitful to share the lead completely, taking  
turns to be in the spotlight. This gives the participants  
variation in delivery and style, which will help them pay  
attention. The facilitator who is less in focus can watch the  
group for potential misunderstandings, prepare the next  
task, work on documentation of the last step, or simply be  
ready to jump in as needed. It’s enormously empowering  
to be facilitating in the knowledge that you can go as far  
as you need to go, try new ideas, or mess something up –  
your co-facilitator will get you out of trouble.  
With two facilitators, one effective division is for  
one facilitator to be outcome-focused, while the other  
takes care of the needs of the group. This is similar to  
the division of Scrum roles, and it is not far from the TV  
thriller classic of “good cop, bad cop” – at least as far as the This is Service Design Doing  
participants are concerned.01 Sometimes, the backgrounds  
or organizational roles of the facilitators will offer other  
useful divisions, such as “frontstage/backstage” \(user  
experience versus process\). Or one “low-flying” ­ person  
might take charge of the tools and exercises being run in  
the room, while another connects the outputs into the  
“high-flying” strategy and goals, showing the participants  
that they are on target for their organizational needs.  
Having multiple facilitators also gives the facilitation  
team one very valuable tool – it’s possible for the facilita-  
tors to publicly \(but politely\) disagree. This can help more  
passive groups understand that there is no one clear “an-  
swer” to the problem they face, and that their own input is  
just as valuable as the facilitators’.  
In everyday project work, budget constraints or  
­ timing often mean that one team member must take on  
the facilitator role. While challenging, it is not impossible  
to facilitate your colleagues. Look at the tricks of tradi-  
tional meeting processes, where the chairperson is a tem-  
porary role given localized authority. That’s an excellent  
model for facilitating colleagues – taking control of the  
agenda and timing, keeping some distance from the is-  
sues by perhaps standing at the flipchart while others sit,  
and only dipping into the content level when necessary  
or especially valuable, perhaps with a “casting vote.”  
A team leader in a facilitator role will have great  
difficulty ever being seen as neutral and will find it  
hard to effectively adopt a lower status. This makes it  
especially difficult to combine project leadership and  
facilitation tasks.  
10.2.3  
Can a team member be a facilitator?  
EXPERT TIP  
“One intermediate  
solution is to borrow an  
experienced ­ facilitator  
from another part of  
your organization. They  
will understand the  
organization’s culture  
and limits, but will be  
able to be more neutral  
on the project itself. As  
they are a colleague,  
buy-in might be easier  
to achieve – but set the  
boundaries and responsi-  
bilities very clearly.”  
— Ivan Boscariol  
It’s a common question\: “Can a team member be a facili-  
tator?” In most situations, this seems difficult. A colleague  
working temporarily as a facilitator might have the  
consent of the group, but it is difficult to remain neutral  
if you are in the project because of your connection to  
the theme. It is even trickier to be perceived as unbiased  
when you represent a certain part of an organization.  
More crucially, an internal facilitator has a clear place in  
the hierarchy, and does not have access to the full range  
of status strategies which an external facilitator can adopt.  
01 Colleagues with military experience have likened these roles to the duties of the second in command and the  
senior NCO; or they may even be likened to clichéd “mother and father” roles. One variation is where the “good  
cop” does the “fun” stuff in the divergent phases, and the “bad cop” knuckles down in the convergent parts. 10 Facilitating workshops  
# 10.3 SUCCESS FACTORS  
10.3.1  
Building the team  
The selection of people in the room may vary at different  
stages of the project,02 and may not be the choice of the  
facilitator. But a good rule of thumb is to include repre-  
sentatives of anyone affected by the workshop or project,  
anyone who will deliver on the outcomes and outputs,  
and anyone who can stop it – in other words, the key  
stakeholders.03 Many organizations tend to restrict the  
invitation list for a workshop to the core project team,  
but they are usually quick to see the benefits of involving  
other parts of the organization, and these “guests” are  
often enthusiastic about being involved. This can cause  
budgeting issues – who is paying for that person’s time? –  
so make sure to discuss this aspect in advance.  
When it comes to customers, many organizations  
are unwilling to show their offerings in an incomplete  
state and to let customers look “behind the scenes” in  
co-­ design sessions. It’s a pity, because this inclusive  
approach can be warmly greeted. When KLM set up  
a co-design lab at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, they  
expected \(and got\) great insights. But they also bene-  
fited from their customers’ positive reaction to actually  
being involved in a design process,04 instead of just a

Don’t forget people with any expert knowledge you need.

satisfaction survey. One way to encourage unwilling  
teams toward more co-design with customers is to involve  
customers in other ways \(e.g., in more street testing and  
contextual interviews\) so that the team sees firsthand the  
­ value of including customers and is keen to bring them  
into the workroom.  
In some B2B organizations especially, the  
­ relationship with customers is quite formal, contract-led,  
and stiff, so this kind of co-creation is seen as difficult.  
This is a missed opportunity, as B2B partners are often  
in a long-term relationship, and can be quite happy to  
reduce risks and get better value from the future service,  
­ perhaps by prototyping together.  
10.3.2  
Purpose and expectations  
Before planning a workshop \(or series of workshops\), it  
is important to be clear what it is for. Often, your client  
\(or boss, or colleague\) will ask for a workshop without  
being clear themselves what they want to get out of it.  
They might feel a need for activity – but not much more  
than that. It’s important to pin down what your sponsor  
needs, even if you might not share this information fully  
with the participants. Find out what outputs and out-  
comes are expected and choose methods to reach them.  
You should also share an honest assessment of what is  
possible with the time and people you are given. This is Service Design Doing  
COMMENT  
“There is sometimes a  
tension between the neu-  
tral role of a facilitator,  
and the expected role of  
a consultant. Consultants  
are generally expected  
to deliver the results that  
the sponsor asks for. But  
in a facilitation setting  
we know that we cannot  
promise results, because  
the final decision is  
made by the team.”  
— Arthur Yeh  
Some sponsors have inflated ideas about the power  
of service design or design thinking to generate killer  
new business propositions or problem solutions in a very  
short time. It’s important to explain that service design is  
an understanding and development process, not a single  
creativity technique.  
Epic wins can happen at any time, but they can never  
be guaranteed. To make them more probable, you need  
to look behind the perceived problem or opportunity;  
to understand the needs; to generate, prototype, and test  
concepts; and to iterate. That’s not one workshop.  
The purpose of the workshop needs to be clear to the  
sponsor and \(usually\) to the participants.01 If you decide  
to tell them, tell them clearly\: “We are here today to find  
out what really goes on in this part of the call center.”  
10.3.3  
Planning the work  
Group facilitation takes place over various time frames,  
which we can think of as the project scale \(months,  
weeks\) and the session scale \(hours, days\). Planning the  
facilitation will be a matter of choosing activities and  
allocating resources along this timeline. Project-level  
planning will usually follow whatever innovation or  
design structure the organization and facilitator choose,  
such as the typical iterative process of research, ideation,  
prototyping, and implementation.02  
01 02 Sometimes, surprise can be useful. See, for example, 10.6.1, Case\: The energizing power of the unfamiliar.  
See Chapter 4, The core activities of service design.  
Within a single session there might be less ground  
to cover, and thus more freedom for the facilitator. Your  
workshop might only be set up to fulfill one task – like  
mapping a value network or planning some research – or  
you might need to go through the entire service design  
process in just a couple of days03 as a “taster” or as the  
first mini-iteration to kick off a project.  
It’s vital to remember that design is exploration,  
and it is both futile and counterproductive to try to plan  
everything, whether for a project or a session. You will  
have to adjust and pivot as you go along, confidently  
changing your plans to fit the reality of the discovery  
process but never losing sight of the time constraints.04  
There’s no need to be afraid, as the workshop which goes  
off the rails sometimes has the most startling results.  
All a facilitator needs is some backup plans, or enough  
methods “on call” that he can launch as needed. Or you  
might consciously adopt an approach of sprints, reflec-  
tion, and adjustment like in agile software development.  
As well as considering project goals, a facilitator will  
also have to consider the human needs of participants,  
planning a sequence of activities which is not only effec-  
tive but engaging, enabling, encouraging, and enjoyable.

See for example 10.6.2, Case\: Pivot and focus. EXPERT TIP  
“With a new team, people  
I did not know, I would  
wear a suit and tie. This  
communicated that I  
took people seriously  
and I was a professional.  
I would also use slides  
for presenting ideas and  
action plans. For the sec-  
ond meeting I would lose  
the tie and dress more  
casually. This would cre-  
ate a more relaxed and  
personal among friends  
atmosphere. I would also  
lose the slideware. People  
would be more relaxed,  
open, and less defensive.”

10.3.4  
Creating a safe space  
Many service design tools and methods seem uncomfort-  
able and strange to people in organizations, especially  
because a creative process needs people to fail. This is a  
very unfamiliar way of working, and people need help to  
accept and welcome it.  
One powerful way to do this is to pay attention to  
“safe space,” the physical and mental environment which  
accepts and embraces failure. The idea of safe space  
is well developed in theater, where every actor knows  
that the rehearsal room is completely safe. He can try  
anything, will never be interrupted or mocked, and will  
be judged only on what he chooses to bring out of the  
room. That’s the ideal atmosphere for innovation.  
A safe space cannot be set up by simply declaring  
it. “Today, nothing we do goes beyond this room” is a  
statement which only works if there is full trust, and trust  
is not usually present at the beginning of a co-creative  
project. Instead, safe space is built up using a mix of  
techniques – both in the planning phase and during the  
session itself. Many of these techniques are based on  
giving a sense of security to participants who are going  
through an unfamiliar process. Others help the team  
members adopt different mindsets – catalogs of behavior  
and responses – which are unlike the usual work mindset  
and are more conducive to cooperative, creative work.  
Own the space  
A good co-creative session needs its own private space  
where the group is not overlooked. Close the door,  
398/399  
­ uninvite guests \(“no spectators today, sorry – you are  
welcome to join in or step out”\), and paper up any windows  
which expose you to curious passersby. This need not be  
overt – a strip of flipchart paper at eye level gives priva-  
cy and holds your sticky notes later. You can extend the  
room ownership to the group by letting them rearrange the  
room themselves.05  
Start in familiar territory  
It’s rarely helpful to plunge people into cold water. Start  
where they feel safe. For example, in a corporate environ-  
ment you might wear a suit and welcome guests into a  
conservative room layout. Perhaps you start with a calm  
slide presentation showing which corporate strategy the  
project is part of. Orientation is important,06 but people  
don’t always perform best if they know exactly what is  
coming. Show an agenda which describes the coming  
session in conservative terms, without being dishonest.  
For example, an agenda point of “role-play session” or  
“live street research” will terrify some group members,  
but you can describe the same session as “understanding  
the customer” and no one will think twice.  
Make sure you understand the organization’s  
­ language – terms like “research,” “insight,” and “prototype,”  
or even “customer,” “user,” or “stakeholder” can mean very  
specific things in some organizations. So use terms the  
way your participants use them, or take time to explain  
how you will use them differently, and why.

EXPERT TIP  
“When I am facilitat-  
ing co-creative groups,  
I often draw on the  
practical \(but profound\)  
principles of improvisa-  
tional theater. There are  
many ways to express  
them, but I like Robert  
Poynton’s let go, notice  
more, and use everything  
with a core of yes, and.  
That’s a great foundation  
for any creative ses-  
sion – or project.”  
— Belina Raffy  
Invoke authority  
It’s possible to establish ownership of the process with the  
right tone of voice, a look straight in the eye, and carefully  
chosen words of welcome. Saying, “I am the facilitator  
today, and I will make sure we get a result” will make roles  
clear and also show you accept responsibility. But you  
may need more.  
If you have reference customers who are impressive  
and perhaps also conservative, you might name them  
when you introduce yourself to the group, and say in  
what context you were able to help them. If you have  
relevant qualifications which will mean something to the  
group \(and if you can talk about them without ­ sounding  
like a boaster\), mention them early on. You might also  
­ name-drop some very conservative and traditional orga-  
nizations that are using service design or design ­ thinking,  
like Big Four consulting companies and their peers,01 or  
the US military.02 For a small nonprofit, you might choose  
other examples.  
Best of all, get senior staff of your client organization  
to address the group by video message or in person and  
tell them which parts of the organization are behind the  
initiative, and which strategic goals it fits into.  
Break with routine  
Having started off in a conservative tone, it’s time to  
show that the upcoming work session will be different and  
01  
“Service design will be at the core of where we want to go.” Joydeep Bhattacharya, Managing Director, Accenture  
Interactive Financial Services at SDN Global Conference, Stockholm 2014. More professional services companies,  
banks, and other large organizations have bought up service design agencies in an attempt to benefit from their  
skills and capacities.

will have room for other kinds of ideas and behavior.  
Do something unusual but clearly useful \(like an extreme  
warm-up,03 complete with neurological explanation of  
why it’s important; or have the group quickly rearrange  
the room for group work\). It’s impossible to win trust  
straight away, but you might generate some curiosity.  
If someone resists warm-ups as kid stuff, talk about the  
science and experience behind them and gently show that  
someone who rejects them is missing an opportunity to  
be more effective.  
Ease in  
Don’t jump straight into the hard stuff, be too crazy, or put  
anyone in the spotlight yet. This is a good time to agree on  
or establish some ground rules. The Rules of Rehearsal  
are one example, but you might have your own. It’s useful  
to establish early on how you will make decisions – the  
Rules of Rehearsal do this via the point “Doing, not  
talking.” You might play a game to demonstrate useful  
behaviors or attitudes, like perhaps a “Yes, and …” round.  
Don’t spend too long on this, though. After an intense  
warm-up, the team will want action, not discussion.  
03 See 10.4.1, Warm-ups, and the method Three-brain warm-up in 10.5. 10 Facilitating workshops  
RULES OF REHEARSAL  
Use what you have.  
Play seriously.  
Doing, not talking!  
→  
→  
→  
The Rules of Rehearsal use a term which seems odd  
in many workspaces – “play.” In fact, play is a safe space  
in itself as it includes permission to fail. A serious,  
focused playfulness can be enormously effective in a  
creative context.  
Give orientation  
People always feel more comfortable if they know  
where they are in the process. But as service design is  
an explorative, iterative task, it’s not always useful to  
post a method agenda – you can never be sure in advance  
when you will change it. Instead, a large visual of the  
whole process can be reassuring. Refer to your process  
visualization often, and especially to the divergent and  
convergent phases.04  
Some phases of a design task are not comfortable,  
especially for inexperienced designers, and telling the  
group that it is OK to feel confused or out of control  
at these points will help them enormously. The end of  
a divergent phase can feel especially overwhelming.  
Participants thought they had a handle on a possible end  
result, and now suddenly there are so many new ideas, so  
many possible variations. This is a loss of control, which  
04 The Squiggle \(discussed in Planned iterations in 9.2.4\) is also useful here.  
400/401  
is precisely what most organizational processes try to  
avoid. It’s unsettling – so tell them “it’s normal to feel like  
this,” and show them that while the outcome is fuzzy, the  
process is perfectly clear. And try not to end a session on a  
divergent phase.05  
Sh!tty first drafts  
People who are new to creative work are usually far too  
careful. They think creativity is about having great ideas,  
so they spend too much time on their first ideas and run  
the risk of falling in love with them. Show them that in  
these early iterations, “lo-fi” – a rough, low-fidelity ap-  
proximation of reality – is encouraged.  
You could show them some of your own terrible  
sketches, present some very flimsy prototypes, make  
them use fat pens on small pieces of paper, or perhaps  
introduce the concept of sh!tty first drafts \(this is based on  
Hemingway’s observation that “the first draft of anything  
is sh!t”\).06 That’s a tough word to say in some corporate  
concepts, but there is no better way to express the idea.  
In the executive schools which led to this book, the  
concept of the “sh!tty first draft” became a real favorite  
with participants returning to their companies, as it freed  
people from the desire to think everything through in  
detail and take responsibility for every spontaneous idea.  
Management folks in particular are often delighted to  
discover how fast they can get to actionable results with  
this attitude.07  
05 06 07 If it happens \(sometimes it can’t be avoided\), acknowledge it openly.  
Ernest Hemingway’s statement, and the term “shitty first draft”, were popularized in Lamott, A. \(1994\). Shitty First  
Drafts. Bird by Bird\: Some Instructions on Writing and Life \(pp. 21–26\). Anchor.  
Another benefit\: commentators seem to give more honest and sweeping feedback on lo-fi prototypes as they think  
we have not invested too much time in them. This is Service Design Doing  
EXPERT TIP  
“We always want  
whatever we are doing  
to be instantly good,  
and this can cause us  
to freeze up. When I see  
this in my participants, I  
follow Keith Johnstone’s  
example and invite them  
to aim for average. It  
enables them to get  
that essential sh!tty  
first draft out.”  
— Belina Raffy  
To encourage this type of working, you can talk  
about sh!tty first drafts explicitly, or leave the term  
unsaid and instead encourage people toward them. One  
way is to use seemingly “impossible deadlines” which  
make the group worry about quantity instead of quality.01  
EXPERT TIP  
“You will have people  
with introverted and with  
extroverted communi-  
cation styles. Make an  
effort to give space to  
all of them and not only  
to the ones that speak  
most\: the extroverted  
ones. Make sure you  
use a mix of activities  
that allow for quiet  
individual reflection and  
observation as well as  
doing activities.”02  
— Renatus Hoogenraad  
Mix activities, make a mess  
Different people appreciate and understand different  
types of activities, so keep the energy in the room and  
appeal to different audiences by including a broad mix.  
Try to choose activities which make a clear contri-  
bution to the task at hand, but vary the location in the  
room, the media, the focus, and the physical position of  
participants. You can emphasize the explorative, “throw-  
away” nature of ideas and prototypes by creating a mess  
as you go on. Have candy in wrappers \(rustling, noisy  
ones are best\) which litter the room. Don’t clean up  
\(too much\) overnight.03 Have things like toys, gadgets,  
and old prototypes lying about – people will pick them  
up and fiddle with them while they think and talk. All  
these will help people remain sketchy in their thinking  
and presentation, until the time comes to focus down,  
make choices, and tidy the room. A key part of the  
design process is moving from productive messes to  
­ simplicity and clarity.

WORKSHOP STRUCTURE  
The workshop is structured in three phases\:  
a prephase, to fill in information gaps and even  
lower expectations; a main phase leading up  
to the key tool of investigative rehearsal; and a  
final reflection phase.  
In this one-day design workshop for  
a group of mainly frontline staff or  
­ customers, the plan is to examine an  
existing experience, then generate and  
test many new ideas using investigative  
rehearsal04 – a usually unfamiliar tool.  
We might spend about two hours establish-  
ing safe space and building energy before  
subtly slipping into the rehearsal phase, fi-  
nally ending the day with a reflective phase.

EXPERT TIP  
“They say there are two  
kinds of people\: the ones  
who learn by making  
fools out of themselves,  
and the ones who learn  
by watching others make  
fools out of themselves.  
Make room in your work-  
shop for both kinds.”  
—  Renatus Hoogenraad  
freely adapted  
from Thiagi  
Avoid killer words  
Avoid words and phrases which force people to be overly  
analytical or which raise the stakes on ideas too early.  
Don’t ask for “your best idea,” just ask for “a heap of ideas  
to get us started.” Don’t ask people to “choose the best  
option,” just tell them to “grab an interesting one to kick  
off with.” Don’t ask for a “presentation” or a “role-play,” ask  
instead for a “quick status report” or say “Can you get up  
and show me quickly how it might look?”  
Offer safety nets  
Participants agonize about the quality of their ideas, but  
some simple safety nets will ease their worries. Help people  
learn to let go of ideas by generating so many of them that  
leaving some behind becomes easier \(and remind them of  
the link between the number of ideas and the final success\).  
Increase the willingness to let go by throwing nothing away.  
Ask teams to pin up abandoned ideas on the wall so they  
can come back to them later. Let subgroups choose which  
ideas and insights to take forward, so someone can quietly  
ask his subgroup, “Can we not take my suggestion, please?”  
Avoid judgment  
In most corporate contexts, quickly deciding what is good  
and what is not is a key skill. Service design ­ encourages  
us not to rank and choose ideas, but to evolve them  
through prototyping and testing. So, it is helpful to avoid  
asking “Was that a good idea?” and instead ask “How did  
that feel?” or “What does that suggest?” In a co-creative  
environment, the words “good” and “bad” are rarely  
­ useful for content.  
Notice more and adapt  
Good facilitators develop good sensing skills, and are able  
to read the room and the people in it. They can see when  
the group is losing track, being dominated by certain  
members, or is lost, confused, or demotivated. Sometimes,  
you can ask the group directly. But they are not always  
willing or able to verbalize – and sometimes it is not the  
group which needs help, but particular individuals. This  
means sensing skills are very important, as is the flexibility  
to change the facilitation plan in response.  
Fail first  
It is no use telling participants that failure is welcome,  
then doing everything you can yourself to avoid it. If  
you mess up a part of your facilitation, be open about it.  
Laugh, and describe it as a learning opportunity \(some  
irony is completely appropriate\). Be clear that the whole  
session is explorative, and that some activities might fail.  
Give permission to be human by being human yourself.  
10.3.5  
Work modes in teams  
Whether “brainstorming,” talking, or prototyping, group  
work in teams has three basic forms. Look out for them  
in groups – consciously switching between them can be  
a useful technique, choosing the best one for the next  
task and the current group dynamic. We describe them  
as if the task was a written activity like drawing up new  
ideas, but the models apply equally well to working  
on a prototype. A

can let teams rescope early.  
D This looked much more roomy on paper … a physical sh!tty  
first draft of a transport seating system immediately  
reveals problems.  
E At the Hatch, participants are invited to get  
hands-on and messy.01  
One page, one pen  
All the group members are talking and one person is  
writing or sketching – either on a pad or device, or on a  
flipchart or board for all to see. Although status within  
the group plays a role, the “hands-on” person has a basic  
choice between being a servant or a king. If he chooses  
the servant option, he will record the group consensus  
and not take much part in the conversation.  
Or he could choose to wait until he agrees before  
writing a point down, or shape his notes to his preferred  
slant on the discussion. With various degrees of subtlety  
and success, he could take the crown of the king.  
“One page, one pen” is the mode you will see most  
often in your workplace and is the one most groups will  
default to. It is familiar, and has the advantage that the  
output has coherence, basic consensus, and is understood  
by the whole group, especially when the work has been  
visible to all. But more diverse ideas and opinions have  
already been ironed out. We have a narrow, “predigested”  
outcome – and this way of working is very slow in  
comparison with the other modes.  
One page, many pens  
In this mode, the whole group sit or stand around a  
shared work object. Everyone is writing, drawing, amend-  
ing the same drawing or text. There might be discussion,  
or they might work in silence. They share their time  
between actively contributing and looking at what the  
others are doing, what they are changing.

WAYS OF WORKING  
OF PENS AND PAGES  
Different ways of working in groups have different  
­ advantages and disadvantages. Most groups will default  
to one pen, one page, so encourage them to sometimes  
change their group cooperation pattern when they  
need diversity or speed.  
ONE PEN, ONE PAGE MANY PENS, ONE PAGE MANY PENS, MANY PAGES  
Completeness  
Shared understanding  
Speed  
Diversity  
This mode also works digitally\: when writing  
publications, the lead authors of this book often use online  
platforms to write simultaneously in the same document.  
We don’t have any verbal channel open – we simply write,  
or sit back, and watch the other cursors before dropping  
in to rearrange, rewrite, or add emphasis and examples.  
“One page, many pens” is reasonably consensual.  
Afterward, there may be a need to tidy up and explain  
some of the work to each other, but there is usually  
a basic understanding of the shared ideas. The tech-  
nique is messy, but quite fast. Conflicts and differences  
of opinion are usually readily visible on the page as  
crossings-out or notes and might be the start for a good  
discussion afterward.  
or sketching one idea per page. Often, the group tries  
for an ambitious number of ideas in a fixed time period,  
so they keep searching after the obvious ideas have been  
recorded. When the time is up, they come back together  
and each show the group their results.  
“Many pages, many pens” is a fast way to develop  
many ideas and particularly empowers more ­ introverted  
participants. Some ideas will probably occur several  
times from different group members, but there will still  
be far more diversity than with either other mode. This  
method does not bring a shared understanding – some  
ideas will need to be explained to the rest of the group,  
and this will take some time. The group will also need to  
decide which ideas to take forward, either by discussion,  
voting, or using selection matrices or portfolios.01  
Many pages, many pens  
The group consciously split up and work as individuals.  
Each person writes on their own pages, usually writing

COMMENT  
“You can be serious  
and playful at the same  
time. Serious is not the  
same as solemn.”  
—  
Belina Raffy  
EXPERT TIP  
“Participants may not  
always fully engage.  
Persevere when facil-  
itating energizers and  
activation activities.  
Resist the temptation to  
lower your energy and  
give in. You know this is  
important for the group,  
and by voicing this clearly  
and putting in the right  
energy, people will come  
along and benefit from  
participating in the end.”  
—  
Renatus Hoogenraad  
Warm-ups  
Warm-ups and energizers can be enormously valuable  
or a colossal waste of time and good will. They can help to  
“break the ice” in a group, help members get to know each  
other, get people comfortable in a space, make ideation  
more effective, help teams let go of ideas, help people to  
be happy failing, and wake people up in the natural low  
points of the day. Badly chosen or framed, they can also  
cost you the respect and consent of the group.  
If possible, pick warm-ups which have a secondary  
­ effect, and explain the thinking behind your choice.02  
Some warm-ups, for example, are great models of com-  
munication patterns or show us valuable behavior for  
group cooperation. Others demonstrate a point. Nearly  
all of them are ideation boosters.03 This chapter contains  
descriptions of several warm-ups we like to use.  
Rather than doing warm-ups automatically at the start  
of the day and after lunch, think about placing them more  
carefully. In particular, people are usually pretty fresh di-  
rectly after lunch, so do a warm-up 45 or 60 minutes later,  
when they are really battling their biorhythm. A power-  
ful warm-up can also be a great way to start ­ opening a  
safe space, after the introductory talks are over and the  
02 03 This might happen after the warm-up, in a short reflection – consider warm-ups as experiential learning tools in  
themselves. See Kolb, D. \(1984\). Experiential Learning as the Science of Learning and Development. Prentice Hall.  
Got a sketching activity coming up? Try a sketchy warm-up like “draw your neighbor in 30 seconds without  
looking at the paper.” These games are remarkably effective. See for example Worinkeng, E., Summers, J. D., &  
Joshi, S. \(2013\). “Can a Pre-sketching Activity Improve Idea Generation?” In M. Abramovici & R. Stark \(eds.\),  
Smart Product Engineering \(pp. 583-592\). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg. VIPs have left. In ideation activities, give the ­ ideation  
challenge first, then move straight into a warm-up which  
demands complete concentration before you start gener-  
ating ideas. This will stop the participants thinking about  
the challenge for a few minutes, with a positive effect04 on  
the ideation which follows.  
Combine warm-ups with other functions to be doubly  
efficient. Rearranging the room into a new configuration  
is a great way to mark a new step in the process. Add some  
fun music and a tight deadline and it becomes a great  
warm-up too \(the same goes for tidying the space\). Or, in-  
stead of boring introduction rounds, have the participants  
map out their organization, skills, or physical world by  
where they stand in the room. A game like Thirty-Five or  
Benny Hill sorting is a highly efficient work process that  
also works as a warm-up. If you have one of these activi-  
ties coming soon, a warm-up might not be necessary.  
If you can, go for warm-ups with a physical, spatial,  
and mental component, and with a fun factor. If people  
are concentrated, moving, and laughing, it’s going to be a  
good warm-up. And if we are having fun failing, we show  
a shared humanity and open a door to successful fail-  
ure in our work.

10.4.2  
EXPERT TIP  
“Make sure you keep  
the pressure high,  
even though the real  
­ timing may be liquid.”  
— Renatus Hoogenraad  
Timing  
One of the most powerful tools of the facilitator is time.  
Use deadlines throughout the day to keep the team mov-  
ing forward and to adjust the level of detail and polish in  
their work. Very tight or “impossible” deadlines can help  
teams avoid wasting time on talking too much. Time  
pressure will encourage them to go for quantity instead  
of quality. It will prevent them considering details too  
early in the process and promote creating the sh!tty first  
drafts mentioned earlier in this chapter.  
An occasional countdown through a task will help  
teams use their time wisely and keep up energy in the  
room, and counting out the last seconds \(or playing a  
“time’s up” song with a clear end\) means no one gets  
stopped mid-sentence. If a deadline must cut people off  
in mid-presentation, find a supportive way to interrupt –  
a vigorous round of applause hurts least.  
But be careful with impossible deadlines, though. They  
are very powerful up to a certain point, but there is a mini-  
mum time below which the task becomes meaningless. Play  
around with deadlines and see what works for your group.  
Give them 3 minutes, and they will gasp but knuckle down.  
Give 10 minutes and they will expect 15, but give 8 minutes  
and they will focus. Give 20 minutes and they will step out  
to fetch a coffee first; give 18 or 21 and they might not.  
Not everything can be done at a sprint. Like a ­ project,  
a workshop also needs slower times for reflection, recov-  
ery, and to make a satisfying dramatic arc.01 Decide if you  
01 See the textbox Dramatic arcs in 3.3.  
need a visible clock in the room. If you don’t have one, you  
can use “liquid time” – secretly ­ shorten deadlines to add  
pressure and increase energy; secretly lengthen deadlines  
if important discoveries are made, or if people have trou-  
ble with a task or need to feel productive.  
10.4.3  
The room  
The room itself is a tool, and a crucial one. We will talk  
about dedicated spaces in Chapter 11, Making space for  
service design, and much of that applies here. But let’s  
consider temporary spaces first.  
It’s easy to consign this kind of work to expensive  
off-site locations with a “creative atmosphere” that help  
us “think outside the box”; but that can signify to some  
people that service design is detached from everyday  
concerns, and needs a specialized environment. It’s fun,  
useful, and perhaps more sustainable to take a normal  
conference room and transform it temporarily into a more  
flexible and stimulating space. It shows that we can do  
this anytime and anywhere, and means that our colleagues’  
expertise and experience is just a short walk away.  
If you have a choice of rooms, think about light, pri-  
vacy, acoustics, and flexibility. Everyone loves light and  
air, and facilitation in a low-ceilinged, gloomy room is  
always much more difficult as the day wears on.02 But no  
one wants to work in a fishbowl either, and a feeling of  
02 In experiments, high ceilings seem to put test participants in a mindset of freedom, creativity, and abstraction,  
while low ceilings help them limit and focus. See, for example, Meyers-Levy, J., & Zhu, R. \(2007\). “The Influ-  
ence of Ceiling Height\: The Effect of Priming on the Type of Processing That People Use.” Journal of Consumer  
Research, 34\(2\), 174–186. EXPERT TIP  
“If high tables and bar-  
stools are not available  
\(talk to the manager  
of the staff restaurant  
before you give up\),  
ask yourself if you even  
need chairs. Try a fluid  
standing space with  
some tables near the  
walls to perch on and  
perhaps a few chairs  
for those who really  
need them. Ideally, there  
would be a comfortable  
sitting area for reflective  
phases nearby.”  
— Renatus Hoogenraad  
10 Facilitating workshops  
being “on display” can seriously inhibit creativity. So if the  
room is very glassy, encourage participants to use the glass  
as a work and display surface, and perhaps hang blank  
paper at eye level to shield them until the windows fill up.  
Music can be an incredibly useful tool. Use it to ener-  
gize, speed up, relax, calm, create urgency, have fun. Play  
light, jangly music during group discussion rounds, so the  
participants cannot listen in on other groups. Play quiet  
music to help create an atmosphere of concentration in solo  
work. Establish rituals like a set of songs to count down to a  
deadline, the start of the next session, or to a break.  
Practitioner’s experiments03 have found that the most  
effective furniture for creative groups seems to be a combi-  
nation of high tables and bar stools – they are restful for the  
legs but also make it easier for people to get up and move  
around. A flexible selection is ideal, with light but sturdy  
furniture which can be moved quickly and even folded  
away. Rearranging the room several times throughout the  
day helps punctuate the activities04 and mark the process,  
as well as mixing up groups and breaking up hardening  
social structures in the space. If they do it themselves,  
it also helps the participants “own” the space.05  
10.4.4  
Tools and props  
Tools and other tangible items can enrich a room. One op-  
tion is to have a core toolkit \(standard pens, scissors, knives,

tape, note paper, sticky notes\) on each workspace, and a  
central pool of shared resources like templates, cardboard,  
building bricks, figurines, and other prototyping material.  
Add to the mix by spreading some random portable ob-  
jects around the room – toys, gadgets, ornaments, puzzles,  
even little bits of costume \(or rubber chickens\). They can  
help establish a safe space by prompting other playful, curi-  
ous, empathic, or experimental mindsets.  
You can never have enough wall space in a room.06  
Participants should keep their material visible by hanging  
it on the wall, letting them constantly discover new con-  
nections and trace ideas back to their origins in research  
insights. This consumes wall space very fast, so expand it  
with wheeled pinboards or simply big sheets of cardboard  
which can be moved around fast, rested against tables,  
and laid to one side when not needed. If the space is  
very high, use a ladder to have another row of key mate-  
rial hanging high above the active area. It’s a great visual  
reference and stimulus, but it’s never in the way.  
10.4.5  
Visualization  
With so much service design DNA coming from the world  
of product and graphic design, visualization will always  
have a key place in the design process.07 Appropriate  
visuals speed up the process, allow for easy iterations,  
and get people on the same page very quickly. Compare

Tight deadlines, used lightly, keep the room engaged

B A quick visualization tells a thousand words … and  
provides the perfect support for storytelling or explaining  
an insight. That’s why so many key service design tools  
are visualizations.  
C As well as promoting a playful, humane mindset,  
­ random objects spread through the room will often  
become part of a prototype or a group’s identity.  
They will even help some people think better.01 a 4-page text document with many open questions to 10  
quick sketches\: only the latter will help you in a workshop  
setting. Visuals help enormously to make things tangible,  
helping participants move away from theoretical thinking  
into practical doing. Not least, you will rely on documenta-  
tion after your workshops, and visualizations of any quality  
will be extremely helpful and authentic in this context.  
If you want participants to draw, don’t show them  
your exquisitely drafted flipcharts first. Use scrappy  
visuals and scribbled templates yourself, tell them that  
stick figures are welcome, or give them a crash course in  
simple visualization techniques. Remind them that most  
of the visualizations they create will be only for the team,  
and will be left behind soon.  
10.4.6 Post it or lose it\:  
The expert’s guide to sticky notes  
If there is one tool which has become the epitome – or  
cliché – of service design it is surely the sticky note. In  
fact, those notes are enormously useful – they each hold  
a bite-sized piece of information and let us organize and  
sequence it easily, then change our mind. But they can be  
even more powerful if we use them intelligently.  
Encourage participants to both choose and mark  
their sticky notes consciously, not just grab the nearest  
one. Encourage them to use one color and size of note,  
and one color and thickness of pen for the same level of

“I use my sticky notes  
one color at a time, as  
it seems to work best  
and I think it encourages  
shared ownership of  
ideas. Other colleagues  
use chaotic mixes of col-  
ors and pens when they  
think the group needs  
this shock treatment or  
craves a release from  
gray thinking. That’s a  
valuable point, but I find  
the cost of the colorful  
inspiration is a slower  
process, and irritation  
for some people who  
like structure.”

information. \(Make this easier for them by only having one  
type of pen in the room and specifying the note color for  
each task or step.\) This makes it easier to find connections  
and groupings within the clusters of notes.  
If you use many colors, shapes, and pen sizes, par-  
ticipants may feel themselves distracted by searching for  
patterns among the colors, even if their conscious minds  
know that the format is meaningless. It can also make it  
very easy to see which ideas come from the boss …  
On the second day of a workshop, or after lunch,  
the floor will usually be littered with notes which have  
fallen off the wall.02 It’s annoying and it costs us data.  
Teach your team to pull sticky notes “like a pro” so they  
stick better. A flat note will stay on the wall far longer, and  
your “million-dollar idea” will be safe from the fifty-dollar  
vacuum cleaner.  
10.4.7  
Space, distance, and positioning  
Pull  
up …  
As a facilitator, one of your most powerful tools is your own  
body and physicality, using the entire room as a three-di-  
mensional stage. Do you sit with the participants, hover  
near them, or have your own territory? When will you step  
firmly into the center to get attention and focus, withdraw  
into a corner to let them get on with it, or fade into the  
group to do something together? To help someone pay  
attention, you can stand closer to her, step into her personal  
space \(directly behind her is most effective\), or, if appropri-  
ate, lay a hand on her shoulder to really make the point.  
02 Those extra-sticky notes are a good investment.

POSITION AND  
CONVERSATION  
 Parallel and triangular positioning,  
for a very ­ different conversation.  
PARALLEL  
POSITIONING  
TRIANGULAR  
POSITIONING  
Be conscious of relative height as well – there are  
times when you should stand when the group sits, times  
when you should sit or stand with them, times you  
should sit while they stand. When would you stand on a  
chair, squat beside someone, even sit on the floor? When  
do you make eye contact, and when do you let it slip  
away? When do you spread out your arms, or put your  
head in your hands? When is your body language open,  
critical, engaged, relaxed? Observe others and you will  
soon see what works.  
Most positioning strategies come down to two basic  
arrangements called parallel or triangular positioning.  
Parallel positioning is where two people \(or two groups,  
or a person and a group\) stand or sit directly facing each  
other, their shoulders forming two parallel lines. It is  
the position of the interviewee to the interviewer \(or the  
police officer\), the two negotiation teams, the two tough  
guys about to fight. This is an unnatural and uncomfort-  
able position which feels confrontational. Triangular po-  
sitioning is different. The two parties stand at two points  
of a triangle, facing the third point. The third corner  
holds \(or represents\) the material being discussed, the  
challenge, the problem. It is a more cooperative position,  
like two friends fishing in one ice hole, or mechanics dis-  
cussing how to fix a dent in a car.  
A parallel position is not always bad, and a triangular  
one is not always good. Sometimes a parallel position can  
give authority, like the judge in court or the nightclub  
doorman. It can be a powerful position to take charge  
of a group, to call a halt to unacceptable behavior, or to  
punctuate the day.01  
10.4.8  
Feedback  
Feedback is a very versatile facilitation tool. Quick team  
feedback from a “passing” facilitator or mentor can help  
teams stay on track, break deadlocks, or quietly suggest  
methods and tools. More public feedback – perhaps from  
the whole room or from visitors \(e.g., users, customers,  
frontline staff, or other stakeholders\) – can give a team a  
broad selection of new ideas and input, help them focus,  
and can also be used to divide up the day.  
Feedback sessions can be weighted differently to fit your  
needs. To keep teams on track and to diversify their options,  
keep feedback low-key and ask for “a one-minute status re-  
port in five minutes.” Teams will see this as a brief interrup-  
tion in their workflow and an opportunity to get some input,  
but will not see it as a goal in itself, or a “gate” in the process.  
01 A critique session, or simply “crit session,” is often used in design and art schools, where the term describes a  
session in which either peers or faculty critically evaluate a student’s work. In service design, crit sessions refer to  
inviting people who are not familiar with your project to critically reflect on your work. This often includes  
asking the really stupid questions no one within the design team dares to ask anymore – similar to the approach of  
“rubber duck debugging” in software development. See, for example, Hunt, A., & Thomas, D. \(2000\).  
The Pragmatic Programmer\: From Journeyman to Master. Addison-Wesley Professional. 10 Facilitating workshops  
If you want teams to filter and converge their ideas  
more strongly and perhaps make some tough decisions,  
present the feedback opportunity as a more significant  
event. Warn teams well in advance that they will be asked  
to pitch or present their ideas more formally to the  
group, to another team, or to a visitor. This is a huge op-  
portunity for valuable discovery, so you can even present  
it as a kind of research.  
Feedback can be enormously time consuming,  
especially if open feedback methods lead to discussion.  
When planning, remember that closed feedback methods  
are faster. If there are several teams, decide if they get  
feedback in parallel \(e.g., by pairing teams\) or in series  
\(e.g., in plenum\).  
To make a feedback round into a real point of conver-  
gence, hold a “dragon’s den” or “shark tank” session with  
visiting experts and perhaps a facilitator. These work  
best as a formal session in a separate room. Other groups  
should be excluded, to strengthen the impression that the  
feedback will be especially tough and honest. Teams can  
be quite shell-shocked after this experience, so don’t end  
a session with this.  
10.4.9  
Changing status  
A facilitator’s unique role as a leader of the process and a  
servant of the group gives him the ability to use his status  
as a tool, varying it as needed. The ability to elegantly move  
along a spectrum between “high” and “low” status can be  
a crucial tool and form part of a facilitator’s ­ personal style.  
412/413  
Our choice of words and use of artifacts can play a part, but  
because we are monkeys, much of this can be done with  
voice and three-dimensional positioning in the room.  
At your next trip to the zoo, spend some time watching  
the baboons. The one sitting still, high up on the rock and  
looking everyone in the eye is the boss. He’s a power-dress-  
er, with broad shoulders, a laconic loud voice, and head  
held high. Around him we have the main group looking  
busy, chattering and stealing sideways glances at him and  
at one another. And at the edges, we have the youngsters  
playing and one or two smaller individuals who sit quietly  
with their backs bent, eyes on the floor. That’s about all you  
need to know about status in one scene. There are always  
exceptions, and a lot will depend on your own physical  
stature, gender, and personal style in the context of your lo-  
cal culture. But as a rule, to raise your perceived status, go  
physically higher up \(stand straighter, or closer to a seated  
person to seem higher\), look at people directly, keep move-  
ments purposeful, and speak in a lower voice, using short-  
er, firm phrases and words. To decrease your perceived  
status, go lower, look down, move aimlessly or fidget, speak  
quietly and higher, and don’t finish your sentences.  
It’s important to remember that taking a low status  
does not mean surrendering control of the process \(even  
if you claim you are doing exactly that\). Sometimes, it is  
useful to go lower status to regain control. The Status/  
Control Matrix described in the following textbox shows  
some strategies for keeping a tight or loose rein on a pro-  
cess from different status levels.02  
Developed by Samuel Pickands and Adam Lawrence, based on experiences as a military officer and  
biker-bar doorman, respectively.

# The Status/Control Matrix  
It’s possible to lead from low status, and  
to allow others to lead without giving  
up high status. In one design session,  
the facilitator felt he was losing con-  
trol of the group and the situation was  
getting critical.  
Raising his status would have led to  
confrontation in that context, so he went  
low. From a standing position, he sighed  
and slumped suddenly into a chair,  
scanned the floor with his eyes, fiddled  
with his pen, and then looked up at the  
group with a hangdog expression.  
“You guys are killing me today,” he said  
quietly. “What do you suggest I do?  
Shall I cancel the session for today, or  
… well … \(shrug\).” After letting the  
group react – mostly by looking at each  
other in silence – he began to take  
control of the situation again by saying,  
“Is there any reason we can’t move past  
this today? Are there any facts we don’t  
have? OK, so … what can I do which  
will help us crack this in the next half  
an hour?” In effect, he consciously  
crashed from peer status down to very  
low status, then moved through the  
bottom row of the Status/Control Matrix,  
from left \(low status, low control\) to  
right \(low status, high control\). ◀

DOING,  
NOT  
TALKING  
Some tips on the many  
facets of “doing, not  
talking” from the Global  
Service Jam commu-  
nity. The table suggests  
alternate, “doing” ways to  
keep a process moving.  
GOAL OR TASK  
THE “TALKING” WAY THE “DOING” WAY  
Create ideas by … talking about it.  
thinking with your hands\:  
making sketches, playing around with rough models, acting it out.  
Evolve ideas by … talking them through, comparing opinions. building and testing them, comparing prototypes.  
Make decisions by … discussing the opinions. building fast prototypes, trying them.  
Share information by … telling me about it. showing me, letting me try it, letting me experience it.  
Break a deadlock by … Present your work by … discussing it, arguing. creating a presentation. testing, asking an outsider, playing a game, tossing a coin.  
showing a prototype, letting people experience and try a prototype.  
10.4.10  
Doing, not talking  
the sequence. Do you talk first, then build? Or do you build  
first, then talk? Do you need to understand something  
before you build it, or can you build it to understand it?  
At Stanford’s d.school, you will often hear of a “bias  
toward action.”01 At the Global Service Jam,02 where  
thousands of people in a hundred cities try to create  
new services in just a few hours, the cry is a simpler one\:  
“Doing, not talking!” As well as being a great way to keep  
moving forward, this attitude can help a facilitator in  
many critical situations. Often, an effective way to break  
past a creative or interpersonal lock-up is to change the  
working method or communication channel – leaving  
the verbal and switching to other ways forward.03  
In a “doing, not talking” mindset, ideas are evolved by  
pragmatically iterating on the prototype, instead of mak-  
ing hypothetical leaps through discussion. A “bias toward  
action” in any co-creative session will usually keep things  
moving more smoothly, as well as giving more opportu-  
nity to the team members who are less verbally dominant.  
Play with the balance between doing and talking, and with

10.4.11  
Growing as a facilitator  
As a practicing service designer, facilitation will always be  
a key factor in your success or failure. You will invariably  
discover and experiment with different facilitation styles  
and techniques. Learn from other experts, such as agile  
coaches, therapists, sports coaches, hosts of jams and other  
innovation events, practitioners of applied improvisation,  
and more. It’s valuable to ask participants for feedback on  
your facilitation style after each session or project.  
As you spread service design through your profes-  
sional context, you will develop a community of practice  
not just for design tools and methods, but also for facili-  
tation. You will find that every facilitator is different, and  
that what works for one will not work for others. Embrace  
this diversity – we can all learn from each other as we  
develop our own styles of facilitation. This is Service Design Doing

# Three-brain warm-up  
An unusually intensive, effective, loud, and very popular warm-  
up where participants have fun failing.  
Description\: A volunteer stands between three other  
people. From her right, she is asked simple mathematical  
questions. From her left, she is asked the color of familiar  
objects. In front of her, a fourth person makes very precise  
movements that she has to copy. The people asking  
questions are insistent, constantly repeating them until  
the right answer is given\: “Two plus two! Two plus two!  
Hurry up! Two plus two!” After half a minute or so,  
the participants trade roles.  
Essentials\: Stand in groups of four \(or groups of three  
with a shared ‘conductor’ making the movements\).  
Explain the roles and make sure the questioners are very  
insistent. They can reuse questions, but should never  
stop talking. When the subject is warm \(eyes bright,  
face full of life, usually after about 30 seconds\), change  
so everyone gets a new job.01 Once the team know the  
warm-up, it can be performed in a couple of minutes.  
Outcomes\: Warmed-up and excited participants who  
have been distracted from their previous thinking; an  
equalized group of people who have just had fun failing  
01 Always change all teams at the same time, so everyone starts and finishes each round at the same time,  
sharing the experience and building the dramatic arc.  
416/417  
# Color-chain warm-up  
A fun team warm-up which includes a lesson on communication.  
Description\: A group of 7 to 11 people stand in a ring.  
Led by a captain, they “pass” words to each other in end-  
less, simultaneous chains\: perhaps one chain of colors,  
one of animals, and one of countries. As the chains flow  
more smoothly, they speed up or add more chains.  
Essentials. Build up the chains one at a time. First, the  
captain should give a color to someone. This person gives  
a color to a third person, and so on until everyone has a  
color and the last person gives a color to the captain. Now  
run the chain, just looping the same sequence of colors  
to the same people. Keep the loop going, and get as fast  
as you can. Stop, and build another chain with a different  
pattern, perhaps using animal names. When this one  
works well, try running both chains independently but at  
the same time. When it fails, debrief and try strategies to  
make it work. Keep adding new chains \(three is enough for  
the first time\) and debriefing. Finish by physicalizing the  
chains – for example, by high-fiving on every handover.  
Outcomes\: Warmed-up participants, and a great model  
of communication, shared responsibility, and trust This is Service Design Doing  
WARM-UP  
# “Yes, and …” warm-up  
A warm-up for a new mindset of additive creativity and  
cooperation demonstrating the principles of divergent and  
convergent activities.  
Description\: People stand in pairs. Taking turns within a  
pair, they plan a common activity – perhaps a party or a  
shared holiday. In the first round, their ritualized conver-  
sation is based on “Yes, but …”; in the second, it is based  
on “Yes, and …”  
Essentials\: Stand in pairs, face to face.01 Explain the task  
\(like planning a holiday\), and the rules of the conversation\:  
one person will make a suggestion, the second will  
respond to the suggestion, the first will respond in turn,  
and so on. In the first round, every response must start  
with “Yes, but …” After about a minute, stop the group  
and ask them to repeat the same exercise, but this time  
starting each response with “Yes, and …” Debrief the  
activity. Which attitude took them further? Which was  
more realistic? When is each useful? The links to conver-  
gent and divergent activities in innovation02 are clear.  
Outcomes\: Fun, laughter, and a useful attitude change,  
especially when switching from convergent to divergent  
activities \(or vice versa\)  
01 02 If someone is left without a partner, make one “triangle” group of three.  
See especially Chapter 9, Service design process and management.  
FEEDBACK  
# Red and green  
# feedback  
A simple but effective closed feedback system to maximize input  
and keep moving forward.  
Description\: A group of participants have just seen an  
idea, prototype, etc. and give concentrated feedback.  
They start by asking understanding questions, then  
briefly describe what they liked \(green\) and what they  
suggest as next steps \(red\).  
Essentials\: After a short presentation or proposal,  
there are three phases. In the understanding questions  
round, the audience can ask for any unclear points to be  
very briefly explained. Keep this short, and don’t allow  
feedback disguised as a question. In the green round, the  
audience tell the team what they liked about the propos-  
al, what should be kept or expanded in future iterations.  
Next, in the red round, the audience share concerns or  
suggestions about the proposal. Crucially, they cannot  
give red feedback unless it is constructive, including a  
clear proposal or suggestion for the team. In both red  
and green rounds, the feedback recipients take notes and  
may only say “thank you.”  
Outcomes\: Plenty to think about for the team receiv-  
ing feedback, as well as a brief overview of that team’s  
work for the others METHODS

While service design is an emerg-  
ing concept in the Philippines,  
the ­ demand for improved customer  
services is ever-mounting. This is  
especially the case for the financial  
services industry, where it’s widely  
acknowledged that no one provides  
outstanding customer experiences,  
with many companies frustrat-  
ing customers with poor services  
and interactions.  
Most companies tend to bench-  
mark themselves against their com-  
petitors to discover “best practices.”  
This often leads to average designs  
and a massive “meh” effect for cus-  
tomers. Instead of taking this path,  
Sun Life Financial \(an insurance and  
financial services company\) decided  
to take a stand and redefine the cus-  
tomer experience from the ground  
up, without worrying about what  
competitors were up to.  
“It’s a very different approach  
compared to how we usually do  
it. Normally we follow a set of  
­ specifications and let the ­ technology  
do its job. I’m excited to see all  
this develop and really happen  
for my team now.”

Design Studio workshops  
and going “slide-less”  
for the first time  
Inspired by the growing number  
of people against using slides as  
communication tools, the On Off  
team decided to go slide-less for the  
first time when facilitating “Design  
Studio” \(applied design process\)  
sessions with Sun Life. It turned out  
to be a great decision! Instead of  
slides, the facilitators used stories,  
whiteboards, and role-play to bring  
ideas and concepts to life as they  
went along. The energy in the room  
was completely different, people  
were much more engaged with what  
was happening and they weren’t  
“zoning out.” The Design Studio  
activities were being driven by  
“doing, not talking” and “thinking  
with your hands” – not by bullet  
points on a screen.  
Observations and interviews  
The team conducted interviews with  
existing and potential customers  
and observed them using Sun Life’s  
digital platforms, such as websites  
and mobile applications, to find  
advisors and purchase insurance.  
This ­ provided details about how easy  
it was for customers to find informa-  
tion online, as well as assessing their  
wants, needs, and motivations.  
Outcomes  
One of Sun Life’s major goals is to  
create and deliver new standards of  
service in the Philippines. To prepare  
for that, several major internal CASES 10 Facilitating workshops

provided a foundation on which to

at preparing the entire organization  
to become more customer-centric,  
which means implementing signifi-  
cant organizational, structural, and  
cultural changes. The company is  
also aligning its digital transforma-

needs and enable ­ employees to  
deliver on them.

Don’t make it about ­ service

service design does.  
Design the day after the  
engagement ends. The  
best results are ­ sustainable  
after you leave.  
Use language as a design tool.  
Help your clients find a vo-  
cabulary that enables internal  
conversations to become  
more customer-focused.

10.6.2 CASE\: PIVOT AND FOCUS  
# Setting up and rocking the day or the room  
AUTHOR  
Damian Kernahan  
Founder and Head  
of Experience Design,  
Protopartners  
Pivoting during a workshop  
A few years ago while working with  
a rather large telco here in Australia,  
we hit a bit of a roadblock halfway  
through the project while trying to  
assist our clients to establish ­ greater  
empathy with their customers.  
We had completed all the design  
research and it was compelling\:  
­ customers were not too happy.  
But the senior management were  
finding it pretty hard to place them-  
selves in the shoes of their most  
­ valued customers.  
We decided that we could take  
the option to keep telling them  
how important it was or, maybe a  
better way, help them build greater  
empathy through a guided facilita-  
tion exercise. We ­ explained to the  
lead on the project that we were  
concerned that, despite the amount  
of research, his team might not be  
connecting with the research well  
enough. We asked for and received  
his permission to have his team fill  
out the same research questions that  
their customers did.  
Using the right tool at the right  
time with the right people  
We decided to use a context map-  
ping tool,01 to great effect. Having  
already had our customers share  
with us how they felt about certain  
things like “control,” “fairness,” and  
“  
­ connection,” we asked the senior  
managers in a workshop setting to  
fill out those very same pages in a  
diary format. We sent them outside  
for 30 minutes to reflect and write  
down how those things made them  
feel. While they did that, we placed  
up on all the walls the research in  
which their own customers answered  
those same questions.  
Getting real with your clients  
When the senior management  
team walked back into the room,  
01 The context mapping tool used was Zilver Innovation’s \(see http\://  
7daysinmylife.com\). CASES 10 Facilitating workshops  
A  
B  
we suggested that they read how their  
own customers felt. Our experience  
is that when people walk into their  
office, they forget that customers are  
people and feel the same way they do.  
This exercise quickly demonstrates  
that customers are real people with  
real feelings, not some figment that  
works only in our imagination.  
Nothing beats empathy  
As we helped the managers truly  
empathize with their customers,  
they began to understand from an  
emotional perspective not only the  
challenges their customers faced,  
but more importantly the validity  
of these challenges and the impor-  
tance of addressing them. We have  
used this facilitation exercise many  
times to great effect across a range  
of ­ categories. It never fails to help  
build the much-needed empathy that  
removes roadblocks and accelerates  
adoption of additional service design  
tools and techniques.

real customer answers on the wall  
for all to read.  
B Taking the insights and developing cus-  
tomer ­ solutions once real empathy has  
been established.  
424/425  
Within 5 minutes, all around the  
room, people who had found it hard  
to step into the shoes of their customers  
were spontaneously saying things like  
“They feel the same way I do,” “He  
has the same experience I have had,”  
and “I was surprised how similar I  
felt compared to our customers, it’s all  
exactly the same.”  
KEY TAKEAWAYS  
01  
Don’t tell your clients what  
they need to discover;  
instead, help them with the  
means to find it themselves.  
02  
03  
Be ready and happy to  
­ pivot. Things don’t ­ always  
follow the path you  
­ intended, even when well  
designed up front.  
Try to prove your findings  
from an ­ emotional per-  
spective first and a ­ rational  
perspective ­ second.

COMMENT  
“I think a dedicated  
working space is more  
than just an aspiration.  
The types of spaces  
described in this chapter  
are very purposeful –  
the work we do cannot  
be done in a traditional  
office with cubicles,  
heavy furniture, and small  
offices with walls.”  
—  
Doug Powell  
A physical space for service design teams and ­ projects is a  
common aspiration. Usually after the first few ­ workshops  
and small projects have been successfully completed in  
meeting rooms, rented workshop ­ facilities, and normal  
offices, the idea of a dedicated space comes up.  
The hope is that a lab, incubator, gym, or suchlike  
will be inspiring, will enable better work, and will serve  
as a clear signal to the rest of the organization or the local  
business community. But how should these spaces be  
set up? What should they contain? How should they be  
used? And are they really ­ necessary – or even helpful?

COMMENT  
“Service design spaces  
often evolve from play-  
ground to serious play.  
Playgrounds are seen as  
interesting and fun, but  
not everyone is able to  
see the potential impact  
on the business. Once  
a company reaches  
serious play the business  
impact of design-driven  
innovation is perceived,  
measured, and  
appreciated.”01

Physical spaces for creative work can be in-house or  
­ outside the normal working context, and can be  
­ permanent, temporary, or mobile. Often, organizations  
start with mobile solutions like toolboxes and carts, then  
experiment with temporary spaces before creating more  
permanent ones. Even if permanent spaces exist, the  
mobile solutions will always remain useful – you can use  
them in contextual project work \(working in the ­ physical  
context of the service\), and when spreading the word  
about service design.  
11.1.1  
Mobile solutions\: Kits, carts, and trucks  
Simple, portable solutions are often the first step for  
service design initiators, and need not be complex or  
­ expensive. You can facilitate service design with the sim-  
plest of tools – so why not put them in a bag, cart, or even  
vehicle and take them where they are needed? Put some  
sticky notes, pens, cutters, scissors, glue, tape, modeling  
clay, figurines or paper cutouts, a big roll of paper, some  
cardboard, zip-ties, connectors, hole punches, templates,  
signage, a portable loudspeaker, and a few generally  
­ useful objects \(rubber chickens are popular\) on a cart or  
in a roller-suitcase, and away you go. Material presented in  
this way feels more approachable and attainable. You can

the locals to keep going.  
With more budget, you could outfit a trailer or

like vinyl cutters, electronic maker equipment, costumes,  
or large card or foamcore panels for full-size prototyping.

Temporary/remote\: The pop-up  
It is possible to rent wonderful spaces for design projects  
off-site – this book was born in one of them.02 They come  
with a great atmosphere and perfect furnishings, plenty  
of materials, and sometimes even facilitation. They are  
a great option for short projects and kickoffs – but if  
you want to be there for more than a few days, you are  
going to have to invest quite a lot of money. As the best  
ones are justifiably popular, it can also be quite difficult  
to get access at the time that suits you and the rhythm of  
your project. And there is a limit to how much you can  
customize the space to your process.  
An interesting alternative is to set up your own  
temporary space. These “pop-up” design spaces have  
one ­ tremendous benefit – they can be built and used in  
­ context. To do research or test a prototype with users, you

with laughter because  
everybody wanted to  
have office space in  
that building. But there  
was a room which was  
not ideal for offices, but  
more or less perfect for  
us. Because it had few  
windows, it was diffi-  
cult to use as a regular  
office space, but gave  
us plenty of wall space  
for workshops. Once  
again, we learned – never  
give up, but take any  
chances you get!”

can simply step out of the door. In retail or urban con-  
texts, it can be relatively easy to take over an unused shop  
or office \(or shipping container\) for a few months, set up  
a temporary studio, and work embedded in the context  
of your project. If you have a flow of users \(customers,  
citizens, colleagues\) through your own locations, why not  
temporarily co-opt some space there, and do some “open”  
service design with visitors to your shop, office, or airport?04

organizations fly initially “under the radar.”05 That means  
there is no budget for an official space which can be

Pop-up studios where customers are invited to step inside might need to look more polished than less visible  
spaces. For a great example from a working airport, see 6.5.1, Case\: Opening the design studio to your customers.

devoted to service design – but there is that underused  
room in the basement … With \(or without!\) ­ explicit  
permission, almost any space can be turned into a useful  
service design facility. Meeting rooms, roof spaces,  
corridors, or underused offices miraculously lose cu-  
bicle walls, filing cabinets, and bulky shelving, before  
gaining whiteboards, prototyping materials, and more  
­ flexible furniture.  
A temporary space like this even has some advan-  
tages over a permanent one. Because it is less polished,  
you are less likely to see it hijacked by the bosses for  
“  
­ presentations” and “events.” And it is still flexible, so  
there is a great opportunity to experiment. What furni-  
ture works best? What balance of flexible and inflexible  
areas is useful? What technology is an aid, what is a  
hindrance? Start with trestles, old doors, even pallets.  
Encourage groups and facilitators to set up the space  
themselves, and to iterate and document their arrange-  
ments with each session. This is Service Design Doing

Maik Medzich  
Permanent/remote\: The retreat or outpost  
Ringing phones, colleagues knocking on doors, “I’ll just  
get something from my desk” – in an in-house corporate  
setting, distractions are a real problem and can even  
impact spaces which are “dedicated” to design work.  
The effects of these interruptions01 and temptations are  
not trivial. They break trains of thought, puncture safe  
space, bring complex mental models crashing down – or  
simply remind us of that forgotten email.  
For some organizations, the answer might be a  
creative space which is geographically separate from the  
everyday workplace. An owned space can come complete  
with your own research assets, familiar process tools,  
and even a facilitation team which really knows your  
business. Some organizations even make sure that the  
computer systems there do not connect to the company  
network, helping participants avoid the temptation of  
emails and familiar work platforms. Such retreats might  
be hidden away in the forest, in a hip part of town, or  
simply in a separate building on the same campus.02  
Another type of permanent “external” space, the  
outpost, can have the opposite intent. Instead of isolating  
teams from distractions, it might be set up to thrust them  
into a more stimulating environment. Many technology  
firms have outposts in places like Silicon Valley, where  
they keep watch on innovations in the startup scene or  
01 02 Unscheduled interruptions can actually help break impasses, but they reduce our powers of insight.

Insight and Impasses\: Do You Need a Break Right Now?” Creativity Research Journal, 20\(4\), 358-364.

high-tech companies.03 Fashion companies might keep  
small teams of designers in hotspots like New York or  
Shanghai, scouting for trends on the street. Simply being  
present in an energetic community with easy access to  
specialists and outriders can be a valuable booster.  
11.1.5 Permanent/in-house\: The studio  
Whatever you call it – studio, lab, workshop, gym, incuba-  
tor – having a dedicated and enduring space is the ultimate  
ambition of many designers and creators. In many cases,  
simply being able to leave work hanging undisturbed from  
session to session can be ­ enormously valuable – when our  
data and idea assets stay in the same place in the room, we  
seem to find it easier to build connections.  
In a permanent space, equipment and ­ resources can  
be kept near at hand, and distractions can be discouraged.  
For regular users, there can also be a ritual aspect to en-  
tering the space, which can easily shift them into a more  
creative mindset. And many first-time users will find  
themselves lifted into a different way of working by the  
change of context. The visible investment – both financial  
and personal – represented by a permanent setting always  
sends a powerful message about the intent, priorities, and  
values of the organization.04

# 11.2 BUILDING THE SPACE  
Creating a dedicated space for service design, whether  
permanent or temporary, is an exciting task. In fact, it is  
so much fun that you might be tempted to do it without  
really considering when \(and if\) it might be necessary.  
If you do decide to take the plunge and make a permanent  
space, there is plenty to think about.

Space  
If possible, go for a well-lit space with a range of ­ ceiling  
heights – but with generally high ceilings. Lots of natural  
light will help keep people awake and alert, and higher  
ceilings \(not too high!\) make us better at creative and ab-  
stract thought while lower ones can help us concentrate  
on details.01 It’s tricky to raise the height of most rooms,  
but it’s easy enough to lower the perceived height in  
certain areas with dividers, strips of cloth, or hanging ob-  
jects. Invest in good curtains, so you can dim the space  
to show a movie or promote concentration. A range of  
heights will also help divide the space into natural activi-  
ty zones, without impacting on communication or line of  
sight, or making the space unsuitable for activities which  
need plenty of room.

Acts. ScienceDaily,” at http\://www.sciencedaily.com.  
Selecting your canvas  
If you are looking for a raw space to convert into your  
own service design studio, look for\:  
→ Lots of walls which won’t get ruined by sticky  
notes and duct tape  
→ Good acoustics so group work won’t  
drown in the noise  
→ Natural light and access to fresh air –  
high windows are ideal  
→ A mixture of high and low ceilings  
\(if you can’t get that, go for a high ceiling\)  
Plenty of power sockets  
→ Space and water connections for a kitchen  
and good toilets  
→ Access to the outside world, but privacy

11.2.2  
Walls  
You cannot have too much wall space. In service design  
projects, teams will pin up templates, cluster sticky notes,  
and hang much of their research on the walls to keep it  
visible and keep it working. It seems trivial, but it’s often  
said that wall space is a critical success factor in service  
design. So make sure the walls are there to work – to be 11 Making space for service design  
pinned on, written on, stuck on. And if you have the  
height for it, provide a safe ladder so people can use the  
whole of the wall to display their work.  
This will often not be enough, especially if several  
teams use the space – so use temporary “walls” which  
can be moved into storage and brought out again when  
the project continues.  
If you work on flat boards, whether hanging from  
rails or hooks or simply propped up against a wall, you  
can stack them away when another team is using the  
space.02 When you return, you can rehang the boards in  
the same order, and the workspace is re-created as if you  
had never left it.

Division of the space  
Varied ceiling heights and movable walls can help  
draw subdivisions which can take on various  
­ functions – ­ reflection, sharing, movement, and more.  
You can create more subtle boundaries with changes in  
the color or texture of the floor and walls, with painted  
lines, light, movable furniture, or changes in the type and  
style of furnishings.  
Think through the activities you will perform in the  
space \(or better still, run a pilot and try them out\).

arrangement on the board.

Sound  
Consider the acoustics of the space. Large, light spaces  
often have challenging soundscapes and can be overly  
echoey or bright, especially when larger groups are  
busy talking. Soft furnishings, thick carpets, or other  
sound-catchers can help.  
As much as you want to capture noise, some-  
times you will want to make it. So make sure your  
space has a good sound system for music, film, and  
perhaps microphone – you won’t regret it when you  
are facilitating. Encourage participants to co-create a  
playlist, and establish sound rituals to start and end  
sessions, to bring the group together or warn of a  
deadline approaching.  
11.2.5  
EXPERT TIP  
“Many of the collabora-  
tive spaces in the global  
network of IBM Studios  
use a system of mov-  
able whiteboards that  
are suspended from the  
ceiling from a tracking  
system. This enables  
our teams to reconfigure  
the space in a matter of  
minutes, from small team  
spaces to large  
all-hands meetings.”

Doug Powell  
Flexibility  
Service design includes many different activities,  
from silent reflection to high-energy group activities.  
Sometimes small teams work quietly or alone, some-  
times dozens of people are moving through a full-size  
prototype. To meet all these challenges and many others  
you cannot foresee, keep the space flexible because you  
never know what you might need.  
A flexible space has more than one advantage – when  
participants are allowed to change the space, they start to  
assume ownership of it, creating the physical and mental  
“safe space” they need for their best work. Let them do  
this a few times, and the ritual character of setting up the  
436/437  
space this way will get people into their design headspace  
even before they think they are working.04  
So, look for furnishings which fold and stack safely  
out of the way. Make sure dividing walls pivot or collapse  
at need. Put wheels on pretty much everything,05 but  
keep some fixed references or you will drive participants  
crazy. Most successful labs have a central store of key  
resources which never move, plus one eternal constant –  
the coffee machine.06 And don’t forget to add the best  
washroom facilities you can afford.  
11.2.6  
Furnishing  
You probably need much less furniture than you think.  
Many service design tools work best when teams tape a  
template or arrange sticky notes on the wall and stand  
around them. Much prototyping is done standing up,  
but now and again your teams will want to reflect, or  
write, or build something delicate. Experiments at  
Stanford07 suggest that the best furniture for group  
work is high ­ tables and \(not too comfortable\) bar  
stools, combined with access to open spaces – the high  
seats encourage us not to keep sitting, but to perch for a  
while and move again. Choose tables with small, square  
tops, and move them together in different combinations

Your space does not stand alone. Even in a “retreats,”  
make sure you have strong connections to the outside  
world. Your teams will need good internet connectivity  
for desk research and remote interviews or collabora-  
tions. But there will also be physical, human, and opera-  
tional connections.  
The ideal location has plenty of resources nearby –  
libraries, centers of excellence, specialist providers. It  
will have good opportunities for research and prototyp-  
ing, and it will be easy to bring in or take out materials,  
­ prototypes, and guests.  
Who is linked to your space? Who is likely to  
drop in, and perhaps stay a while? How do the activities  
in your space link to other activities in your organiza-  
tion? How are you linked to other innovation processes?  
To the customer experience team’s workflow? To idea  
contests, culture work, open innovation? Is your space a  
central resource for key activities, or just a cul de sac in  
the organizational chart?  
Think how you can encourage serendipitous  
encounters with the rest of your ­ organization, your part-  
ners, your users. Plan events or offerings to encourage  
these visits and make them a habit.02  
01 02 See 12.1.1, Start with small projects.  
See 11.4.2, Case\: Sowing the seeds of innovation and change, for a space which is part of an inno-  
vation ecosystem.  
11.2.8  
Low and high tech  
Creative spaces tend to be markedly or even  
­ dogmatically low-tech. It’s true that in much of our  
­ service design process, a low-tech approach is quicker,  
easier, and will give us faster iterations. But restricting  
the space to purely low-tech approaches misses a valu-  
able opportunity. Carefully chosen technology can help  
us get higher fidelity in our prototyping, and better ex-  
amine the technical feasibility of our ideas. It can help us  
handle data better and make visualizations which open  
our work to a broader audience of contributors.  
To a certain type of participant, technology is  
inspiring in itself. Look for technology which augments  
our smartphones, which lets us simulate interfaces and  
machines, and which can quickly turn rough mock-  
ups into more polished forms for presentation out-  
side the group.03  
11.2.9  
Inspiration  
Almost anything can be inspiring to your visitors, so fill  
your space with almost everything. While the ­ traditional  
image of the design space is sparse and simplistic,  
a ­ complex visual environment actually stimulates  
cognitive process, providing you with better ideas and

If you use tech toys for prototyping in quick workshops, go for toys aimed at ages 6 to 9. That’s usually simple  
enough for adults not to need an explanation. 11 Making space for service design  
­ decisions.04 Walls need to be work surfaces, so don’t fill  
useful bits of the wall with framed art. For visual inspi-  
ration, have the artist paint directly on the walls \(and be  
happy about having the work covered in sticky notes\) –  
or go for movable art and curious objects05 instead, with  
space ready to hide them when they are in the way or  
you need clarity. Those gimmicks will often end up being  
passed around, fiddled with, or used as an ideation stim-  
ulus or prop in a service simulation.  
Add to the inspiration by keeping your resources  
and tools clearly visible. Transparent boxes work well, or  
simply have plenty of cubbyholes and shelving – what is  
visible will be used.

Scars  
EXPERT TIP  
“Co-create simple rules  
of how you want to work  
together. Open space can  
be daunting to some, and  
sometimes it feels like liv-  
ing with roommates … in  
college. So together you  
need to figure out what  
works for you.”

Greg Judelman  
Your space is a workshop, not a fashion boutique – so be  
prepared for it to suffer. Pens, paint, knives, glue, even  
power tools will all have an impact on their environment.  
So be prepared, and embrace the story that these scars  
can tell. Screw false tops to the tables, and replace them  
when truly needed – but not at the first scratch. Keep  
stain removers nearby – but don’t be prissy about every  
spot. Signs of wear and tear give your teams permission  
to use the space fully, and to make their own mistakes to  
add to the story.  
For inspiration, look to makerspaces, fablabs, and  
other open workshops. They are ­ invariably clean enough  
and well organized, with clear areas for appropriate  
tool use – but they are also stained, cut, burned, with  
438/439  
half-finished projects on shelves and crates of potentially  
useful junk in the corner. The combination of extreme  
organization and the marks of use makes a loud state-  
ment that this is a place for serious work.  
11.2.11  
Lay out the process?  
Some of the most successful design spaces physicalize  
the design process in their architecture to help teams and  
co-creative partners orient themselves.  
Chick-fil-A’s “Hatch,” for example, has a more or less  
circular arrangement of workspace around the outside of  
a large building. These peripheral zones are labeled and  
equipped for various stages of the design process, and  
teams move from one to the next \(or drop back to ­ iterate\)  
as they work. In the middle is a large ­ prototyping area,  
where you can build foamcore restaurants, try things  
out in working kitchens and eating areas, or even enter a  
virtual 3D simulation environment.  
Amsterdam’s Design Thinking Center attempts  
the same trick using pivoted walls which swing around  
to reveal the next stage of the process, as well as the

# Holding the space  
Once you have a space, expect to fight for it.  
People looking for “inspiration”  
or “something different” will  
want to use your design space for  
meetings, presentations, “brain-  
storming” \(meaning unstructured  
ideation\), and the same old boring  
formats, thinking that the space  
itself will add some magic. They  
might not be totally wrong, and  
perhaps you should welcome them  
with open arms – or perhaps you  
should give them a firm “no.”  
Just like an expensive paint-  
brush does not make an artist,  
the space itself does not make  
creativity. Ask yourself, what is  
your space really for? What are  
your goals? How does your space  
and its output fit in the ecosystem of  
your organization? Then decide who  
and what to welcome into your space,  
and under what conditions.  
It will be clear if you should allow  
others to use the space freely, or only  
with facilitation from your team. You  
will be able to ­ decide if you limit use  
to certain formats, insist on co-design,  
or allow free rein.  
Remember, the people visiting  
your space for these “other” events  
might be the ones who control your  
budget. You need them on your side –  
but you also need them to understand  
what the space is for, and what it can  
do. If they think it’s just a wacky meet-  
ing room, you have already lost. ◀

# 11.3 SPACE OR NO SPACE?  
Never forget that service design can be successful and  
hugely impactful without a dedicated physical space.  
“We don’t have the space,” is never an excuse for not  
­ doing service design – and while a good space can  
­ reduce the facilitation load, simply having a space will  
not make service design happen, or make it good.  
It needs to be populated with the right people, filled with  
the right knowledge and experience, and connected to  
the right processes.02  
But a space can set a very clear signal, with two very  
contradictory messages. The first message is that the  
organization is investing in innovation, in co-creation,  
in customer experience and in the skills of its people.03  
If budget is how companies show love, investing floor  
space and cash in this kind of facility shows clearly that  
Start cheap and rough, perhaps with mobile solutions  
to be used anywhere, or tools which can be used at any  
workstation. Try a range of kits and temporary spaces,  
learning from each one and building on each other’s ideas.  
See what processes, tools, traditions, and rituals work  
best, and how each one can create a safe space. Any one  
of these prototypes could give the model for a permanent  
facility, or could prove that you do not need one.  
service design is loved by the organization. That’s just the  
message you need to support your work.  
The other message which a dedicated space can  
broadcast is much less helpful. It can suggest that service  
design – or even creativity – can only take place in ­ special  
circumstances, far away from the everyday struggles  
of work. It can even suggest that this kind of work can  
only be done by certain special, selected people. That  
is the worst possible message you could spread – so  
every ­ activity of your space will need to speak against it.  
Perhaps instead you should decide to spend your energies  
and budget on supporting people as they do service  
design in their usual offices and cubicles, not in a special  
space. Or perhaps you need both. Consider it carefully.  
Or don’t think about it at all. Approach your potential  
“service design space” as you should have done in the first  
place – as a service design project. Research the needs of  
your stakeholders; ideate possible solutions; prototype  
them, prototype them as you build your community,  
and iterate your way forward.04  
And keep exploring the way forward into the  
physical ubiquity of a design-based approach – where it  
makes no sense to have a dedicated space, because the  
whole organization is set up to do service design any-  
time and anywhere.

# Why space is more than just another playground  
AUTHOR  
Maik Medzich  
Head of Customer  
Experience,  
Deutsche Telekom  
Introduction\: From process  
orientation to touchable  
customer orientation  
When we started to transform  
Telekom Deutschland GmbH  
\(Deutsche Telekom\) into a more  
customer-centric company, our  
focus was on improving processes  
and regulations, or filling checkbox-  
es for “customer centricity” within  
decision processes. At that time, this  
was the most appropriate action we  
could take, as the corporate culture  
was strongly influenced by a public  
authority. We were able to change  
a lot, but the end result always felt  
like a foreign object – we needed to  
take it to the next level. Moving from  
process orientation to action orienta-  
tion, we started to actively help proj-  
ects become more customer-focused  
through design thinking.  
It’s not just a room  
It quickly became clear that de-  
sign thinking works better when  
you have an appropriate \(physical\)  
environment. In a company like  
Deutsche Telekom, such a project  
meant we would have to bend all  
the regular processes to get where  
we wanted. In the end, we were able  
to lease a room that was considered  
too difficult to use for regular office  
spaces. It also helped a lot that we  
partnered with other departments in  
Deutsche Telekom, like HR Digital  
& Innovation, which facilitates  
transformative business challenges  
by applying design thinking, and the  
Creation Center,01 which has a long  
history of setting up such spaces.  
This partnership made clear that  
we were not just a few nerds – the  
request was supported by differ-  
ent departments.  
01 Learn more at http\://www.creation-center.de.  
Although a comprehensive physical  
space involves the risk that ­ people  
see a high barrier in applying design  
thinking, for us it became neces-  
sary to have physical evidence of  
the changes that were happening  
within the company.  
The impact of space  
Our dedicated workspace helps us  
to better run projects with creative  
tools because we have materials on  
the spot, combined with an environ-  
ment that supports “out of the box  
thinking.” We clearly see that this  
has an impact on the people working  
in that environment. Although our  
colleagues are not accustomed to act-  
ing like curious children at work, the  
gadgets we provide are helping them  
let go of business behavior and start  
to play. We also see another phenom-  
enon\: usually our dress code suggests  
business casual, so suits and shirts  
are very common. We see a change  
here as well\: the more often people CASES 11 Making space for service design

B Customer dialogue\: Customers talk directly to

C Flexible walls\: We use paper walls to enhance flexibility  
during setup of group spaces.  
D Flexible setting\: With high and low tables, almost everything  
can be moved with little effort.  
E Design thinking principles are permanently present. This is Service Design Doing  
work in the creative environment,  
the more they shift to embracing a  
casual dress code. It’s like feeling “at  
home,” where everybody maintains  
their own personality rather than  
being masked by a suit. You may ask  
yourself why this is big deal, but we  
believe it is important to get rid of  
classic business thinking like facts  
and figures and help to establish  
empathy, not only for teammates but  
also for customers.  
Another important advantage of  
having a physical space is to support  
customer dialogues. In the past, this  
often happened via external agencies  
in spaces outside our headquarters,  
and in the worst case, even behind a  
mirror. We now have the chance to  
bring our customers to the heart of  
our company, directly to our project  
teams. From the customer’s per-  
spective, this feels like the opposite  
of a blank room where they are part  
of an artificial interview situation.  
Using the creative space makes it  
much easier to get in touch with  
customers and reduces barriers as  
the environment radiates a relaxing  
atmosphere. It is very interesting to  
see that at the end of a session, when  
we say goodbye, our colleagues and  
the customers feel like “old friends”  
and they have fewer concerns  
about one another.  
Last but not least, this room is  
also part of the marketing success  
story; we use it to communicate  
about what we do and how we do it.  
For example, the “opening” was de-  
signed like a vernissage \(art exhibi-  
tion\) – so we not only provide access  
to the room, but we also spread the  
word about the things we do. We  
also try to get decision makers into  
the environment, as it helps to get  
support in other areas of our work.  
For example, just six months  
later, another room was set up at  
this office. It was originally intended  
for a single project, which was so  
successful that the owner decided to  
keep the space for further usage. The  
continuous work of HR Digital &  
Innovation at the end also bore fruit,  
as they managed to set up a standard  
furniture set for creative spaces to be  
used in any similar setting through-  
out Deutsche Telekom.

Besides the obvious use case,  
physical spaces are a symbol  
for change and a place where  
employees and customers  
can meet at eye level.  
A too-extensive focus on  
special spaces might harm  
your change progress, as this  
builds up barriers for appli-  
cation of design thinking.  
Experience is key – let man-  
agers, employees, and even  
customers experience what  
you are talking about, don’t  
just tell them.  
In big corporate companies,  
you may need perseverance  
to reach your goals – look  
for like-minded partners  
and don’t give up.  
Don’t make it look too clean  
– a little bit of hands-on  
mentality helps to activate the  
users, as with prototyping. CASES 11 Making space for service design

WECO is a co-creation platform  
that generates value for both the  
public and private sectors. In its  
first six months, WECO has already  
helped some 5,000 people to break  
down barriers between disciplines,  
industries, and generations, and con-  
tributed to helping turn ideas into  
sustainable ventures. To date, WECO  
has hosted 30 co-creation sessions,  
generating 100 new startup pitches  
to investors, with 3 of them already  
receiving a second round of invest-  
ment. One of WECO’s most promi-  
nent projects so far is the sustainabil-  
ity app called “Refuture.” OpenIDEO  
selected this app to launch a global  
campaign that found successful  
backing on Indiegogo. By engaging  
diverse people to solve challenges, we  
unlock creativity, build communities,  
and make change happen.  
Nowadays, unlocking inno-  
vation capabilities is an important  
challenge for China’s economy  
and society. Innovation can play a  
catalyzing role in ensuring China’s  
future success – this was one of the  
three themes that emerged from the  
World Economic Forum’s Annual  
Meeting in September 2014. Both  
Prime Minister Li Ke Qiang \(李克强\)  
and Xi Jin Ping \(习近平\) are promot-  
ing “Shuangchuang” \(双创\). Double  
“chuang” means creativity, which  
refers to “innovation and startups” as  
keywords to encourage co-creation.  
CBi China Bridge recognized this  
trend and started probing to discover  
the best methods, models, and prac-  
tices of design for innovation. And  
moreover, they wondered, what is ap-  
propriate within the Chinese context?  
Facilitating innovation  
In 2015, together with  
SuccessfulDesign.org, CBi created  
WECO. The name is short for “We  
Co-create,” meaning we bring to-  
gether different kinds of people with  
various mindsets, backgrounds, and  
skills to turn ideas into reality.  
446/447  
With the lack of traditional  
methods or any established atmo-  
sphere of co-creation, we followed  
an iterative process that began with  
a raw collaborative model of space,  
along with methods that considered  
the fundamental aspects of openness  
and involvement.  
Located in Jing’an district, the  
center of Shanghai’s creative area, we  
found the perfect space – a former  
fashion warehouse. Starting from a 2D  
blueprint of the space we established  
the building’s structural limits and  
possibilities; then, playing with draw-  
ings and paper models, we worked  
to create a flexible space that could  
reflect the basic principles of openness  
and inclusiveness. In this process, we  
quickly moved onto 3D, and once the  
space was physically empty we started  
to prototype hypothetical scenarios  
between people and available objects  
to simulate different types of interac-  
tions. Instead of starting with newly  
manufactured materials, we used This is Service Design Doing

“We know that innovation is not  
about simply thinking harder;  
it also requires collaboration,  
­ creativity, and design in an open  
­ environment. Such environments  
are not very common or readily  
available in China, so we decided  
to develop one.”  
— Rudolph Wimmer, Managing Partner  
and Innovator, CBi China Bridge  
A The heart of the WECO welcoming area is the kitchen table – as a symbol of conviviality,  
it is a great space for bringing people together.  
B Key actors\: people play a key role in WECO experience; mature companies, startups, and  
members of the community become part of the same ecosystem, bringing ideas to life.  
C We believe kids will be the entrepreneurs of the future, so we embrace the chance  
to hold creative workshops with them.  
D WECO is open to individuals and clubs for different types of gatherings that enable  
people with distinctly different backgrounds and hobbies – think watching sports,  
reading, reviewing movies, etc. – to come together, build relationships, and create some  
sparks while enjoying one another’s company.  
E WECO has hosted different interactive activities such as workshops, training courses,  
jams, creative camps, and brainstorming sessions.  
F This creative space lends itself to a collaborative, cooperative mindset, making it perfect  
for workshops, team building, and innovative training.  
A flexible and dynamic space  
We wanted the WECO space to be  
flexible, a dynamic and inspiring en-  
vironment that could allow people to  
reinvent the configuration depending  
on the hosted activity. Its features  
were initially selected according to  
the physical constraints of the space,  
building on event organization  
knowledge from SuccessfulDesign.org  
and CBi China Bridge facilitation and  
co-creation methodologies. A glass  
ceiling extends all the way from the  
kitchen to the guest area, where there  
are sofas and a public library. This is  
called 高架桥 \(gao jia qiao\), or the  
“expressway.” It connects the entrance  
with CBi’s studio and the observa-  
tion room. Here is where most of the  
activities happen.  
In the middle of the space is a  
projector screen that, when fully  
drawn down, transforms the space  
into a lecture room. This makes the  
space very flexible – it is, at once, a  
kitchen, an informal meeting room,  
a lecture hall, a dining room, and  
a welcome area. In other words, an  
open space for opening minds.  
On one side of the “gao jia qiao”  
there are two smaller rooms, the This is Service Design Doing  
“small bridge” and the “big bridge.”  
This space is equipped for recording  
sound and video, but unlike tradi-  
tional observation rooms, which  
usually have a one-way mirror, the  
activity is observed from another  
room. This creates a more comfort-  
able feeling for the innovation team.  
The main room is connected with  
the big bridge by a door that, once  
opened, transforms the space into a  
bigger workshop or co-creation area.  
CBi’s studio also is open and  
connected with the common space.  
When external people are involved  
in projects that require a private  
space they can use the project rooms  
to immerse with the team and the  
material, while outside they can sit  
and collaborate with others.  
“I think anything can happen in this  
place, and the space feels  
surprisingly free.”  
— Chen Zhang, CEO, Orient  
Landscape Group \(张\)  
Creating an ecosystem  
WECO was born as a space to host  
co-creation events, with the goal to  
encourage startups to test and iterate  
their products and services. But we  
soon realized, based on how people  
were interacting and communicat-  
ing, that it was not simply about  
building a physical space, but also  
about creating an innovation ecosys-  
tem without boundaries.  
“The kind of interaction and collab-  
oration we were looking for made us  
realize that our goal should not be  
simply a physical space, but an inno-  
vation ecosystem without boundaries.”  
— Sissi Ren, Co-Founder of SuccessfulDesign.org  
Every event is facilitated by experts  
who are able to support initiatives, fol-  
low up on projects, and assist brands  
in their design process. WECO’s  
system and design methods can be ap-  
plied to different organizations – while  
helping NGOs and social enterprises  
to use co-design to better confront  
important social issues and challenges,  
we charge companies for the oppor-  
tunity to facilitate innovation, and en-  
gage their target customers, staff, and  
partners in the co-creation process,  
by adopting a design-driven approach  
with customer-centric perspectives of  
their business.  
“It is so exciting for me just to look  
around this space, to know that there  
are spaces like this in China, because  
spaces like this can help great cre-  
ative thinking, design, and prod-  
uct development.”  
— David Houle, Future Thinker, Strategist, Speaker  
WECO is a tight ecosystem in which  
design and business are colliding  
in the same space. By combining  
CBi China Bridge design consulting  
knowledge and SuccessfulDesign.org’s  
network, WECO overcomes the chal-  
lenge of involving businesses in the  
design process to stimulate actionable  
creativity. It is an open environment  
for open minds. It goes beyond the  
physical space – through the WeChat  
platform, people can follow different  
activities, such as a weekly sharing  
session called “Hello Design” in  
which more than 300 people can  
listen, comment, and ask questions  
about the topic of the week.  
For most of our offline ac-  
tivities we create online groups  
in which people can share their  
thoughts, news, and questions.  
These small communities that we CASES 11 Making space for service design  
create often remain active long after  
the event is over.  
WECO was a needed space. The  
challenge was not only to make it  
relevant to the Chinese market, but  
for it to be useful and appealing at  
the same time. This friendly, invit-  
ing space contains various practical  
materials for notes, sketching, and  
prototyping, and a service design  
toolkit that serves as a reference for  
design thinking methodologies. CBi  
also developed a Workshop Toolbox,  
aimed at applying design methodol-  
ogies to remote areas.  
At WECO, ideas are nurtured  
and grow. We believe our space  
represents the future of collabo-  
rative working and that within 10  
years, nearly all isolated spaces and  
cubicles will disappear. We are proud  
to be supporting co-creation as the  
means for becoming the standard  
way of working.  
KEY TAKEAWAYS  
01  
In order to foster a creative  
environment you need tools  
and methodologies, but  
mostly you need an envi-  
ronment that enables people  
to gain their own “creative  
confidence.”  
02  
Having a diverse group of  
people aligned around a  
common purpose, guided by  
a solid process, is like rocket  
fuel for innovation.  
03  
Diversity in backgrounds,  
expertise, and experience  
is so much more import-  
ant than diversity around  
culture and race. Variety is  
important because differ-  
ences attract open-minded  
people, which helps to create  
collision.

The business model itself  
will need to become more  
open and sustainable. Some-  
times an innovation’s success  
is linked to timing; the  
next iteration will be better  
designed, so it is prepared  
for changes in circumstanc-  
es, resources, and other  
challenges of sustainable  
business.  
It’s important to find the  
right scale. Space around the  
world is expensive; we incu-  
bated our idea at home in a  
space we funded, and now  
we are situated to replicate  
our success by learning from  
our past failures.  
A dedicated co-creation  
space and ecosystem is best  
suited for organizations that  
are able to provide a per-  
petual stream of challenges  
that can be rallied behind in  
order to co-create solutions  
that provide value to all.

“One of the infuriating  
things about service  
design that I have expe-  
rienced, is that people  
need to do it to under-  
stand it. So, the more  
you can get people to

How to introduce service design in  
an organization  
Just acquiring service design capabilities is not enough  
to sustainably introduce service design in an organization.  
That process usually includes a cultural and organi-  
zational transformation that cannot be implemented  
within a few months.01 It requires the alignment of the  
whole organizational system, including organizational  
structures, processes, practices, routines, and values.  
It is a change process in itself, and needs to be carefully  
designed and managed.  
It’s much easier to introduce service design if the or-  
ganizational transformation builds on a ­ supportive cor-  
porate culture. Signs of this are, for example, ­ customer  
centricity, cross-silo thinking and doing, or an iterative  
way of working, such as early prototyping. While there’s a  
lot of knowledge on how to change organizational struc-  
tures, processes, and sometimes even culture, there’s no  
silver bullet that works for all organizations.  
Both a top-down approach and a bottom-up  
­ approach to introducing service design have potential  
pitfalls. While a pure bottom-up approach often lacks  
management buy-in and so also budget and approval,  
top-down approaches often lack support from employ-  
ees as they feel that they are being forced to deal with  
“just another buzzword.” The successful introduction of

Small projects, sometimes also called  
“island projects” or “stealth projects,” that fly  
under the radar of an organization are a  
good way to get started with service design.  
EXPERT TIP  
“Start with an annoying  
in-house challenge! To  
get the ball rolling and  
\[get\] service design into  
your organization, take  
your own staff as first  
users and collaborate on  
an issue that has been  
bugging everyone for  
a while. At Mobisol, we  
used the development  
of an internal commu-

a shared language and  
our own way of applying  
service design.”

service design requires commitment on various levels\:  
from the top and the bottom, but particularly also from  
someone in the middle who initiates the first project  
and connects top and bottom needs, expectations,  
and perspectives.  
The involvement of influential middle managers can  
make the introduction of service design easier and more  
successful. They might be “influential” in terms of formal  
decision-making powers or because of informal ­ social  
ties within an organization.01 However, service design  
can only become a continuous success if top management  
approve the introduction and support it with enough  
resources like budget, time, and people, as well as some  
personal involvement. Some practitioners refer to this  
as the middle-top-bottom approach.  
12.1.1  
Start with small projects  
Small projects are the ideal starting point as they can  
be detached from existing structures and processes, in  
particular from requirements to integrate with complex  
01 It might make sense to map the hierarchical structure of an organization to locate influential middle managers  
that act as hubs between the crucial departments you’ll need to involve. Sometimes, using a simple tool such  
as a stakeholder map \(see Chapter 3, Basic service design tools\) and talking to some of your colleagues might be  
enough to find the right team.  
IT systems or business initiatives. Many things might  
cause your first project to drift away from the initial  
plan, and you need to limit both your expectations and  
those of your team – and in some organizations also the  
­ expectations of your superiors. Plan a mix of well-­ defined  
projects – ones where you are quite sure of success,  
and others where there is a chance they will go wrong.  
It might help if you clarify up front what kind of ­ results  
can – or cannot – be expected from a specific service design  
project, to make sure that everybody is aligned on the  
expected results. This will later help pinpoint unexpected  
positive or negative results. Luckily, service design projects  
usually provide a few unexpected quick wins that might  
help you to promote the approach within your organization  
and help you to get management buy-in.  
This could also be a chance to bring “skeletons” out  
of the closet – projects that might be important from  
a business perspective but where nobody knows how  
to tackle the problem, or where someone has tried and  
failed before.  
Try to choose first projects that include open and  
­ collaborative stakeholders to avoid wasting time and  
­ energy with unmotivated team members. Use these  
smaller projects to adapt the service design process and  
language to your organizational structures, processes,  
and culture. Focusing on just one project risks putting  
too much pressure on a team, and if this one project  
goes wrong, you might have “burned” the term service  
design \(or whatever you call what you’re doing\) in the  
­ organization forever. EXPERT TIP

Indeed, it often helps if at first you give the service  
design approach a name which does not stand out in  
your organization.02 A rather traditional project title helps  
you avoid too much early attention and gives you time to  
work out how to adapt service design to your organiza-  
tion, to fail in a safe space, to analyze what could be done  
better next time, and to understand where exactly in the  
process something went wrong. Perhaps you can even  
reuse the work done before the failure, and just try again  
from there – with the crucial lessons learned.03  
12.1.2  
Secure management buy-in  
If needed, find someone from management to ­ sponsor  
your initial projects. It is often said that “budget is how  
organizations express their love,” but management ­ buy-in  
is not only about financial backing, but also about political  
support within your organization. Often just a brief intro-  
duction from higher management will give a design team  
the credibility that you might need for your first projects.  
It helps a lot if your sponsors have decent service  
design knowledge. Offer opportunities to experience  
service design through a hands-on approach, perhaps by  
involving higher management during research, ­ running  
a pressure-cooker format like a mini-workshop or a short  
02 03 See, for example, 12.5.1, Case\: Including service design in nationwide high school curricula. The school subject is  
called “Business and Service Management.” Although the content of the new subject very much focuses on service  
design, you’ll only find the term “service design” in the fine print.  
See Chapter 4, The core activities of service design, Chapter 8, Implementation, and Chapter 9, Service design process  
and management, for more information on the iterative character of a design process. Sometimes, when you intro-  
duce service design in an organization it helps to plan ahead for a minimum number of iterations within a project.  
This might help you to manage expectations up front and might give you more leeway for your first projects.

jam04 with them, offering internal and external work-  
shops and talks, or inviting visits from other companies  
who have introduced a more “design centric” approach  
within their business. Although top management don’t  
need to be ­ service design experts, they should be aware of  
the general ­ process and potential benefits and pitfalls.  
Try to speak a common language, understand their  
current goals and challenges, and remember that their time  
is often limited. Sometimes, “translating” ­ project-specific  
details into the overall business strategy of a company  
helps to find a common ground; for example, by showing  
how a service design project relates to business and growth  
opportunities.  
Up front, define a clear aim for the project with all  
team members and management. For small and well-defined  
projects, it is often even possible to agree on  
specific key performance indicators for a ­ project.05 Try to  
measure these before and after the project to understand  
and prove its impact. Document your project throughout  
the entire process using photos, videos, quotes from  
participants, and artifacts like personas or journey maps,  
as well as measuring potential impacts of your project.  
Remember to keep doing this as you approach the end  
of a project, when other things become very important.  
This is not only crucial to showcase your project and way  
of working to others, but also to celebrate the successes  
with your team.  
04 05 See the textbox Innovation jams in 12.2 for a detailed description of a jam.  
These KPIs could focus on a specific product, process, or department and measure; for example,  
customer or employee satisfaction, sales or revenues, the duration of a specific process, conversion rates,  
up- and cross-selling, support tickets, and so on. This is Service Design Doing  
12.1.3  
Raise awareness  
EXPERT TIP  
“A quick way to gain  
­ management support  
early on is to know in  
advance some of man-  
agement’s agenda. What  
do they really care about  
and what are their goals?  
Choosing projects that  
address those cares,  
goals, and concerns  
align the outcomes of a  
service design project  
to management reality  
and increases man-  
agement buy-in.”

Fernando Yepez  
When you have found “your” way of doing service  
­ design01 through a series of small “stealth” projects and  
have developed management buy-in, you can start raising  
awareness within your organization. Good ­ documentation  
of previous projects can help you do this organically.  
Project documentation should include the state of an  
experience before and after the project \(if possible with a  
measurable impact\) as well as the design process and how  
the team worked together.02 Video summaries or short  
­ reports with plenty of photos usually work quite well,  
shared through a newsletter, an internal website, or a blog.  
Another approach is to casually showcase ­ high-fidelity  
journey or system maps that address a specific experience  
before and after a project – perhaps by hanging them in  
your office and even in hallways or coffee areas.03 It helps  
if these maps are self-explanatory. Also, you can provide  
some general information on the project and particularly  
on the process the team went through.  
Project participants from various departments and  
backgrounds can team up to educate others through  
demonstrations. The goal is not to up-skill ­ non-designers  
to designers, but to create champions of the process  
throughout an organization. Explaining a project and the  
design process to others often brings better understand-  
ing for those who have to present, and stories from your  
“Your” way of service design refers to the successful adaption of service design process, methods, tools, and  
language to your organizational structure, processes, and culture.

02 03 own organization are better for promoting service design  
than cases from other companies. Make clear that service  
design works in your organization, in your structures,  
in your culture.  
You can also use classic internal communication  
channels to celebrate achievements and showcase success-  
es, such as posting an article in an employee newspaper,  
or asking someone from senior management to recap a  
project during a corporate event. It might make sense to  
explain the philosophy behind a project and what you  
hope to achieve with this. Also offer further reading, a  
listing of events, or contact details of someone within the  
organization so employees can learn more.  
Both internal participants and management sponsors  
are often great advocates for service design in an orga-  
nization and could act as a catalyst for further projects.  
You might raise enough interest that employees ask you  
for more information, and you can identify motivated  
people for your next projects.04

12.1.4  
Build up competence  
As a next step, strive to build up and spread competence.  
Identify motivated colleagues from different departments  
and organize internal talks, workshops, masterclasses,  
jams, conference visits, and the like. These colleagues are  
often the best ambassadors within an organization and  
can help to diffuse service design knowledge organi-  
cally by word of mouth. You can help them by offering  
them information they can share, such as an internal  
service design website or brochures showcasing projects,  
­ process, methods, and tools. Often they will convince  
new people who might show up to your events.  
Sometimes, you will need to define a common  
language and standards for your organization. Often  
people think they are speaking the same language,  
but in fact have in fact understood service design  
­ differently. Inconsistent terminology makes collabora-  
tion ­ inefficient and conflictual.05 The aim should be to  
build up ­ competence across different departments and to  
establish a network of like-minded people. Establishing  
a community of practice like this generates a safe space  
in which you can openly share lessons learned, success  
stories, and failures.  
Give this community an easy way of sharing, such  
as a shared chat room or community page, but also  
­ establish regular face-to-face meetings to learn with and  
from one another. Invite your project sponsors and man-  
agement and include them in your community.  
05 See 12.5.4, Case\: Integrating service design in a multinational organization, for an example of how to establish a  
common service design language across an entire company.  
458/459  
The more management understand the process, tools,  
and methods, the more they’ll realize that design needs a  
specific type of leadership. Micromanagement and unedu-  
cated decisions by superiors can demotivate a design team  
and ultimately kill innovation.  
12.1.5  
Give room to try  
Three of the most quoted barriers to organizational change  
are employee resistance to change, management behavior  
that does not support change, and insufficient human and  
financial resources. Service design projects are rarely suc-  
cessful if ­ employees have to run them on top of their daily  
work. This is no different to any other project.  
“You get what you pay for” is a saying in many  
agencies, and the same is true for projects that are run  
­ internally. Empower employees with time, support, ­ budget,  
and sufficient responsibility and decision-making power so  
they can really do a service design project. Ideally, a service  
design project is a separate activity outside of any other  
daily activity. Think, for example, of temporarily occupying  
a space outside the regular workspace, such as a dedicated  
creative space or design thinking center.06 This ensures that  
your service design initiative will not get lost in day-to-  
day business and helps to bridge the spatial separation  
of departments.

# Spotting the savvy\:  
# Finding great service design staff  
BY ERIK WIDMARK AND SUSANNA NISSAR, EXPEDITION MONDIAL  
When we were in charge of scouting and  
recruiting talent for a rapidly growing  
­ service design company in Sweden, we  
struggled for seven years to find great  
talent. The service design scene was ex-  
ploding and we needed to expand in order  
to meet market demands. The challenge  
was that there were no schooled service  
designers to choose from and many of  
Sweden’s most experienced service design-  
ers were already in our company. These  
circumstances made us develop a strategy  
for looking beyond CVs in order to predict  
future potential. Service design talents are  
often full of contradiction, but there are  
some reoccurring clues to look for\:  
→  
Look for someone to hug.  
Service ­ design is about interacting and  
understanding humans, and you need a  
people person to do this – someone who  
genuinely radiates empathy and interest  
in others. Huggable is highly employable.  
→  
Look for a humble expert.  
The job of a service designer is 90% about  
­ listening, understanding, and adapting to  
the end users’ and clients’ needs. There is  
little room for big egos looking to push  
through their own ideas. Search for expert  
listeners, facilitators, and team players.  
→  
Look for a philosophical craftsman.  
Service design is a craft. It’s about do-  
ing, but also about contemplating and  
learning. So, you want a balanced mix of  
­ tinkering and thinking; someone who is  
learning by doing and doing to learn.  
→  
Look for a zoom lens.  
An important skill for a service designer  
is the ability to change perspectives –  
from macro to micro, from technical  
platform to human needs, from system  
to touchpoint, from strategy to solution.  
Preferably, you want someone who can  
handle these various perspectives all  
at the same time.  
→  
Look for meticulous simplicity.  
Life and humans are complex, often too  
complex to make complete sense of. A  
service designer has to have the ability  
to see the relevant patterns and ­ simplify  
overwhelming information in order to  
deliver manageable results to enthuse the  
audience. If the design is too complex,  
you haven’t done your homework. 12 Embedding service design in organizations  
→  
Look for spelling mistakes.  
Is the applicant’s spelling really crappy?  
Great! A cover letter or CV full of mis-  
spellings is something that raises our inter-  
est. Dyslexics typically have had to find  
alternative ways of gathering knowledge  
and have developed their own strategies to  
learn, work, and achieve – skills that are  
great in a service design project. And hey,  
there’s always spell check.  
→  
Look for bipolar education.  
Has the person studied seemingly contra-  
dictory subjects? A combo of “rational,”  
process-driven fields mixed with “cre-  
ative,” emotionally driven education shows  
an ability to be \(and interest in being\)  
both intuitive and logical and to switch  
between them – a great trait. Biochemistry  
\(PhD\)/Interactive Art Direction is one  
combo that developed a brilliant ser-  
vice designer. Business Admin/Product  
Design is another.  
→  
Look for international lovers.  
It can’t be a coincidence that many of  
the top ­ service designers we’ve recruited  
have had partners from different cultures.  
Maybe it’s a sign of curiosity about other  
­ people and perspectives. Extensive travel-  
ling is also a good sign.  
→  
Look for humans.  
When browsing through an applicant’s  
portfolio, can you see people? Too much  
focus on the details of the solution and  
little effort made to explain the benefit  
to users can be an indication of a person  
lacking the right perspective. We have to  
remember, a service designer’s solutions  
are often mere puzzle pieces to facili-  
tate users’ lives.  
460/461  
And remember, if you happen to meet  
someone that ticks all of these boxes, hire  
them straight away! Great service design  
talent is a valuable resource and extremely  
hard to come by. ◀ This is Service Design Doing  
# 12.2 SCALING UP  
How to set up a service design team in  
an organization  
Not everyone needs to be a service design expert,  
­ although a basic level of design knowledge for everyone –  
or at least an understanding of what design is for – has  
proved valuable in some great companies. Depending on  
the size of the organization, there’s often a core service  
design team that keeps an overview of the end-to-end  
experience and coordinates all service design projects.01  
Each individual project, however, has its own extended  
project team built around the competencies needed for  
the specific project.  
Service design projects are a great opportunity to give  
members of different departments a common focus and  
objective outside their normal work routines.  
12.2.1  
The core service design team  
The members of the core team are usually experts on ser-  
vice design management, processes, tools, and ­ methods,  
as well as facilitation. The role of the core team is to  
manage or support projects and perhaps facilitate them  
through workshops and activities. They do not ­ necessarily  
01 In this context, the end-to-end experience refers to the entire experience customers or users have with an orga-  
nization, or the entire experience employees have within corporate structures and processes, or the ­ experience  
the extended service design team has across multiple projects.  
need to be experts on specific products, processes, or de-  
partments.02 Sometimes, it even helps if they are unfamil-  
iar with organizational structures and processes or do not  
know how customers use certain offerings. They are often  
hired from outside the company to bring in know-how  
or are employees that are trained in service design and  
facilitation. In a small, private grocery ­ market or a printing  
house business, this core team might have just one expert.  
In a government department or a multinational telco cor-  
poration, it might have hundreds. Members of this core  
team can be internal employees or external consultants;  
perhaps a service design agency that commits to a long-  
term relationship. External ­ members are often better able  
to openly point out the inconvenient truths. Often, a mix  
of internal and external members is most promising.  
12.2.2  
The extended project teams  
While the core team is rather small and focused on the  
service design process, most projects are also ­ supported by  
extended project teams\: larger groups of people with spe-  
cific competencies related to the subject matter. These ex-  
tended project teams should be as cross-­ functional and  
multidisciplinary as possible. The size of an extended  
The term “products” describes anything a company offers – no matter if this is tangible or not. In academia, prod-  
ucts are often divided into goods and services. However, products are usually bundles of services and physical/  
digital products. As “goods” is colloquially understood as referring to something tangible, we prefer to speak of  
the term physical/digital products. Read more on this in the textbox Service-dominant logic in 2.5.  
02  EXPERT TIP  
“Organizations are  
­ complex systems.  
As such, it is hard for a  
system to change itself.  
An outside view seems  
to be a catalyst for  
aiding change to happen.  
Therefore, part of building  
a community of ­ practice  
should include the knowl-  
edge and experiences  
of other outside subject  
matter experts and  
practitioners.”

12 Embedding service design in organizations  
project team can vary over time; it often even changes  
from workshop to workshop.  
One aim of service design projects within larger  
organizations is to facilitate the organizational transfor-  
mation toward a more customer-centric culture. Service  
design can help break down entrenched silos by connect-  
ing ­ people from various departments.  
Members of the extended project teams are often  
people that normally work apart from one another and  
sometimes even compete over budgets or KPIs. Working  
together in a project might help them to establish per-  
sonal connections and ultimately get on the same page.03  
“Where does the project brief come from?” and  
“Who needs to implement this?” are two questions you  
should always ask yourself when you start a project in an  
organization. You might, for example, learn about similar  
earlier projects and find people who were ­ previously  
involved. They might be able to assist you in selecting  
your team members and managing stakeholders. As the  
size and composition of the extended project team can  
vary over time and depending on the project needs,  
the core service design team need to determine who to  
include and when.04  
Extended teams should include people that are di-  
rectly affected by the problem the organization is willing  
to solve – affected staff as well as users and/or customers.  
In the long run, across several projects, the people who  
were part of an extended team form a loose community  
See 12.5.5, Case\: Creating a customer-centric culture through service design, for an example of broad involvement  
of various stakeholders in a service design project from the beginning.  
See also 9.2.3, Project team and stakeholders, for more information on who to include  
when in a service design project.  
03 04 462/463  
of practice. With every project they pick up more and  
more, until some of them might eventually switch into  
your core service design team.  
12.2.3  
Choose a name that fits your culture  
Often, it doesn’t make sense to reinvent the wheel and  
raise expectations or even suspicions by using fancy  
names such as “Service Design Task Force” or “Design  
Thinking Squad.” The core service design team should  
be named in a way which fits the corporate culture and  
strategy. Build on whatever exists already and only use a  
new name if you do this consciously.  
A new department for service design might be useful  
if you want to push the approach internally and if this  
reflects your corporate strategy. However, this requires  
a corporate strategy that includes a commitment on  
service design; long-term management buy-in; internal  
service design competence; a shared language of service  
design; and a working process that is adapted to corporate  
structures, processes, and culture. If not, you might raise  
expectations that you probably cannot deliver with your  
first round of projects.  
Name individual project teams according to the  
subject of their project, such as “call center improvement  
team” or “work group for online shopping experience.”  
These unsuspicious names do not reflect the underly-  
ing method and help to reduce prejudices and barriers.  
Mentioning the subject matter also helps to generate a  
common understanding and identity. Members of the This is Service Design Doing  
service design core team will usually not name ser-  
vice design as the underlying approach. The technical  
­ language of service design should remain within the core  
team, while extended service design project teams use  
the shared language of the subject matter.  
If you don’t have a local service design community,  
you could be the one to start it. Look for like-minded  
people through social media and invite them for a first  
casual meeting. You’ll find interested people in similar  
communities, like UX design, or at startup events. On a  
global scale, you’ll find an active service design commu-  
nity in all common social media channels; just search for  
the hashtag or keyword \#servicedesign. Use any opportu-  
nity you find to share your stories and learn from others.  
The wider service design community is delightfully open  
and happy to share success stories as well as lessons  
learned from projects that went wrong.02  
12.2.4  
Connect with the wider  
service design community  
Working in cross-functional design teams is extreme-  
ly rewarding but also demanding. The service design  
teams need to facilitate a process of organizational change,  
­ motivate stakeholders to look at things from different  
­ angles and distances, engage and inspire internal and  
­ external stakeholders, and often also break with or at least  
challenge an existing corporate culture. They will need to  
find ways to engage and inspire themselves at the same  
time. This can be triggered and nourished by ­ connecting  
with the wider local and international service design  
community. Organizing and participating in commu-  
nity events, such as service design drinks, service design  
thinks, ­ conferences, workshops, or jams,01 connects  
the core team formally and informally with experts  
outside of the organization who can become crucial in  
future projects.  
Sponsoring service design and innovation events  
like these increases employer branding and might attract  
further service design talents to your organization.

be useful to connect your organization with the local community and beyond.

Many of the working practices of service  
design – qualitative over quantitative,  
quantity not quality of ideas, building  
prototypes not comparing opinions – are  
contrary to the usual way people work in  
organizations. It’s not enough for most  
people to hear about them, they need to  
use them themselves, see the results and  
feel them working.  
So, many organizations that are in-  
troducing this approach look for formats  
which get as many people as possible to  
“touch” the design activities and tools.  
One of the most successful of these for-  
mats is jamming.  
Jamming is a concept which comes  
from music, where musicians meet up  
without an agenda and play. They listen  
attentively to one another, picking up  
themes and adding to them, co-creating  
new music that none of them could have  
made alone. They don’t discuss goals,  
they just play. They don’t try to predict  
the success of a particular riff, they throw  
it into the mix and see how the audience  
responds. Often, they surprise themselves  
with the results.  
A jam in an organization adapts this  
process to working on the organization’s  
offerings, processes, or culture. There are  
no musical instruments, but a wide range  
of skills, attitudes, and experience. The  
group \(usually 25 people or more, even  
hundreds\) are given a theme and facili-  
tated through a rapid innovation process  
over perhaps just two days. Research in-  
cludes stopping passersby, or phoning col-  
leagues. They try fast creative techniques  
to generate dozens of ideas. Then, like  
the musicians, they don’t discuss ideas,  
but start building lo-fi prototypes. As the  
prototypes fail in testing, they iterate and  
464/465  
move forward, building more prototypes  
to show to decision makers.  
Some of these prototypes may be use-  
ful, and some may contain some valuable  
DNA and form the spark of a real service  
design project, but almost none will be  
implemented as they are. Although they  
are the most visible output, prototypes are  
not the main goal of jamming. Instead,  
jams are best used as a culture injection.  
They connect innovative people in an  
informal but productive context. They  
empower participants by giving them a  
crash course in useful methods.  
Jams are also great fun, and that  
seems to be part of the success, as serious  
playfulness helps us let go of ideas and  
preconceptions – a crucial skill in design.  
Jams have gained prominence in  
service design since the 2011 launch of  
the Global Service Jam, a volunteer event This is Service Design Doing  
which takes place every year with  
physical locations in over 100 cities  
worldwide. Its success led to the Global  
GovJam, a similar event for public  
services, and others.01  
The success of those events and  
similar initiatives has been largely re-  
sponsible for the adoption of jamming  
as an innovation culture tool by a wide  
variety of organizations, from compa-  
nies to governments. In 2015, BASF  
ran a series of jams around the world  
as part of a broad co-creative inno-  
vation program. The events involved  
customers, partners, employees, board  
members, and other stakeholders such  
as politicians and environmentalists.  
01 See http\://www.globalservicejam.org. In 2013, the event was awarded  
a Core77 Service Design Award \(http\://designawards.core77.com\) for  
“significantly contributing to the spread of service design culture ... The  
challenging format, highly engaging and motivating, has contributed to add  
services to the global design agenda.”  
It instigated cross-departmental and  
interdisciplinary conversations way be-  
yond the jam itself and helped to ignite  
collaboration, looking outside the box  
and finding a solution together.  
02  
Alongside similar hand-on formats  
like hackathons and design sprints,  
jams are widely used as effective  
transformational tools to help embed  
service design methods and mindsets  
into an organization or community.03 ◀

How to lead organizations that  
integrate service design  
Organizations of all sizes and sectors are affected by  
an ongoing digital transformation, with the increasing  
threat that their existing business models might be  
challenged or disrupted. This is one of many reasons  
why organizations are focusing more on customer  
centricity, innovation, and design in general. However,  
organizational structures, processes, and leadership  
approaches often still reflect a product-centric approach  
with many different silos, hierarchical structures, and  
processes. Their innovation process is often driven  
more by technology, by products, by engineering and  
learned behaviors, and less by human-centered design,  
by ethnographic research, and by co-creation with cus-  
tomers and employees. Many recent articles in business  
journals reflect the increasing awareness of service  
design,03 but leadership04 often struggles with such an  
open and fast approach, where you need more trust  
and less control.  
Service design is not only a process and a toolset,  
but can be a management approach to innovation and  
01 02 Besides the term “service design,” there are other names that describe iterative approaches,  
such as design thinking, UX design, CX design, experience design, business design, and Lean Startup.  
See Chapter 1, Why service design?, for some examples and figures on the increasing awareness  
of service design and other iterative approaches.  
Leadership here refers to top/senior management of an organization. 466/467  
business in general. It is an approach that is human-cen-  
tered, that is based on value co-creation for multiple  
actors, that negotiates meanings and perspectives, that  
contributes to social innovation, and that proposes evi-  
dence-based solutions.  
An organization that has integrated service design  
requires a certain kind of leadership. The following list  
presents some key suggestions for the leadership of  
such organizations.  
Understand the design process  
As a leader in a service design context, you should un-  
derstand and value qualitative research and prototyping.  
You should appreciate the concept of a “sh!tty first draft,”05  
the importance of early stakeholder involvement, and the  
powerful process of early user ­ feedback and iterative im-  
provement. If you don’t agree with this, you’ll have a hard  
time working with a team doing service design.  
→ Tip\: Learn by doing  
Participate in service design workshops to learn  
some basic tools and methods and to experience  
the process yourself. You can’t learn to play football  
out of a book. Service design is just the same.  
03 See sh!tty first drafts in 10.3.4. This is Service Design Doing  
EXPERT TIP  
“Remember, no one  
within a client company  
ever has much empathy  
for outside service con-  
sultants. We are often  
viewed as expensive  
parasites. That means  
be prepared to give  
others credit for your  
work. If you can further  
their careers, the better  
the chances are that  
you will be hired again  
– and ultimately, you  
will achieve buy-in for  
more ­ service design  
initiatives that really  
make a difference.”  
—  
Eric Reiss  
Lead through co-creation  
Service design uses educated decisions based on ­ research  
and prototyping. In the end, it is customers who decide  
if they want to use your product or not. The ­ earlier you  
include them in your decision-making process, the more  
promising the outcome of your project is. To ­ educate  
your decisions you need to understand customers and  
frontline employees.  
→ Tip\: Lead by example. Be part of research and  
prototyping and experience this firsthand. Go out  
to see yourself how customers react to a prototype  
instead of listening to presentations by your team.  
EXPERT TIP  
“To create buy-in and  
make sure the approach  
is sustainable, develop  
new service assess-  
ment processes which  
require senior stake-  
holders to use the  
service. This makes sure  
managers are taking  
decisions from the cus-  
tomer perspective.”  
— Sarah Drummond  
Eat your own dog food  
You should personally use the products offered by your  
­ organization. This is often one of the first steps in service  
design to help management understand a certain issue  
beyond mere reports and statistics.01  
→ Tip\: Regularly become a customer of your own  
organization. Use products your company offers –  
just as any other customers do. Do this at least once a  
month, quarter, or year. Some organizations incor-  
porate this approach into their culture, and manage-  
ment meet ­ afterward to share their experiences and  
discuss potential consequences. Some companies do  
the same with frontline work experience.  
04 For example, see the description of self-ethnographic approaches in 5.2, Methods of data collection.  
Practice empathy  
It’s important for service design leadership to ­ understand  
the needs of people \(employees, customers, ­ stakeholders\)  
and recognize critical situations \(customer problems, team  
conflicts\). If you understand your team, you will be able to  
give them the support they need. You’ll establish mutual  
trust and empower your design team to achieve more.  
→ Tip\: Dedicate time to train empathy. Almost  
everyone has the ability to empathize with other  
people, but often we don’t make use of it. Try to  
dedicate some time for this regularly\: become aware  
of people you do not normally deal with in your  
organization, perhaps starting with the extended  
service design team. Be curious about their work  
routines, their lives, and their thoughts in general.  
Just ask them, show serious interest, and focus on  
listening – you want to learn something from them,  
not the other way around.  
Look beyond quantitative  
statistics and metrics  
You may have heard – or even repeated – the saying,  
“If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.” This is  
an outdated myth from an era when management was  
restricted to quantitative tools. Customer experience is  
more than metrics. Numbers can help you identify that  
you have a problem and maybe where the problem is,  
but can’t tell you why people like or hate something, or  
what their aspirations are. EXPERT TIP  
“If an insecure manager  
interprets suggestions as  
personal criticism, junior  
employees may fear that  
suggesting change could  
actually get them fired.  
If you truly want sugges-  
tions, you have to create  
a safe environment. You  
also have to provide  
timely feedback. All too  
often I hear, ‘We’ve told  
management about this  
problem for years, but  
they never listen.’”  
—  
Eric Reiss  
12 Embedding service design in organizations  
→ Tip\: Focus on human experiences. Look beyond  
mere numbers and use qualitative and mixed-meth-  
od approaches to understand experiences more  
holistically, including the human and the business  
aspects. Use statistics and metrics to find problems  
or track developments over time, but use qualitative  
­ research to understand why people like or dislike  
something, to understand what they are trying to  
be, and to inspire your team.  
Reduce fear of change  
and failure  
Employees at all hierarchical levels often fear change  
because it happens too frequently, is initiated “top-down,”  
and often has a negative impact on their own experience.  
Co-creation can lower this fear if you involve your em-  
ployees in this process, embrace a culture of failure,02 and  
are open to feedback and change yourself.  
→  
Tip\: Ask for prototypes instead of presentations.  
Show that you use a design approach yourself. Support  
prototyping – for example, by relying less on shiny pre-  
sentations and more on using sh!tty first drafts ­ yourself.  
Encourage your employees to prototype their ideas to-  
gether with customers and fellow employees. Allow them  
to test ideas and iteratively improve concepts with a clear  
and transparent innovation process and decision criteria.  
05 This does not mean that it is acceptable for whole projects to fail again and again. It means understanding that  
“failed” steps in a project \(i.e., experiments with negative results\) are necessary to learn, to improve, to iterate,  
and to innovate, and are always part of a successful innovation project or organizational change. Often it is mid-  
dle management who are risk-averse and fear change, as they tend to be measured by their output. Leadership  
should embrace and accept failure on the road to success to lower this fear of change for middle management.  
468/469  
Use customer-centric KPIs  
Instead of only using KPIs that reflect the performance  
of single departments \(silos\) of an organization, add  
cross-silo KPIs that are based on customer ­ experience.  
This can help departments to think beyond their  
­ boundaries. In order to impact these KPIs, departments  
need to work together and co-create with customers and  
employees. Reward those departments that take an active  
lead in impacting such customer-centric KPIs.  
→ Tip\: Connect silos through KPIs. Try out cross-silo  
KPIs that are based on customer events – for exam-  
ple, ones that can be described within the job-to-be-  
done \(JTBD\) framework. These KPIs might focus on  
customer satisfaction analysis regarding a specific  
JTBD, combining that with complaints, churn, and  
so on. Offer co-creative service design projects to  
the relevant departments so they can work together  
to impact these KPIs.  
Disrupt your own business  
Some organizations ask their employees to ­ constantly  
challenge their own company, their own ­ products.  
Waiting for other companies to find completely new ways  
of ­ solving a customer’s problem with a new, disruptive  
solution might ultimately put your company at risk.  
→ Tip\: Empower employees to find problems  
and suggest projects. Invite employees across  
your entire organization to look for new business This is Service Design Doing  
opportunities that might put your ­ organization at  
risk. Establish a system for your employees to sub-  
mit insights or ideas, to select the most promising,  
and to explore them outside of their daily routines  
together with your core design team.  
EXPERT TIP  
“A good measure of  
how the organization  
is absorbing service  
design is to listen for  
terminology changes  
within the organization,  
and the way terms are  
used. Touchpoints and  
customer journey quickly  
get absorbed, but you  
really feel you have  
cracked it when people  
in a project team start  
discussing what kind of  
experience an employee  
or customer will have at  
stages of a journey.”  
—  
Simon Clatworthy  
Make design tangible  
Instead of talking about what design is and how this  
can help an organization, follow a “doing, not talking”  
­ approach and constantly make design visible and ­ tangible  
everywhere. Make your innovation and design pro-  
cess more transparent by exhibiting research data and  
insights, personas and journey maps, prototypes and  
workshop documentation.  
Prototyping, for ­ example, is a great activity to  
understand the feasibility and sustainability of a new  
idea, as well as a good way to test and understand the  
organization’s willingness to change. Making design  
tangible lowers the barrier for others to participate in co-creative  
processes.  
→ Tip\: Showcase the impact of design in your  
organization. Exhibit journey maps showing the  
impact of service ­ design projects in your own com-  
pany. For example, show a journey map of before  
and after a project, and highlight the differences.  
Give some information on the process, tools, and  
methods, and add a contact from whom interested  
employees can learn more. This helps you to identi-  
fy motivated people.  
 Bring service design into the  
organizational DNA  
If you aim to bring service design sustainably into your  
organizational DNA, you might decide to stop talking  
about service design. Instead, you and your team will  
work naturally with service design tools and methods,  
­ follow the basic principles, and work in an iterative,  
­ collaborative, and human-centered way without think-  
ing about this as “service design.” Thus, it stops being  
a ­ special approach carried out by a dedicated group of  
people, and becomes everyday for everyone.  
In the long run, when service design is part of your  
organizational DNA, you don’t need a dedicated ser-  
vice design team.  
→ Tip\: Do service design without talking about it.  
Show your own passion for this way of working  
without mentioning service design, but simply  
by using the tools, methods, and principles in  
various situations – for example, by using proto-  
types instead of presentations, or by co-creating  
meeting documentation, perhaps even in a vi-  
sual way through graphic recording, instead of  
sending around written meeting minutes that no  
one reads anyway.  
Think about which decision rights your em-  
ployees have; if your organizational structure allows  
them to work collaboratively, self-responsibly,  
and in an interdisciplinary way; if they know how  
their performance is assessed; and which objec-  
tives or incentives motivate them to follow this  
way of working. 12 Embedding service design in organizations  
# Is design thinking a methodology?  
# No, it’s a holistic change!  
BY MAIK MEDZICH AND ANKE HELMBRECHT  
When we started to put a stronger focus  
on customer experience at Deutsche  
Telekom, we followed an approach which  
we did not fully understand until a year  
later – “start small, but start.”  
In the beginning, there was no man-  
agement assignment, no budget alloca-  
tion, little knowledge about methodology,  
and just two people spending their time  
on an idea which looked impossible for a  
­ company of our size\: to set up a commu-  
nity of volunteers who would spend 30%  
of their work time on projects outside  
of their job descriptions. These volun-  
teers would become known as Customer  
Experience \(CX\) Navigators. Our idea  
was to bring CX to the people to whom it  
belongs, with the purpose to enable them  
to do a more customer-centric job.  
Looking back, we would not have  
done anything differently. In the begin-  
ning, we had little to no ­ visibility – hence,  
trying and failing was not a problem.  
It felt like everything we did was better  
than doing nothing. Eventually, the word  
spread and we started to grow. We were  
still a group of volunteers until Marc and  
Jakob introduced us to design thinking;  
that was when things began to change  
rapidly. While we were still experiment-  
ing with “the right way” to do things, we  
realized that a lot needed to change, and it  
reached beyond providing methodology  
expertise to our colleagues.  
470/471  
Applying an agile methodology like  
design thinking requires a complete  
change in how we\:  
→ Lead projects\: Replace unpro-  
ductive one-hour meetings with  
focused workshop sessions with a  
tangible result.  
→ Provide trust\: Hierarchy should be  
left outside, every voice is valuable.  
→ Think about staffing\: Experts are  
not the only ones for the job; rather,  
you need a diverse team of passion-  
ate people, coached by a facilitator.  
→ Think about humans\: People get  
motivated by taking on responsibili-  
ty and meaningful work. This is Service Design Doing  
We had intuitively applied these ­ principles  
to our community, which on the one hand  
made it more attractive for colleagues  
to join and on the other hand provided  
a prototype of an organizational set-  
up – hence, we became the symbol of the  
new working culture we were trying to  
establish. Management also realized our  
success, and we received support from our  
board – which was necessary in certain  
ways, especially to get backing for the 30%  
work-time issue. However, the manage-  
ment support we receive is by means of  
mentoring, not top-down decision mak-  
ing – we are still self-governed.  
And, more importantly, we can  
see changes begin to manifest in  
the organization\:  
→ More business units/managers  
take on responsibility for CX;  
CX becomes an important part of  
the product development process.  
→ Product ideas get rejected when  
the CX is not as desired.  
→ Scaling in CX Navigators \(from  
4 to 30, to committed 100\) and  
support requests \(from around 5 to  
around 80 per year\).  
Design thinking as a mere set of tools and  
methods is not that important for us. We  
realized that we need to transform the  
entire organizational culture. To achieve  
this, the most important aspec is not the  
set of methods, but how you apply these  
methods, how you lead projects, how you  
set up diverse teams, or which principles  
you follow in general. The way of working  
is what makes up a more agile and cus-  
tomer-centric organization – not follow-  
ing methods out of a textbook. ◀ 12 Embedding service design in organizations  
# 12.4 DESIGN SPRINTS  
How to set up service design as an ongoing  
activity in an organization  
One way to implement or introduce service design  
in organizations is as a sequence of design sprints.01  
Each sprint can be understood as a single service design  
­ project.02 In larger projects, a sprint refers to one iteration  
within the project – for example, focusing on a specific  
step or stage of an experience. Once a project is imple-  
mented \(or discarded\), the next sprint starts with an  
evaluation of the overall customer or employee experi-  
ence. Thus, the first step of any new sprint also includes  
an evaluation of the impact of the prior sprint.  
Working with sprints can be effective because it  
gives teams a framework to work in. A design sprint  
­ provides a rough process structure with a specific dead-  
line. The team need to deliver something at the end of  
each design sprint and receive feedback. However, with-  
in a sprint, the design team can adapt the process and  
iterate as needed. This also helps to manage the iterative  
service design process as you can work in a predictable  
structure. Often, a core service design team manages the  
sprints and builds the extended project team based on  
01 02 A design sprint describes a period of time in which a team works through at least one iteration of a design  
process. Sprints often have a duration of something like one to four weeks. The term “sprint” derives from agile  
software development, but the concept of timeboxed design processes has a long tradition in product/industrial  
design. Recently the design sprint approach has gained more attention; see, for example, Banfield, R., Lombardo,  
C. T., & Wax, T. \(2015\). Design Sprint\: A Practical Guidebook for Building Great Digital Products. O’Reilly.  
See also Chapter 4, The core activities of service design, and Chapter 9, Service design process and management,  
for an overview of the process of single service design projects. In particular, 9.2.4, Structure\: Project, iterations,  
and activities, provides details on planning and reflecting planned iterations that also apply to design sprints as  
ongoing activities.  
472/473  
the specific topic of each sprint. The extended project  
team may vary within a sprint.03  
Research04  
Use qualitative and quantitative research to understand  
and review the existing customer and/or employee  
experience. Often previous sprints or a general roadmap  
guides the team to focus on a specific research topic.  
Research also includes evaluating the impact of previous  
sprints on the experience and business success. A design  
team then defines the next design challenge\(s\).  
Typically, they use visualizations of their research  
data, such as system or journey maps to identify criti-  
cal steps in the customer experience, often building on  
existing visualizations and adapting them based on their  
research. Journey maps and other visualizations should  
become living documents that are challenged in every  
new design sprint.  
Research should also focus on the internal process of  
previous sprints and question team dynamics, ­ problems,  
implementation challenges, and so on to iteratively im-  
prove the sprint process.  
03 04 See 12.5.6, Case\: Building up service design knowledge across projects, for a case study on how to balance the  
ongoing need for quick iterative cycles and the parallel need to build up more long-term value across sprints and  
projects in design research.  
See Chapter 5, Research, for a detailed overview of how to do research in service design projects. This is Service Design Doing  
SERVICE DESIGN SPRINTS\:  
IN THEORY  
An archetypal structure of a service design sprint often  
looks like this.  
IMPLEMENTATION  
Ideation01  
Based on the defined design challenge\(s\), a process of  
idea generation \(diverge\) and idea selection \(converge\)  
starts. If necessary, some more focused design research  
can be done to scrutinize the critical steps you identify.  
Ideation should take into account earlier ideas that have  
been “parked” \(e.g., in an idea portfolio or on an idea  
wall\). If organizational hurdles must be overcome to  
convince decision makers before prototyping, early ideas  
can be progressed into initial example concepts.  
01 See Chapter 6, Ideation, for guidelines on how to do ideation and idea selection in service design projects.  
RESEARCH  
IDEATION  
PROTOTYPING  
Prototyping02  
Selected ideas are iteratively prototyped from low-fidelity  
concepts to high-fidelity prototypes and tested in context  
as early as possible. Prototyping can be focused on  
technical feasibility and look-and-feel, but here the main  
aim should be to test if an idea actually provides value  
to the customer, user, and/or employee. Prototyping  
and testing the value of an idea often provides a team  
with the arguments they will need to gain buy-in for  
further development and implementation. At any point  
during this stage, concepts can be discarded, iterated  
further, or “looped back” for additional research and  
ideation sessions.  
02 See Chapter 7, Prototyping, on how to prototype and test ideas and concepts in service design projects. 12 Embedding service design in organizations

 When you realize that you’re missing  
research data, you can always go back and  
do more research.  
 When you realize that an idea or concept  
doesn’t work during prototyping, you go back  
to ideation or the last working prototype.  
 When research brings up very obvious issues  
that need to be \(or could be\) fixed immedi-  
ately, fix them.

PROTOTYPING  
Implementation03  
Once an idea has been successfully tested in context,  
and approved by the design team and \(if needed\) by  
superiors, it will be implemented and rolled out. Larger  
organizations often follow a step-wise implementation  
process from first local pilots to regional test rollouts to  
global implementation.  
Sprints in organizations  
The duration of service design sprints often depends on  
many factors. As a rule of thumb, small companies, such  
as startups, often work with sprints of 1–4 weeks based  
on their agile and lean structure. In particular, software  
startups can integrate a model like this seamlessly  
within their existing agile development workflows to  
define requirements as epics or user stories. Small- and  
­ medium-sized companies often use slightly longer sprint  
durations of 4–12 weeks, and some larger companies and  
governmental organizations even work in sprints of 3–6  
months. Organizations use various names for sprints04  
depending on their individual context.  
Some organizational structures and cultures tend  
to make it easy to work in sprints, while others make it  
much harder. Practice shows that a corporate entrepre-  
neurship philosophy and intrapreneurship behaviors

processes like software development, change management, engineering, and architecture.  
Depending on the organization, there are various names for sprints, such as service design sprints, design  
thinking sprints, experience design sprints, customer experience sprints, user experience sprints, innovation  
loops, iterations, and journey projects, to name a few. This is Service Design Doing  
EXPERT TIP  
“At this stage, you need  
management buy-in. If  
you define new criteria and  
deliverables within existing  
processes this will lead  
to governance questions\:  
Who is responsible for  
developing deliverables?  
Who is checking the qual-  
ity? Who is paying for the  
additional activities? Key  
for us was that top man-  
agement started to ask\:  
Where are the deliverables  
like personas and journey  
maps? Without them,  
I cannot decide.”

Ole Schilling  
are helpful for design sprints. This type of managerial  
philosophy usually fosters employee empowerment  
and learning opportunities, and it promotes incentive  
systems, exemption phases, and serendipitous activities  
such as cross-silo networking, open innovation activities,  
and loose structures. For instance, some companies orga-  
nize separated dedicated spaces to support experimenta-  
tion with entrepreneurial ideas \(e.g., internal incubators,  
accelerator programs, internal ventures\). Employees get  
a chance to pitch their ideas \(or better, their functioning  
prototypes\) to a jury of external experts and internal  
decision makers. If accepted, they can continue the  
exploration with a small team of colleagues, supported  
by coaching and sometimes even funding to develop a  
minimum viable product \(MVP\).01 If this succeeds, some  
programs even offer venture capital to start a spin-off  
outside of the existing ­ organization. Through such initia-  
tives, ideas can leapfrog the ­ paralyzing structures of large  
organizations at the same speed as a startup.  
Many organizations integrate design sprints within  
their existing innovation process – for example, a stage-  
gate process. In cases like this, it is important to review  
the existing decision criteria with a critical eye. It’s hard  
to get better results if you change the innovation process  
but keep the same decision-making system. A system  
that stops projects before ideas can be explored further  
through an iterative design process is not helpful.

12.5.1 CASE\: INCLUDING SERVICE DESIGN IN NATIONWIDE HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULA  
# Service design in secondary schools  
AUTHOR  
Helga Mayr  
Teacher and  
Course Coordinator,  
Pedagogical  
University Tyrol  
Austria leads the way in dissemi-  
nating service design by being the  
first country worldwide that has  
implemented service design in the  
national curriculum for all second-  
ary schools with a business focus.01  
Service design as  
a school subject  
Since 2016, service design has been  
part of the Austrian national curricu-  
lum for secondary schools, integrated  
into a subject called “Business and  
Service Management.”02 There are  
approximately 90 secondary schools  
with a business focus in Austria and  
each school can individually define  
the scope of this subject, from 2 to  
12 teaching hours per week. The  
work on the new curriculum started  
in 2011 with the objective of creat-  
ing a subject addressing “business  
01 02 This includes all secondary schools in Austria of the type “Höhere  
Lehranstalt für wirtschaftliche Berufe,” abbreviated “HLW” or “HBLA,”  
which could be translated as “secondary schools with a business focus.”  
The original German title of this subject is “UDLM - Unternehmens -  
und Dienstleistungsmanagement.”  
organization and implementation in  
reality.” In 2012, a nationwide work-  
ing group was established to support  
the introduction of the new subject.  
Four years later, in 2016, the new cur-  
riculum came into effect by decree.  
Business and Service Management is  
now taught nationwide.  
By integrating service design in the  
curriculum, a space for “doing” as  
a promoter for sustainable learning  
has been created, with a strong focus  
on a multidisciplinary approach and  
applicability to business practice in the  
context of entrepreneurship education.  
Meeting different goals  
As graduates will predominantly find  
jobs in the relatively unspecific “ser-  
vice industry,” they should be able to  
understand the nature of services as  
a whole. This includes knowing how  
services can be designed – includ-  
ing research, ideation, prototyping,  
and implementation – as well as  
identifying various stakeholders and  
considering backstage processes.  
The subject in which service de-  
sign is integrated was introduced in  
order to offer students the opportuni-  
ty to link and practically apply what  
they had learned in different subjects.  
Along with helping students  
acquire an entrepreneurial attitude,  
teaching service design will con-  
tribute to reaching the educational  
objectives of “active citizenship” and  
“employability.” Integrating a seminal  
\(trendsetting\) innovation approach  
makes students fit for actively “de-  
signing” their \(and our\) future.  
Implementation  
The big challenge was – and still is  
to a certain degree – the question of  
how to anchor service design in the  
schools as it is still a relatively young  
discipline. Two years before the new  
secondary school curriculum was  
launched, the “concept” of service  
design was presented to a selected CASES 12 Embedding service design in organizations  
number of potential multiplicators,  
such as teachers and school princi-  
pals. The audience were interested,  
but initially uncertain about how  
service design could be brought  
into the classroom.  
Thanks to the internet, we real-  
ized that Marc Stickdorn was living  
just around the corner in Innsbruck,  
Austria. We contacted him to set  
up some further presentations and  
workshops to help us understand  
what service design actually is, how  
it can be beneficial for high school  
students, and how it could be taught  
in school. Then, we asked him and  
his colleague Markus Hormeß to set  
up nationwide teacher training in  
service design.  
Nationwide teacher training  
We set up these nationwide teacher  
training sessions as courses of-  
fered by the Pedagogical University  
Tyrol in Innsbruck exclusively to  
teachers that are responsible for  
this new school subject. There are  
two consecutive three-day courses\:  
a “basic” course and a follow-up  
“advanced” course.  
The three-day basic course  
includes basic service design tools,  
such as personas, journey maps,  
stakeholder maps, and prototypes, as  
well as the Business Model Canvas.  
It also includes some of the main  
service design activities\: research,  
ideation, and prototyping. A big  
part of this first course is about the  
mindset and the iterative design  
process, as most of the teachers do  
not have a design background. The  
whole course is set up as a train-the-  
teacher course. As all participants are  
professional pedagogues, the course  
content focuses on service design in  
practice and gives the participants  
enough time to review and discuss  
how these tools and methods can be  
taught in school.  
The three-day follow-up course  
adopts a more open “bar camp” or  
“unconference” approach.03 Topics  
range from case studies, to ex-  
changing first experiences, to trying  
out lessons and prototyping class-  
room materials.  
03 A “bar camp” or “unconference” is a user-generated conference. The  
agenda of the event is co-created by the participants themselves on the  
day, so the content is based on their needs and interests.

“Our course topic was ‘Street Food’  
and we prototyped the entire situation  
with a rented truck so that we could  
even produce and test our kitchen  
prototypes in the actual situa-  
tional context.”  
— Marianne Liszt, Teacher at HBLA  
Oberwart/Burgenland  
Gaining experience  
In the winter semester 2016/2017,  
the third nationwide basic course  
and the second follow-up teach-  
er training took place. More than  
100 teachers in Austria have been  
through the training already and are  
passing on their knowledge to their  
students and colleagues, sometimes  
doing team teaching together with  
colleagues from other subjects.  
Actually, implementing service  
design as a subject in secondary  
schools is a service design process on  
its own. Both teachers and students  
start with “sh!tty first drafts” and  
improve them iteratively\: the teach-  
ers their lessons, the students the  
services they work on in their class-  
es. In order to constantly improve  
this process, teachers can constantly  
exchange experiences and share This is Service Design Doing

CASES 12 Embedding service design in organizations  
teaching material through an online  
forum shared with the growing  
community of service design teach-  
ers in Austria. In addition, we have  
received requests from teachers to  
establish an annual meeting fostering  
a living community of practice of  
service design teachers in Austria.  
Prospects  
Given the fact that service design is  
still in its infancy in schools, it will  
– without a doubt – stay exciting.  
We will academically monitor and  
evaluate the further process of imple-  
menting service design in secondary  
education in Austria during the  
upcoming years. One of our research  
questions is how students benefit  
from early service design education  
in their professional and maybe even  
in their private lives. Also, we hope  
with growing experience within our  
community to be able to offer pro-  
found guidance on how to effectively  
and successfully implement service  
design in secondary school curric-  
ula. Nevertheless, we can already  
see some initial results that we  
would like to share.  
The individual degree of imple-  
mentation at each school seems to  
depend on several influencing factors.  
One of these factors could be how  
service design is introduced to schools  
on a national level. In Austria, this is  
done through a mixture of a top-down  
approach \(by including service design  
in the national curriculum of sec-  
ondary education\) and a bottom-up  
approach \(by training teachers and  
establishing a community of prac-  
tice\), which seems promising so far.  
Another route to success might be to  
start with small projects and learn it-  
eratively, tolerating – or even welcom-  
ing – errors as a source of knowledge  
for further improvement. Moreover,  
it is certainly helpful to raise aware-  
ness within the school \(amongst all  
related stakeholders, such as teachers,  
students, parents, partners, and so on\)  
and also between schools, by commu-  
nicating about service design activ-  
ities, exchanging experiences with  
colleagues, and staying open-minded  
about student involvement.  
Indeed, one of the key drivers  
might be an open mindset and the  
willingness to share experiences and  
to learn from others. Finally, school  
482/483  
principals are key stakeholders  
that also need some basic service  
design knowledge to understand the  
design process, methods, and tools.  
This knowledge will allow them to  
understand school projects related to  
service design, and how students and  
schools can benefit from these.  
“Service design is also an attitude,  
an open, sensitive observation and  
perception of events that very often  
initiates a change process.”

HLW Landeck/Tirol

With decreasing citizen trust  
and employees pushed to the  
limit of their engagement,  
Arbetsförmedlingen \(the Swedish  
Public Employment Service\)  
needed to find a new way forward  
and create a cultural change. At  
the time, Arbetsförmedlingen had  
13,000 employees, 320 offices,  
and 27 million customer con-  
tacts every year.  
Prior to this project, a line of  
projects had been done to design  
customer-centered solutions. The  
link between negative customer  
experience and internal problems  
was mapped. A clear prioritization  
for the changes was developed. But  
instead of simply commanding  
the offices to “implement these  
solutions and make them work,”  
Arbetsförmedlingen took a brave  
turn and put frontline staff in  
charge of the change.  
“The understanding of our trust  
problem had existed more or less for  
a long time, but the positive results  
as an effect of the understanding had  
been absent. We really had no choice  
other than to become more customer-centered  
in our approach, and that’s  
why we turned to service design  
and decided to let our ­ employers  
and our customers be a part of  
the development.”

Communications, Arbetsförmedlingen

one, we started with those who were  
curious and volunteers. Today nearly

be a Greenhouse.”

Engaging  
employees  
Offices were invited to participate,  
and seven with a range of con-  
ditions were chosen to become  
“Greenhouses.” The staff got to  
attend a three-day crash course in  
service design, testing methods,  
tools, and the approach. The offices  
were introduced to the service solu-  
tions and got to perform the final  
iterations on a local scale.  
They adapted the solutions  
to their everyday conditions and  
prototyped, interviewed customers,  
generated ideas for adjustments,  
and made the final designs. A  
central support function was set  
up, with service designers from  
Transformator Design and head-  
quarters staff to moderate the pro-  
cess and coach the offices. So far 24  
offices have become Greenhouses.

“We thought maybe that solutions  
could be implemented without the  
employers having an understanding  
of the customers’ needs and why we  
needed to change. This was a mistake,  
but that’s the great part with this  
whole approach – it’s based on making  
mistakes, but making them early,  
admitting them, learning from them,  
and adjusting as you go.”  
— Pia Rydqvist, Customer Service Manager,  
Arbetsförmedlingen  
The result was a range of revised  
solutions that headquarters now  
knew would work well in large and  
small offices, in cities and in the  
countryside, and from the custom-  
ers’ and the employees’ points of  
view. The changes were implemented  
with great buy-in from the front-line  
staff and created a sense of organiza-  
tional ownership.  
When the first concept was im-  
plemented in 320 offices it resulted in  
a reduction in time \(from 50 minutes  
to just 10\) spent on practical regis-  
tration in the first meeting, freeing  
time for focusing on the individual’s  
ambitions and needs. The decrease in  
citizen trust stopped, and employees This is Service Design Doing  
say that the service design approach  
helped soften hierarchies and erase  
prestige, leading to drastically in-  
creased health and work satisfaction.  
“Learning will take some extra time  
in the beginning, but we believe  
customer-driven development must  
be built in as a natural part of the  
everyday work.”  
— Pia Rydqvist, Customer Service Manager,  
Arbetsförmedlingen  
Effects on  
organization  
Customer-driven development is  
now seen as an essential part of the  
organization’s future, and in June  
2016 a permanent support function  
was implemented to establish the  
Greenhouse concept throughout the  
organization. So far 2,000 employees,  
including 400 managers, have been  
introduced to service design and the  
importance of a customer-centric  
approach, but the goal is to offer it to  
all employees. The support function  
will make sure that\:  
— Customer knowledge is shared  
—  
and collected so that the  
development of services can be  
conducted in local offices.  
— Future national development  
—  
projects will be coordinated  
in Greenhouses.  
— The Greenhouse framework con-  
—  
tinues to be relevant and contrib-  
utes to creating better services,  
based on needs of the citizens.  
“We can’t go back to the way we  
worked before. Once you’ve learned  
the tools and methods, and more  
importantly adapted the approach,  
you can’t keep \[from\] applying it to

AWARENESS AND EXPERTISE  
# The emergence of service design in Thailand  
AUTHOR

Thailand Creative  
& Design Center  
Realizing the service economy’s  
importance in creating value and  
improving the quality of life for Thai  
people, and boosting the country’s  
competitiveness in the field of ser-  
vices, Thailand Creative & Design  
Center \(TCDC\) is the first Thai orga-  
nization to introduce service design  
to Thailand, experimenting and ap-  
plying it to various organizations in  
both the public and private sectors.  
We initiated a Service Design  
Thailand program with the ambition  
to drive service design as a major  
part of improving existing services  
or boosting service innovation  
for businesses and public ser-  
vices in Thailand.  
We first introduced service de-  
sign in TCDC’s annual symposium,  
Creativities Unfold 2012, by inviting  
Birgit Mager, President of the Service  
Design Network and Professor  
of Service Design at the Köln  
International School of Design, to  
lecture on the value of service design.  
She presented ideas from countries  
such as Germany and Finland, which  
take a systematic and efficient public  
service development approach; this  
resulted in Thailand’s first service  
design workshop. Participants  
included design professors, TCDC,  
and public service organizations,  
namely the Thai Post Office, the State  
Railway of Thailand, and the Office  
of Transport and Traffic Policy and  
Planning \(OTP\).  
Workshops  
The workshops created awareness  
among public service organizations  
of the role and importance of service  
design. Consequently, we have  
participated in two projects planning  
the future of Thailand’s public trans-  
portation system\:  
1 The Service Design Research  
for User Insights and Needs in  
486/487  
High-Speed Trains \(HST\) Project, a  
co-creation project between TCDC,  
OTP, and Livework, resulted in the  
implementation of the design prin-  
ciples of space and services within  
the development of high-speed train  
stations. This project illustrated the  
importance of the design to the pub-  
lic sector, as the HST Service Design  
Principles were under the Terms of  
Reference of OTP, the organization  
that handled the Thailand HST feasi-  
bility study program.  
2 The Hua Lamphong Train  
Station Improvement Study Project  
is a study of the unchanged, century-old  
Hua Lamphong train station.  
Our team applied service design,  
starting with field research, user  
studies, and moving on to a complete  
service design process. The result  
was physical improvements, includ-  
ing updates to the passenger waiting  
area and commercial area around This is Service Design Doing  
the station, as well as a feasibility  
study of the new service design and  
the establishment of a new business  
model for Hua Lamphong Station  
in the future.  
In 2014, we invited service de-  
sign experts Marc Stickdorn, Markus  
Hormess, and Adam Lawrence to  
disseminate their knowledge more  
widely by hosting two types of  
service design workshops. First, a  
“Train the Trainers” program trained  
service design facilitators, who then  
acted as knowledge dissemina-  
tors themselves, facilitating future  
service design workshops. Second,  
our guests facilitated co-creation  
workshops to initiate three proj-  
ects in different service sectors\: the  
healthcare sector with Bumrungrad  
International Hospital, the hospi-  
tality service industry with Thai  
Hotel Association, and the tourism  
sector with Designated Areas for  
Sustainable Tourism Administration  
\(Public Organization\). The concepts  
and prototypes derived from these  
workshops have been implemented  
in these organizations.  
Additionally, we set out to  
involve the education sector in  
supporting and amplifying service  
design. This initiated cooperation  
among five universities. Choosing  
the topic of “Service Design for  
Public Transportation,” with a  
high-speed train as a service de-  
sign development target, teachers  
and students from all five universi-  
ties together learned the concepts  
and process of service design and  
created prototypes showcased in  
the “Service Design for Public  
Transportation” exhibition.  
Training courses  
We also created short-term service  
design training courses for the  
general public under the Bangkok  
Service Jam project, as well as host-  
ing special service design training  
courses for 13 universities under  
the miniTCDC project, disseminat-  
ing knowledge through workshop  
facilitation. The workshop results  
were service design prototypes in  
each local case.  
After accumulating lessons, op-  
portunities, problems, and obstacles  
from our service design program  
\(which has mostly focused on the  
service sector in the past few years\),  
in 2015, we challenged ourselves as  
well as the agricultural and man-  
ufacturing sectors with the ques-  
tion, “How can we transform Thai  
businesses from manufacturing and  
product-oriented companies to cus-  
tomer experience – and service-ori-  
ented companies using the service  
design approach?”  
Large company adoption  
We introduced the service design  
approach to two large-scale Thai  
companies – namely, STC Group,  
a leading company in the agricul-  
tural sector, and PTT Chemicals, a  
manufacturing company – and we  
were able to convince the executive  
boards of both companies of the  
importance and benefits of service  
design’s principles, processes, and  
tools. We also initiated co-cre-  
ative service design projects based  
within these two organizations by  
gathering the companies’ staff and  
various stakeholders\: we invited the  
production, product R&D, sales,  
and marketing departments, as well  
as top-level management, to join  
our service design workshops and  
training programs. We and our team CASES 12 Embedding service design in organizations

facilitated the workshops, executed  
the whole service design process,  
and concluded with product and  
service prototypes.  
This is a starting point in apply-  
ing service design and the design  
thinking process. These compa-  
nies may not have transformed  
themselves within a few years, but  
feedback from the companies is  
quite positive, as they have gained  
experience during these workshops  
and training programs. They have  
adopted new approaches which have  
given them a better understanding  
of their customers and the way their  
departments think and operate. They  
are creating prototypes and test-  
ing minimum viable products and  
services, comparing their prototypes  
with their existing business process-  
es. The new approaches have led to  
changes in their manufacturing and  
in the organizations themselves.  
Creative district  
To promote TCDC moving to  
Charoenkrung and to apply de-  
sign thinking and service design  
on a larger scale, we and our  
partners initiated the “Co-Create  
488/489  
Charoenkrung” project. The proj-  
ect’s aim was to revive and develop  
Charoenkrung district – once a  
significant economic and social area  
of Bangkok – to become a creative  
district of the future. The project,  
which ran from July 2015 to June  
2016, was conducted using service  
design thinking and doing principles  
and processes, focusing on co-cre-  
ation among experts on creative cit-  
ies, architecture, and design, as well  
as key stakeholders in the district.  
In co-designing the creative  
district, we invited designers and local  
people \(who are not only users but  
participants\) to express the problems  
and articulate the opportunities and  
needs of the community. This led to  
a concept of project development in  
various forms, steps, and processes\:  
starting from design research, gaining  
insights, generating ideas, co-design-  
ing, making paper prototypes and 1\:1  
full-scale prototypes, and testing and  
evaluating with the local people in the  
real spaces. The ultimate goal of the  
project involves not only developing  
the creative district but also develop-  
ing a “co-creation model” as well as  
the principles and processes of service This is Service Design Doing  
design thinking and doing which can  
be applied to our beloved Thailand.  
Our service design programs  
and schemes have just started; none-  
theless, they have raised awareness  
among the public, business, and  
social sectors and provided essential  
outcomes. These include service  
prototypes for future investment  
and development. Our creation  
and dissemination of service design  
knowledge through workshop facil-  
itation, together with project-based  
and co-creative schemes with other  
organizations and communities,  
have publicized and developed  
service design knowledge, as well  
as reinforcing the service design  
network and ecosystem that will  
create economic and social impacts  
in Thailand in the future.  
As a result of these activities,  
we’ve seen major engagement with  
service design. From March 2013  
through June 2016, 1,500 people  
attended our service design work-  
shops. Additionally, our YouTube  
channel has logged more than  
87,000 views. TCDC has encouraged  
30 public and private organizations  
and 30 universities to participate in  
service design activities.  
KEY TAKEAWAYS  
01 The simplicity of service  
design and its process\: Peo-  
ple are surrounded by ser-  
vices in almost every aspect  
of their lives. So, it is quite  
easy to educate, teach, train,  
and apply service design in  
either life or work.  
02  
Co-creation in multi  
disciplinary projects\:  
Service design and the  
design thinking process can  
lead non-designers to under-  
stand design differently, as a  
method of solving problems  
and creating value. “Design”  
is not only for designers; it  
is the process of co-creation  
with people from various  
disciplines \(whether they  
are experts or amateurs\),  
blending experience and  
backgrounds and providing  
the appropriate solutions.  
03 Facilitation of workshops\:  
The best starting point for  
service design \(for those  
people or organizations who  
are new to the approach\)  
is to run through a service  
design workshop. This  
means that the intelligence  
and skills of the service  
design facilitator are the key  
to success. Even if they have  
great facilitation skills, good  
facilitators have to know or  
learn some specific content  
before they run workshops. CASES 12 Embedding service design in organizations

MULTINATIONAL ORGANIZATION  
# Redesigning Deutsche Telekom  
AUTHOR  
Ole Schilling  
Senior Design Manager,  
Deutsche Telekom  
Philipp Thesen  
Chief Designer –  
Lead Telekom Design,  
Deutsche Telekom  
The challenge  
Deutsche Telekom operates in 14  
countries, serves 160+ million cus-  
tomers, and has an annual turnover  
of around 70 billion euros. As a  
formerly state-owned company, we  
are mainly driven by technology  
and infrastructure. Just over seven  
years ago, the design department  
was established to challenge every  
product and service while driving  
customer centricity in order to  
achieve a best-in-class customer  
experience\: a daunting challenge for  
a tech giant that used to be run by  
the government.  
Our goal  
From the 2016 World Economic  
Forum in Davos to the boardrooms  
of billion-dollar corporations,  
design thinking is a widely em-  
braced approach to creative problem  
solving. Thanks to the increasing  
importance of customer experience  
as a key differentiating factor in  
most businesses, the role of design  
is changing – from form-giving to  
strategy-giving. Design has adopted  
a strategic leadership role and, by  
doing so, caused a major hiccup for  
large corporations in which design  
has traditionally played a less promi-  
nent role. We had one goal\: a best-in-  
class experience for our 160 million  
customers. And we knew that in  
order to accomplish that, we needed  
a sustainable mind shift across major  
parts of our organization. This is the  
story of how it happened.  
“Over the past few years we have  
successfully worked on more than 200  
products and services for Deutsche  
Telekom and managed to climb the  
design ladder from a focus on form to  
focus on processes, slowly working our  
way up to a focus on strategy.”  
— Philipp Thesen, Chief Designer,  
Lead Telekom Design  
490/491  
From doing to thinking  
We leveraged the potential of design  
by integrating design thinking into  
the fundamental processes through-  
out the company. There are only  
about 100 designers in our team, so  
we could never hope to keep up with  
the increasing need for design. That’s  
why we created tools and assets that  
would serve the organization while  
leveraging the potential of design  
and design thinking. We operation-  
alized the processes and methods  
that we derived from our experience  
of design doing. Additionally, we ana-  
lyzed existing design thinking meth-  
ods while adopting approaches from  
various schools of thought, including  
from Stanford University and HPI.  
Ultimately, we took external  
methods and hundreds of interviews  
and weighed them against our own  
internal expertise and experience  
in order to create a standardized set  
of methods and tools tailored for  
our organization. This is Service Design Doing  
This led to common ground, a  
clear understanding of responsibili-  
ties, and clean integration within the  
existing organizational structure. We  
created a selection of 17 methods,  
customized for our needs, along  
with detailed personas and practical  
tools and templates. It’s the standard  
toolset of our daily work and it helps  
us to collaborate in a way that is both  
efficient and customer oriented. The  
toolbox is continuously extended  
and updated. It’s available as a book  
and online within our corporate  
design tool, Brand & Design, a plat-  
form we created for our colleagues to  
distribute and leverage design.  
“We aligned the design process and  
the integration of our methods and  
tools within the development process  
with our German and European col-  
leagues that work on customer-facing  
products and services.”  
— Ole Schilling, Senior Design Manager  
We strongly believe that visibility is  
key and we actively communicate  
and showcase our customer-centered  
ideal. This is also why we launched  
a new format for interaction called  
Customer Lab. On a regular basis we  
invite real customers, selected on the  
basis of our personas, to challenge  
existing products and proposed  
product innovations. This approach  
is especially powerful because it  
generates valuable feedback and in-  
sights which we embrace by inviting  
our colleagues across the company  
to share this knowledge and drive  
the visibility of our topic. Inviting  
the management team so that they  
can experience customer feedback  
firsthand is a simple, yet extremely  
powerful tool. Live and direct –  
customer-centric design.  
Educational framework  
Although we invited our colleagues  
at an early stage to engage with us  
and discuss how to implement cus-  
tomer experience KPIs with existing  
processes, the reality is that within  
large corporations change happens  
in baby steps. So, we need to foster  
a culture in which the principles of  
design thinking are largely embraced  
within corporate culture and values.  
The logical next step was to create an  
educational framework.

In order to drive real change we  
created a space and program dedi-  
cated to focusing on design thinking\:  
the Telekom Design Academy, a  
place where we teach our methods  
and the use of our tools but also sup-  
port our colleagues with real project  
facilitation. We realized that the  
demand for project facilitation and  
on-the-job design thinking training  
can be applied to specific topics.  
Demand far exceeded our expecta-  
tions, which is why we had to start  
staffing our internal and external  
teams immediately.  
Learnings  
We come from a strong legacy of  
design doing. This entitles us to  
create and implement processes and  
tools for our colleagues that will  
drive change within our company.  
Integrating design into processes ul-  
timately brings us one step closer to  
integrating design into the corporate  
strategy. For now it’s clear that we  
still have a long way to go to become  
a more design- and customer-orient-  
ed company, but we are well under-  
way and design has taken a leader-  
ship position within the company.  
KEY TAKEAWAYS  
01  
Integrate stakeholders and  
users as early as possible in  
order to help design thinking  
become a common approach.  
Start with the stakeholders  
who are most open to collab-  
oration.  
02  
Make the approach as tan-  
gible as possible so it’s clear  
how it works and what the  
benefits are. Create a clear  
target picture and work your  
way toward it. Don’t waste  
time with theoretical discus-  
sions.  
03  
Integrate new processes into  
the existing context and  
make them as visible as pos-  
sible. Make sure that there  
is a top-down pull toward  
the necessary deliverables.  
Leadership involvement  
is, however, very beneficial  
along the way in order to lay  
the foundation.  
04  
05  

Design thinking is far too  
important to be left only  
to designers. However, the  
experience designers gain  
from a strong design doing  
background makes them  
the perfect ambassadors for  
design thinking. Building a  
community of experts  
has been especially ­ beneficial  
for our European rollout,  
in which learning from and  
building upon on each  
other’s experiences proved  
to be essential.  
Don’t expect results  
to be immediate. Change  
needs time.

Improvement  
Leader, Coca-Cola  
Hellenic BSO  
The Coca-Cola Hellenic Business  
Services Organization \(BSO\) is a  
fast-growing shared services cen-  
ter in Sofia, Bulgaria, operating on  
behalf of one of the world’s largest  
Coca-Cola bottlers. Providing finan-  
cial and HR support to 22 diverse  
countries, its 600 employees now  
aim to be best in class in terms of  
customer satisfaction. To realize this,  
BSO is leveraging the service design  
concept to introduce new ways of  
thinking and acting.  
“If your business model became  
your prison, you’ve got to change  
your business.”  
— Arne van Oosterom, Senior Partner and  
Co-Founder, DesignThinkers Group  
Changing the emphasis  
BSO was originally set up with a  
focus on enhancing processes from  
a compliance and efficiency point  
of view, adding extra steps to gain  
the trust of the different country  
operations. “This often resulted  
in cumbersome processes spread  
over many departments,” explains  
Business Services Director Simona  
Simion-Popescu. “This meant that  
the backbone of our services was  
not especially customer-oriented.  
And because the 22 country opera-  
tions now see the added value of a  
shared service center, requests for  
even more services have added to the  
complexity of our operations.”  
The challenge for BSO was to  
change the approach and the setup  
of its processes. “We needed to find  
a way to get things right from the  
outset when launching new proj-  
ects and services so as to respect  
compliance and governance while  
providing an excellent experience for  
customers,” says Continuous Process  
Improvement Leader Vladimir  
Tsaklev, who is managing the project  
at BSO. “We needed to build an  
organization where there is a con-  
tinuous focus on customer centricity  
and implementing in a sustainable  
way. This is where DesignThinkers  
Academy came in.”  
Learning by doing  
The project kicked off with a work-  
shop to establish proper ownership  
with relevant senior-level stakehold-  
ers from inside BSO and the client  
organizations. Further details of  
the program were developed with  
these leaders and a pilot customer  
journey workshop held on Service  
Management, a relationship man-  
agement framework for internal  
customers. Similar workshops with  
other departments were set up with-  
in which customer journey mapping  
and employee journey mapping were  
key components.  
“Workshops with relevant  
stakeholders from the country orga-  
nizations and a number of external  
customers typically take two days,”  
explains Tim Schuurman from  
DesignThinkers Academy. “We go This is Service Design Doing

through the standard service design  
approach, including persona identi-  
fication, interviews with customers,  
customer journey mapping, and the  
ideation part, prototyping. Where  
customer journey mapping focuses  
mainly on improving the services  
provided to customers and business  
partners, employee journey mapping  
aims to create an environment for  
them to work in a customer-cen-  
tric way. In other words, customer  
centricity is approached from both  
an internal \(employee\) as well as  
external \(customer\) perspective.”  
An ongoing process  
Periodic sessions with relevant  
stakeholders reflect on the process  
for building the customer-centric  
ecosystem. Focusing on how things  
are done is vital as new ways of  
collaboration basically determine the  
successful implementation of new  
service concepts.  
“The idea is to turn this way of  
working into a regular routine that  
continuously builds on a custom-  
er-centric mindset in a sustainable  
way,” adds Tsaklev. “You don’t talk  
about change – you ‘do change’ and  
496/497  
learn to collaborate in a way which  
leads to changes in mindset, and  
ultimately, genuine transformation  
which is anchored within the orga-  
nization.” A train the trainer model  
\(as part of the workshops\) assures  
capability building in tools and  
facilitation so that programs can be  
run independent of external trainers  
and consultants.  
Broad involvement  
In addition to internal \(country  
organizations\) and external custom-  
ers, the senior management levels at  
BSO have also been involved from the  
outset, helping co-create the program  
and running a customer journey  
workshop on Service Management.  
Simion-Popescu welcomes this  
approach\: “Employees are seen as  
customers and key stakeholders. By  
building empathy for one’s colleagues  
and understanding how that empathy  
was developed, people understand  
each other better. This in turn means  
you automatically become a custom-  
er-centric organization and auto-  
matically collaborate in a way that is  
customer-centric.” This is Service Design Doing  
“The initial skepticism about  
seeing service design as a means  
to build a customer-centric  
mindset quickly changed as we  
worked with tools such as the  
customer journey map. Together  
with proper facilitation, this  
creates a practical way of  
working which is understandable  
for all participants.”  
— Vladimir Tsaklev, Continuous Process  
Improvement Leader  
Phased outcomes  
An ambitious goal like becoming  
the best shared services organization  
in the beverage industry requires  
changing people’s behavior – and  
that does not happen overnight. Tim  
Schuurman reinforces the impor-  
tance of celebrating small wins at  
different phases of the project. “At  
the outset you have outcomes such  
as ensuring senior management  
commitment, engaging stakeholders  
in customer journey mapping, and  
sharing the customer journey narra-  
tive with employees. As the project  
evolves, the goals are improved  
employee satisfaction, enhanced cus-  
tomer satisfaction, better financial  
results, and a best-in-class shared  
service center.”  
The BSO project now has been  
handed over to the organization and  
is running independently of external  
consultants and trainers. Within the  
first year, the service design approach  
has achieved widespread support  
from stakeholders, along with a com-  
mitment to continuous involvement  
\(design research\) from customers in  
all major change initiatives.  
Some 90 employees have shared  
the customer journey narrative and  
2 customer \(employee\) journey  
workshops a year are planned for  
each service department. Last but  
not least, some 20 new short-term  
and 20 mid-term service concepts  
have been introduced across 4  
service departments. The fact that  
the executive management of Coca-  
Cola Hellenic has now decided on  
an organization-wide scale-up of  
the service design project speaks  
volumes for its success.

12.5.6 CASE\: BUILDING UP SERVICE DESIGN KNOWLEDGE ACROSS PROJECTS  
# Working with moving targets  
AUTHORS  
Geke van Dijk  
Strategy Director, STBY  
Katie Tzanidou  
UX Research  
Manager, Google  
Over the past few years STBY and  
Google have collaborated on a series  
of design research projects. Each  
project was focused on finding an-  
swers to a progressive set of specific  
questions from an internal team of  
developers, designers, and product  
managers who were working on a  
new service proposition. This string  
of research efforts also built up a re-  
pository of research assets across the  
individual projects, delivering more  
long-term value for the team and the  
wider organization. All of this hap-  
pened in a fast-moving, agile context  
characterized by dynamic product  
strategy development – challenging  
the design research team to effective-  
ly cater for a moving target.  
This continued strand of work  
has led us to jointly identify a few  
principles about agile collaboration  
with interdisciplinary teams in large  
organizations. Key to these prin-  
ciples is finding the right balance  
between the ongoing need for quick  
iterative cycles of design research  
efforts, during which data collection,  
analysis, and reporting happen in  
joint sprints, and the parallel need  
to build up more long-term value  
by documenting research activities  
in a structured way across the stages  
and projects in order to generate a  
“treasure trove” of design research  
assets. In this way design research  
contributes to a larger strategic value  
for organizations than just a probing  
resource in reactive mode.  
“We jointly identified a few ­ principles  
about agile collaboration with  
interdisciplinary teams in large  
organizations.”  
— Geke van Dijk, Strategy Director,  
STBY London & Amsterdam  
Various levels of questions  
Often the starting point for design  
research projects consists of a few  
layers. Most urgent and obvious are  
the short-term and specific questions  
from the project team \(e.g., develop-  
ers and designers\). They are working  
with an agile approach that entails  
developing new features in a fast-  
paced process. They are naturally  
most interested in specific answers to  
the questions they encounter in their  
current work, preferably to be deliv-  
ered on short notice. The issues they  
face often change over time, so in  
various stages of the design research  
process new or altered interests and  
questions may come up and will get  
folded into the ongoing design re-  
search. It is of course very important  
to answer these questions, but gear-  
ing all of the design research toward  
answering them will limit the scope  
of the research to what is already in  
the focus. This risks not touching on  
more surprising angles on the topic  
that might have been discovered via  
design research.  
Other stakeholders in the  
team and the wider organiza-  
tion \(e.g., product managers and This is Service Design Doing  
researchers\) usually also have an  
interest in exploring more holistic  
overarching themes related to the  
type of product or service they are  
working on. Finding the answers  
to their more strategic and long-  
term questions needs a bit more  
open-ended exploration. Ideally  
the design research approach caters  
for both these types of stakeholders  
and their questions\: while collecting  
data to answer specific short-term  
questions, it is also possible to collect  
data to answer more strategic and  
long-term questions.  
“We need to cater for questions from  
different types of stakeholders, with  
different speeds and focuses.”  
— Katie Tzanidou, UX Research Manager, Google  
Various speeds for exploration  
Catering for a moving target through  
design research demands a process  
of regular quick update meetings  
to align the ongoing work with the  
progressive thinking of the various  
stakeholders. During these meetings  
the intermediary results from the de-  
sign research are shared, even if they  
are still rough and unrefined. There  
is no point in waiting until the end  
of the design research process before  
making the insights and research  
assets available, as the team may then  
already have moved on and no lon-  
ger be engaged with the explorations.  
Meeting regularly and aiming for  
progressively informed conversations  
ensures that the results of the design  
research get better over time and  
are better aligned to the needs and  
interest of the stakeholders.  
This is easy to say, but definitely  
not easy to do. It is a big challenge  
for researchers to work in such an  
open, transparent way while going  
through a few weeks of successive  
research stages. They need to open  
up the work process to produce  
and share intermediate results in  
quick joint cycles/iterations. This is  
a real challenge for researchers, as  
they usually tend to desire time to  
germinate thoughts and conclusions.  
Between STBY and Google we have  
tried, tested, and improved this pro-  
cess over time, based on a joint belief  
and trust that this would be the  
best way forward. From both sides  
we saw the benefits and decided to  
push for this. Of course, there were  
moments of trial and error, followed  
by reflection on what worked best  
and what we wanted to change.  
For each project both parties were  
very flexible and open to adjusting  
our styles of working and trying  
different things.  
This highly collaborative and  
transparent approach doesn’t just  
ask a lot from the research team;  
also, the client team need to figure  
out how to best deal with this \(e.g.,  
the team need to decide who to  
involve in each stage\). It can be-  
come quite messy, as stakeholders  
need to understand what stage the  
project is in and what the status of  
the intermediary deliverables is, so  
the process does need to be managed  
quite actively. It is important to guide  
expectations carefully as most of the  
materials shared are not yet finished.  
We have learned the value of sharing  
the research documentation at an  
early stage of the design research,  
even if we do not yet know exactly  
what may come out of it. The process  
of building on intermediary results,  
and jointly discussing the progressive  
filtering and prioritization process,  
helps to progressively refine the CASES 12 Embedding service design in organizations

Working with shared  
online platforms  
So, regular meetings are important,  
as is sharing the design research ma-  
terials in a progressive and accessible  
way. We use shared online platforms

A Project flow with both quick iterations and  
more long-term explorations.  
B Know/Don’t Know matrix.  
C Pyramid of project deliverables.  
D Co-creative user lab with research participants  
and project team.  
E Visual documentation of social context of use.  
F Visual documentation of positive/negative  
user experiences. This is Service Design Doing  
for this, such as Google Drive and  
Google Sites. Google Drive is the  
shared project sandbox where notes  
and preliminary assets are exchanged  
and discussed with the core project  
team. Google Sites is the platform to  
share the more consolidated out-  
comes and assets from the various  
stages of the project with a wider  
group of stakeholders in the orga-  
nization. To guide this process of  
continuous exploration and filtering,  
we use a simple matrix that indicates  
what findings may be most valuable  
to spend more time on \(the Know/  
Don’t Know matrix\).  
Various layers of deliverables  
The intermediate and final deliver-  
ables of the design research project  
need to cater for the various levels  
and speeds of the stakeholders  
involved. They need to offer both a  
quick overview of key findings and  
a deep/rich repository for further  
exploration. They need to be very  
accessible and easy to scan, as  
some stakeholders are looking for  
actionable recommendations and  
others for more general inspira-  
tion or grounding.  
“By layering the design research deliv-  
erables, we offer insights for different  
levels of interest.”  
— Geke van Dijk, Strategy Director, STBY  
London & Amsterdam  
This is where layering of the design  
research deliverables is key. Different  
assets created throughout the design  
research process fit into different  
layers of what we call the “pyramid  
of deliverables.”01 The base of the  
pyramid consists of organized and  
structured fieldwork documentation  
\(e.g., annotated customer journey  
maps, interview notes, diary or  
probe study returns, selected video  
clips, etc.\), the middle layer of the  
pyramid contains the fully described  
and illustrated insights that answer  
the specific project questions \(e.g.,  
recurring pain points, typical profiles  
of people or events, opportunities for  
improvement, etc.\), and the top layer  
offers a highly selective summary of  
the key takeaways from the design  
research and the recommendations  
that can be derived from those.  
01 See illustration C., Pyramid of project deliverables.  
Additional added value  
across projects  
While the middle and top layers  
of the pyramid answer directly  
both the more specific short-term  
and the more strategic long-term  
questions posed by various stake-  
holders involved in the project, the  
base layer of design research assets  
offers a more general treasure trove  
of materials that can also be mined  
for other purposes than the current  
project. When the design research  
assets are created in a structured  
way across projects, they can offer  
additional valuable insights over  
and above what is taken out of each  
project. They can be mined for other  
purposes as well, such as exploring  
new upcoming questions. When  
done well, the overall collection of  
assets from various projects adds up  
to a treasure trove with a more long-  
term value for an organization. This  
is where considerable extra mileage  
can be generated out of the original  
project budget. CASES 12 Embedding service design in organizations

KEY TAKEAWAYS  
01  
Find the right balance  
between ongoing quick iter-  
ations and more long-term  
investigation of overarching  
themes.  
02  
Build in very regular update  
meetings to align the ongo-  
ing work through progres-  
sively informed conversa-  
tions.  
03  
Be ready to share and dis-  
cuss unfinished work, and  
benefit from this exposure.  
04  
Combine a transparent  
and collaborative approach  
with active management of  
expectations.  
05  
Layer the design research  
deliverables to cater for the  
needs of all stakeholders.
