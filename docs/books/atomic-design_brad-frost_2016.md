Proudly created in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Foreword  
It was 2013, and we huddled with Brad Frost and Jennifer Brook around  
a sunlit kitchen table in Brooklyn. The four of us had just begun work  
on a new website for TechCrunch, and we were sketching wireframes  
in Jennifer’s apartment, wrestling with the new demands of responsive  
design. Brad pulled out his laptop\: “I’ve been playing with a new idea.”  
Brad’s screen looked like a webpage had exploded. Bits and pieces of UI  
floated free of each other, untethered by a unified design or hierarchy.  
It looked like a pile of spare parts from a web garage.  
Brad flashed his crazy grin and nodded, “Great, right?” The three of  
us stared back blankly. Somebody coughed.  
And then Brad Frost the front-end developer started talking like Brad  
Frost the chemist. He talked about atoms and molecules and organisms  
– about how large pieces of design can be broken down into smaller  
ones and even recombined into different large pieces. Instead  
of visualizing the finished recipe for the design, in other words, he  
was showing us the ingredients. And we lit up\: this was a shift in  
perspective, a way to move away from conceiving a website design as  
a collection of static page templates, and instead as a dynamic system  
of adaptable components. It was an inspired way to approach this  
responsive website – and all responsive projects for that matter.  
Brad’s new idea was atomic design, and it changed the way we work  
in this astonishingly multi-device world. By thinking about interfaces  
simultaneously at both the large \(page\) level as well as the small  
\(atomic\) level, we streamlined our process\: we introduced more rigorous  
thought into the role of every element; we fell into habits that improved  
the consistency of our UX; and crucially, we started working much faster  
and more collaboratively. Atomic design was our superpower.  
In the early stages of the TechCrunch redesign, there was this moment  
where we talked about what we wanted the article page to be. Within  
an hour, Brad had a fully responsive version wired up from his kit of  
parts. That was the moment we realized just how quickly we were going  
to be able to move, a powerful case for investing in this clever, modular  
approach.  
Almost four years later, we haven’t looked back. Brad continued to  
refine his techniques and tools over the projects that followed,  
6 ATOMIC DESIGN including blockbuster sites for Entertainment Weekly and Time, Inc.  
We’ve used these lessons to help in-house product teams make  
sites faster and with higher quality, build massive design systems  
for organizations looking to centralize their design and development  
work across international offices, and much more.  
Atomic design gave us speed, creative freedom, and flexibility.  
It changed everything. We think it will do the same for you, too.  
This wonderful book explains the philosophy, practice, and  
maintenance of atomic design systems. And it does so with the  
cheerful, helpful generosity that so describes Brad himself.  
Brad’s energy and big-hearted enthusiasm for the web and its  
makers are boundless. For years, Brad has worked at the forefront  
of responsive design technique – and he’s shared everything along  
the way. His This Is Responsive site is the go-to resource for finding  
responsive solutions to any UX problem. His blog and Twitter feeds  
share his roadblocks and his solutions. When designers and developers  
follow Brad Frost, they get a fast and dense stream of practical,  
passionate insight for building beautiful and resilient websites.  
This book doubles down on all of that.  
Given the chance, Brad would knock on the door of every designer  
and developer to personally deliver his message. We’ve watched  
with astonishment \(and mild envy\) as this whirling dervish has  
barnstormed around the globe to share his advice with hundreds of  
teams and organizations across six continents. \(Atomic design, coming  
soon to Antarctica!\) But even Brad Frost can’t be everywhere at once,  
and we’re delighted that he’s detailed his ideas with such depth and  
good humor in this book.  
Atomic design is blowing up around the world; it transformed our  
design practice; and we’re excited for it to bring the same creative  
combustion to your process, too.

8 ATOMIC DESIGN A long, long time ago, there were these things called books.  
Remember them? These contraptions were heavy and bulky and  
made from the pulp of dead trees. Inside these books were things  
called pages. You turned them, and they cut your fingers.  
Awful things. I’m so glad these book things with their razor-sharp  
pages aren’t around anymore.  
Oh, wait…  
# Our paginated past  
The page has been with us for a long time now. A few millennia,  
actually. The first books were thick slabs of clay created about 4,000  
years ago, soon replaced by scrolls as the preferred way to consume  
the written word. And while reading technology has come a long  
way – from papyrus to parchment to paperback to pixels – the  
concept of the page holds strong to this day.  
The page metaphor has been baked into the lexicon of the web since  
the very beginning. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web  
so that he, his colleagues at CERN, and other academics could easily  
share and link together their world of documents. This document-  
based, academic genesis of the web is why the concept of the page is  
so deeply ingrained in the vocabulary of the internet.  
So what?  
As we’ll discuss throughout this book, the way things are named  
very much impacts how they’re perceived and utilized. Thinking  
of the web as pages has real ramifications on how people interact  
with web experiences, and influences how we go about creating web  
interfaces.  
From the beginning, the page metaphor provided users with a  
familiar language with which to navigate this brave new World Wide  
Web. Concepts like bookmarking and pagination helped new web  
users explore and eventually master an entirely new medium using  
conventions they were already comfortable with.  
CHAPTER 1 / DESIGNING SYSTEMS 9 Chrome browser displaying ‘This webpage is not available’ message.  
The page was – and continues to be – a very visible and helpful  
metaphor for the users of the web. It also has a profound influence  
on how web experiences are created.  
In the early days of the web, companies looking to get online simply  
translated their printed materials onto their websites. But even  
though these brochure websites offered a very one-dimensional  
perspective of what the web could offer, viewing websites as digital  
representations of the printed page was easy for creators to wrap  
their heads around.  
But we’re now 25 years into this new medium, and this  
once necessary figure of speech has overstayed its welcome.  
Unfortunately, the page metaphor continues to run deep with  
respect to how we scope and execute our web projects. Here are  
just a few examples I hear on a regular basis\:  
“We’re a startup looking to launch a five-page website  
this October…”  
“Brad, how long will the homepage take to build?”  
“How are we ever going to redesign this university website that  
contains over 30,000 pages?!”  
10 ATOMIC DESIGN All of the statements above make the fundamental mistake of  
assuming a page is a uniform, isolated, quantifiable thing. The  
reality is that the web is a fluid, interactive, interdependent  
medium. As soon as we come to terms with this fact, the notion  
of the page quickly erodes as a useful means to scope and create  
web experiences.  
How long will a homepage take to build? Well, that sort of depends  
on what’s on it, right? Maybe the homepage simply consists of a  
tagline and a background image, which means it could be done by  
lunch. Or maybe it’s chock-full of carousels, dynamic forms, and  
third-party integrations. In that case, maybe the homepage will  
take several months to complete.  
As for the 30,000-page university website, it might be tempting to  
declare, “Thousands of pages?! Wow, that sounds challenging!” But  
in reality, those 30,000 pages may consist of three content types  
and two overarching layouts.  
Ultimately, a project’s level of effort is much better determined by  
the functionality and components contained within those pages,  
rather than on the quantity of pages themselves.  
The page metaphor has served its purpose helping users familiarize  
themselves with the web, and provided creators with the necessary  
transitional language with which to create for a brand new medium.  
But to build thoughtful interfaces meant to be served to a multitude  
of connected devices, the time has come for us to evolve beyond  
the page.  
# Tearing up the page  
Thankfully, the web community is hard at work establishing  
principles and practices to help us effectively talk about and  
create for the web. And there’s one concept that keeps popping  
up in every conversation about how to make successful web  
experiences\: modularity.  
Modularity predates the web by a long shot. The Industrial  
Revolution brought about interchangeable parts and Henry Ford’s  
assembly line forever transformed the automobile manufacturing  
CHAPTER 1 / DESIGNING SYSTEMS 11 process. The earliest cars and components were individually crafted,  
which led to many safety and maintainability nightmares. Ford broke  
the automobile down into its component parts and modularized the  
assembly process. The results spoke for themselves\: more uniform,  
more reliable, safer cars rolled out of the factory, and in record time  
to boot.  
As the machine age became the computer age, computer scientists  
began practicing object-oriented programming and establishing  
important modular concepts like separation of concerns and the single  
responsibility principle. It is from this world that the World Wide Web  
was born, so it’s no surprise that modular design quickly became a  
design principle for the architecture of the web.  
Slowly, but surely, these concepts found their way into web designers’  
workflows. In the early 2000s we saw the introduction of libraries  
like YUI and jQuery UI that provided developers with a toolkit of  
widgets and patterns to create more consistent user interfaces.  
If modularity has been around for such a long time, why are we  
talking about it now?  
The short answer is that modularity matters more than ever. Right  
now, our entire industry is drowning in a sea of devices, viewport  
sizes, and online environments. And things aren’t slowing down  
anytime soon.  
Disruption will only accelerate. The quantity and diversity  
of connected devices – many of which we haven’t imagined  
yet – will explode, as will the quantity and diversity of the  
people around the world who use them. Our existing standards,  
workflows, and infrastructure won’t hold up. Today’s onslaught  
of devices is already pushing them to the breaking point. They  
can’t withstand what’s ahead.  
- The Future-Friendly manifesto  
12 ATOMIC DESIGN These are just some of the connected devices we need to worry about.  
Like it or not, this multi-device universe is our reality. It was hard  
enough to get our web pages to display consistently in a handful  
of desktop browsers, but we’re now tasked with ensuring our web  
experiences look and function beautifully on a dizzying array of  
smartphones, tablets, phablets, netbooks, notebooks, desktops, TVs,  
game consoles, and more.  
To address this reality while maintaining our sanity, it’s absolutely  
necessary for us to take a step back and break these giant  
responsibilities into smaller, more manageable chunks.  
And that’s exactly what folks are doing. The spirit of modularity  
is weaving its way into every aspect of the web creation process  
and having profound effects on organizations’ strategy, process,  
content, design, and development.  
# A manageable strategy  
Every organization is finally realizing that bulldozing their entire  
website and replacing it with a New-And-Shiny™ website every  
three to eight years isn’t \(and never was\) an optimal solution.  
CHAPTER 1 / DESIGNING SYSTEMS 13 Out with the old! In with the new! It’s certainly an attractive  
prospect. But even before the launch party confetti is swept up, the  
calls start coming in. “You moved my cheese!” cry the users, who  
spent years learning the previous interface and functionality.  
When massive redesigns launch with significant changes to the  
experience, users get knocked down what Jared Spool calls the  
“Magic Escalator of Acquired Knowledge”. Huge redesigns are a  
jolt to the system, and newly frustrated users have to spend a great  
deal of time and energy relearning the experience in order to slowly  
climb back up that escalator of acquired knowledge.  
In addition to disorienting users, these monolithic redesigns  
don’t get to the organizational root of the problem. Without  
a fundamental change in process, history is bound to repeat  
itself, and what’s New-And-Shiny™ today becomes Old-And-  
Crusty™ tomorrow. The cycle repeats itself as companies push off  
minor updates until the next big redesign, ultimately paralyzing  
themselves and frustrating users in the process.  
Thankfully, even massive organizations are taking cues from the  
smaller, leaner startup world and striving to get things out the  
door quicker. By creating minimum viable products and shipping  
often to iteratively improve the experience, organizations are able  
to better address user feedback and keep up with the ever-shifting  
web landscape.  
Moving away from Ron Popeil-esque, set-it-and-forget-it  
redesigns requires deliberate changes in organizational structure  
and workflow. Which is a heck of a lot easier said than done.  
# An iterative process  
If I had a quarter for every time I heard some stakeholder declare  
“We’re trying to be more agile,” I’d be orbiting the earth in my  
private spacecraft instead of writing this book.  
Wanting to be more agile is commendable. But agile is a loaded  
term, with big differences between capital-A Agile and lowercase-a  
agile. Capital-A Agile is a specific methodology for software  
development, equipped with a manifesto and accompanying  
frameworks like Scrum and Lean.  
14 ATOMIC DESIGN Lowercase-a agile is more of an informal desire to create an  
efficient process. This desire may certainly involve adopting general  
principles from capital-A Agile, but it may not involve adopting the  
Agile process in its entirety. Project manager Brett Harned explains\:  
We want to be more agile; we’re embracing change, continuing  
improvement, being as flexible as possible, and adapting as  
we see fit. The thing is, we won’t ever truly be Agile, as the  
Manifesto states. That’s okay, as long as we say what we will be.  
- Brett Harned  
Organizational structure, client relations, personalities, and so on  
all play major roles in determining a project’s process. The trick  
is to find the process that works best for you, your organizational  
constraints and opportunities.  
Even though it may be impossible to adopt a truly Agile process, it’s  
still a sound idea to work in cross-disciplinary teams, get into the  
final environment faster, ship early and often, and break bigger tasks  
into smaller components. In chapter 4, we’ll detail how to establish  
an effective pattern-based workflow.  
# Modularizing content\: I’m on Team Chunk  
Get your content ready to go anywhere, because it’s going to  
go everywhere.  
- For A Future-Friendly Web  
Publishing content for the Web used to be a fairly straightforward  
endeavor, as the desktop web was the only game in town. Oh, how  
things have changed. Today, our content is consumed by a whole  
slew of smartphones, dumb phones, netbooks, notebooks, tablets,  
e-readers, smartwatches, TVs, game consoles, digital signage, car  
dashboards, and more.  
To properly address this increasingly diverse and eclectic digital  
landscape, we need to dramatically overhaul our perception of  
content and the tools we use to manage it.  
CHAPTER 1 / DESIGNING SYSTEMS 15 In the future, what I believe is that we are going to have better  
content management and content publishing tools. We are  
going to have ways to take well-structured content, well-  
designed chunks of content that we can then figure out how  
we want to restructure and publish and display in a way that’s  
going to be right for the appropriate platform.  
- Karen McGrane  
Thankfully, this future is starting to take shape. Organizations are  
recognizing the need to create modularized content to better reach  
their audience wherever they may be. And content management  
systems are evolving beyond their web publishing platform roots  
into tools that can elegantly create and maintain modular content.  
While sophisticated content management systems have existed for  
years in the form of custom solutions like NPR’s COPE \(Create Once,  
Publish Everywhere\) platform, smart modular thinking is making  
its way into mainstream content management systems.  
# Classy code  
Modularity has long been a staple principle in the world of  
computer science, as we discussed earlier. While this principle  
existed long before the web was invented, it has taken some time  
for modularity to become engrained in the minds and hearts of  
web developers.  
Despite being around since 1995, JavaScript, the programming  
language of the web, first had to endure some growing pains to  
mature into the capable, respected language it is today. Now that  
JavaScript has grown up, developers can apply those tried-and-true  
computer science principles to their web development workflows.  
As a result, we’re seeing folks develop sophisticated JavaScript  
patterns and architectures.  
Applying modular programming principles to JavaScript is a bit of  
a no-brainer, since JavaScript is itself a programming language.  
But object-oriented thinking is weaving its way into other aspects  
of the web as well, including CSS, the styling language of the web.  
Methodologies like OOCSS, SMACSS, and BEM have cropped up to  
help web designers create and maintain modular CSS architectures.  
16 ATOMIC DESIGNVisually repaired  
Not only is modularity infiltrating the code side of style on the  
web, it’s revolutionizing how visual designers approach modern  
web design.  
As the number of viewports and environments proliferate, it’s  
become untenable to produce static mockups of every page of a  
web experience. As Stephen Hay quipped, presenting fully baked  
Photoshop comps “is the most effective way to show your clients  
what their website will never look like.”  
That’s not to say static design tools like Photoshop and Sketch  
aren’t important. Far from it. But it’s the way we use these  
tools that has changed dramatically. While creating hundreds  
of full-on comps isn’t realistic, these static tools excel at  
providing a playground to establish what Andy Clarke calls  
“design atmosphere”\:  
Atmosphere describes the feelings we get that are evoked  
by colour, texture and typography. You might already think  
of atmosphere in different terms. You might call it “feel”,  
“mood” or even “visual identity.” Whatever words you choose,  
the atmosphere of a design doesn’t depend on layout. It’s  
independent of arrangement and visual placement. It will be  
seen, or felt, at every screen size and on every device.  
- Andy Clarke  
Establishing design atmosphere early is critical to a project’s  
success, which is why designers have found ways to facilitate these  
important conversations without having to generate full mockups.  
Designer Samantha Warren developed design artifacts called  
style tiles, which demonstrate color, type, and texture explorations  
in a nice encapsulated one-pager. Designer Dan Mall built on  
Samantha’s idea with a concept called element collages, which  
demonstrate design atmosphere explorations in an exploded collage  
of interface elements.  
CHAPTER 1 / DESIGNING SYSTEMS 17 Style tiles, a concept created by designer Samantha Warren, allow designers to explore  
color, typography, and texture without having to develop fully realized comps.  
By breaking visual explorations into smaller chunks, designers  
save time and effort while avoiding presenting unrealistic,  
premature layouts to clients. More importantly, these approaches  
shift stakeholders away from simply reacting to a pretty picture,  
and instead facilitate crucial conversations about overall design  
direction and how they relate to the project’s goals. We’ll discuss  
these concepts in more detail in chapter 4, but suffice it to say the  
visual design workflow is changing in a big way!  
# Systematic UI design  
We’re not designing pages, we’re designing systems of  
components.  
- Stephen Hay  
What is an interface made of? What are our Lego bricks? What  
are our Subway sandwich pieces that we combine into millions of  
delicious combinations? It’s these questions that we’ve been asking  
ourselves more and more now that we’re sending our interfaces to  
more and more places.  
A few years ago Ethan Marcotte introduced us to the idea of  
responsive web design and its three core tenets\: fluid grids, flexible  
media, and CSS media queries. These three ingredients provided a  
much-needed foundation for designers to create flexible layouts  
18 ATOMIC DESIGN that smartly adapt to any screen size. Perhaps more importantly,  
responsive design helped get designers excited about creating  
thoughtful, adaptable, multi-device web experiences.  
As designers quickly discovered, creating multi-device web  
experiences involves a lot more than creating squishy pages. Each  
individual piece of an interface contains its own unique challenges  
and opportunities in order for it to look and function beautifully  
across many screen sizes and environments.  
How can we present primary navigation – typically displayed as a  
horizontal list on large screens – in a thoughtful way on smaller  
screens? How do lightboxes, breadcrumbs, and carousels translate  
to smaller viewports and alternate input types? It’s these questions  
that led me to create This Is Responsive, a showcase of responsive  
patterns that demonstrate the various ways a particular component  
could be executed in a responsive environment.  
While This Is Responsive is successful at articulating how these  
interface patterns can scale across screen sizes and environments,  
it’s still up to designers and developers to put these patterns into  
action. And as it turns out, that’s a lot of work.  
# UI frameworks, in theory and in practice  
Designers and developers are already strapped for time and  
resources, and they’re now being tasked with making interfaces  
that look and function beautifully in any environment. That’s a very  
tall order.  
This need to address growing device diversity while still  
sanely getting projects out the door has given rise to front-  
end frameworks like Foundation by Zurb and Bootstrap. These  
user interface frameworks provide designers with a collection  
of preassembled HTML patterns, CSS styles, and JavaScript to  
add functionality to interactive components like dropdowns and  
carousels. In essence, these frameworks are handy tool kits for  
quickly assembling interfaces.  
CHAPTER 1 / DESIGNING SYSTEMS 19 Bootstrap provides a collection of UI components to speed up development.  
And boy are these things popular. As I’m writing this, Bootstrap is  
the most popular repository on the code-sharing site GitHub, with  
over 77,000 stars and 30,000 forks. These frameworks’ popularity  
is a testament to the fact that designers and developers are seeking  
solid ground to stand on in this ever-complex web landscape.  
One of the most attractive aspects of these frameworks is speed.  
Frameworks like Bootstrap allow designers to get ideas off the  
ground quickly, rapidly create prototypes, and launch sites sooner.  
Because the patterns provided by a tool kit are already cross-  
browser tested, developers can spend their time on more important  
tasks rather than beating their heads against a table testing some  
archaic version of Internet Explorer. And in case designers do get  
stuck, these frameworks’ communities can provide helpful support  
and advice.  
For freelancers, this increase in speed might mean they can take  
on an extra project or three, yielding more financial stability for  
the year. And in the startup world – a place where Bootstrap is  
20 ATOMIC DESIGN omnipresent – minimum viable products can launch sooner,  
leading to faster answers regarding the products’ viability.  
So frameworks like Bootstrap are insanely popular design systems  
that provide well-tested components, resulting in consistent  
designs and faster launches. What’s not to love? Well, like most  
everything in life, there are cons right there alongside the pros.  
# Trouble in framework paradise  
When I was a kid, I’d watch sci-fi movies and TV shows with a  
strange fascination. There was one question I could never quite  
shake\: why are they all dressed the same?  
In the future, everyone dresses the same. Illustration credit\: Melissa Frost.  
I could only guess that given enough time, we solve fashion. “Say,  
these jumpsuits are pretty snazzy, and comfortable too! Let’s just  
all wear these from now on.” “Sounds good to me!”  
Of course, that’s not how human beings work. We all have different  
tastes, goals, and desires. Variety, as they say, is the spice of life,  
and fashion, music, and design reflect our diverse nature. Yet on  
the web we tend to fall into the trap of wanting everyone to do  
things the same way. “Why don’t all browsers just standardize  
on WebKit?” “Why can’t device manufacturers just use the same  
screen sizes?” “Always use jQuery!” “Never use jQuery!” “Just use  
frameworks!” “Never use frameworks!”  
CHAPTER 1 / DESIGNING SYSTEMS 21 Just like the real world, the diverse needs, goals, and desires of web  
projects lead to a myriad of different solutions. Of course, there’s a  
time and place for everything, and designers and developers need  
the discernment to know which tools to use and when.  
Front-end frameworks are tools that provide a specific solution  
and a particular look and feel. While those solutions help speed up  
development, the resulting experiences end up resembling those  
sci-fi jumpsuits. When everyone uses the same buttons, grids,  
dropdowns, and components, things naturally start to look the  
same. If Nike, Adidas, Puma, and Reebok were to redesign their  
respective sites using Bootstrap, they would look substantially  
similar. That’s certainly not what these brands are going for. Sure,  
each brand can modify and extend the default look and feel, but  
after a while customization means fighting the framework’s given  
structure, style, and functionality.  
In addition to look-alike issues, these frameworks can add  
unnecessary bloat to an experience. It’s fantastic that frameworks  
provide plenty of prebuilt components and functionality, but a large  
percentage of designers and developers won’t adopt every aspect  
of the framework. Unfortunately, users still have to download the  
framework’s unused CSS and JavaScript, resulting in slower page  
loads and frustration.  
On the flip side of that coin, frameworks might not go far  
enough, leading to developers needing to create a substantial  
amount of custom code to achieve their projects’ goals. At some  
point, a threshold is crossed where the initial benefits of using  
a framework–namely development–are outweighed by the time  
spent modifying, extending, and fixing the framework.  
And then there’s the issue with naming. Using a framework  
means subscribing to someone else’s structure, naming, and style  
conventions. Of course, it’s important to establish a useful front-  
end lexicon, but what makes sense for an organization might not  
be what comes out of a framework’s box. I, for one, would balk  
at the idea of using Bootstrap’s default component for a featured  
content area they call a “jumbotron”. How a framework’s naming  
conventions jive with an existing codebase and workflow should be  
properly discussed before jumping on board the framework train.  
22 ATOMIC DESIGN Now that we’ve put frameworks through the wringer, it’s  
important to take a step back and recognize that conceptually these  
frameworks are very much on point. It’s an excellent idea to work  
with a design tool kit that promotes consistency and speeds up  
development time. While discussing the redesign of Microsoft’s  
homepage by Austin-based web shop Paravel, developer Dave  
Rupert stressed the importance of creating and delivering a design  
system to their client. Dave wonderfully articulated that it’s not  
necessarily about using Bootstrap for every client, but rather  
creating “tiny Bootstraps for every client.”  
Responsive deliverables should look a lot like fully-functioning  
Twitter Bootstrap-style systems custom tailored for your  
clients’ needs. These living code samples are self-documenting  
style guides that extend to accommodate a client’s needs as  
well as the needs of the ever-evolving multi-device web.  
- Dave Rupert  
It’s not just about using a design system, it’s about creating  
your system.  
# Design systems save the day  
So what do robust design systems look like? What form do they  
take? How do you create, maintain, and enforce them?  
The cornerstones of good design systems are style guides, which  
document and organize design materials while providing guidelines,  
usage, and guardrails.  
As it happens, there are many flavors of style guides, including  
documentation for brand identity, writing, voice and tone, code,  
design language, and user interface patterns. This book won’t detail  
every category of style guide, but it’s important to take a look at  
each to better understand how each style guide influences the  
others, and how style guides for the web fit into a larger ecosystem.  
CHAPTER 1 / DESIGNING SYSTEMS 23Brand identity  
Brand identity guidelines define the assets and materials that make  
a company unique. Logos, typography, color palettes, messaging  
\(such as mission statements and taglines\), collateral \(such as  
business card and PowerPoint templates\), and more are aggregated  
and described in brand identity guidelines.  
West Virginia University’s brand style guide.  
It’s essential for a brand to present itself in a cohesive manner  
across an increasing number of media, channels, and touchpoints.  
How can everyone within an organization speak in one voice and  
feel part of a singular entity? How do third parties know which  
Pantone colors to use and how to correctly use the brand’s logo?  
Brand identity guidelines provide answers to these fundamental  
questions in one centralized hub.  
Historically, brand identity guidelines were contained in hard-  
cover books \(remember, those things with the pages?\), but as with  
everything else, brand style guides are making their way online.  
24 ATOMIC DESIGNDesign language  
While brand identity guidelines are fairly tactile, design language  
guidelines are a bit harder to pin down. Design language style guides  
articulate a general design direction, philosophy, and approach to  
specific projects or products.  
To present itself in a cohesive way across a growing range of  
products and media, Google developed a design language called  
material design. The material design style guide defines its  
overarching design philosophy, goals, and general principles, while  
also providing specific applications of the material design language.  
Google’s material design language.  
Design language style guides can \(and usually do\) incorporate  
aspects of other style guide categories in order to make high-level  
concepts a bit more tangible.  
Design language guidelines aren’t set in stone the way brand guidelines  
are. For example, one day Google will likely develop a new design  
language to replace material design, so while Google’s overall brand will  
remain intact, the design vocabulary around its products will change.  
CHAPTER 1 / DESIGNING SYSTEMS 25Voice and tone  
People interact with brands across a huge array of channels and  
media. In addition to the digital media we’ve discussed so far,  
brands also operate in print, retail, outdoor, radio, TV, and other  
channels. When a brand must communicate across so many varied  
touchpoints, speaking in a unified, consistent manner becomes  
critical to a brand’s success.  
A brand’s voice stays the same from day to day, but its tone has  
to change all the time, depending on both the situation and the  
reader’s feelings.  
- Kate Kiefer Lee  
Voice is an elemental aspect of a brand’s identity, so typically brand  
identity guidelines include some reference to the brand’s voice.  
However, these guidelines usually aren’t very nuanced, which is  
why voice and tone guidelines are so important.  
MailChimp’s Voice and Tone guidelines  
Voice and tone guidelines get into the weeds by articulating how  
the company’s voice and tone should shift across a variety of  
scenarios. MailChimp’s brilliant voice and tone guidelines define  
26 ATOMIC DESIGN how the brand’s tone changes across content types, so that when a  
user’s credit card is declined, writers know to shift away from their  
generally cheeky and playful tone of voice and adopt a more serious  
tone instead.  
# Writing  
The rise of the web and content-managed websites makes it  
easier than ever for many people within an organization to  
publish content. This, of course, can be a double-edged sword, as  
maintaining a consistent writing style for an organization with  
many voices can be challenging. Writing style guides provide every  
author some guidelines and guardrails for contributing content.  
Writing style guides can be extremely granular, defining particulars  
around punctuation and grammar, but they don’t always have to  
be so detailed. Dalhousie University’s writing style guide provides a  
concise list of principles and best practices for content contributors  
to follow.

CHAPTER 1 / DESIGNING SYSTEMS 27Code style guides  
It’s essential for teams to write legible, scalable, maintainable  
code. But without a way to promote and enforce code consistency,  
it’s easy for things to fall apart and leave every developer to fend  
for themselves.  
Code style guides provide conventions, patterns, and examples  
for how teams should approach their code. These guidelines and  
guardrails help rein in the madness so that teams can focus on  
producing great work together rather than refactoring a bunch of  
sloppy, inconsistent code.  
GitHub’s code style guide provides best practices for writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby  
within their organization.  
28 ATOMIC DESIGN Pattern Libraries  
And now for the main event. Pattern libraries, also known as front-  
end style guides, UI libraries, or component libraries, are quickly  
becoming a cornerstone of modern interface design.  
Code for America’s pattern library  
The rest of this book will concentrate on how to approach interface  
design in a systematic manner, and detail how to establish and  
maintain pattern libraries.  
# Style guide benefits  
Getting UIs to work across a myriad of screen sizes, devices,  
browsers, and environments is a tall order in and of itself. But  
once you factor in other team members, clients, stakeholders, and  
organizational quirks, things start looking downright intimidating.  
Style guides are important tools that help prevent chaos, both  
from a design and development standpoint and also from an  
organizational perspective. Here’s why style guides are now  
essential tools for modern web design and development.  
CHAPTER 1 / DESIGNING SYSTEMS 29Consistently awesome  
Web style guides promote consistency and cohesion across a user  
interface. This consistency benefits both the people who create  
these interfaces and also their users.  
I recently visited my health insurance provider’s website to pay  
my bill. In the course of five clicks, I was hit with four distinct  
interface designs, some of which looked like they were last touched  
in 1999. This inconsistent experience put the burden on me, the  
user, to figure out what went where and how to interpret disparate  
interface elements. By the time I got to the payment form, I felt like  
I couldn’t trust the company to successfully and securely process  
my payment.  
Style guides help iron out these inconsistencies by encouraging  
reuse of interface elements. Designers and developers can refer  
back to existing patterns to ensure the work they’re producing is  
consistent with what’s already been established.  
Even third parties responsible for matching their UIs with the  
look and feel of a company’s internal UIs can make great use of a  
style guide. Externally hosted experiences like payment portals or  
localized sites can better match the look and feel of the primary  
experience by applying the styles defined in the guide.  
Making style guides central to your process results in user  
interfaces that feel more united and trustworthy, which helps  
users accomplish their tasks faster and empowers them to master  
the interface.  
# A shared vocabulary  
What does “utility toolbar” mean? Does everyone understand what  
a “touch slider hero” is?  
As the number of people working on a project increases, it becomes  
all too easy for communication breakdowns to occur. It’s not  
uncommon for different disciplines to have different names for the  
same module, and for individuals to go rogue and invent their own  
naming conventions. For true collaboration to occur, it’s essential  
for teams to speak a common language. Style guides are there to  
help establish that shared vocabulary.  
30 ATOMIC DESIGN Giving names to patterns like ‘Blocks Three-Up’ in Starbucks’ style guide helps team members  
speak the same language.  
Style guides establish a consistent, shared vocabulary between  
everyone involved in a project, encouraging collaboration between  
disciplines and reducing communication breakdowns.  
# Education  
In her book Front-End Style Guides, Anna Debenham deftly explains  
the many advantages of creating style guides, including one of the  
most crucial benefits\: education.  
Education is as important as documentation. A style guide can  
show clients that websites are systems rather than collections  
of pages.  
- Anna Debenham  
Style guides demonstrate to clients, stakeholders, and other  
disciplines that there’s a lot of really thoughtful work going into  
a website’s design and development beyond just “Hey, let’s make  
a new website.” A pattern library communicates the design  
language in a very tangible way, which helps stakeholders  
understand that an underlying system is determining the  
final interface.  
Style guides can help alleviate what I call special snowflake syndrome,  
where certain departments in an organization think that they  
have unique problems and therefore demand unique solutions.  
By exposing the design system in the form of a style guide,  
these special snowflakes can better appreciate consistency and  
understand why their requests for custom designs receive pushback.  
CHAPTER 1 / DESIGNING SYSTEMS 31An empathetic workflow  
Education isn’t just important for clients and stakeholders. A good  
style guide helps inform designers and developers of the tools they  
have in their toolbox, and provides rules and best practices for how  
to use them properly.  
By making a style guide a cornerstone of your workflow \(which we’ll  
detail in chapter 4\), designers and developers are forced to think  
about how their decisions affect the broader design system. It  
becomes harder to go rogue and easier to think of the greater good.  
And this is exactly where you want team members to be.  
A style guide provides a home for each discipline to contribute their  
respective considerations and concerns for patterns. By collecting  
all these considerations under one roof, the style guide becomes a  
hub for everyone involved in the project, which helps each discipline  
better understand the design system from many perspectives.  
# Testing, testing, 1-2-3  
The homepage is broken, you say? Well, what exactly is breaking it?  
The ability to pull an interface apart into its component pieces  
makes testing a lot easier. A style guide allows you to view interface  
patterns in isolation, allowing developers to zero in on what’s  
causing errors, browser inconsistencies, or performance issues.  
# Speed  
Earlier in the chapter we discussed how faster design and development  
is one of the main reasons why UI frameworks like Bootstrap are so  
popular. We’re under pressure to get projects out the door as soon as  
humanly possible. By developing your own design system, you can  
reap those same speed rewards as the out-of-the-box UI tool kits.  
It’s true that devising an interface design system and creating a  
custom pattern library initially takes a lot of time, thought, and  
32 ATOMIC DESIGN effort. But once the pattern library is established, subsequent  
design and development becomes much faster, which tends to make  
everybody happy.  
Federico Holgado, lead UX developer at MailChimp, explained how  
MailChimp’s pattern library initially consisted of patterns created  
from the four primary screens of their app. But once they moved  
on to other areas of the site, they realized they were able to use  
existing patterns rather than having to generate brand new patterns  
from scratch every time.  
…Once we did that, as we were implementing things in other  
pages we started to realize\: man, this system will actually work  
here and this system will actually work here and here.  
- Federico Holgado  
# In it for the long haul  
There’s no doubt style guides help teams effectively get things done  
in the here and now. But much like a fine wine, style guides increase  
in value over time. The beautiful thing about interface design  
systems is that they can and should be modified, extended, and  
refined for years to come.  
As previously mentioned, creating a custom pattern library requires  
a lot of hard work up front, but that hard work should provide a  
structural foundation for future iteration and refinement. Lessons  
learned from analytics, user testing, A/B testing, and experience  
should be incorporated into the style guide, making it a powerful  
hub for truth, knowledge, and best practices.  
Better yet, even if you were to undertake a major redesign you’ll  
find that many of the structural interface building blocks will  
remain the same. You’ll still have forms, buttons, headings,  
other common interface patterns, so there’s no need to throw the  
baby out with the bath water. A style guide provides a rock-solid  
foundation for all future work, even if that future work may look  
totally different.  
CHAPTER 1 / DESIGNING SYSTEMS 33 Style guide challenges  
By now the benefits of creating design systems should be  
abundantly clear, and hopefully visions of sugar plums and  
beautiful style guides are dancing through your head. But to reach  
style guide nirvana, you must first overcome the many treacherous  
challenges that come with the territory.  
# The hard sell  
To benefit from style guides, organizations must first appropriate  
the necessary time and budget to make them happen. That requires  
organizations to overcome the short-term mentality that all too  
often creeps its way into company culture.  
The long-term benefits that style guides provide are obvious to  
those who are already thinking about the long game. The challenge,  
therefore, becomes convincing those stuck in a short-term,  
quarter-by-quarter mindset that establishing a thoughtful design  
system is a smart investment in the future.  
# A matter of time  
The hard part is building the machine that builds the product.  
- Dennis Crowley  
Perhaps the biggest, most unavoidable challenge is that style guides  
are time-consuming to create. I don’t know about you, but I don’t  
go into work every day twiddling my thumbs wondering what to do  
with my time. I’ve never met a person who isn’t feeling pressure to  
get work out the door, and this pressure naturally leads to focusing  
on the primary web project. Unfortunately, aggressive timelines and  
finite budgets detract from the effort required to make style guides  
happen, even when teams are committed to the cause.  
34 ATOMIC DESIGNAuxiliary Projects  
Pattern libraries are often treated as auxiliary projects, rather than  
as the component parts of the final product. By treating pattern  
libraries as something separate from the core project, they tend to  
fall into the nice to have category and become first on the chopping  
block when the going gets tough.  
This auxiliary project conundrum reminds me of sentiments I often  
hear around factoring accessibility into projects. They say, “Oh,  
we wish we had the time and budget for accessibility, but…” The  
notion that accessibility \(and other principles like performance  
and responsiveness\) is a costly extra line item is a fallacy. Pattern  
libraries, like accessibility, are good ideas to bake into your  
workflow whether or not the project plan explicitly calls for them.  
# Maintenance and governance  
Even if time and money are allocated to establish style guides, these  
valuable tools often die on the vine if they’re not given the focus  
they need to reach their true potential.  
A maintenance and governance strategy is critical to style guides’  
success. Style guides will be thrown in the trash \(right beside  
all those PSDs and wireframes\) and abandoned without a proper  
strategy in place for who will manage, maintain, and enforce them.  
Style guide maintenance is a hugely important topic and deserves  
to be covered in detail, so we’ll dive into how to create maintainable  
style guides in chapter 5.  
# Audience confusion  
Style guides can be misunderstood as tools useful only to  
designers or developers, which leads to a lack of visibility that  
immediately limits their effectiveness. Instead of serving as a  
watering hole for everyone in the organization, a style guide can  
become a best-kept secret guarded by one discipline. Color me  
naive, but I don’t think this helps foster a culture of collaboration.  
Without thinking of broader audiences, style guides may come  
across as too vague or too technical, which can intimidate other  
disciplines and lead them to believe these resources aren’t for them.  
CHAPTER 1 / DESIGNING SYSTEMS 35Style guide structure  
For style guides to be useful resources for everyone in an  
organization, they should clearly convey what they are and why  
they matter. Style guides should be attractive, inviting, visible,  
clear, and easy to use. As mentioned above, they should be aware  
that a whole host of audiences will be viewing them, so should  
therefore aim to be welcoming and useful for as many people  
as possible.  
Yelp’s style guide homepage sports a handsome design and important intro text explaining the  
purpose and audience for the guide.  
# Lack of context  
Context is key to understanding a design system. Unfortunately,  
most pattern libraries out in the wild don’t provide any hints as  
to when, how, and where their components get used. Without  
providing context, designers and developers don’t know how global  
a particular pattern is, and as a result wouldn’t know which pages  
of their app would need to be revisited, QA’d, and tested if changes  
were made.  
36 ATOMIC DESIGN ‘Highlight Block’ looks useful, but where is this pattern being used?  
# Lacking a clear methodology  
As much as I adore the pattern libraries out there, I can’t help but  
notice a lack of structure in many of them. Don’t get me wrong, I  
think it’s absolutely fantastic that teams are thinking systematically  
and are documenting their UI patterns. But I often feel like many  
pattern libraries are little more than loosely arranged sprays of  
modules. I think there’s room for improvement.  
# In search of an interface design methodology  
For us to create experiences for this eclectic web landscape, we  
must evolve beyond the page metaphor that’s been with us since  
the birth of the web. Thankfully, organizations are embracing  
modularity across every aspect of the web creation process, which is  
leading to smarter work and more sustainable systems.  
As the number of devices, browsers, and environments continues  
to increase at a staggering rate, the need to create thoughtful,  
deliberate interface design systems is becoming more apparent  
than ever.  
Enter atomic design.

38 ATOMIC DESIGN My search for a methodology to craft interface design systems led  
me to look for inspiration in other fields and industries. Given this  
amazingly complex world we’ve created, it seemed only natural that  
other fields would have tackled similar problems we could learn from  
and appropriate. As it turns out, loads of other fields such as industrial  
design and architecture have developed smart modular systems for  
manufacturing immensely complex objects like airplanes, ships, and  
skyscrapers.  
But my original explorations kept creeping back to the natural world,  
which triggered memories of sitting at a rickety desk in my high  
school’s chemistry lab.  
# Taking cues from chemistry  
My high school chemistry class was taught by a no-nonsense Vietnam  
vet with an extraordinarily impressive mustache. Mr. Rae’s class had a  
reputation for being one of the hardest classes in school, largely because  
of an assignment that required students to balance hundreds upon  
hundreds of chemical equations contained in a massive worksheet.  
If you’re like me, you may need a bit of a refresher to recall what a  
chemical equation looks like, so here you go\:  
An example of a chemical equation showing hydrogen and oxygen atoms combining together to  
form a water molecule.  
CHAPTER 2 / ATOMIC DESIGN METHODOLOGY 39 Chemical reactions are represented by chemical equations, which  
often show how atomic elements combine together to form  
molecules. In the example above, we see how hydrogen and oxygen  
combine together to form water molecules.  
In the natural world, atomic elements combine together to  
form molecules. These molecules can combine further to form  
relatively complex organisms. To expound a bit further\:  
ɕ Atoms are the basic building blocks of all matter. Each chemical  
element has distinct properties, and they can’t be broken down  
further without losing their meaning. \(Yes, it’s true atoms  
are composed of even smaller bits like protons, electrons, and  
neutrons, but atoms are the smallest functional unit.\)  
ɕ Molecules are groups of two or more atoms held together by  
chemical bonds. These combinations of atoms take on their own  
unique properties, and become more tangible and operational  
than atoms.  
ɕ Organisms are assemblies of molecules functioning together  
as a unit. These relatively complex structures can range  
from single-celled organisms all the way up to incredibly  
sophisticated organisms like human beings.  
Of course, I’m simplifying the incredibly rich composition of the  
universe, but the basic gist remains\: atoms combine together to  
form molecules, which further combine to form organisms. This  
atomic theory means that all matter in the known universe can be  
broken down into a finite set of atomic elements\:  
The periodic table of chemical elements.  
40 ATOMIC DESIGN Apparently Mr. Rae’s strategy of having students mind-numbingly  
balance tons of chemical equations worked, because I’m coming  
back to it all these years later for inspiration on how to approach  
interface design.  
# The atomic design methodology  
By now you may be wondering why we’re talking about atomic  
theory, and maybe you’re even a bit angry at me for forcing you to  
relive memories of high school chemistry class. But this is going  
somewhere, I promise.  
We discussed earlier how all matter in the universe can be broken  
down into a finite set of atomic elements. As it happens, our  
interfaces can be broken down into a similar finite set of elements.  
Josh Duck’s Periodic Table of HTML Elements beautifully articulates  
how all of our websites, apps, intranets, hoobadyboops, and  
whatevers are all composed of the same HTML elements.  
The periodic table of HTML elements by Josh Duck.  
CHAPTER 2 / ATOMIC DESIGN METHODOLOGY 41 Because we’re starting with a similar finite set of building blocks,  
we can apply that same process that happens in the natural world to  
design and develop our user interfaces.  
Enter atomic design.  
Atomic design is a methodology composed of five distinct stages  
working together to create interface design systems in a more  
deliberate and hierarchical manner. The five stages of atomic  
design are\:  
1\. Atoms  
2\. Molecules  
3\. Organisms  
4\. Templates  
5\. Pages  
Atomic design is atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages concurrently working together  
to create effective interface design systems.  
Atomic design is not a linear process, but rather a mental model  
to help us think of our user interfaces as both a cohesive whole and  
a collection of parts at the same time. Each of the five stages plays a  
key role in the hierarchy of our interface design systems. Let’s dive  
into each stage in a bit more detail.  
42 ATOMIC DESIGN Atoms  
If atoms are the basic building blocks of matter, then the atoms  
of our interfaces serve as the foundational building blocks that  
comprise all our user interfaces. These atoms include basic HTML  
elements like form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that can’t be  
broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.  
Atoms include basic HTML tags like  
inputs, labels, and buttons.  
Each atom in the natural world has its own unique properties.  
A hydrogen atom contains one electron, while a helium atom  
contains two. These intrinsic chemical properties have profound  
effects on their application \(for example, the Hindenburg explosion  
was so catastrophic because the airship was filled with extremely  
flammable hydrogen gas versus inert helium gas\). In the same  
42 https\://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element  
CHAPTER 2 / ATOMIC DESIGN METHODOLOGY 43 manner, each interface atom has its own unique properties, such  
as the dimensions of a hero image, or the font size of a primary  
heading. These innate properties influence how each atom should  
be applied to the broader user interface system.  
In the context of a pattern library, atoms demonstrate all your base  
styles at a glance, which can be a helpful reference to keep coming  
back to as you develop and maintain your design system. But like  
atoms in the natural world, interface atoms don’t exist in a vacuum  
and only really come to life with application.  
# Molecules  
In chemistry, molecules are groups of atoms bonded together that  
take on distinct new properties. For instance, water molecules and  
hydrogen peroxide molecules have their own unique properties and  
behave quite differently, even though they’re made up of the same  
atomic elements \(hydrogen and oxygen\).  
In interfaces, molecules are relatively simple groups of UI  
elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form  
label, search input, and button can join together to create a search  
form molecule.  
44 ATOMIC DESIGN A search form molecule is composed of a label atom, input  
atom, and button atom.  
When combined, these abstract atoms suddenly have purpose. The  
label atom now defines the input atom. Clicking the button atom  
now submits the form. The result is a simple, portable, reusable  
component that can be dropped in anywhere search functionality  
is needed.  
Now, assembling elements into simple functioning groups is  
something we’ve always done to construct user interfaces. But  
dedicating a stage in the atomic design methodology to these  
relatively simple components affords us a few key insights.  
Creating simple components helps UI designers and developers  
adhere to the single responsibility principle, an age-old computer  
science precept that encourages a “do one thing and do it well”  
mentality. Burdening a single pattern with too much complexity  
makes software unwieldy. Therefore, creating simple UI molecules  
makes testing easier, encourages reusability, and promotes  
consistency throughout the interface.  
Now we have simple, functional, reusable components that we can  
put into a broader context. Enter organisms!  
CHAPTER 2 / ATOMIC DESIGN METHODOLOGY 45 Organisms  
Organisms are relatively complex UI components composed of  
groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. These  
organisms form distinct sections of an interface.  
Let’s revisit our search form molecule. A search form can often  
be found in the header of many web experiences, so let’s put that  
search form molecule into the context of a header organism.  
This header organism is composed of a search form molecule, logo atom, and primary  
navigation molecule.  
The header forms a standalone section of an interface, even though  
it contains several smaller pieces of interface with their own unique  
properties and functionality.  
Organisms can consist of similar or different molecule types. A  
header organism might consist of dissimilar elements such as a logo  
image, primary navigation list, and search form. We see these types  
of organisms on almost every website we visit.  
46 ATOMIC DESIGN Organisms like website headers consist of smaller molecules like primary navigation, search forms,  
utility navigation, and logos.  
While some organisms might consist of different types of  
molecules, other organisms might consist of the same molecule  
repeated over and over again. For instance, visit a category page of  
almost any e-commerce website and you’ll see a listing of products  
displayed in some form of grid.  
Building up from molecules to more elaborate organisms provides  
designers and developers with an important sense of context.  
Organisms demonstrate those smaller, simpler components in  
action and serve as distinct patterns that can be used again and  
again. The product grid organism can be employed anywhere a  
group of products needs to be displayed, from category listings to  
search results to related products.  
Now that we have organisms defined in our design system, we can  
break our chemistry analogy and apply all these components to  
something that resembles a web page!  
CHAPTER 2 / ATOMIC DESIGN METHODOLOGY 47 A product grid organism on Gap’s e-commerce website consists of the same product item molecule  
repeated again and again.  
# Templates  
48 ATOMIC DESIGN Now, friends, it’s time to say goodbye to our chemistry analogy.  
The language of atoms, molecules, and organisms carries with it a  
helpful hierarchy for us to deliberately construct the components  
of our design systems. But ultimately we must step into language  
that is more appropriate for our final output and makes more sense  
to our clients, bosses, and colleagues. Trying to carry the chemistry  
analogy too far might confuse your stakeholders and cause them to  
think you’re a bit crazy. Trust me.  
Templates are page-level objects that place components into a  
layout and articulate the design’s underlying content structure.  
To build on our previous example, we can take the header organism  
and apply it to a homepage template.  
The homepage template consists of organisms and molecules applied to a layout.  
This homepage template displays all the necessary page  
components functioning together, which provides context for  
these relatively abstract molecules and organisms. When crafting  
an effective design system, it’s critical to demonstrate how  
components look and function together in the context of a layout to  
CHAPTER 2 / ATOMIC DESIGN METHODOLOGY 49 prove the parts add up to a well-functioning whole. We’ll discuss this  
more in a bit.  
Another important characteristic of templates is that they focus  
on the page’s underlying content structure rather than the page’s  
final content. Design systems must account for the dynamic nature  
of content, so it’s very helpful to articulate important properties of  
components like image sizes and character lengths for headings and  
text passages.  
Mark Boulton discusses the importance of defining the underlying  
content structure of a page\:  
You can create good experiences without knowing the content.  
What you can’t do is create good experiences without knowing  
your content structure. What is your content made from, not  
what your content is.  
- Mark Boulton  
By defining a page’s skeleton we’re able to create a system that can  
account for a variety of dynamic content, all while providing needed  
guardrails for the types of content that populate certain design  
patterns. For example, the homepage template for Time Inc. shows  
a few key components in action while also demonstrating content  
structure regarding image sizes and character lengths\:  
50 ATOMIC DESIGN Time Inc.’s homepage template demonstrates the content’s underlying structure.  
Now that we’ve established our pages’ skeletal system, let’s put  
some meat on them bones!  
CHAPTER 2 / ATOMIC DESIGN METHODOLOGY 51 Pages  
Pages are specific instances of templates that show what a UI  
looks like with real representative content in place. Building on  
our previous example, we can take the homepage template and pour  
representative text, images, and media into the template to show  
real content in action.  
The page stage is the most concrete stage of atomic design, and it’s  
important for some rather obvious reasons. After all, this is what  
users will see and interact with when they visit your experience.  
This is what your stakeholders will sign off. And this is where you  
see all those components coming together to form a beautiful and  
functional user interface. Exciting!  
52 ATOMIC DESIGN The page stage replaces placeholder content with real representative content to bring the design  
system to life.  
In addition to demonstrating the final interface as your users will  
see it, pages are essential for testing the effectiveness of the  
underlying design system. It is at the page stage that we’re able  
to take a look at how all those patterns hold up when real content  
is applied to the design system. Does everything look great and  
function as it should? If the answer is no, then we can loop back and  
modify our molecules, organisms, and templates to better address  
our content’s needs.  
When we pour real representative content into Time Inc.’s  
homepage template, we’re able to see how all those underlying  
design patterns hold up.  
CHAPTER 2 / ATOMIC DESIGN METHODOLOGY 53 At the page stage, we’re able to see what Time Inc.’s homepage looks like with real representative  
content in place. With actual content in place, we’re able to see if the UI components making up  
the page properly serve the content being poured into them.  
We must create systems that establish reusable design patterns and  
also accurately reflect the reality of the content we’re putting inside  
of those patterns.  
54 ATOMIC DESIGN Pages also provide a place to articulate variations in templates,  
which is crucial for establishing robust and reliant design systems.  
Here are just a few examples of template variations\:  
ɕ A user has one item in their shopping cart and another user has  
ten items in their cart.  
ɕ A web app’s dashboard typically shows recent activity, but that  
section is suppressed for first-time users.  
ɕ One article headline might be 40 characters long, while another  
article headline might be 340 characters long.  
ɕ Users with administrative privileges might see additional  
buttons and options on their dashboard compared to users who  
aren’t admins.  
In all of these examples, the underlying templates are the same,  
but the user interfaces change to reflect the dynamic nature of the  
content. These variations directly influence how the underlying  
molecules, organisms, and templates are constructed. Therefore,  
creating pages that account for these variations helps us create  
more resilient design systems.  
So that’s atomic design! These five distinct stages concurrently  
work together to produce effective user interface design systems.  
To sum up atomic design in a nutshell\:  
ɕ Atoms are UI elements that can’t be broken down any further  
and serve as the elemental building blocks of an interface.  
ɕ Molecules are collections of atoms that form relatively simple  
UI components.  
ɕ Organisms are relatively complex components that form  
discrete sections of an interface.  
ɕ Templates place components within a layout and demonstrate  
the design’s underlying content structure.  
ɕ Pages apply real content to templates and articulate variations  
to demonstrate the final UI and test the resilience of the  
design system.  
CHAPTER 2 / ATOMIC DESIGN METHODOLOGY 55 Advantages of atomic design  
So why go through all this rigamarole? What’s atomic design good for?  
These are valid questions, considering we’ve been building user  
interfaces for a long time now without having an explicit five-stage  
methodology in place. But atomic design provides us with a few key  
insights that help us create more effective, deliberate UI design systems.  
# The part and the whole  
One of the biggest advantages atomic design provides is the ability to  
quickly shift between abstract and concrete. We can simultaneously  
see our interfaces broken down to their atomic elements and also see  
how those elements combine together to form our final experiences.  
Atomic design allows designers to traverse between abstract and concrete.  
In his book The Shape of Design, Frank Chimero beautifully articulates  
the power this traversal provides\:  
The painter, when at a distance from the easel, can assess and  
analyze the whole of the work from this vantage. He scrutinizes  
and listens, chooses the next stroke to make, then approaches the  
canvas to do it. Then, he steps back again to see what he’s done  
in relation to the whole. It is a dance of switching contexts, a  
pitter-patter pacing across the studio floor that produces a tight  
feedback loop between mark-making and mark-assessing.  
- Frank Chimero  
56 ATOMIC DESIGN Atomic design lets us dance between contexts like the painter Frank  
so eloquently describes. The atoms, molecules, and organisms that  
comprise our interfaces do not live in a vacuum. And our interfaces’  
templates and pages are indeed composed of smaller parts. The  
parts of our designs influence the whole, and the whole influences  
the parts. The two are intertwined, and atomic design embraces  
this fact.  
When designers and developers are crafting a particular component,  
we are like the painter at the canvas creating detailed strokes. When  
we are viewing those components in the context of a layout with  
real representative content in place, we are like the painter several  
feet back from the canvas assessing how their detailed strokes affect  
the whole composition. It’s necessary to zero in on one particular  
component to ensure it is functional, usable, and beautiful. But it’s  
also necessary to ensure that component is functional, usable, and  
beautiful in the context of the final UI.  
Atomic design provides us a structure to navigate between the parts  
and the whole of our UIs, which is why it’s crucial to reiterate that  
atomic design is not a linear process. It would be foolish to design  
buttons and other elements in isolation, then cross our fingers  
and hope everything comes together to form a cohesive whole. So  
don’t interpret the five stages of atomic design as “Step 1\: atoms;  
Step 2\: molecules; Step 3\: organisms; Step 4\: templates; Step 5\:  
pages.” Instead, think of the stages of atomic design as a mental  
model that allows us to concurrently create final UIs and their  
underlying design systems.  
# Clean separation between structure and content  
Discussing design and content is a bit like discussing the chicken and  
the egg. Mark Boulton explains\:  
Content needs to be structured and structuring alters your  
content, designing alters content. It’s not ‘content then design’,  
or ‘content or design’. It’s ‘content and design’.  
- Mark Boulton  
CHAPTER 2 / ATOMIC DESIGN METHODOLOGY 57 A well-crafted design system caters to the content that lives inside  
it, and well-crafted content is aware of how it’s presented in the  
context of a UI. The interface patterns we establish must accurately  
reflect the nature of the text, images, and other content that live  
inside them. Similarly, our content should be aware of the manner  
in which it will be presented. The close relationship between content  
and design requires us to consider both as we construct our UIs.  
Atomic design gives us a language for discussing the structure of  
our UI patterns and also the content that goes inside those patterns.  
While there is a clean separation between the content structure  
skeleton \(templates\) and the final content \(pages\), atomic design  
recognizes the two very much influence each other. For instance,  
take the following example\:  
On the left we see the UI’s content skeleton, which consists of the  
same person block molecule repeated again and again. On the right  
we see what happens when we populate each instance of the person  
block molecule with representative content. Visualizing the content  
skeleton and the representative final content allows us to create  
patterns that accurately reflect the content that lives inside them. If  
a person’s name were to wrap onto five lines within the pattern, we  
would need to address that broken behavior at a more atomic level.  
58 ATOMIC DESIGN The content we pour into our UIs at the page stage will influence the  
characteristics and parameters of the underlying design patterns.  
# What’s in a name?  
Throughout this book I’ve mentioned that modular design and  
development is nothing new. So why are we introducing terms like  
atoms, molecules, and organisms when we can just stick with established  
terms like modules, components, elements, sections, and regions?  
For as long as I’ve been talking about atomic design, I’ve had people  
proffer alternate names for the stages of the methodology. Person  
One would suggest, “Why not just name them elements, modules,  
and components?” while Person Two would suggest, “Why not just  
name them base, components, and modules?” The issue with terms  
like components and modules is that a sense of hierarchy can’t be  
deduced from the names alone. Atoms, molecules, and organisms  
imply a hierarchy that anyone with a basic knowledge of chemistry  
can hopefully wrap their head around.  
That being said, naming things is hard and imperfect. The names I’ve  
chosen for the stages of atomic design have worked really well for me  
and the teams I’ve worked with as we create UI design systems. But  
maybe they don’t work for you and your organization. That’s more  
than OK. Here’s one perspective from the design team at GE\:  
As we showed our initial design system concepts that used the  
Atomic Design taxonomy to our colleagues, we were met with the  
some confused looks. \[…\] The evidence was clear, for this to be  
successful within our organization we had to make the taxonomy  
more approachable.  
- Jeff Crossman, GE Design  
The taxonomy the team landed on were “Principles”, “Basics”,  
“Components”, “Templates”, “Features”, and “Applications”. Do  
these labels make sense to you? It doesn’t matter. By establishing  
a taxonomy that made sense for their organization, everyone was  
able to get on board with atomic design principles and do effective  
work together.  
CHAPTER 2 / ATOMIC DESIGN METHODOLOGY 59 “Atomic design” as a buzzword encapsulates the concepts of  
modular design and development, which becomes a useful  
shorthand for convincing stakeholders and talking with colleagues.  
But atomic design is not rigid dogma. Ultimately, whatever  
taxonomy you choose to work with should help you and your  
organization communicate more effectively in order to craft an  
amazing UI design system.  
# Atomic design is for user interfaces  
Atomic design is a concept born of the web. After all, your lowly  
author is a web designer, which is mainly the reason this book  
primarily focuses on web-based interfaces. But it’s important to  
understand that atomic design applies to all user interfaces, not  
just web-based ones.  
You can apply the atomic design methodology to the user interface  
of any software\: Microsoft Word, Keynote, Photoshop, your bank’s  
ATM, whatever. To demonstrate, let’s apply atomic design to the  
native mobile app Instagram.  
Atomic design applied to the native mobile app Instagram.  
60 ATOMIC DESIGN Let’s walk through this atomized Instagram interface\:  
ɕ Atoms\: This screen of Instagram’s UI consists of a handful  
of icons, some text-level elements, and two image types\: the  
primary image and the user’s avatar image.  
ɕ Molecules\: Several icons form simple utilitarian components  
like the bottom navigation bar and the photo actions bar where  
users can like or comment on a photo. Also, simple combinations  
of text and/or images form relatively simple components.  
ɕ Organisms\: Here we can see the photo organism take shape,  
which consists of the user’s information, time stamp, the photo  
itself, actions around that photo, and information about the  
photo including like count and caption. This organism becomes  
the cornerstone of the entire Instagram experience as it is  
stacked repeatedly in a never-ending stream of user-generated  
photos.  
ɕ Templates\: We get to see our components come together in the  
context of a layout. Also, it’s here where we see the exposed  
content skeleton of the Instagram experience, highlighting  
dynamic content such as the user’s handle, avatar, photo, like  
count, and caption.  
ɕ Pages\: And finally we see the final product, complete with real  
content poured into it, which helps ensure the underlying design  
system comes together to form a beautiful and functional UI.  
I show this non-web example because atomic design tends to get  
misinterpreted as an approach to web-specific technologies like  
CSS and JavaScript. Let me be clear about this\: atomic design has  
nothing to do with web-specific subjects like CSS or JavaScript  
architecture. In chapter 1 we discussed the trend toward modularity  
in all aspects of design and development, which includes CSS and  
JavaScript. These are fantastic trends in CSS and JavaScript, but  
atomic design deals with crafting user interface design systems  
irrespective of the technology used to create them.  
CHAPTER 2 / ATOMIC DESIGN METHODOLOGY 61 Atomic design in theory and in practice  
This chapter introduced the atomic design methodology and  
demonstrated how atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and  
pages all work together to craft thoughtful, deliberate interface  
design systems. Atomic design allows us to see our UIs broken down  
to their atomic elements, and also allows us to simultaneously step  
through how those elements join together to form our final UIs. We  
learned about the tight bond between content and design, and how  
atomic design allows us to craft design systems that are tailored  
to the content that lives inside them. And finally we learned how  
the language of atomic design gives us a helpful shorthand for  
discussing modularity with our colleagues, and provides a much  
needed sense of hierarchy in our design systems.  
Atomic design is a helpful design and development methodology,  
but essentially it’s merely a mental model for constructing a UI. By  
now you may be wondering how you make atomic design happen.  
Well, fear not, dear reader, because the rest of the book focuses on  
tools and processes to make your atomic design dreams come true.  
62 ATOMIC DESIGN Chapter 3  
# Tools of  
# the Trade  
# Pattern Lab and the qualities of  
effective style guides In the previous chapter, I introduced the atomic design  
methodology for constructing user interfaces. I hope you’ll find  
atomic design to be a helpful mental model for constructing UI  
design systems, but now it’s time to climb down from the ivory  
tower and actually put atomic design into practice in the real world.  
The cornerstone of pattern-based design and development is the  
pattern library, which serves as a centralized hub of all the UI  
components that comprise your user interface. As we discussed in  
chapter 1, the benefits of pattern libraries are many\:  
ɕ They promote consistency and cohesion across the entire  
experience.  
ɕ They speed up your team’s workflow, saving time and money.  
ɕ They establish a more collaborative workflow between all  
disciplines involved in a project.  
ɕ They establish a shared vocabulary between everyone in an  
organization, including outside vendors.  
ɕ They provide helpful documentation to help educate  
stakeholders, colleagues, and even third parties.  
ɕ They make cross-browser/device, performance, and  
accessibility testing easier.  
ɕ They serve as a future-friendly foundation for teams to modify,  
extend, and improve on over time.  
That all sounds wonderful, right? I can almost hear you saying,  
“I need this whole pattern library thing in my life.” But how do  
we make pattern libraries happen? Well, you’ve come to the right  
place, friend, because the rest of this book is dedicated to exactly  
that. This chapter will introduce helpful tools for creating pattern  
libraries, the next chapter will discuss how to make patterns a  
cornerstone of your design and development workflow, and the fifth  
chapter will cover how to make your design system stand the test  
of time.  
This chapter will talk about the qualities of effective pattern  
libraries through the lens of a tool called Pattern Lab, an open  
source project maintained by web developers Dave Olsen,  
CHAPTER 3 / TOOLS OF THE TRADE 65 Brian Muenzenmeyer, and me to execute atomic design systems.  
While I’ll excitedly discuss Pattern Lab and its various features,  
I want to stress that the point of this chapter is to cover the  
characteristics of well-constructed pattern libraries, not sell any  
one specific tool to you. Hell, Pattern Lab isn’t even for sale! No  
single tool will be a perfect fit for every setup and scenario, but be  
sure to keep the following principles in mind when deciding what  
tools to use to create your pattern libraries.  
# Just what exactly is Pattern Lab?  
Before we dive into the nuts and bolts of how Pattern Lab works,  
it’s important to take time to explain what the tool is and isn’t.  
# Pattern Lab is...  
ɕ a static site generator tool for building atomic design systems.  
ɕ a pattern documentation and annotation tool.  
ɕ a pattern starter kit.  
# Pattern Lab isn’t...  
ɕ a UI framework like Bootstrap or Foundation.  
ɕ language-, library-, or style-dependent.  
ɕ a replacement for a content management system.  
Let’s walk through these points, starting with the term static site  
generator. Static site generator tools take in some source code  
and assets, compile them, and spit out plain ol’ HTML, CSS, and  
JavaScript at the other end. Pattern Lab takes source code –  
namely patterns – and compiles those patterns into a functional  
front-end UI inside a pattern library shell.  
So what does Pattern Lab look like out of the box? Drumroll, please.  
66 ATOMIC DESIGN One default Pattern Lab dashboard. What it lacks in good looks, it makes up for in utility.  
Not a terribly inspiring design, eh? Believe it or not, this minimal  
\(one might even say lack of\) design is deliberate. To avoid incorrect  
classification as a UI framework like Bootstrap, the design is  
deliberately stripped down so no one would mistakenly take Pattern  
Lab’s demo UI for suggested styles. Pattern Lab doesn’t give you  
any answers as to how to design or architect your front-end code  
– you have to do all that work yourself. The look and feel, naming  
conventions, syntax, structure, libraries, and scripts you choose to  
use to create your UI are entirely up to you and your team. Heck,  
you can even use UI frameworks like Bootstrap within Pattern Lab.  
Pattern Lab is just there to help stitch everything together.  
As a technical aside, Pattern Lab uses either PHP or Node.js as the  
engine that stitches patterns together and generates the pattern  
library. However, you don’t need to be a PHP wizard or Node.js  
guru to use Pattern Lab any more than you have to know how to  
build an internal combustion engine to drive a car. Moreover, your  
final website doesn’t have to be built with PHP or Node.js to use the  
tool, as Pattern Lab’s output is backend-agnostic HTML, CSS, and  
JavaScript. So like any technology decision, choose a pattern library  
CHAPTER 3 / TOOLS OF THE TRADE 67 tool that fits with your organization’s infrastructure and jives with  
how your team works together.  
If that all sounded like gibberish to you, don’t worry. This chapter  
focuses on the overarching features of Pattern Lab and principles  
of effective pattern libraries rather than going too far down the  
technical rabbit hole. If interested, you can check out Pattern Lab’s  
documentation to dive into the nitty-gritty.  
# Building atomic design systems with Pattern Lab  
To understand the core concept behind Pattern Lab, you need to  
understand Russian nesting dolls.  
Russian nesting dolls. Image credit\: S. Faric on Flickr  
Matryoshka dolls \(also known as Russian nesting dolls\) are  
beautifully carved hollow wooden dolls of increasing size that are  
placed inside one another. Patterns in Pattern Lab operate in a  
similar manner\: the smallest patterns \(atoms\) are included inside  
bigger patterns \(molecules\), which are included in even bigger  
patterns \(organisms\), which are in turn included in even bigger  
patterns \(templates\).  
68 ATOMIC DESIGN Constructing UIs in this manner keeps things DRY, which is a  
long-standing computer science principle that stands for “don’t  
repeat yourself.” What this means is that you can make a change  
to a pattern, and anywhere that pattern is employed will magically  
update with those changes. This Russian nesting doll approach  
considerably speeds up your workflow, and certainly beats the pants  
off sifting through hundreds of Photoshop documents for every  
instance of a pattern in order to make a simple change.  
To make this happen, Pattern Lab uses the include feature of  
Mustache, a logicless templating language. Here’s what a Mustache  
include looks like\:  
# \{\{\> atom-thumbnail \}\}  
This is Mustache code, in case the double curly braces \(\{\{\}\}\) that  
look like little mustaches didn’t give it away. The greater-than  
symbol \(\>\) is Mustache’s way of telling Pattern Lab to include an  
atom pattern called “thumbnail”. Pattern Lab will go searching  
through its folders of patterns to find an atom named “thumbnail”.  
This is what Pattern Lab’s patterns folder structure can look like. You can  
name and categorize these folders however you’d like, including changing  
the labels “atoms”, “molecules”, and “organisms”, “templates”, and  
”pages”. The most important consideration is to establish naming and  
categorization that is most effective for your team.  
CHAPTER 3 / TOOLS OF THE TRADE 69 Now that we know what an include looks like, let’s put it into  
practice and take a look at a few patterns from a website I helped  
make for Time Inc. Here’s one reusable pattern we designed\:  
For Time Inc.’s website, we created a basic block molecule consisting of a thumbnail image,  
headline, and excerpt.  
This pattern should look fairly familiar. A thumbnail image,  
headline, and excerpt working together as a single unit is a common  
pattern found on countless websites. Let’s take a peek behind the  
curtain to see how this pattern is constructed.  
70 ATOMIC DESIGN **\<div class="block-post"\>**  
# \<a href="\{\{ url \}\}"\>  
# \{\{\> atoms-thumb \}\}  
# \<h3\>\{\{ headline \}\}\</h3\>  
# \<p\>\{\{ excerpt \}\}\</p\>  
# \</a\>  
# \</div\>  
You can see we have\: HTML markup consisting of a wrapper div  
with a class name of block-post; a link; a Mustache include for the  
thumbnail image; an \<h3\> element for the headline; and a \<p\> tag  
for the excerpt. You’ll notice there’s more Mustache code for url,  
headline, and excerpt, which we’ll use later to dynamically swap  
in actual content. More on that in a bit.  
Now that our pattern markup is established, we can include that  
chunk of code in bigger patterns using the same include method\:  
# \{\{\> molecules-block-post \}\}  
Now let’s move up to more complex organisms like the website’s  
header, which looks a little something like this\:  
The website header consists of fairly common conventions like a logo atom, primary navigation  
molecule, and a search form molecule.  
CHAPTER 3 / TOOLS OF THE TRADE 71 When we crack open the hood to look at the header’s markup in  
Pattern Lab, we see the following\:  
# \<header role="banner"\>  
# \{\{\> atoms-logo \}\}  
# \{\{\> molecules-primary-nav \}\}  
# \{\{\> molecules-search \}\}  
# \</header\>  
What’s going on here? Well, we have a basic \<header\> element,  
and inside that element we’re including the logo image atom, the  
primary navigation molecule, and the search form molecule.  
And now we can include that relatively complex pattern anywhere  
we need it.  
# \{\{\> organisms-header \}\}  
I hope by now you can see the Russian nesting dolls in action.  
The smallest atoms are included in bigger molecules, and those  
molecules get included in even bigger organisms. Now let’s take  
these components and plug them into a layout. Take the homepage  
template, for instance\:  
72 ATOMIC DESIGN The Time Inc. homepage template consists of a few repeatable patterns\: a global  
header, a hero area, a few sections \(containing an image, headline, excerpt, and  
call to action\), an area featuring four items, a factoid area, and a global footer.  
CHAPTER 3 / TOOLS OF THE TRADE 73 Take a quick stroll through the homepage template and you’ll see  
some pretty standard patterns\: a site header at the top, a site footer  
at the bottom, and a full-screen hero area. You’ll also see a few  
other patterns repeating themselves throughout the template.  
So how does this look in code? As you might expect, it involves  
more includes!  
# \{\{\> organisms-header \}\}  
# \<main role="main"\>  
# \{\{\# hero \}\}  
# \{\{\> molecules-hero \}\}  
# \{\{/ hero \}\}  
# \<section\>  
# \{\{\# experience-block \}\}  
# \{\{\> molecules-block-main \}\}  
# \{\{/ experience-block \}\}  
# \{\{\# experience-feature \}\}  
# \{\{\> organisms-story-feature \}\}  
# \{\{/ experience-feature \}\}  
# \</section\>  
# \<section\>  
# \{\{\# factoid-advertising \}\}  
# \{\{\> organisms-factoid \}\}  
# \{\{/ factoid-advertising \}\}  
# \</section\>  
# \<section\>  
# \{\{\# advertising \}\}  
# \{\{\> molecules-block-main \}\}  
# \{\{/ advertising \}\}  
# \</section\>  
# ...  
# \</main\>  
# \{\{\> organisms-footer \}\}  
At this stage in the game the smaller patterns are already  
constructed, so all the template needs to do is pull them into the  
context of a page layout and give them unique names.  
74 ATOMIC DESIGN Taking a closer look at the code, notice that certain patterns like  
\{\{\> organisms-header \}\} and \{\{\> organisms-footer \}\} are  
included the same way as the earlier examples. But there are also a  
few other includes patterns that are supplemented by some additional  
information, like the following\:  
# \{\{\# factoid-advertising \}\}  
# \{\{\> organisms-factoid \}\}  
# \{\{/ factoid-advertising \}\}  
We’re including organisms-factoid in the same way as all the  
other patterns, but we’re also naming it factoid-advertising  
by wrapping the include in a Mustache section, indicated by the  
Mustache code containing the \# and / symbols. By giving the pattern  
instance a unique name, we can latch on to it and dynamically replace  
the content of the pattern. More on that in the next section!  
This Russian nesting doll approach to building UIs is simple  
but tremendously powerful. The structure allows designers and  
developers to keep patterns DRY, saving time, effort, and money.  
The approach allows teams to build a final UI while simultaneously  
creating the underlying UI design system. After all, the final interface  
is one instantiation of its underlying design system. Teams can  
also move between abstract and concrete, zeroing in on a particular  
pattern to fix bugs \(“The header’s broken!”\), while also seeing how  
changes to small patterns affect the overall page layout.  
# Working with dynamic data  
It’s important to articulate the underlying content structure of  
UI patterns within the context of a pattern library. That’s why  
we’ve been looking at dimension-displaying grayscale images  
and placeholder text containing character limits. But while this  
information is helpful for creative teams, grayscale images and Lorem  
ipsum text are not what users interact with on your actual site. We  
need a way to replace our dummy content with real representative  
content to ensure our UI patterns match the reality of the content  
that lives inside them.  
To demonstrate how Pattern Lab dynamically swaps in real content  
into templates, let’s take a look at a side-by-side comparison of Time  
Inc.’s homepage template and page levels\:  
CHAPTER 3 / TOOLS OF THE TRADE 75 A side-by-side comparison of Time Inc.’s homepage template and page levels. The template  
articulates the content structure of the design system, while the page shows what the system looks  
like with real content displayed by it.  
76 ATOMIC DESIGN On the left we have the template level, which articulates the content  
structure of the patterns making up the web page. And on the right  
we have the page level, where we’re pouring in real representative  
content to demonstrate what the final UI might look like and test  
the effectiveness of the design system.  
How do we swap dummy content for real content in Pattern Lab?  
Pattern Lab uses JSON \(as well as YAML, Markdown, and other  
data formats\) to define and swap out the dynamic bits of content in  
our designs.  
The default placeholder data is defined in a file called data.json that  
lives in Pattern Lab’s /source directory. Inside this file we define all  
the text, image paths, and other dynamic data that will make up our  
UI. Here’s a small sample from Time Inc.’s data.json file\:  
# "hero" \: \{  
# "headline"\: "Lorem Ipsum",  
# "img"\: \{  
# "src"\: "/images/sample/fpo\_hero.png",  
# "alt"\: "Hero Image"  
# \}  
# \}  
For developers, this type of format most likely looks familiar. If  
you’re not a developer, don’t freak out! Once you look beyond the  
curly braces and quotes, you’ll see that we’re defining a hero object  
\(for the full-bleed hero area directly below the header\) that has a  
headline value of “Lorem Ipsum”, and an img with a src value of  
“/images/sample/fpo\_hero.png”. We’re simply defining this  
object’s attributes and providing values for those attributes.  
Once those objects are defined, we can then override their  
attributes at Pattern Lab’s page level. This is accomplished by  
creating a new JSON file that matches the page pattern name  
\(for Time Inc.’s homepage, we’ll call it 00-homepage.json\) inside  
the /pages directory.  
CHAPTER 3 / TOOLS OF THE TRADE 77 Inside the ‘pages’ directory we have the homepage pattern as well as a JSON file that  
matches the name of the pattern. This is where we’ll override the default content  
with page-specific content.  
When we open up 00-homepage.json we can override the placeholder  
data we established earlier. Here’s what that might look like\:  
# "hero" \: \{  
# "headline"\: "Moving People",  
# "img"\: \{  
# "src"\: "/images/hero\_beyonce.jpg",  
# "alt"\: "Beyonce"  
# \}  
# \}  
By overriding the default data, the hero headline now reads  
“Moving People” instead of “Lorem Ipsum.” And instead of  
pointing to a grayscale for-placement-only \(FPO\) hero image,  
we’re now pointing to a picture of Beyoncé located at “/images/  
hero\_beyonce.jpg”.  
78 ATOMIC DESIGN This process of establishing defaults for dynamic data then  
replacing them with page-specific content continues for each  
section of the website. In addition to replacing simple strings like  
headings, we can also dynamically set variables to true or false,  
loop through an array of items, and more. We can even dramatically  
alter the UI with just a few changes to a JSON file, which we’ll talk  
about next.  
# Articulating pattern variations  
# with pseudo-patterns  
Historically, designers working with static tools have had a  
tendency to only design best-case scenarios. You know what I’m  
talking about\: the user’s name is Sara Smith and always fits neatly  
on one line; her profile picture looks like it was clipped out of a  
magazine; her profile is completely filled out; the two columns of  
her profile content are exactly the same height.  
Of course, these best-case scenarios rarely, if ever, occur in the  
real world.  
To create more robust and resilient designs, we need to  
concurrently account for the best situations and the worst –  
and everything in between.  
What if the user doesn’t upload a profile picture? What if the  
user has 87 items in their shopping cart? What if the product has  
14 options? What if the blog post title contains 400 characters?  
What about a returning user? A first-time user? What if the article  
doesn’t have any comments? What if it has seven layers of nested  
comments? What if we need to display an urgent message on  
the dashboard?  
Articulating these UI variations in a static design tool is an exercise  
in tediousness and redundancy, which may explain why they’re  
rarely designed. But if we want to create systems that address all  
the variables and realities of our content, we must take those ‘what  
if’ questions into account.  
How do we address all manner of UI variation without exhausting  
ourselves in the process? Pattern Lab’s pseudo-pattern feature  
CHAPTER 3 / TOOLS OF THE TRADE 79 allows us to articulate sometimes wildly different scenarios with  
just a few changes to our data.  
Let’s say we’re making an app whose dashboard displays a list of  
project collaborators. The UI might look something like this\:  
A list of project collaborators in  
our hypothetical app.  
To create the dynamic content inside each of these blocks, we’ll  
define our list of collaborators as an array inside dashboard.json\:  
# "collaborators"\: \[  
# \{  
# "img"\: "/images/sample/avatar1.jpg",  
# "name"\: "Steve Boomshakalaka",  
# "title"\: "CIA"  
# \},  
# \{  
# "img"\: "/images/sample/avatar2.jpg",  
# "name"\: "Gingersnap Jujubees-Daniels",  
# "title"\: "President of the Longest Company  
# Name in the World Corporation, Global Division"  
# \},  
# \{  
# "img"\: "/images/sample/avatar3.jpg",  
# "name"\: "Sarunus Marciulionis",  
# "title"\: "Golden State Warriors"  
# \},  
# \{  
# "img"\: "/images/sample/avatar4.jpg",  
80 ATOMIC DESIGN **"name" \: "Sara Smith",**  
# "title" \: "Short Title"  
# \}  
# \]  
By default, our design assumes the user is a regular user and not  
an administrator, but what if we wanted to give administrators the  
ability to manage project collaborators from the dashboard? That UI  
might look something like this\:  
The administrator’s dashboard  
UI introduces extra edit and  
delete actions.  
To show additional admin edit and delete actions on the dashboard  
in Pattern Lab, we can create a pseudo-pattern, a new file in the  
/pages folder that looks like this\:  
# dashboard\~admin.json  
The tilde \(\~\) symbol indicates a pseudo-pattern. dashboard\~admin.json  
will inherit all the data contained in dashboard.json, but also gives us  
the opportunity to append or override additional data. That means  
the list of collaborators we defined earlier in dashboard.json is still  
available, but we can add additional data inside dashboard\~admin.json  
like so\:  
# "isAdmin" \: true  
We’re defining a variable called isAdmin and setting it to true.  
We can now use that to conditionally include the additional actions  
inside the block pattern.  
CHAPTER 3 / TOOLS OF THE TRADE 81 **\<div class="block"\>**  
# \<img src="\{\{ img \}\}" alt="\{\{ name \}\}" /\>  
# \<h3\>\{\{ name \}\}\</h3\>  
# \<h4\>\{\{ title \}\}\</h4\>  
# \{\{\# isAdmin \}\}  
# \{\{\> molecules-block-actions \}\}  
# \{\{/ isAdmin \}\}  
# \</div\>  
The first few lines are pulling in the img, name, and title we  
defined in dashboard.json. But pay close attention to what’s wrapped  
in the isAdmin Mustache section. What we’re saying here is\: if  
isAdmin is set to true, include a molecule pattern called block-  
actions. The block-actions pattern contains the edit and delete  
buttons, and will only display if isAdmin is set to true \(or anything  
besides false\). In our default dashboard.json, isAdmin isn’t set,  
so the extra actions won’t display. In dashboard\~admin.json, we’re  
setting isAdmin to true so the extra actions will display. You  
can extend this technique to dramatically alter the entire UI \(like  
altering the primary navigation, showing additional panels on the  
dashboard, adding extra controls, and so on\) just by changing a  
single variable. Powerful stuff, indeed.  
Whew. If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You now  
know how to add and manipulate dynamic data in Pattern Lab.  
Pattern Lab’s ability to design with dynamic data provides some  
crucial benefits\:  
ɕ Creates a clear separation between structure and content. A  
pattern’s structure and its content very much influence each  
other. However, resilient design systems strive to establish  
agnostic, flexible patterns that can contain a variety of content.  
Decoupling pattern structure and data allows us to keep things  
DRY \(which, again, stands for don’t repeat yourself\) and make  
changes to content without affecting the pattern structure.  
Likewise, we’re able to make changes to a pattern without  
having to update every instance of that pattern simply because  
each instance contains different data. This separation results in  
huge savings in both time and effort.  
ɕ Establishes an ad hoc CMS. Establishing default and page-  
specific data serves as an ad hoc content management system.  
82 ATOMIC DESIGN As mentioned earlier, static design tools aren’t well equipped to  
handle dynamic data, but it’s also overkill to install WordPress,  
Drupal, or some other CMS just to demonstrate UI variations.  
Pattern Lab strikes a balance as it allows teams to work  
with dynamic data but doesn’t require setting up any crazy  
MySQL databases.  
ɕ Serves as a blueprint for back-end developers responsible for  
integrating the front-end UI into a real content management  
system. Back-end developers can look at the UI created in  
Pattern Lab, understand which bits are static and dynamic, then  
translate that into the back-end system.  
ɕ Allows writers, content people, designers, and other non-  
developers to contribute to the living, breathing design  
system. As a front-end developer, I can’t count the number of  
times I’ve had to fix typos, swap in new images, translate copy  
decks, and make other content-related edits to front-end code.  
It’s death by a million paper cuts, and I’m sure most developers  
would agree that making minor copy changes isn’t an effective  
use of their time. By separating structure and data, Pattern Lab  
enables non-developer team members to safely manage the  
content-related aspects of the design, freeing up developers to  
focus on building the design system’s structure.  
We’ve now covered Pattern Lab’s core functionality, but we’re not  
done yet! Next we’ll cover a few additional features that should  
be considered, irrespective of the tool you use to create your  
pattern library.  
# Viewport tools for flexible patterns  
The multitude of devices now accessing the web has forced  
designers to re-embrace the intrinsic fluidity of the medium.  
Thankfully, techniques like responsive web design allow us to create  
layouts that look and function beautifully on any screen.  
It’s a no-brainer that we need to establish flexible UI patterns if  
we want to create responsive designs, but creating fluid patterns  
has additional advantages. The more fluid a UI component is, the  
more resilient and versatile it becomes. Imagine being able to  
take a component – let’s say a photo gallery slider – and plunk it  
CHAPTER 3 / TOOLS OF THE TRADE 83 anywhere we need it. Sometimes we may need it to be a full-bleed  
element occupying the entire viewport. Other times we may need  
to include it in the context of an article. And still other times we  
may want to include it in the sidebar. The dream is to build our  
components fluidly and they’ll adapt their styles and functionality to  
fit whatever containers we put them into.  
Indeed, this is the promise of container queries. Container queries  
let elements adapt based on their parent containers rather than  
the entire viewport, which is how we manipulate elements using  
media queries at the moment. While still being developed as a native  
browser capability, container queries will allow us pattern-crazed  
designers and developers to easily create and deploy fluid UI systems.  
Between responsive design, container queries, and good ol’-  
fashioned common sense, we now understand why it’s imperative to  
create flexible UI patterns. But how do we do that? And how can our  
pattern library tools help us think and act flexibly?  
Many early responsive design testing tools focused on viewing  
designs on popular mobile device widths, such as 320px \(an iPhone  
4 in portrait mode\), 480px \(an iPhone 4 in landscape mode\), 768px  
\(an iPad in portrait mode\), and so on. But, of course, the web is much  
more diverse than a mobile view, a tablet view, and a desktop view.  
To help designers better consider the entire resolution spectrum  
when testing their responsive designs, I created a tool called ish.  
The tool is called ish. because selecting the small button results in  
a small-ish viewport. Selecting it again provides a different small-  
ish viewport. Selecting the medium button gives you a medium-ish  
viewport. And the large button results in a – wait for it – large-ish  
viewport. These randomized values help designers and developers  
better consider the entire resolution spectrum rather than a handful  
of popular device dimensions.  
Ish. is baked into Pattern Lab, which means we can view our UIs and  
their underlying patterns across the entire resolution spectrum.  
While ish. helps designers and developers uncover bugs along the  
viewport continuum, I’ve found it to be more helpful as a client and  
colleague education tool. By building a device-agnostic viewport  
resizing tool directly into the pattern library, clients and colleagues  
84 ATOMIC DESIGN can come to appreciate the fact that their design system should look  
and function well no matter the viewport size.

# A look under the hood with code view  
A common pattern library feature is the ability to peek under the  
hood and view the underlying code that makes up a particular  
component. Exposing a UI pattern’s code speeds up development  
time \(I love copying and pasting as much as the next coder\) and  
helps team leaders enforce code syntax and style conventions. This  
becomes especially rewarding when a ton of developers are working  
on an organization’s codebase.  
The types of code to be highlighted in a pattern library naturally  
vary from organization to organization, in order to meet the  
requirements of the vast array of environments, technologies,  
and conventions used. Most pattern libraries out there in the wild  
demonstrate a pattern’s underlying HTML, while others also  
include pattern-specific CSS and JavaScript. Salesforce’s Lightning  
design system, for example, shows a pattern’s HTML as well as all  
the \(S\)CSS pertaining to that pattern.  
86 ATOMIC DESIGN Salesforce’s Lightning design system showcases the UI components’ HTML and SCSS code.  
Including front-end code leads to authors writing it more  
consistently, but that doesn’t guarantee perfection. There’s still  
room for developers to go rogue and write sloppy, incongruent code  
– which is why some organizations have gone above and beyond  
to establish incredibly sophisticated design systems. Companies  
like Lonely Planet have achieved the holy grail of pattern libraries,  
which is to say their pattern library and production environment  
are perfectly in sync. We’ll discuss the holy grail in more detail in  
chapter 5, but it’s worth bringing up in this section to demonstrate  
how that affects the code exposed in the context of a pattern library.  
Rather than offering HTML and CSS, Lonely Planet’s Rizzo style  
guide surfaces the include code for teams to pull in the appropriate  
UI component.  
Lonely Planet’s Rizzo design system pattern library showcases the template usage.  
CHAPTER 3 / TOOLS OF THE TRADE 87 This setup allows the core development team to maintain a single  
source of truth for all patterns’ front-end code. For developers to  
get up and running, the pattern library needs only provide the code  
to include a particular pattern.  
Pattern Lab provides the ability to view both a pattern’s underlying  
HTML and the template code used to generate the HTML. It can also  
be extended to showcase accompanying CSS and JavaScript code.  
Pattern Lab’s code view demonstrates both a pattern’s template code and the compiled HTML.  
Ultimately, whichever pattern library tool you decide to use should  
have some form of code view. Perhaps more importantly, the  
pattern libraries you create should showcase the types of code  
that enable you and your development team to be as effective  
as possible.  
88 ATOMIC DESIGN Living documentation and annotations  
In a traditional siloed design process, it’s typical to see lengthy  
wireframe and spec documents created, debated, and approved.  
These documents usually take the form of gigantic PDFs, which  
is unfortunate considering they often contain all sorts of valuable  
insights, instructions, and documentation about the design system.  
Sadly, these bulky artifacts are often thrown into a \(virtual\) trash  
can by the time the project makes its way into production.  
This shouldn’t be the case. A UI’s documentation should contain  
insights from every discipline involved in creating it, and –  
this is key – should be baked into the living, breathing design  
system. Effective pattern libraries carve out a space to define and  
describe UI components, articulating considerations ranging from  
accessibility to performance to aesthetics and beyond.  
Pattern Lab provides several ways to add pattern descriptions  
and annotations to a design system. Pattern descriptions can be  
added by creating a Markdown file that corresponds to the name  
of a pattern \(e.g. pattern-name.md\), which will show the pattern  
description in the library list view.  
Pattern Lab displays important pattern documentation right alongside the living pattern examples,  
which helps teams communicate definitions, usage, examples, outside resources, and more.  
CHAPTER 3 / TOOLS OF THE TRADE 89 Pattern Lab also provides a \(dare I say\) cool feature that enables you  
to attach annotations to any UI element and view those annotations  
in the context of the living, breathing design. When annotations  
are switched on, each annotated element receives a number which,  
when clicked, jumps you to the corresponding annotation. This  
allows teams to view pattern considerations within the context of  
the full UI. Pretty neat!  
Pattern Lab’s annotation feature is interactive and baked into the living UI.  
# Providing context with pattern lineage  
When looking at various patterns in a library, I’ve found myself  
wondering, “Great, but where is this component actually used?”  
Defining and describing pattern characteristics is one thing, but  
there’s an opportunity to provide additional contextual information  
about your UI patterns.  
90 ATOMIC DESIGN Thanks to the Russian nesting doll include approach described  
earlier, Pattern Lab can display what patterns make up any given  
component, and also show where those patterns are employed in  
the design system.  
Pattern Lab’s lineage feature displays what patterns make up any component, and also shows all  
the places that component is employed.  
In the example above, we have a molecule pattern called media-  
block, which contains an image, headline, text, and a group of  
buttons. Looking at the pattern’s lineage, we can see it contains a  
pattern called atoms-square, which is the thumbnail-sized image,  
as well as molecules-button-bar, which is the group of buttons.  
We can also see where exactly this pattern gets used\: the media-  
block-list organism.  
This contextual information is amazingly helpful for designers and  
developers; I know I use the lineage feature all the time in my own  
workflow. Let’s say we wanted to make changes to a particular  
pattern, like doubling the size of an image or adding an additional  
element\: we’d immediately know which patterns and templates  
would need to be retested and QA’d to ensure nothing breaks with  
CHAPTER 3 / TOOLS OF THE TRADE 91 the changes. The lineage feature also helps point out redundant  
and underused patterns so teams can weed them out of the pattern  
library as the launch date gets closer.  
# To each their own  
So there you have it. Pattern Lab provides several helpful features  
for teams to create deliberate, thoughtful design systems. But as I  
mentioned before, no single tool is going to be perfect for everyone  
and every situation. There are a ton of great tools out there to help  
you create effective pattern libraries, and the tools you decide on  
will undoubtedly be influenced by your organization’s environment,  
technologies, workflow, and culture.  
When choosing tools to create your pattern library, you should keep  
your eyes open for these qualities and features of effective pattern  
libraries\:  
ɕ Providing pattern descriptions and annotations.  
ɕ Showcasing the relevant pattern HTML, templating, CSS, and/or  
JavaScript code.  
ɕ Viewing patterns across the entire resolution spectrum.  
ɕ The ability to showcase pattern variations, such as active or  
disabled tabs.  
ɕ The ability to dynamically add real representative content into  
the patterns’ structures.  
ɕ Providing contextual information, like which patterns make up a  
particular component, as well as where that component is used.  
At the end of the day, it’s not about the tools we use to create  
pattern libraries, but rather how we use them. Creating and  
maintaining an effective design system means dramatically  
changing your organization’s culture, processes, and workflows. If  
that sounds hard to you, it’s because it is. But fear not! The rest of  
the book will detail the entire process of creating and maintaining  
a successful design system to set your organization up for long-  
term success.  
92 ATOMIC DESIGN Chapter 4  
# The Atomic  
# Workflow  
# People, process, and making design  
systems happen Talk is cheap. And up until now, we’ve been doing a whole lotta  
talkin’. That’s not to say it hasn’t been productive talk! After all,  
we’ve discussed the importance of modular thinking, we’ve learned  
a methodology for crafting deliberate UI design systems, and we’ve  
showcased tools for creating effective pattern libraries.  
But here’s where the rubber meets the road. Where we roll up our  
sleeves and put all of this theory into practice. Where we get stuff  
done. This chapter will tackle all that goes into selling, creating, and  
maintaining effective design systems. You ready? Let’s go.  
# It’s people!  
The not-so-secret secret about creating effective design systems  
\(or doing any great work, really\)\: it all comes down to people truly  
collaborating and communicating with one another.  
If this is such common knowledge, why aren’t we constantly  
hearing thousands of success stories from around the world? I’ll let  
Mark Boulton explain\:  
The design process is weird and complicated, because people  
are weird and complicated.  
- Mark Boulton  
You can have all the right technologies in place, use the latest and  
greatest tools, and even have extraordinarily talented individuals  
on board, but if everyone involved isn’t actually cooperating and  
communicating with one another then you’re not going to create  
great work. It’s as simple as that. That’s not to say you can’t create  
good work, but more often than not you’re going to create one of the  
many disappointing shades of bad work.  
Establishing and maintaining successful interface design systems  
requires an organization-wide effort, and this chapter will discuss  
how to overcome human beings’ many quirks to make them happen.  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 95 When to establish a design system  
So when’s the best time to establish an interface design system?  
Short answer\: now.  
Design systems and their accompanying pattern libraries are  
often created in conjunction with a new design or redesign  
project, replatforming effort, or other initiative. Piggybacking off  
another project is a great way to sneak a pattern library into your  
organization.  
That being said, creating a design system and pattern library  
doesn’t necessarily need to coincide with another project. If you  
can convince your clients and stakeholders to pony up the cash and  
resources for a dedicated design system project, then good on you!  
How exactly do you sell a design system to your clients, bosses,  
colleagues, and stakeholders? Put on your business hat, because  
we’re going to tackle that in the next section!  
# Pitching patterns  
Introducing a new way of doing things is no easy task, as it requires  
changing people’s existing mentalities and behaviors. Getting  
stakeholders and clients on board with establishing a design system  
involves constant education, in addition to a bit of marketing savvy.  
First things first. It’s necessary to introduce the concept of interface  
design systems to your clients, colleagues, and stakeholders.  
Explain what these design systems are and the many ways they can  
help the organization. We’ve discussed these benefits throughout  
the book, so you can explain how design systems promote  
consistency and cohesion, speed up your team’s productivity,  
establish a more collaborative workflow, establish a shared  
vocabulary, provide helpful documentation, make testing easier,  
and serve as a future-friendly foundation. Who can say no to all  
that?!  
Alas, I’ve found that I can hype design systems until I’m blue in the  
face, but the suits don’t always see things through the same lens as  
the people on the ground. A simple reframing of the question helps  
96 ATOMIC DESIGN immensely. It’s much more effective to simply ask, “Do you like  
saving time and money? Yes or no?” If the answer to that question  
is no, I’m afraid you have way bigger problems than selling a design  
system. If the answer is yes, then you can pitch the benefits through  
the lens of time and money. Let’s try this out, shall we?  
ɕ Design systems lead to cohesive, consistent experiences. That  
means users master your UI faster, leading to more conversions  
and more money based on the metrics your stakeholders care  
about.  
ɕ Design systems speed up your team’s workflow. Rather than  
reinventing the wheel every time a new request comes through,  
teams can reuse already established UI puzzle pieces to roll out  
new pages and features faster than ever before.  
ɕ Centralizing UI components in a pattern library establishes a  
shared vocabulary for everyone in the organization, and creates a  
more collaborative workflow across all disciplines. With everyone  
speaking the same language, more time is spent getting work  
done and less time is spent dealing with superfluous back-and-  
forth communications and meetings.  
ɕ Design systems make cross-browser/device, performance, and  
accessibility testing easier, vastly speeding up production time  
and allowing teams to launch higher-quality work faster. Also,  
baking things like accessibility into a living design system scales  
those best practices, allowing your interfaces to reach more users  
while reducing the risk of you getting sued!  
ɕ Once a design system \(with accompanying pattern library\) is  
established, it serves as a future-friendly foundation for the  
organization to modify, tweak, extend, and improve on over time.  
Doing some A/B testing? Roll the lessons from those tests into the  
living design system. Made some big performance optimizations?  
Roll them into the living design system! The living part of living  
design systems means they can always adapt to meet the future  
needs of the organization, saving time and money all the while.  
Framing things in terms of time and money helps the people  
controlling the purse strings understand why a design system is a  
worthwhile pursuit. With any luck, these conversations will translate  
to a concrete commitment from the organization \(read\: allocating  
real time and money\) to make a design system happen.  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 97 Show, don’t tell\: the power of interface inventories  
If only getting buy-in were as easy as having a few well-timed  
conversations with the right people. Maybe you’re savvy enough to  
seal the deal with talking points alone, but for us mere mortals words  
aren’t enough. Sometimes you need more. Sometimes you need to  
make them feel the pain.  
Enter the interface inventory.  
Many are familiar with the concept of a content inventory. Content  
audits are usually performed in the early stages of a website redesign  
process to take stock of all a site’s content. It’s a tedious process  
involving spreadsheets and caffeine, but all that hard work pays off.  
By the end of the exercise the organization’s content is laid out on  
the table, giving teams valuable insights into how to handle their  
content as they tackle the project.  
An interface inventory is similar to a content inventory, only instead  
of sifting through and categorizing content, you’re taking stock  
of and categorizing all the components that make up your user  
interface. An interface inventory is a comprehensive collection of  
the bits and pieces that make up your user interface.  
Here’s a collection of all the unique button styles found on the homepage of United.com. An  
interface inventory rounds up and categorizes all the unique patterns that make up an interface.  
98 ATOMIC DESIGNConducting an interface audit  
How do you go about conducting an interface audit? How do you  
round up all the components that make up your UI? The simple  
answer is screenshots. Lots of them! Creating an interface inventory  
requires screenshotting and loosely categorizing all the unique  
components that make up your user interfaces. While that’s a  
relatively straightforward endeavor, there are some important  
considerations to keep in mind to make the inventory as useful  
as possible. Let’s go through the process for creating a successful  
interface inventory.  
Step 1\: Round up the troops  
I’ve encountered many ambitious designers and developers  
who have taken it upon themselves to start documenting their  
organization’s UI patterns. While I certainly applaud this individual  
ambition, it’s absolutely essential to get all members of the team  
to experience the pain of an inconsistent UI for them to start  
thinking systematically.  
For the interface inventory to be as effective as possible,  
representatives from all disciplines responsible for the success of  
the site should be in a room together for the exercise. Round up the  
troops\: UX designers, visual designers, front-end developers, back-  
end developers, copywriters, content strategists, project managers,  
business owners, QA, and any other stakeholders. The more the  
merrier! After all, one of the most crucial results of this exercise is  
to establish a shared vocabulary for everyone in the organization,  
and that requires input from the entire team.  
Step 2\: Prepare for screenshotting  
The interface inventory exercise generates a ton of screenshots,  
so naturally you’ll need software to capture and display those  
screenshots. Some possible tools include\:  
ɕ PowerPoint or Keynote  
ɕ Photoshop or Sketch  
ɕ Evernote Web Clipper  
ɕ Google Docs or Microsoft Word  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 99 It’s important for all participants to capture screenshots using the same software so they can be  
combined later. I’ve created a Google Slides interface inventory template for teams to use as a  
starting point.  
ɕ Google Slides \(If you’re interested, I’ve created a Google Slides  
interface inventory template\)  
Ultimately, it doesn’t really matter what tool you use, but everyone  
should agree on a single tool to make it easier to combine at the end  
of the exercise. I’ve found online slide-building software like Google  
Slides to be very effective as it provides a canvas for free-form image  
positioning, they’re chunked out into slides for easier categorization,  
and they’re web-based so can be shared with ease.  
Step 3\: Screenshot exercise  
Get your screenshotting fingers ready because it’s time for the  
main event! The interface audit exercise involves screenshotting  
and categorizing all the unique UI patterns that make up your  
experience. Bear in mind this exercise doesn’t mean capturing every  
instance of a particular UI pattern, but rather capturing one instance of  
each unique UI pattern.  
Assign each participant a UI category. You may need to pair people  
or have participants document multiple categories, depending on  
how many people are taking part in the exercise. Once again, it’s  
helpful to have as many participants as possible since more people  
screenshotting will result in more thorough documentation.  
100 ATOMIC DESIGN What patterns to capture  
What interface element categories should be captured? Obviously,  
the categories are going to vary from interface to interface, but here  
are a few categories to start with\:  
ɕ Global elements\: components like headers, footers, and other  
global elements that are shared across the entire experience.  
ɕ Navigation\: primary navigation, footer navigation, pagination,  
breadcrumbs, interactive component controls, and essentially  
anything that’s used to navigate around a user interface.  
ɕ Image types\: logos, hero images, avatars, thumbnails,  
backgrounds, and any other type of image pattern that shows up  
in the UI.  
ɕ Icons\: icons are a special type of image worthy of their own  
category. Capture magnifying glasses, social icons, arrows,  
hamburgers, spinners, favicons, and every other interface icon.  
ɕ Forms\: inputs, text areas, select menus, checkboxes, switches,  
radio buttons, sliders, and other forms of user input.  
ɕ Buttons\: buttons are the quintessential UI element. Capture all  
the unique button patterns found throughout the experience\:  
primary, secondary, big, small, disabled, active, loading, and  
even buttons that look like text links.  
ɕ Headings\: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 and variations of typographic  
headings.  
ɕ Blocks\: also known as touts, callouts, summaries, ads, or hero  
units, blocks are collections of typographic headings and/or  
images and/or summary text \(see Nicole Sullivan’s write-up  
about the media object as an example of a block\).  
ɕ Lists\: unordered, ordered, definition, bulleted, numbered,  
lined, striped, or any group of elements presented in a list-type  
format.  
ɕ Interactive components\: accordions, tabs, carousels, and other  
functional modules with moving parts.  
ɕ Media\: video players, audio players and other rich media  
elements.  
ɕ Third-party components\: widgets, iframes, stock tickers, social  
buttons, invisible tracking scripts, and anything else that isn’t  
hosted on your domain.  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 101 ɕ Advertising\: all ad formats and dimensions.  
ɕ Messaging\: alerts, success, errors, warnings, validation, loaders,  
popups, tooltips, and so on. This can be a challenging category  
to capture as messaging often requires user action to expose.  
ɕ Colors\: capture all unique colors presented in the interface. This  
category can be aided by fantastic style guide bootstrapping  
tools like CSS Stats and Stylify Me.  
ɕ Animation\: animation is an elemental aspect of user interfaces,  
and should therefore be documented. This requires using screen  
recording software such as QuickTime to capture any UI element  
that moves, fades, shakes, transitions, or shimmies across the  
screen.  
An example of unique button patterns captured in an interface inventory for a major bank’s website.  
Again, these categories aren’t set in stone and will vary based on  
the nature of the user interface you’re dealing with. Of course, it’s  
important to add, subtract, or modify these categories to best fit  
your organizational needs.  
102 ATOMIC DESIGN An example of various form elements captured in an interface inventory for a major bank’s website.  
Timing is everything  
It’s important to set time limits on the screenshotting exercise to  
avoid going down a rabbit hole that ends up lasting all day. The  
amount of time you allocate will vary depending on how many  
people are participating, but I find between 30 and 90 minutes to be  
sufficient for a first pass of an interface inventory. Set a timer, throw  
on some Jeopardy! music \(well, maybe not Jeopardy! music, but some  
other music that sets an upbeat mood for the exercise\), and have the  
participants concentrate on screenshotting the unique UI patterns  
they encounter.  
Dig deep  
Which parts of the site should participants capture in the interface  
inventory? Short answer\: everything. Any piece of UI that is or could  
be managed by your organization should be documented.  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 103 This is difficult as organizations tend to favor certain parts of the  
experience \(cough homepage cough\) over others. For example,  
people working on an e-commerce website tend to focus on the  
core shopping experience, even though areas like customer support,  
FAQs, sizing charts, 404 pages, and legal terms are also extremely  
important to the user experience. Remember, users perceive your  
brand as a singular entity and don’t care about your organizational  
structure, tech stack, or anything else that might cause disparities  
in the UI. Encourage interface audit participants to be as thorough  
as possible during the exercise.  
Step 4\: Present findings  
The screenshotting exercise can be a bit overwhelming, so be sure  
the team takes a break after the exercise is complete. Get some food,  
grab some coffee, and stretch your legs for a bit. Once everyone’s  
feeling refreshed, it’s time to discuss what you captured.  
Have each participant spend five or ten minutes presenting each UI  
category to the group. Here’s where the fun begins. Presenting to  
the group allows the team to discuss the rationale behind existing  
UI patterns, kick-starts a conversation about naming conventions,  
and gets the team excited to establish a more consistent interface.  
Naming things is hard. It’s fascinating to hear the inconsistent  
names designers, developers, product owners, and other  
stakeholders all have for the same UI pattern. “Oh, we call that  
the utility bar.” “Oh, we call it the admin nav.” “Oh, we call it the  
floating action area!” This exercise is an opportunity to unearth  
and iron out disparities between pattern labels, and also establish  
names for previously unlabeled patterns. Don’t feel like you need  
to come to a consensus on patterns’ final names in the course of  
ten minutes; this exercise is simply meant to open up a broader  
discussion.  
Once every category has been presented and discussed, all the  
participants should send their slides to the exercise leader. The  
leader will then combine everything into one giant über-document,  
which will soon become a wrecking ball of truth and justice.  
104 ATOMIC DESIGN Step 5\: Regroup and establish next steps  
With the über-document in hand, it’s time to get the entire  
organization on board with crafting an interface design system.  
Have you ever wanted to see a CEO cry? Laying bare all your UI’s  
inconsistencies is a great way to make that happen! One of the  
most powerful benefits of interface inventories is that you can  
show them to anyone, including non-designers and developers,  
and they’ll understand why inconsistent UIs are problematic.  
You don’t need to be a designer to recognize that having 37 unique  
button styles probably isn’t a good idea. Here’s your opportunity  
to make it crystal clear to stakeholders that approaching your UI in  
a more systematic way makes great sense for both your users and  
your organization.  
In addition to selling the idea to key stakeholders, all the hard  
work and discussion that went into the initial interface inventory  
exercise should be translated into the seeds of your future design  
system and pattern library.  
It’s very likely the initial exercise didn’t capture every unique  
UI pattern, so you may need to conduct another interface audit  
exercise to capture a more complete picture of your UI patterns.  
This may involve a large group again, but in reality a smaller,  
cross-disciplinary team will be going through the über-document  
and establishing next steps for the design system.  
Once the gaps in the interface inventory have been filled, the  
working group can have some important conversations about next  
steps for the design system project. Some key questions for this  
group to cover include\:  
ɕ Which patterns should stay, which should go, and which can be  
merged together?  
ɕ What pattern names should we settle on?  
ɕ What are the next steps to translate the interface inventory into  
a living pattern library?  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 105Benefits of an interface inventory  
Creating an interface inventory can be quite an undertaking, but the  
benefits of making one are many\:  
ɕ Captures all patterns and their inconsistencies\: an interface  
inventory rounds up all the unique patterns that make up your UI.  
Seeing all those similar, but still different, patterns next to each  
other exposes redundancy and underscores the need to create a  
consistent, cohesive experience.  
ɕ Gets organizational buy-in\: having a large, diverse group of  
disciplines participate in the exercise helps everyone understand  
the value of creating and maintaining a consistent user  
interface. Also, the interface inventory über-document can be a  
tremendously powerful tool for convincing stakeholders, bosses,  
and clients to invest in an interface design system.  
ɕ Establishes a scope of work\: an interface inventory helps design  
teams determine the level of effort required to design and build  
each UI pattern as part of a design or redesign project. Which  
components will be relatively easy or difficult to convert into  
a responsive environment? What are the content, design, and  
development considerations around each component? An interface  
inventory enables teams to have important conversations that  
help establish a project’s realistic scope and timeline.  
ɕ Lays the groundwork to a sound interface design system\: the  
interface inventory is an important first step for setting up a  
comprehensive pattern library. It’s essential to capture all existing  
UI patterns to determine which patterns will make the final cut in  
the living design system. The interface audit exercise also helps  
teams establish a shared vocabulary, which will be crucial for the  
success of the eventual design system.  
# Ask forgiveness, not permission  
So you’ve discussed the benefits of establishing a living design  
system with your stakeholders, and you’ve even created an interface  
inventory to show them the inconsistent train wreck that is the  
current UI. And yet, despite all your efforts, they still shoot down the  
106 ATOMIC DESIGN sound idea of establishing an interface design system and pattern  
library. What’s a responsible web team to do?  
Do it anyways.  
Just how we build things like performance, accessibility, and  
responsiveness into our products and process by default, we should  
also create design systems by default. You don’t need to get the  
client’s blessing to follow your craft’s best practices. When you give  
stakeholders the option to say no to something, they will. So simply  
don’t give them that opportunity. Our job is to create great work  
for our clients and organizations, and interface design systems  
are a means to that end.  
In fact, to create the whole, you need to create the parts of that  
whole. Our interfaces consist of smaller pieces, whether you pay  
those smaller pieces any mind or not.  
You have a decision to make\: focus solely on creating the whole  
while ignoring the parts, or spend some time organizing the parts  
to help you more efficiently create the whole. In his book Multiscreen  
UX Design, Wolfram Nagel wonderfully articulates these approaches  
using Lego bricks as an analogy.  
One way to approach a Lego project is to simply dump the pieces  
out of the box onto a table, roll up your sleeves, then start building  
your creation.  
One way to approach a Lego project is to simply dump the pieces out onto a table, and rummage  
through the pile to find the pieces you need. Image adapted from "Multiscreen UX Design" by  
Wolfram Nagel.  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 107 This approach to a Lego project is certainly a viable strategy, even if  
it is unapologetically haphazard. The only time you’d pay attention  
to the pile of bricks is when you’re sifting through it to find the  
specific piece you need.  
This is not dissimilar to how many digital projects are approached.  
The client needs a website, so we jump in to designing and building  
it. The client needs a mobile app, so we immediately start building  
the screens of the app. Our gaze remains transfixed on the final  
product, and we rarely, if ever, glance at the underlying patterns that  
comprise our final UIs.  
Of course, there is another way to approach your Lego and digital  
projects. Rather than diving headfirst into constructing the final  
work, you can take the time to take stock of the available pieces and  
organize them in such a way that they become more useful.  
Taking the time to organize the pieces that make up your final creations allows you to approach the  
work in a more deliberate and efficient manner. Image adapted from "Multiscreen UX Design" by  
Wolfram Nagel.  
No doubt organizing takes time, planning, and effort. It doesn’t  
come for free. The fact that this configuring isn’t visibly represented  
in the final product may tempt us to say it serves as a distraction to  
the real work that needs to be done. Why bother?  
By taking the time to organize the parts, you can now create  
the whole in a more realistic, deliberate, and efficient manner.  
Creating a library of your available materials allows you to approach  
the project in a more methodical way, and saves immense amounts  
of time in the process. Rather than rummaging through a haphazard  
108 ATOMIC DESIGN pile of bricks and burning time reinventing patterns, you can create  
an organized system of components that will help produce better  
work in a shorter amount of time.  
Taking the time to organize the pieces that make up your final creations allows you to work in  
a more deliberate and efficient manner. Rather than sifting through a haphazard pile of bricks,  
an organized inventory of components can produce better, faster work. Image adapted from  
"Multiscreen UX Design" by Wolfram Nagel.  
As far as your clients and stakeholders are concerned, the final  
product is still being produced. So long as you’re showing progress  
on the final work, you can decide how much of your internal process  
you’re willing to expose. The fact that you’re creating a design  
system to produce the final product is really of no concern to them;  
it’s simply a decision your team is making to create better work.  
If you’re dealing with change-averse stakeholders, I say do  
what you need to do and tell them to pay no attention to what’s  
happening behind the scenes. Once you’ve successfully launched the  
project and the champagne has been poured, you can pull back the  
curtain and say, “Oh, by the way, we established a design system  
and pattern library so the team could collaborate and work more  
efficiently together.” It would be extremely difficult for them to  
argue against you now, especially if the project came in on time and  
on budget. If you’re really lucky, you can parlay the initial project’s  
success into a more official initiative within the organization to  
evolve your design system.  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 109 Of course, it’s preferable to get your clients, colleagues, and  
stakeholders excited about creating an interface design system, or  
at the very least get their blessing to pursue the project in a modular  
fashion. But I think it’s important to find ways to follow your craft’s  
best practices even when you’re faced with extreme organizational  
resistance.  
# \(Re\)setting expectations  
You’ve put in a lot of hard work to sell the concept of a design  
system, but you still need to set stakeholder and team expectations  
before you roll up your sleeves and get to work.  
When I say “set expectations” I’m really saying “reset expectations.”  
You see, we all bring our own experiences, opinions, and biases  
to a project. Our industry is still incredibly young, so many people  
working on web projects are coming from other industries with  
their own established Ways Of Doing Things™. Even people who  
have worked exclusively in the digital world have felt the baggage of  
industries past. Moreover, the guiding principles, best practices, and  
tactics of digital design are still very much being codified.  
It’s ludicrous for anyone to utter the phrase, “This is how we’ve  
always done things” in an industry that’s only 25 years old.  
Unfortunately, we humans are creatures of habit, and stepping  
outside familiarity’s warm embrace is uncomfortable. We don’t like  
being uncomfortable. We must overcome our existing predispositions  
if we’re going to embrace our ever-shifting industry’s best practices  
and create successful digital work.  
# Redefining design  
We’ve come a long way from simply transplanting print PDFs to the  
World Wide Web, but print design still casts a long shadow and  
continues to influence how things get done online.  
Design in the print world focuses heavily on visual aesthetics. After  
all, you can’t do much more with a poster than look at it. To be clear,  
I’m certainly not implying print design is easy or one-dimensional;  
the world of print is steeped in nuance and craft. What I am saying  
is that the bidirectional and interactive nature of the web adds  
many more dimensions to what constitutes good design. Speed,  
110 ATOMIC DESIGN screen size, environment, technological capabilities, form-factor,  
ergonomics, usability, accessibility, context, and user preferences  
must be considered if we want to create great work for this brave  
new digital world.  
These additional design considerations are vital for creating great  
digital work, yet they are too often absent from our processes and  
workflows. Designer Dan Mall explains\:  
As an industry, we sell websites like paintings. Instead, we  
should be selling beautiful and easy access to content, agnostic  
of device, screen size, or context.  
- Dan Mall  
How did we get to the point where we sell and design websites  
like they’re static images? During the formative years of the web  
we created experiences meant to be consumed solely by desktop  
computers, which is understandable since desktops were really the  
only game in town. The real estate provided by desktop screens  
made the idea of simply translating a PDF onto the web feasible and  
enticing. So that’s what we did – and for a while it actually worked!  
Once upon a time, the web was primarily consumed on desktop screens, hence this crusty-looking,  
old machine.  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 111 However, this didn’t come without consequences. This print-like  
perspective of the web reinforced the notion that web designs, like  
their offline counterparts, could and should look the same in every  
environment. It also kept the focus on how a web design looked  
rather than how it worked, ignoring all the unique characteristics of  
this rich new medium. Moreover, it strengthened the belief that we  
could apply the same linear processes used to create print work to  
our digital work.  
Time went by, of course, and mobile exploded, technology  
improved, and the web become the incredibly large and diverse  
landscape we know today. Gone are the desktop-only days of yore,  
and in their place is a time of smartphones, dumb phones, tablets,  
phablets, netbooks, notebooks, e-readers, wearables, TVs, game  
consoles, car dashboards, and so much more.  
This is the web\: a potpourri of devices, screen sizes, capabilities, form factors, network speeds,  
input types, and more.  
The diversity of today’s web landscape has shattered the consensual  
hallucination of the desktop web, where we could simply bolt on  
the mentalities and processes of print to this new medium. Simply  
112 ATOMIC DESIGN looking at a smartphone, tablet, and desktop machine next to one  
another quickly erodes the assumption that a web design should  
look the same in every environment.  
We’re still at the very beginning of the Big Bang of connected  
devices. The device and web landscape of tomorrow will  
undoubtedly be even bigger and diverse than today’s. In addition  
to current devices and the nascent technologies already on the  
horizon, the future web will involve technologies and ideas that  
haven’t yet been conceived.  
In addition to all the web-capable devices we concern ourselves with today, we must understand  
that the device and web landscape is becoming bigger and more diverse all the time.  
I’ve found the three previous images to be a tremendously helpful  
shorthand for helping clients, colleagues, and stakeholders  
understand the reality of the web landscape. With this newfound  
understanding, everyone becomes a whole lot more receptive to  
updating their processes and workflows to create great work for this  
unique medium.  
It’s our job to create great experiences for people using a diversity  
of devices, screen sizes, network speeds, device capabilities,  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 113 browser features, input types, form factors, contexts, and  
preferences. That’s undoubtedly a Herculean task, but all these  
variables really underscore the need to extend far beyond visual  
aesthetics when creating interface design systems.  
In addition to making visually beautiful and consistent experiences,  
we should\:  
ɕ Embrace the ubiquity of the web by creating accessible, resilient  
design systems. Recognize that a whole slew of people with a  
vast spectrum of capabilities will be accessing our experiences,  
so construct design systems to be as inclusive as possible.  
ɕ Create flexible layouts and components so our interfaces look  
and function beautifully irrespective of any particular device  
dimension or screen size.  
ɕ Treat performance as an essential design principle and create  
fast-loading experiences that respect users and their time.  
ɕ Progressively enhance our interfaces by establishing core  
experiences then layering on enhancements to take advantage of  
the unique capabilities of modern devices and browsers.  
ɕ Create future-friendly design systems meant to stand the test  
of time and anticipate inevitable changes to the device and web  
landscape.  
Of course, there are many other design considerations that should  
be included in our interface design systems \(ergonomics, input  
type, Section 508 compliance, legibility, and so on\), but the key  
takeaway here is to expand the definition of what constitutes good  
digital design beyond visual aesthetics.  
As you might expect, substantial changes to our processes need to  
happen so we can properly address all these uniquely digital design  
considerations. It therefore becomes our responsibility to set client,  
colleague, and stakeholder expectations so that everyone knows the  
process for creating will be different this time around.  
# Death to the waterfall  
Tell me if you’ve heard this one before. A team is tasked with  
making a website. Once the kick-off meeting dust has settled, a UX  
114 ATOMIC DESIGN designer goes away, puts their head down, and eventually emerges  
with a giant PDF document detailing the entire experience. This  
monolithic wireframe document gets passed around to the project  
stakeholders, who sign it off after some feedback and suggestions.  
The UX designer then passes the wireframes to the visual designer,  
who hops into Photoshop or Sketch to apply color, typography,  
and texture to the structured-but-sterile wireframes. In the design  
review meeting, stakeholders sit eagerly while the projector fires up  
and the project manager runs off to print copies of the design deck  
for everyone. The art director takes their position at the front of the  
room and unveils the design. Behold, a website design! Once the  
presentation is finished, the room quickly buzzes with feedback and  
conversation. After the initial reactions and compliments die down,  
a key stakeholder speaks up.  
“This looks fantastic, and I think really hits the mark for what we’re  
trying to accomplish with this project. But…”  
They express their desire to see something perhaps with an  
alternate layout, something that captures a certain vibe, maybe  
something that uses different photography, something that just…  
pops.  
With the floodgates opened, the other stakeholders suddenly  
realize they too have opinions and constructive criticism they’d  
like to share. By the time the meeting draws to a close, everyone  
has rambled off their wish list of what they’d like the design to  
accomplish.  
Slightly deflated but determined to nail it, the visual designer  
retreats back to their tools to work in the stakeholders’ suggestions.  
At the next design review meeting, the same scene repeats itself,  
with stakeholders expressing equal parts encouragement and  
longing for more. “I feel like we’re almost there. Could we just…”  
Weeks pass and seasons change. Nerves wear thin, and the deadline  
date looms over everyone’s heads. It’s with a sense of urgency that  
homepage\_v9\_final\_for-review\_FINAL\_bradEdits\_for-handoff.psd  
finally gets approval by the stakeholders.  
The visual designer, relieved they’ve finally completed their job,  
tiptoes oh-so-quietly up to the entrance of the Code Cave. They slip  
the approved design under the door, and as they scamper away they  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 115 yell, “Can you get this done in three weeks? We’re already behind  
schedule and we’re out of budget!”  
The visual designer has already disappeared into the night by the  
time the front-end developer picks the design off the floor. With one  
glance at the composition, a strange feeling – some combination of  
bewilderment, rage, and dread – washes over them. What’s wrong  
with the design, exactly? Maybe it’s the seven typefaces and nine  
unique button styles peppered throughout the comps. Maybe it’s the  
desktop-centric, impossible-to-actually-execute layout. Maybe it’s  
the perfect-yet-improbable user-generated content.  
The front-end developer tries in vain to raise their concerns to the  
broader group, but is quickly dismissed as being either inept or  
curmudgeonly. Alas, it’s too late in the game to make significant  
changes to the design, especially since it’s already been approved by  
the stakeholders.  
So the developer tries their best to make lemonade out of the lemony  
static comps. They bend over backwards to create responsive layouts  
that still retain the integrity of the static comps, normalize some  
of the more blatant component inconsistencies, establish pattern  
states \(like button hover, active, and disabled states\) that weren’t  
articulated in the designs, and make some on-the-fly decisions  
regarding the interactive aspects of the experience. Discussions with  
designers are strained, but everyone realizes that they need to work  
through these issues to get the project done.  
After plugging the front-end code into a CMS, frantically finalizing  
the site’s content, and doing some last-minute QA testing, the team  
finally launches the site. While no one says it out loud, there’s a tinge  
of disappointment in the air alongside the joy and relief of getting  
the project out the door. After all, the live site lacks the glossy polish  
that the comps promised to the stakeholders, and friction between  
disciplines has bruised some relationships.  
I hope this story reads as a work of fiction to you, but based on  
my own experiences and conversations with countless others, I’m  
guessing you’ve experienced this tale of woe at one point or another.  
It may even hit home like a punch in the gut. Whether you’ve  
endured this process firsthand or not, it’s important to recognize  
that the Henry Ford-esque waterfall process increasingly isn’t likely  
to result in great digital work.  
116 ATOMIC DESIGN The waterfall process, where disciplines pass off work to each other in sequential order, isn’t likely  
to result in great digital work.  
The waterfall process may make sense for print, architecture,  
manufacturing, and other physical media since mistakes and  
changes are extraordinarily costly. If a team overlooks an error  
made early in the process, they’ll pay dearly for it later. However,  
the digital world isn’t constrained by the same limitations as the  
physical one. Pixels are cheap. Changes can happen in an instant,  
hypotheses can be quickly tested out, and designs and code can be  
iterated on again and again.  
The waterfall process hinges on the premise that work must flow  
in a sequential order\: the UX designer’s work must be completed  
before visual design can start; the visual designer must finish their  
job before front-end development can begin. This simply isn’t true.  
There is much work that can and should happen in parallel. To  
create sound UI design systems, we must reset our stakeholders’  
expectations and get them comfortable with a blurrier, more  
collaborative process.  
That work will happen in parallel doesn’t imply that everyone will  
be guns blazing throughout the entire process. Of course, the bulk  
of research, information architecture, and other elemental aspects  
of UX design will tend to happen earlier in the process, but that  
work shouldn’t delay the other disciplines from starting their jobs.  
And even when the bulk of a person’s active work is done, they  
should never simply fade away from the project. It’s crucial for  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 117 every discipline to continue to consult with the others to ensure  
their vision makes it into the final product. So rather than a rigid,  
sequential waterfall process, a more collaborative process over time  
looks something like this\:  
A more collaborative workflow involves a cross-disciplinary team working together throughout the  
entire process. While active work will wax and wane, each discipline continues to consult with the  
other team members to ensure their insights are present in the final work.  
# Development is design  
When a previous employer discovered I wrote HTML, CSS, and  
presentational JavaScript, they moved me to sit with the engineers  
and back-end developers. Before too long I was being asked, “Hey,  
Brad. How long is that middleware going to take to build?” and  
“Can you normalize this database real quick?”  
Here’s the thing\: I’ve never had a computer science class in my  
life, and I spent my high school career hanging out in the art room.  
Suffice it to say those requests made me extremely uncomfortable.  
There’s a fundamental misunderstanding that all coding is ultra-  
geeky programming, which simply isn’t the case. HTML is not a  
programming language. CSS is not a programming language. But  
because HTML and CSS are still code, front-end development is  
118 ATOMIC DESIGN often put in the same bucket as Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, C++, and  
other programming languages. This misunderstanding tends to  
give many front-end developers, myself included, a severe identity  
crisis.  
Organizationally, there is often a massive divide between designers  
and developers \(or marketing and IT, or creative and engineering,  
or some other divisive labels\). Designers and developers often sit on  
different floors, in different buildings altogether, in different cities,  
and sometimes even in different countries on different continents.  
While some of this organizational separation may be justified,  
creating a division between designers and front-end developers is  
an absolutely terrible idea.  
The fact remains that HTML, CSS, and presentational JavaScript  
build user interfaces – yes, the same user interfaces that those  
designers are meticulously crafting in tools like Photoshop and  
Sketch. For teams to build successful user interface design systems  
together, it’s crucial to treat front-end development as a core part  
of the design process.  
When you show stakeholders only static pictures of websites, they  
can naturally only comment and sign off on pictures of websites.  
This sets the wrong expectations. But by getting the design into  
the browser as fast as possible, you confront stakeholders with the  
realities of the final medium much sooner in the process. Working  
in HTML, CSS, and presentational JavaScript allows teams to not  
only create aesthetically beautiful designs, but demonstrates those  
uniquely digital design considerations like\:  
ɕ flexibility  
ɕ impact of the network  
ɕ interaction  
ɕ motion  
ɕ ergonomics  
ɕ color and text rendering  
ɕ pixel density  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 119 ɕ scrolling performance  
ɕ device and browser quirks  
ɕ user preferences  
Crucially, jumping into the browser faster also kick-starts the  
creation of the patterns that will make up the living, breathing  
design system. More on this in a bit.  
This is not to say teams must design entirely in the browser. As  
with anything, it’s about using the right tools at the right time to  
articulate the right things. Having the design represented in the  
browser in addition to other design artifacts gives teams the ability  
to paint a richer, more realistic picture of the UI they’re crafting.  
Teams may demonstrate an aesthetically focused design idea as a  
static image, and simultaneously demonstrate a working prototype  
of that same idea in the browser.  
An iterative iterative iterative iterative process  
I believe a successful digital design process is quite similar to  
subtractive stone sculpture. At the beginning of the sculpting  
process, the artist and their patron have a general idea of what’s  
being created, but that vision won’t be fully realized until the  
sculpture is complete.  
The sculptor starts with a giant slab of rock and starts chipping  
away. A crude shape begins to form after the first pass, and the  
shape becomes more pronounced with every subsequent pass. After  
a few rounds of whacking away at the rock, it becomes clear that the  
sculptor’s subject is a human form.  
With the general shape of the sculpture roughed out, the artist then  
begins homing in on specific sections of the piece. For instance,  
they may begin with the face, moving up close to carve the shape  
of the eyes, nose, and mouth. After several passes, they then  
move on to the arms, and then begin detailing the legs. At regular  
intervals the artist steps back to see how their detailed work affects  
the overall sculpture. This process continues until the sculpture is  
complete and everyone is pleased with the results.  
Again, I think subtractive stone sculpture is a great analogy for a  
successful digital process, although unlike sculpture we have the  
power of undo!  
120 ATOMIC DESIGN An iterative digital process is similar to subtractive stone sculpture, where fidelity is built up over  
many iterations. Image credit\: Mike Beauregard on Flickr  
It’s essential to get stakeholders comfortable with reviewing  
works in progress rather than fully baked designs and code. As I  
mentioned in chapter 1, every organization these days wants to  
become more agile, and iteration is a key part of being agile. It’s  
more important to make steps in the right direction than exhaust  
a ton of effort painting unrealistic pictures of what you want  
the final piece to be. A sound design system doesn’t roll off an  
assembly line, but is rather sculpted in iterative loops, building up  
fidelity as the project progresses.  
If this all sounds a bit messy, that’s because it is! To the dismay  
of some project managers, the design process doesn’t fit neatly  
into the rigid borders of Excel spreadsheets and Gantt charts. True  
collaboration between disciplines is fuzzy and chaotic, and that’s  
not a bad thing. Constant communication, tight feedback loops,  
and true collaboration therefore become the glue that holds  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 121 the process together. Get your entire team to commit to honest  
conversation and genuine collaboration, and the details of your  
process will fall into place.  
Are everyone’s expectations properly set? Good! Now let’s roll up  
our sleeves and get to work establishing our design system.  
# Establishing direction  
Teams are often eager to jump right into fun high-fidelity design  
and development work, and clients are eager to see and react to that  
detailed work. However, this leads to distractions, assumptions, and  
all the aforementioned misguided expectations. It’s essential to  
agree on an overall design direction and paint the broad strokes  
first before moving into high-fidelity design and development. This  
requires restraint and expectation management, but results in more  
focused decision-making and more realistic work.  
What does this lo-fi work look like? Let’s take a look at some  
techniques UX designers, visual designers, and front-end  
developers can use to begin crafting a strong overall direction  
for a UI design system.  
# Establishing content and display patterns  
There’s a ton of up-front strategic and research work that can  
and should happen toward the beginning of a project. UX designers  
\(known by other monikers such as information designers, information  
architects, interaction designers, and so on\) are responsible for  
synthesizing all that vital information and translating it into a user  
interface that meets the project’s business and user goals.  
In a traditional waterfall process, many UX designers have gone  
about this task by generating high-fidelity wireframes that  
document every screen of the entire user experience. These  
wireframe documents, stuffed to the gills with black rectangles  
and annotations, spec out the details of what the interface will  
accomplish, and are used to get stakeholder buy-in. As thorough  
as these documents tend to be, they don’t paint the full picture  
and often make dangerous assumptions about visual layout and  
technical functionality.  
122 ATOMIC DESIGN Rather than jumping straight into such high-fidelity documents,  
it’s better to start with lo-fi sketches that establish what appears  
on a particular screen and in what general order. Establishing the  
experience’s basic information architecture can be accomplished  
with a simple bulleted list and a conversation. For a project I did for  
the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, I started by stubbing  
out the basic information architecture for a page on a site.  
Basic HTML wireframes for the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank homepage.  
No one in their right mind would mistake this blocked out grayscale  
page as complete, but it provides more than enough information  
to have important conversations about the page structure and  
hierarchy.  
Making lo-fi wireframes mobile-first means using the constraints  
of small screens to force the team to focus on the core content and  
hierarchy. You can now ask, “Do we have the right things on this  
screen?” “Are they in the right general order?”  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 123 These blocky grayscale wireframes help establish the necessary  
content patterns for the screen, but UX designers can also articulate  
some site-wide UI patterns they anticipate using to ultimately  
display those content patterns. For the redesign of TechCrunch,  
designer Jennifer Brook defined a few site-wide UI patterns that  
could be used anywhere\:  
For the TechCrunch website redesign, Jennifer Brook defined site-wide, gestural display patterns,  
which don’t make assumptions about aesthetics or functionality.  
From the image above, you can gather that the “featured island”  
component will show content in some fashion. Note the gestural  
nature of this sketch and how it doesn’t make any specific  
assumptions about layout or functionality. The details of how this  
pattern will look and function will come later, but at the beginning  
of the project it’s useful simply to define it and articulate where it  
might get used.  
As I’ve discovered from subsequent projects, content and display  
patterns can be effectively communicated in an even simpler format\:  
the lowly spreadsheet.  
124 ATOMIC DESIGN A simple spreadsheet can articulate what content and display patterns go on a given page while  
describing their order and purpose.  
With a few simple spreadsheet columns, we can articulate which  
display patterns should be included in a given template, and what  
content patterns they’ll contain. More importantly, we’re able to  
articulate each pattern’s relative hierarchy and the role it plays  
on the screen. If you read the leftmost column vertically, you’re  
effectively looking at the mobile-first view of what the UI could be.  
“What content and display patterns go on this page? And in what  
general order?” are crucial questions to ask, and the techniques we  
just described can help designers discuss them effectively without  
making any layout or technical assumptions.  
# Establishing visual direction  
A visual designer’s job is to create an aesthetic language and apply  
it to the user interface in a way that aligns with the project’s  
goals. To do this, it’s essential for a visual designer to unearth the  
stakeholders’ aesthetic values.  
Historically, visual designers have gone about this by creating  
full comps – often many comps – to feel out the aesthetic values  
of the organization. Throw some comps against the wall and see  
what sticks. As you might imagine, generating a slew of comps  
from scratch takes an immense amount of time and effort, and  
unfortunately much of that work finds itself on the cutting room  
floor. There must be a more efficient way.  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 125 As it turns out, there’s a better path to take to arrive at aesthetic  
values without having to do a hell of a lot of up-front design work.  
Let’s talk about some of the tactics for making this happen.  
The 20-second gut test  
A fantastic exercise for quickly establishing aesthetic values is the  
20-second gut test. Typically done as part of the project kick-off  
meeting, the exercise involves showing the stakeholders a handful  
of pertinent websites \(about twenty to thirty of them\) for twenty  
seconds each. The sites you choose should be a healthy blend of  
industry-specific sites and other visually interesting sites from  
other industries. For added believability, you can photoshop in your  
client’s logo in place of the site’s actual logo.  
For each site presented, each person votes on a scale from 1 to 10,  
where a score of 1 means “If this were our site I would quit my job  
and cry myself to sleep,” while a score of 10 means “If this were our  
site I would be absolutely ecstatic!” Instruct participants to consider  
visual properties they find interesting, such as typography, color,  
density, layout, illustration style, and general vibe.  
For the Pittsburgh Food Bank website redesign kick-off, we showed stakeholders a variety of  
relevant websites for twenty seconds each. The participants voted on how happy they would be if  
the particular site was theirs. Then we discussed the results.  
126 ATOMIC DESIGN When the exercise is complete, quickly tally up the scores and come  
back to the group to discuss the results. Have a conversation about  
the sites that received the five lowest scores, the five highest scores,  
and the most contentious scores \(sites which some people ranked  
very high and others ranked very low\). The participants should  
explain why they were attracted or repulsed by a particular site, and  
work through differences in opinions with the group.  
This exercise exposes stakeholders to a variety of aesthetic  
directions early in the process, allows them to work through  
differences in taste, and \(with any luck\) helps arrive at some shared  
aesthetic values. The visual designer can then latch on to these  
insights and begin to translate those aesthetic values into a visual  
direction for the project.  
Style tiles  
Once again, visual designers’ first instinct is often to jump right  
into creating full comps to articulate an aesthetic direction for  
the project. This high-fidelity work is certainly tangible, but also  
wastes a ton of time and effort if the comps don’t resonate with the  
stakeholders. Also, creating high-fidelity comps often makes big  
assumptions about technical feasibility, which leads to unrealistic  
expectations and antagonistic relationships with frontend  
developers.  
It’s essential to establish a solid visual direction for the project,  
so how does a visual designer do that without burning a ton of  
time on up-front high-fidelity comps? That’s the question that  
designer Samantha Warren answered when she created style tiles, a  
deliverable that’s more tangible than a mood board but not as high-  
fidelity as a fully baked comp.  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 127 For the Entertainment Weekly website redesign project, visual designers used style tiles to explore  
color, type, texture, and more.  
Style tiles \(along with their in-browser counterparts, style  
prototypes\) allow designers to explore color, typography, texture,  
icons, and other aspects of design atmosphere without making  
assumptions about layout or worrying about polish. They can be  
designed much faster because they’re not encumbered by the  
expectations of high-fidelity comps, which means feedback and  
discussion can happen sooner.  
128 ATOMIC DESIGN Style tiles facilitate conversation to uncover what stakeholders  
value and what they don’t. “Does this style tile resonate better with  
you rather than this one? Why?” “Why does this color palette not  
sit well with you?” “What is it about this typeface you like?” You  
can have important conversations about aesthetic design without  
having to create full comps.  
Crucially, style tiles also reinforce pattern-based thinking  
by educating stakeholders about design systems rather than  
pages. Presenting color swatches, type examples, and textures  
exposes stakeholders to the ingredients that will underpin any  
implementation of the design system.  
Element collages  
While style tiles are great for exploring design atmosphere, they’re  
still a bit abstract. To get a sense of how those design ingredients  
will be applied to an interface, it’s important to quickly move into  
something a bit more tangible than a style tile. But does that mean  
visual designers need to jump from style tiles straight into full  
comps? Not necessarily.  
Somewhere in between style tiles and full comps live element  
collages, which are collections of UI component design explorations.  
Element collages provide a playground for designers to apply design  
atmosphere to actual interface elements, yet still be free from  
layout and highly polished presentation.  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 129 An element collage for the Entertainment Weekly redesign applied color, typography, and texture  
to actual interface elements. These collages enabled important conversations about the aesthetic  
direction of the project.  
Like style tiles, element collages are meant to facilitate discussion  
about the aesthetic direction of the project. It’s very clear these  
collages aren’t an actual website, but stakeholders can still get a  
sense of what the site could look like. Conversation about these  
element collages can give visual designers more ideas and direction  
about where to take the design next, and because of their lo-fi  
nature, designers can quickly iterate and evolve ideas.  
No doubt other tactics exist to establish aesthetic direction for  
your projects, and which techniques you decide to employ will  
vary from project to project. But the key is to paint some broader  
strokes before spending a lot of time and effort on highly detailed  
design work. Engaging in conversation with stakeholders at this  
exploratory stage creates a more inclusive process, which is far  
preferable to a process in which stakeholders simply grunt approval  
or disapproval of design deliverables.  
130 ATOMIC DESIGNFront-end prep chef  
As we discussed earlier, front-end developers are often relegated to  
crude production machines that are brought into the project only after  
all the design decisions are made. This archaic process keeps disciplines  
out of sync with one another and prevents teams from working together  
in a meaningful way. This is a huge mistake. Including front-end  
development as a critical part of the design process requires changes to  
both project structure and team members’ mentalities.  
In the restaurant business, an important yet unsung role is that of the  
prep chef. A prep chef chops vegetables, marinades meat, and makes  
salads in preparation for the following day’s work. By having ingredients  
prepared ahead of time, the kitchen staff can focus on collaboration and  
cooking rather than menial tasks. Without the up-front work of the prep  
chef, the flow of the main chefs would be interrupted and the fast pace  
of the kitchen would grind to a halt.  
A prep chef chops vegetables, marinades meat, makes salads, and prepares other ingredients so  
that the main kitchen staff can focus on cooking meals and collaboration.  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 131 Front-end developers need to be the prep chefs of the web design  
process. If developers aren’t coding from day one of the project,  
there’s something wrong with the process. “But Brad,” I can  
hear you saying, “how can I start coding if I don’t know what I’m  
supposed to code?”  
Believe me, there is plenty of front-end work to do without knowing  
a thing about the project’s information design or aesthetic direction.  
In addition to setting up the development environment \(such as  
preparing Git repositories, dev servers, CMSes, and development  
tools\), developers can dive into code and begin marking up patterns.  
But what should you be marking up if you don’t know anything about  
the design? That depends on the type of project you’re working on.  
Are you making an e-commerce site? You can set up site search,  
a shopping cart table, a placeholder product detail page, the  
homepage, and checkout pages. Making an online service? Start  
marking up the sign-up and login forms, the forgot password flow,  
and dashboard. And, of course, most websites will have a header,  
footer, and main content area. Set up shell templates and write basic  
markup for patterns you anticipate using. This markup will initially  
be crude, but it provides a crucial starting point for collaboration and  
iteration.  
This front-end prep chef work frees up developers’ time to  
collaborate with designers, rather than working after design is  
complete. With basic markup in place, developers can work with  
designers to help validate UX design decisions through conversations  
and working prototypes. They can help visual designers better  
understand source order and web layout, and can quickly produce a  
fledgling codebase that will eventually evolve into the final product.  
# Stop, collaborate, and listen  
Let’s quickly review what establishing design direction looks like  
across disciplines\:  
ɕ UX designers can create lo-fi sketches to establish basic  
information architecture and some anticipated UI patterns.  
ɕ Visual designers can gather the teams’ aesthetic values by  
conducting a 20-second gut test exercise, then create style tiles  
and element collages to explore initial design directions.  
132 ATOMIC DESIGN ɕ Front-end developers can set up project dependencies, stub out  
basic templates, and write structural markup for patterns the  
team anticipates using in the project.  
This work can happen concurrently but shouldn’t happen in  
isolation. Sure, there will need to be some initial head-down time  
for each discipline to get set up, but all team members should  
be fully aware of each discipline’s explorations in anticipation of  
working together to evolve these ideas.  
Ideas are meant to be ugly.  
- Jason Santa Maria  
At this early stage, it’s important to stress the importance of  
exploration, play, and idea generation. The lo-fi nature of the  
techniques we just discussed help encourage this exploration,  
allowing team members to pursue ideas that excite them.  
Sometimes those ideas might be best articulated as a napkin sketch,  
a prototype in CodePen, a visual exploration in Sketch, a quick wire  
in Balsamiq, a motion concept in After Effects, or some combination  
of media and tools. The point is for the team to generate ideas  
and solve problems, not to enforce a rigid order of operations. By  
approaching this design exploration in a cross-disciplinary way,  
teams can find balance between aesthetics, technical feasibility,  
usability, and functionality.  
# Rolling up our sleeves  
With a general design direction established, the team can roll up  
their sleeves to build the interface and its underlying design system.  
But how do teams turn a vague sense of direction into a beautiful,  
functional, usable, and complete design system?  
# From concept to complete  
Turning explorations into finished patterns is a blurry, imperfect  
process. This should come as absolutely no surprise to you by this  
point in the book.  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 133 For the TechCrunch project, Dan Mall riffed on the team’s initial  
design conversations to create a visual exploration for the site’s  
header. This piece of interface was a logical place to start since the  
header is one of the most prominent and branded elements on the  
page. After a little bit of work, we hopped on a call to discuss the  
exploration with the client.  
Dan Mall created an element collage to explore an aesthetic direction for the global header.  
Even though this design artifact was a simple in-progress  
exploration, we were able to have important conversations about  
the header’s aesthetics, hierarchy, and suggested functionality.  
Because the header was presented sans context, we were able to  
discuss the issues pertaining to the header without stakeholders’  
focus wandering to other page elements.  
Though the client didn’t know it, I had been building out a working  
HTML version of the header behind the scenes in Pattern Lab.  
Using Dan’s exploration as a reference, I created an HTML version of the global header in Pattern  
Lab. This grayscale prototype helped us demonstrate interactivity and how the header would adapt  
across the resolution spectrum.  
134 ATOMIC DESIGN This grayscale prototype allowed us to demonstrate interactivity  
and responsiveness, which led to even more discussion. Collectively  
we proposed changes to the header’s layout and functionality, and  
I was able to make changes using the browser’s development tools  
during the call. Suddenly, the entire team and stakeholders were  
actively participating in the design process!  
With input from the stakeholders and team, we iterated over the  
header pattern to massage the layout, IA, aesthetic details, and  
functionality to arrive at the solution we ultimately launched with.  
The header we launched with was the culmination of plenty of conversations and decisions around  
the pattern’s content, design, and functionality.  
Obviously the header pattern doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Within  
Pattern Lab, the header was included in every template using  
Mustache’s include pattern that we discussed in chapter 3.  
# \{\{\> organisms-header \}\}  
This allowed us to view the header within the context of the rest of  
the pages, sketchy as they initially were. So while we were focusing  
on designing one specific pattern, we were simultaneously taking  
into account the context of where that pattern would be employed.  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 135 In a more iterative process, there will be instances where some patterns are further developed  
than others. Seeing a partially done page might look unusual out of context, but communication  
between the team and stakeholders should alleviate confusion.  
Initially, in-browser designs tend to look crude at best, which is  
A-OK. The intention is to stub out the template’s basic information  
architecture in the browser, define patterns, wire up those patterns  
using includes, and begin the patterns’ general markup. With  
that work in place, the team can collectively begin styling specific  
patterns and refining the overall structure.  
Seeing these partially designed prototypes might look unusual to  
those used to more traditional, pixel-perfect design deliverables.  
But it’s far more important to communicate progress than a false  
sense of perfection, which is why rolling updates are preferable to  
big reveals.  
136 ATOMIC DESIGNThe role of comps in a post-PSD era  
Up until this point we’ve been talking about establishing a general  
aesthetic direction and then designing some patterns to experiment  
with the application of that aesthetic direction. These relatively  
lo-fi tactics allow teams to explore freely, iterate quickly, and get  
feedback sooner.  
But I’ll never forget this client feedback we received on the first  
pattern-driven project I worked on\: “These element collages look  
great, but it’s like you’re asking me to comment on how beautiful a  
face is by showing me the nose.”  
If you’ve gotten to this point in your process, congratulations!  
Feedback like this means they’re salivating for more, so now that  
you’ve captured a general aesthetic direction you can safely put  
those explorations into context. That likely involves creating full  
static comps.  
Listen to the chatter around “designing in the browser” and you’ll  
undoubtedly hear that Photoshop comps are the devil incarnate. Which,  
of course, isn’t true. Throughout this book we’ve discussed the  
importance of breaking things down into their atomic elements  
while simultaneously building up a cohesive whole. Static comps  
are effective at painting a full picture of what the UI could look  
like. The trick is knowing when to paint those full pictures, and  
knowing how long to dwell in static design documents.  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 137 Dan Mall created a full comp to demonstrate what a featured article template for TechCrunch might  
look like. This artifact was used to show the design system in context and get approval for the  
overarching design. Subsequent design revisions would be handled in the browser.  
138 ATOMIC DESIGN For the TechCrunch project, we created a comp for the article  
template only after the client was feeling good about our element  
collage explorations. Creating full comps requires a lot of effort,  
which is why we established the design direction first to mitigate  
the risk of all that full-comp effort going straight into the trash if  
we got it totally wrong.  
Comps, like any other design artifact, are used to facilitate a  
conversation with the project stakeholders. If their feedback is,  
“This feels all wrong,” then it’s back to the drawing board to create  
a new comp. But if their feedback suggests, “Can we move this from  
here to here? Can we add a gray border around the article text?  
Can we increase the size of this image?” that’s a sign the overall  
direction is in good shape and those relatively minor issues can be  
addressed in the browser.  
# In-browser iteration  
Static comps can be great for shaping the overall aesthetic direction  
of a template, but users will ultimately view and interact with the  
experience in a browser. That’s why designs should be quickly  
translated into the final environment and iterated on there.  
Working in the browser allows teams to address layout issues  
across the entire resolution spectrum, design around dynamic  
data \(such as variable character lengths, image sizes, and other  
dynamic content\), demonstrate interaction and animation,  
gauge performance, factor in ergonomics, and confront technical  
considerations \(such as pixel density, text rendering, scrolling  
performance, and browser quirks\). Static design comps cannot  
deal with all these considerations, so they should be treated merely  
as hypotheses rather than set-in-stone specifications. Only when  
transferred to the browser can any design hypothesis truly be  
confirmed or rejected.  
Let’s change the phrase “designing in the browser” to  
“deciding in the browser.”  
- Dan Mall  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 139 Once the designs are in the browser, they should stay in the  
browser. At this stage in the process, the point of production shifts  
to team members adept at crafting HTML, CSS, and presentational  
JavaScript. Patterns should be created, styled, and plugged in  
wherever they’re needed. Designers can react to these in-browser  
implementations and can create spot comps in static tools to help  
iron out responsive wrinkles at the organism level. This back-and-  
forth between static and in-browser tools establishes a healthy  
loop between design and development, where the front-end code  
becomes more solid and stable with each iterative loop.  
This illustration by Trent Walton of Paravel perfectly articulates a more iterative design and  
development process. By getting designs into the browser sooner, teams can iterate over the design  
and address the many considerations that can only be dealt with once the design is in the browser.  
The beautiful thing about a pattern-based workflow is that  
as each pattern becomes more fully baked, any template that  
includes the pattern will become more fully baked as well.  
That means the level of effort to create new templates decreases  
dramatically over the course of the project, until eventually creating  
a new template mostly involves stitching together existing patterns.  
140 ATOMIC DESIGN Bring it on home  
The design system is taking shape and the team is cooking with  
gas to bring the project home. At this stage, UI patterns are  
well established, the team is taking some final steps to tighten  
everything up and prepare for launch.  
UX designers are hitting the prototype hard to make sure the  
flows and interactions are all logical and intuitive. Visual designers  
are combing over the interface and proposing design tweaks to  
the UI to polish up the design. Front-end developers are testing  
the experience in a slew of browsers and devices while also  
addressing design feedback. Back-end developers are hard at work  
integrating the front-end UI into the CMS \(we’ll talk more about  
the relationship between front-end and back-end in chapter 5\).  
And, of course, the clients and stakeholders are making last-minute  
demands – I mean suggestions – about the design and content.  
The whole team is contributing documentation for the style guide,  
cleaning up the patterns in the pattern library, and working hard to  
get the website off the ground.  
Then – seemingly in the blink of an eye – the website and  
accompanying design system launch. Champagne is poured, high-  
fives are exchanged and, of course, post-launch bugs are squashed.  
Users visit the new site to find a beautiful, functional, consistent,  
and cohesive experience that undoubtedly makes them weep tears  
of joy. Mission accomplished.  
What began as a giant slab of rock is now a finely polished  
sculpture, thanks to a ton of hard work, genuine collaboration,  
constant communication, and plenty of iteration. Moreover, in  
addition to a brand-spanking-new website, the team leaves behind  
a flexible, deliberate UI system bundled up in a beautiful style guide.  
This chapter explored everything that goes into making an effective  
UI design system. In the next chapter, we’ll discuss how to make  
sure that design system continues to be successful in the long run.  
CHAPTER 4 / THE ATOMIC WORKFLOW 141 Chapter 5  
# Maintaining  
# Design Systems  
# Making design systems stand the test  
of time And they made a design system, delivered a style guide, and lived  
happily ever after. Right?  
Not quite.  
There’s a very real risk that a style guide will end up in the trash  
can right alongside all the PSDs, PDFs and those other static  
artifacts of the design process. Despite everyone’s best intentions,  
all the time and effort that went into making a thoughtful design  
system and style guide can go straight down the drain.  
How can that be?  
A style guide is an artifact of design process. A design system is  
a living, funded product with a roadmap & backlog, serving an  
ecosystem.  
- Nathan Curtis  
An artifact is something you’d find on an archaeological dig or in  
a museum, whereas a system is a living, breathing entity. A style  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 143 guide can provide documentation and serve as a helpful resource,  
but the simple existence of a style guide doesn’t guarantee long-  
term success for the underlying design system. A design system  
needs ongoing maintenance, support, and tender loving care for it to  
truly thrive.  
# Changing minds, once again  
We’ve already discussed the importance of resetting everyone’s  
expectations to establish a more collaborative, pattern-driven  
workflow. To save our style guides from the bowels of a trash can,  
we must once again fundamentally rewire people’s brains.  
# What is it we’re making again?  
We think we merely design and build websites and apps. And that’s  
true for the most part. After all, that’s what our clients pay us to do,  
and the products we create are the vehicles that generate money  
and success for our organizations. It seems natural to focus on the  
final implementations rather than the underlying system. The live  
products remain the primary focus of everyone’s attention, while  
any pattern library exists as an offshoot that simply provides helpful  
documentation.  
The problem with this mindset is that you can almost see that  
pattern library snapping off and sliding into the abyss. Once the  
pattern library ceases to reflect the current state of the products  
144 ATOMIC DESIGN it serves, it becomes obsolete. And when the pattern library  
managing the design system is no longer accurate, the website  
maintenance process devolves into a smattering of hotfixes and ad  
hoc changes, ruining all the thoughtfulness that went into creating  
the original design system.  
To set ourselves up for long-term success, we must fundamentally  
shift our outlook around what we’re actually creating. Rather  
than thinking of final applications as our sole responsibility, we  
must recognize that the design system is what underpins our final  
products and pattern libraries.  
This “design system first” mentality inserts a bit of friction into the  
maintenance process, and that friction can be friendly. It forces us  
to step back and consider how any improvements, client requests,  
feature additions, and iterations affect the overall system rather  
than only a sliver of the whole ecosystem.  
Say you’re working on an e-commerce site, and you run a test  
that finds a custom-styled dropdown menu on the product detail  
page isn’t performing as well as the browser’s default dropdown  
menu. One course of action is to simply remove the custom-styled  
dropdown from that particular page and call it a day. However,  
considering the entire design system rather than just the product  
detail page might cause you to take a step back and wonder,  
“If this custom dropdown menu isn’t performing well here,  
perhaps it’s not performing well elsewhere.” After digging into  
the issue further, you find the best course of action is to globally  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 145 modify the dropdown pattern in the design system to remove the  
custom styling. Now, anywhere the dropdown pattern appears  
will reflect those changes and will likely see similar performance  
improvements.  
That is just one example of how design-system thinking can  
lead to broader, more considered changes. Broken behavior and  
opportunities to enhance the UI will often be realized at the  
application level, but those changes should often be acted on at the  
system level. Adding this bit of friendly friction into your workflow  
ensures improvements are shared across the entire ecosystem,  
and prevents the system from being eroded by a series of one-off  
changes.  
# Done and done  
Another expectation we must revisit is our definition of done.  
Creating things for print and other physical media involves making  
permanent, tangible objects. That sense of finality simply doesn’t  
exist in the digital world, which means change can happen with  
much less effort and friction than other media. Clients, colleagues,  
and stakeholders should embrace the pliable nature of the digital  
world to create living design systems that adapt to the ever-  
shifting nature of the medium, user needs, and the needs of the  
business.  
This shift in thinking fundamentally affects the scope of our work.  
Folks working in the client services business are often used to  
delivering a project in a tidy package then riding off into the sunset.  
Internal teams don’t fair much better, since they tend to float from  
one initiative to the next. Whether you’re part of an internal team  
or you’re an external gun for hire, I’m guessing you’ve experienced  
the shortcomings of project-based work. We tend to talk about a  
future that never comes, and instead we set it, forget it, then move  
on to the next shiny project.  
If we’re committed to creating genuinely useful work that truly  
meets the needs of our clients and organizations, we must  
fundamentally redefine the scope of our work. As Nathan Curtis  
says, a design system shouldn’t be a project with a finite scope, but  
rather a product meant to grow and evolve over time\:  
146 ATOMIC DESIGN Focusing on style guide delivery as the climax is the wrong  
story to tell. A system isn’t a project with an end, it’s the  
origin story of a living and evolving product that’ll serve other  
products.  
- Nathan Curtis  
The web is never done, and the creation of a design system is  
merely the first step in a long \(and hopefully fruitful!\) journey.  
A design system should be a long-term commitment with the  
ambitious goal of revolutionizing how your organization creates  
digital work. Exciting, eh?! So how do we make sure that happens?  
# Creating maintainable design systems  
As you embark on this pattern-paved journey, let’s talk about  
things you can do to craft a design system that sets up your  
organization for long-term success. How do you create a design  
system that takes root and becomes an essential part of your  
organization’s workflow? What pitfalls do you need to be on the  
lookout for? How do you ensure the design system yields big  
results? To set up your design system for long-term success, you  
need to\:  
ɕ Make it official.  
ɕ Make it adaptable.  
ɕ Make it maintainable.  
ɕ Make it cross-disciplinary.  
ɕ Make it approachable.  
ɕ Make it visible.  
ɕ Make it bigger.  
ɕ Make it context-agnostic.  
ɕ Make it contextual.  
ɕ Make it last.  
Let’s dive into each one of these points in a bit more detail.  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 147 Make it official  
Your initial style guide may begin its life as a side project, the  
result of a weekend hackathon, or as the brainchild of one or two  
ambitious team members. As we discussed in the previous chapter,  
your client or boss doesn’t even have to know that you’re creating  
a thoughtful design system and accompanying pattern library.  
Remember\: ask forgiveness, not permission!  
Organic beginnings are all well and good, but in order to establish  
a truly impactful design system that creates long-term success  
for your organization, the design system needs to evolve into  
an officially sanctioned endeavor. That means thinking of it as a  
true product rather than a simple side project, and consequently  
allocating real time, budget, and people to it.  
Convincing stakeholders to commit large chunks of money, time,  
and resources up front for a design system can be extremely  
challenging. So what are we to do? Here’s my advice\:  
1\. Make a thing.  
2\. Show that it’s useful.  
3\. Make it official.  
Let’s break down these steps a bit further.  
# 1\: Make a thing  
You have to start somewhere, and having something started is  
better than nothing at all. Pick a project that would be a great  
pilot for establishing your design system; follow a process similar  
to the one discussed in chapter 4; think about the atomic design  
mental model detailed in chapter 2; and you’ll end up with a solid  
foundation for a thoughtful design system and pattern library that  
helps your team work more effectively.  
Take the time to package your UI patterns in a pattern library and  
get it ready to be shopped around. I’ve talked to several ambitious  
team members who have established the basic gist of their pattern  
library over the course of a weekend. This effort makes all the  
difference in the world since it provides something tangible for  
stakeholders to react to. Again\: show, don’t tell.  
148 ATOMIC DESIGN2\: Show that it’s useful  
With a nascent-yet-tangible design system in place, you can have  
more meaningful conversations with the people who control money,  
scheduling, and resources. You can discuss exactly how the design  
system helped save time and money \(see “Pitching Patterns” in  
chapter 4\), then paint a picture of how those benefits would scale  
even further if the organization invested in an official, full-fledged  
design system.  
Get team members from different disciplines to back you up and  
discuss the initial success of the system, and also pull in others who  
are sympathetic to the cause who would stand to benefit from an  
expanded design system.  
# 3\: Make it official  
You’ve proved the value of your initial design system and presented  
a roadmap for how to make it even better. With any luck your  
organization will commit to making the design system an Official  
Thing.  
With approval from the highest levels, you’re now able to put a  
plan into action that involves\: allocating or hiring people to work  
on the design system; developing a plan to make it more robust;  
establishing a clear governance strategy; and laying out a product  
roadmap.  
It’s worth pointing out that things may not shake out the way you  
hoped. Despite demonstrating real value and presenting a concrete  
plan of action, higher-ups still might shoot your initiative down.  
Don’t be discouraged. You may have lost the battle, but you can  
certainly win the war. Your team should continue to grow and  
extend the design system in whatever capacity you can until its  
value becomes undeniable. As more people benefit from the system,  
you’ll end up with a grassroots-supported system that can help  
push the endeavor through.  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 149Establishing a design system team  
With the design system initiative approved, it’s now time to put the  
right people and processes in place to ensure the system flourishes  
for your organization.  
Design system makers and users  
First things first. It’s important to recognize that there will  
inevitably be people at the organization who help make and  
maintain the design system, and there will be people who will  
be users of the design system. There may be overlap between  
these two groups, but establishing the roles of makers and users is  
important nonetheless.  
When I talk about establishing a more collaborative process like the  
one I detailed in the previous chapter, I inevitably hear people who  
work at large organizations say, “But Brad, we have hundreds \(or  
even thousands\) of developers working on our products. Getting all  
those people to collaborate and contribute like that would be far too  
difficult.”  
They’re likely right. It would be ideal if the entire organization  
adopted nimbler, more collaborative processes, but the daunting  
logistics around such an effort makes it improbable. But here’s the  
thing\: not everyone in the organization needs to contribute directly  
to the design system, but someone \(or more likely, some people\)  
must take ownership of it.  
The design system makers are the ones who create, maintain,  
and govern the system, and they need to work closely together to  
ensure that the system is smart, flexible, scalable, and addresses  
the needs of the users and business. The design system users are  
the teams across the organization who will take the system and  
employ its interface patterns to specific applications.  
150 ATOMIC DESIGN Design system makers and users.  
The design system makers and design system users need to  
maintain a close working relationship to ensure the patterns  
defined within the system serve the needs of the applications,  
and that all documentation is clear. Makers provide a birds-eye  
perspective of the entire ecosystem the design system serves,  
while users provide an on-the-ground perspective focused on  
specific applications of the system. Jina Bolton of Salesforce sums  
up the relationship between makers and users quite nicely\:  
The Design System informs our Product Design. Our Product  
Design informs the Design System.  
- Jina Bolton, Salesforce  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 151 Both outlooks are critical to the success of the design system,  
which is why it’s so important for makers and users to have a  
healthy relationship that involves frequent communication and  
collaboration.  
Design system makers  
Who updates the design system? Who approves changes? Who  
communicates with the users of the design system to make sure it’s  
addressing their needs? Who gets to decide which patterns stay, go,  
or need tweaking?  
The answers to these questions will very much depend on the size  
and setup of your organization.  
Large organizations are able to dedicate serious resources to  
managing design systems. Salesforce, for example, maintains  
an official design systems team, which currently includes about a  
dozen full-time employees, last I heard. That dedicated team is  
responsible for governing the design system and making sure it’s  
meeting the needs of the internal product teams, as well as external  
developers who build things on the company’s platform. When a  
design system is serving literally thousands of users, it’s a smart  
idea to dedicate at least a few full-time employees to manage and  
expand the system.  
Smaller organizations most likely don’t have the luxury of building  
an entire team to service a design system. Team members in  
smaller organizations have to wear many \(hopefully stylish!\) hats  
out of necessity, so governing the design system will likely become  
another responsibility. This may sound like an added burden \(“Oh  
great, yet another thing I’m responsible for that doesn’t involve  
a pay raise!”\), but this particular hat should be a joy to wear as it  
improves the efficiency and quality of all other work. Hooray for  
design systems!  
Typically, design system makers at smaller organizations will be  
senior-level staff who have the experience to make thoughtful  
decisions, and the authority to enforce the design system.  
And then there are external agencies, contractors, and consultants.  
What is the role of a third party when it comes to long-term  
maintenance of a client’s design system? On one hand, external  
152 ATOMIC DESIGN partners are at a bit of a disadvantage since they don’t actually work  
for their client’s organization. A successful design system needs to  
become part of an organization’s DNA, and since third parties exist  
outside the company’s walls, their influence is intrinsically limited.  
But on the other hand, external parties can often provide a sense  
of perspective that’s hard to see while working inside a company.  
This is where outsiders can really shine. In my work as a consultant,  
I work with organizations to establish long-term design system  
maintenance strategies, and help get the right people and processes  
in place. While the long-term success of the system will ultimately  
be up to the organization, third parties can teach them to fish and  
provide important strategic guidance, feedback, and perspective.  
Design system users  
Who are the people responsible for using the design system to build  
new features and applications? Who are the people who talk with  
the system makers to report issues and request features?  
Once again, the answers to these questions will largely depend on  
your organization’s size and structure.  
Design system users may be the same team creating the design  
system, separate development teams within your organization,  
junior-level designers and developers, partner agencies, external  
development shops, or other third-party teams.  
Users’ proximity to and involvement in the creation of the design  
system will undoubtedly vary. You may work on a singular product  
at a scrappy startup, so your small team could be simultaneously  
creating and using the design system. Or you may work at a large  
multinational corporation with development teams and third-party  
partners scattered all across the globe. If this is the case, design  
system makers and users may seldom \(or ever\) meet, which means  
that helpful documentation and a sharp birds-eye perspective  
become that much more important.  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 153 There is a spectrum of potential relationships between design system users and makers, and the  
size and makeup of your company will undoubtedly shape those relationships.  
One of the biggest advantages of establishing a thoughtful design  
system is that it allows organizations to scale best practices. If all  
those best practices – responsiveness, accessibility, performance,  
UX, ergonomics, and so on – are baked into the system, users can  
simply plug in the patterns and reap the rewards. This means design  
system users don’t have to be senior-level designers or developers  
to produce good work; the design system serves as a quality control  
vehicle that helps users apply best practices regardless of each  
individual’s skill level.  
# Design system team makeup  
A cross-disciplinary team should be established to properly  
manage, maintain, and extend the system. All disciplines at an  
organization – UX designers, visual designers, content strategists,  
front-end developers, back-end developers, product managers,  
project managers, executives, and other stakeholders – have  
unique perspectives that can undoubtedly inform and shape the  
work. Incorporating these perspectives into the design system is  
important, but doesn’t necessarily require every discipline to be  
constantly involved in developing it.  
154 ATOMIC DESIGN There will inevitably be disciplines that actively do the work, while  
others may take on more of an advisory role. Those responsible  
for designing and building the user interface – UX designers,  
visual designers, front-end developers – will likely serve as the  
hands that do the work and make updates to the design system.  
They should work collaboratively \(as detailed in chapter 4\) and  
coordinate with other disciplines to ensure that the system reflects  
the values and considerations of the entire business.  
Other people may not be the ones actively doing the work, but  
must be consulted to make sure their perspectives are properly  
reflected in the system. Back-end engineers need to make the team  
aware of any architectural decisions that would affect the front-end  
UI; executives need to make the team aware of important initiatives  
that will affect the role and utility of the system; and, of course,  
design system users need to coordinate with the makers to ensure  
the system serves the needs of individual applications.  
# Make it adaptable  
Change is the only constant, as they say. The living part of a living  
design system means that it needs to roll with the punches, adapt to  
feedback, be iterated on, and evolve alongside the products it serves.  
A misconception about design systems is that once they’re  
established, they become an omnipotent and unchangeable source  
of truth. Thinking in such a rigid way is a surefire way to have  
your design system effort backfire. If users feel handcuffed and  
pigeonholed into using patterns that don’t solve their problems,  
they’ll perceive the design system as a unhelpful tool and start  
searching elsewhere for something that will better address their needs.  
Creating a clear governance plan is essential for making sure  
your design system can adapt and thrive as time goes on. A solid  
governance strategy starts by answering some important questions  
about handling change. Consider the following\:  
ɕ What happens when an existing pattern doesn’t quite work for  
a specific application? Does the pattern get modified? Do you  
recommend using a different pattern? Does a new pattern need  
creating?  
ɕ How are new pattern requests handled?  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 155 ɕ How are old patterns retired?  
ɕ What happens when bugs are found?  
ɕ Who approves changes to the design system?  
ɕ Who is responsible for keeping documentation up to date?  
ɕ Who actually makes changes to the system’s UI patterns?  
ɕ How are design system changes deployed to live applications?  
ɕ How will people find out about changes?  
There are likely many more specific questions to answer, but the  
point is your team should have answers and processes in place to  
address inevitable changes to the system.  
As mentioned a few times already, frequent communication and  
collaboration between makers and users is key for successfully  
governing your design system. Make it as easy as possible for  
users and makers to communicate. Set up a design system Slack  
or Yammer channel, establish regular office hours, make sure your  
bug ticket software helps facilitate conversation, and keep the doors  
open for ad hoc chats and calls. If users are stuck on something,  
they should know exactly where and who to turn to for help.  
In addition to informal day-to-day conversation between makers  
and users, schedule regular “state of the union” meetings to  
review the design system with makers, users, and other key  
stakeholders. Discuss what’s working, be honest with what needs  
to be improved, and review priorities and the roadmap to make  
sure the system is serving the needs of the business. These regular  
checkups are especially helpful for keeping stakeholders up to  
speed, since they often aren’t involved in the day-to-day of the  
design system’s operations.  
# Making changes to patterns  
A critical part of design system maintenance is ensuring that UI  
patterns stay up to date, embrace evolving design and development  
best practices, and continue to address the real needs of the  
organization.  
Developing a strategy for handling pattern changes is crucial, which  
is why Inayaili de León Persson and the Canonical web team spent  
156 ATOMIC DESIGN time to map out their strategy as they created the Vanilla front-end  
framework.  
We thought that it would be good to document the process that  
a pattern should follow in order to become a Vanilla pattern, so  
after a little bit of brainstorming, we created a diagram that shows  
the different steps that should be taken from before submitting a  
pattern proposal to its full acceptance as a Vanilla pattern.  
- Inayaili de León Persson, Canonical  
The result is a gorgeous decision tree that maps out exactly what  
processes need to happen to add a new pattern to the design system.  
The Canonical web team mapped out the decision process used to manage updates and additions to  
patterns in the Vanilla front-end framework.  
The three types of change that can happen to patterns in a design  
system are modification, addition, and removal.  
Modifying patterns  
UI patterns can and should be modified for a number of reasons\:  
feature additions, bug fixes, subtle or major visual design tweaks,  
performance improvements, accessibility enhancements, code  
refactoring, UX best practice updates, and so on.  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 157 The design system maintainers need to understand why and when  
to tweak patterns, how to go about making those changes, and how  
to roll out those improvements into individual applications.  
Keeping patterns fresh is essential for the long-term health of  
the design system. Nobody wants to use and maintain a Web  
2.0-looking design system full of bevels and crusty code!  
Adding patterns  
As smart as your team surely is, it’s quite possible you won’t think  
of every conceivable pattern to include in your design system right  
out of the gate. As the system is applied to more products, gaps will  
inevitably emerge where the needs of the application aren’t solved  
by existing patterns. In such cases, it will become clear that new  
patterns will need created to address these needs.  
Care should be taken when adding patterns to the library. If every  
whim results in a brand new pattern, the design system will  
become a bloated and unwieldy Wild West. It’s worth asking if this  
is a one-off situation or something that can be leveraged in other  
applications.  
Perhaps you may want to assume a one-off until a different team  
encounters a similar use case. If the team working on Application  
2 looks at Application 1 and says, “I want that!” perhaps that’s a  
good indicator that a one-off pattern should be added to the pattern  
library.  
Removing patterns  
Patterns can be deprecated for a number of reasons. Perhaps you  
discover through use that a particular pattern is a terrible idea.  
Hindsight is 20/20, my friend. Maybe the industry has moved away  
from a pattern for UX or technical reasons. Perhaps a pattern sat  
there unused by any application for ages. Maybe users reported  
back with a lot of negative feedback about working with a particular  
pattern.  
Having a plan for deprecating patterns is a great idea. But how  
do you remove patterns from the design system without pulling  
the rug out from under people relying on those patterns in their  
158 ATOMIC DESIGN applications? To address this issue, Salesforce created a neat utility  
called Sass Deprecate that flags patterns that are heading to the  
chopping block in the near future. Through some clever use of Sass  
variable flags and styling, the maker team can give a heads-up to  
users that a particular pattern is being deprecated, and recommend  
an alternative pattern instead.  
# Make it maintainable  
With all this talk about modifying, adding, and removing patterns,  
you may be wondering, “How the hell are our applications supposed  
to actually keep up with all these changes?!” And in asking that  
question, you will have stumbled on to one of the biggest challenges  
organizations face in successfully maintaining a design system.  
The biggest existential threat to any system is neglect.  
- Alex Schleifer, Airbnb  
Many systems fall into a state of disrepair because the effort  
required to make updates is far too high. If it’s difficult and time-  
consuming to update patterns, documentation, and applications,  
people will eventually get so frustrated that they stop making  
the effort and the design system will begin its drift into oblivion.  
Making updates to UI patterns, documentation, and applications  
should be as frictionless as possible, so reducing this friction  
should become a high priority for the design system team. This  
involves careful consideration from both technological and  
workflow standpoints.  
# In search of the holy grail  
The design system holy grail involves creating an environment  
where the pattern library and live applications are perfectly in  
sync. The idea is that you should be able to make a change to a UI  
pattern and see that change automatically reflected in both the  
pattern library and anywhere the pattern is included in production.  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 159 The holy grail of design systems is an environment where making changes to a UI pattern updates  
both the pattern library and production applications simultaneously.  
This technique removes any duplication of effort and ensures the  
pattern library and the applications using the patterns remain  
synchronized. Sounds like a dream, right?  
As it turns out, this dream can be a reality. Lonely Planet, the  
travel guide company, was one of the first to establish a holy grail  
design system called Rizzo. Through some smart architecture,  
they created an API for their UI patterns that feeds into their  
production environment as well as their pattern library. The result  
is a centralized design system that ensures their live application and  
documentation remain perfectly in sync.  
This approach is no easy task, as it requires sophisticated technical  
architecture, smart people to set it all up, and a relatively  
centralized organizational culture. How you go about chasing  
the holy grail – or even if you can achieve it – is dependent on a  
whole load of factors, including your technical architecture and  
organizational makeup.  
160 ATOMIC DESIGN Lonely Planet created an API for its UI patterns that is consumed by both their pattern library and  
production environment. By constructing their design system in this manner, changes to UI patterns  
are automatically reflected in both the pattern library and production environment.  
# Clearing technical hurdles  
Keeping a pattern library in sync with production environments  
requires sharing code in a smart, scalable, and maintainable way.  
Detailing all the different technical strategies and considerations  
around the holy grail would necessitate its own book, but let’s cover  
a few important areas around keeping front-end code in sync.  
The front-end of things  
A UI design system manifests itself as the front-end of a web  
experience, which is comprised of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. How  
we get that front-end code into a production environment, with  
complex application logic and back-end code, is the task at hand.  
In his article “Chasing the Holy Grail,” web developer Marcelo  
Somers details various technical approaches to achieving the holy  
grail. He highlights the pros and cons of each strategy for feeding a  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 161 design system into applications to keep both codebases in lockstep.  
While I won’t detail each of Marcelo’s strategies, it’s worth noting  
there is a spectrum of approaches to choose from\: crude, manual  
front-end code copying-and-pasting on one end, to baking the  
pattern library directly into the production environment on the  
other.  
In my experience, I’ve found that sharing CSS and presentational  
JavaScript with production environments is relatively easy, while  
sharing markup is tough. Because CSS and JavaScript tend to get  
compiled into a single file \(or perhaps a handful of files\), it becomes  
possible to throw them onto a CDN and then simply link to those  
files in each application. Marcelo explains how to do this while  
keeping versioning in mind\:  
You’d provide development teams with a versioned URL \(e.g.,  
http\://mycdn.com/1.3.5/styles.css\) and upgrading is as simple  
as bumping the version number in the URL.  
- Marcelo Somers  
Sharing CSS and JavaScript is all well and good, but where things  
get tricky is when you want to share markup between environments.  
Why? you ask. Well, markup and back-end logic are often  
intertwined in an application’s codebase, which tends to make it  
difficult to simply copy and paste markup between your pattern  
library and production environments. Thankfully, there are ways  
around this problem.  
Bridging the markup gap with templating languages  
Using HTML templating languages \(such as Mustache, Handlebars,  
Twig, Underscore, Jade, Nunjucks, and a slew of others\) makes  
markup more portable and dynamic. Templating languages separate  
structure and data, and supercharge our HTML to keep us from  
having to write the same markup patterns over and over again. The  
good news is that many CMSes and application environments also  
make use of templating languages to serve up front-end markup.  
162 ATOMIC DESIGN The templating language can serve as the bridge between your  
pattern library and production environments. If you use a  
templating language to create the patterns in your design system  
\(something we discussed at length in chapter 3\), you can easily  
share those patterns with production environments that utilize the  
same templating engine.  
A templating language like Mustache, Handlebars, Underscore, Jade, and others can serve as a bridge  
that allows front-end code to be shared between the pattern library and production application.  
The team at Phase2 Technology achieved the holy grail by using  
Pattern Lab as their pattern library development tool and Drupal as  
their content management system. Because both Pattern Lab and  
Drupal support the popular Twig templating engine, Phase2 is able  
to easily share patterns between the two environments, ensuring  
their clients’ pattern libraries and production builds are always in  
step with each other.  
By using the same templating engine, along with the help of  
the Component Libraries Drupal Module, the tool gives Drupal  
the ability to directly include, extend, and embed the Twig  
templates that Pattern Lab uses for its components without any  
template duplication at all!  
- Evan Lovely, Phase2 Technology  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 163Is your culture holy grail compatible?  
You may have read that last section and thought, “That’s amazing!  
My company needs this now!” While holy grail systems are indeed  
great, there are reasons why you may not be able to automagically  
keep your production environments and pattern library in sync.  
Perhaps your organization creates tons of digital products on many  
different platforms using wildly different technologies. Maybe  
you’re a giant multinational company scattered all over the world.  
Maybe your company has an extremely decentralized, autonomous  
culture. Or maybe you’re a gigantic federal government.  
The Draft U.S. Web Design Standards are the design system for the United States federal government.  
The U.S. government’s design system – called the Draft U.S. Web  
Digital Standards – is a collection of UI components and visual  
styles created to help people making government websites build  
more consistent UIs. The design system provides markup and styles  
for users to download and weave into their applications. It would  
certainly be amazing to see a holy grail design system implemented  
at such a gigantic scale, but as you might imagine, that’s a pretty  
tall order. The vastness and decentralized nature of the organization  
164 ATOMIC DESIGN means that a synchronized pattern library isn’t really achievable  
without some dramatic restructuring of how federal government  
websites get built.  
If a relatively scattered, decentralized culture is your reality, don’t  
be disheartened! Even getting some design system in place – a  
handful of go-to UI patterns, some helpful documentation, and  
guiding principles – can show your organization the light that  
points towards the grail. As we’ve discussed throughout this  
chapter, these efforts should be ongoing, and before you can run  
you must first learn to crawl.  
# Make it cross-disciplinary  
Style guides often jump straight into code snippets and pattern  
usage for the benefit of the design system users. Of course, a  
pattern library needs to be helpful for the people actually making  
use of the patterns, but treating a style guide solely as a developer  
resource limits its potential.  
A style guide has the opportunity to serve as a watering hole for  
the entire organization, helping establish a common vocabulary  
for every discipline invested in the success of the company’s digital  
products. Establishing this common vocabulary can lead to more  
efficient work, better communication, and more collaboration  
between disciplines across the organization. That’s why the style  
guide should be an inviting place for everybody, not just design  
system users.  
Take the carousel \(please!\). This component is amazingly complex  
from an organizational standpoint. A homepage carousel on an  
e-commerce website requires input from a host of disciplines  
across the organization. Business owners and editorial staff must  
choose products to be featured in the carousel. Copywriters must  
ensure the copy is effective and stays within the constraints of the  
design. Art directors need to make certain the aesthetic design is  
pleasing and the product photography is legible across every screen  
size. UX designers have to confirm the functionality and controls  
are intuitive. Front-end people must be sure the component is  
responsive, accessible, and performant. Back-end developers need  
to ensure the component is properly wired up to the back-end  
system. You get the idea.  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 165 A homepage carousel on a site like Walmart requires input from many different disciplines and  
stakeholders. A style guide can help gather those different perspectives under one roof.  
A well-crafted style guide can help manage all these moving parts  
and ensure the many perspectives that influence each pattern are  
properly documented in the style guide. Make the pattern library  
accessible to every discipline, and think about how to make it  
easy and inviting for different disciplines to contribute to the  
documentation.  
# Make it approachable  
It should come as a surprise to no one that people tend to gravitate  
towards attractive things. A big part of making a style guide a cross-  
disciplinary resource is ensuring the container that houses your  
pattern library and other documentation is good-looking, inviting,  
and easy to navigate.  
Taking the time to craft an attractive home for your style guide and  
documentation can lead to more usage, help build awareness, help  
create organizational investment, and help get non-developers’  
eyeballs on the style guide. All of this contributes to that important  
shared vocabulary that leads to better cross-disciplinary  
collaboration.  
But creating a great-looking, intuitive style guide experience  
doesn’t just happen, and this can be problematic when getting  
166 ATOMIC DESIGN Yelp’s style guide has an attractive, friendly front page that explains what the resource is, who it’s  
for, and how to use it.  
a style guide off the ground. If teams think that making a useful  
style guide involves making some Big, Official Thing with custom  
branding and a glossy website, they might be deterred from ever  
starting the initiative. So remember\:  
1\. Make a thing.  
2\. Show that it’s useful.  
3\. Make it official.  
Creating a useful design system should be the team’s first  
priority. Building a happy home to contain it all might not happen  
straightaway, but should become a bigger priority once the design  
system becomes official. Making a good-looking style guide  
isn’t just design for design’s sake; it reflects an organization’s  
commitment to making and maintaining a thoughtful, deliberate  
design system.  
# Make it visible  
Visibility is critically important to the ongoing health of your  
design system. Such an important endeavor shouldn’t be tucked  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 167 away in a dark corner of your intranet. What steps can you take to  
ensure the design system remains a cornerstone of your design and  
development workflows?  
# Design system evangelism  
You can create the best style guide in world, use the most  
sophisticated technology, have an amazing team in place, and have  
excited users, but if you don’t actively promote the design system  
and communicate changes, the entire effort will suffer greatly.  
Evangelizing your design system efforts can and should happen  
even before the system is off the ground. At the onset of your  
project, you can set up places to document progress of the project  
to help garner awareness and excitement for the design system  
effort. One client of mine set up an internal blog to publish updates  
to the project, as well as a design system Yammer channel where  
developers and other interested parties can share ideas, address  
concerns, give feedback, and ask questions. Establishing a culture of  
communication early in the process will increase the likelihood of  
the design system taking root.  
Communicating change  
Once the design system is off the ground and is being used in real  
applications, it’s imperative to communicate changes, updates, and  
an ongoing vision to the entire organization.  
The tactics for this communication can vary from nuts-and-bolts  
utilities to more outward-facing marketing efforts. Here are some  
materials that can help communicate change\:  
ɕ Change logs\: “Here’s what’s changed in the pattern library this  
month.”  
ɕ Roadmap\: “Here’s what’s coming up over the next few  
months.”  
ɕ Success stories\: “Team X launched this great new application  
using the design system; read more about how they did it.”  
ɕ Tips and tricks\: “Here are a few best practices and  
considerations for using our system’s buttons throughout your  
application.”  
168 ATOMIC DESIGN Having a base for all these materials is a great idea, and keeping  
them adjacent to \(or even within\) the style guide itself makes a lot  
of sense as well.  
The material design team publishes a handy changelog within its style guide so users can easily  
learn about the latest updates and improvements to the system.  
Design system changes, updates, and requests should be  
communicated wherever your team hangs out. That may include  
Slack, Basecamp, GitHub, wikis, Yammer, email lists, company  
blogs, intranets, and any other internal tools your team uses to  
communicate and collaborate. If that sounds like a lot of work to  
you, fear not! Keeping your team and users updated doesn’t have to  
require a huge manual effort. Thanks to the connected nature of our  
tools, teams can automatically get alerted to changes via software,  
as Micah Sivitz from Shyp explains\:  
Whenever someone makes a pull request, it sends a notification  
to our \#Design slack channel, announcing to the team that  
there is a proposal change and feedback is required.  
- Micah Sivitz, Shyp  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 169 Baking this communication into the team’s everyday workflow keeps  
makers, users, and stakeholders engaged, and helps reassure users  
that the pattern library is being actively maintained and improved.  
Training and support  
You wouldn’t hand someone a hammer, saw, and screwdriver then  
say, “All right, you’ve got what you need; now go and build me a  
beautiful new house.” Knowing how to properly use a tool is often  
even more important than that tool’s availability. Documentation  
in the form of a style guide is no doubt helpful, but by itself it’s  
not enough. It’s essential to provide adequate training and offer  
ongoing support for your design system’s users to ensure they  
successfully get up and running with the tool kit and continue to  
create great work with it.  
Training users how to work with the design system can take many  
forms, including\:  
ɕ Pair sessions\: Nothing beats pulling up a chair and working  
together on a project. While more time-intensive than other  
training vehicles, it’s the best way to get makers and users  
collaborating together, learning how the system works, and  
exposing new opportunities and shortcomings.  
ɕ Workshops\: From immersive full-day sessions to quick walk-  
throughs, it’s incredibly helpful to set up face-to-face training  
workshops involving both makers and users. These sessions can  
help smooth out any misconceptions about the system, help  
level-up users with hands-on guidance, and create a healthy  
relationship between the people in charge of maintaining the  
system and the people in charge of working with it.  
ɕ Webinars\: If workshops or pair sessions aren’t possible, or you  
need to train a lot of users at scale, webinars can be fantastic.  
Users can tune into online sessions to learn about how to  
properly use the system. When conducting webinars, be sure  
to build in plenty of Q&A time to field both audio and typed  
questions, concerns, and comments.  
ɕ Tutorials\: A series of blog posts and screencasts can neatly  
encapsulate core concepts of working with the design system.  
Not only do these help serve as a training tool, but they can  
serve as a great reference to keep coming back to.  
170 ATOMIC DESIGN ɕ Onboarding\: A great way of injecting your design system into  
your company culture is to bake design system training right  
into the onboarding process for new employees. New colleagues  
will understand the importance of modularity, reuse, and all the  
other benefits a design system brings.  
Users will undoubtedly have questions or encounter issues once  
they get up and running and start building things with the design  
system. They need to know there’s a robust support system in place  
to help answer any questions, listen to their requirements, and  
address bugs. There are a host of mechanisms in place to provide  
support for users, including\:  
ɕ Issue trackers\: Tools like JIRA and GitHub Issues are great  
for users and makers to report bugs and have technical  
conversations. Users should be aware of the protocol for filing  
bugs and feel empowered to contribute.  
ɕ Office hours\: Schedule regular times when the design system  
team is available to field questions, address issues, and talk  
about what’s next for the design system.  
ɕ Slack and chat tools\: The real-time nature of many of our  
work collaboration tools presents a huge opportunity to keep  
the pattern-laden conversation going. Thanks to tools like  
Slack, Yammer, and HipChat, makers and users can engage one  
another whenever and wherever.  
ɕ Forums\: Communities like Stack Overflow and GitHub have  
proved to be extremely effective at enabling grassroots,  
community-driven support. Rather than design system makers  
becoming a support bottleneck, it can be worthwhile to open up  
support to the entire user community.  
ɕ Outreach\: Not everyone has the time or the personality to ask  
questions and suggest changes. Design system makers should be  
proactive and reach out to developers using the design system  
to see if they have any issues or concerns. These kinds of actions  
can help build a genuine and positive relationship between  
makers and users.  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 171 The Draft U.S. Web Digital Standards system tracks issues using GitHub, providing a place for users  
and makers to file bugs and have conversations about the nitty-gritty.  
Thanks to tools like GitHub, design system users don’t have to be  
relegated to the role of dumb consumers. The people who use the  
system day in and day out can be extremely valuable contributors to  
the design system if given the chance. Embrace the fact that users  
are eager to pitch in and make the system as great as it can be. Here  
are some tactics for encouraging user contributions\:  
ɕ Suggestions and pull requests\: Encourage anyone using the  
design system to suggest changes and new features. Better yet,  
invite users to submit changes in the form of pull requests that  
can be merged directly back into the codebase.  
ɕ Individual interviews and roundtable discussions\: It’s always  
a good idea to talk to users, so regularly schedule time to chat  
with the people who are touching these patterns on a regular  
basis. Take it all in, listen to both the good and the bad, and  
collectively determine a plan of attack to address any issues and  
suggestions.  
172 ATOMIC DESIGN ɕ Requests for feedback\: Managing a system that can potentially  
be deployed to hundreds of applications can be tricky. Before  
pulling the trigger on decisions that could impact a lot of people,  
ask for opinions\: “We’re considering deprecating our carousel  
pattern and would like to hear what you think.”  
ɕ Surveys\: If interviews aren’t feasible, you can lean on quick  
surveys to get a feel for how effective UI patterns and the style  
guide are. Questions like “On a scale from one to five, how  
useful is the pattern documentation? Any suggestions?” can help  
identify blind spots and get users to suggest features that would  
make their lives easier.  
ɕ Regular “state of the union” meetings\: Schedule regular  
meetings where the design system team discusses the product  
roadmap, lessons learned along the way, and suggestions and  
feedback. Encourage anyone to join the meeting, and be sure to  
record and distribute these sessions so everyone is aware of the  
master plan.  
# Make it public  
Communicating change, evangelizing, and setting up proper  
training and support are all great things to increase your system’s  
visibility. But there’s another big opportunity to take your  
communication strategy to another level\: making your style guide  
publicly accessible.  
Why? Isn’t a style guide merely an internal resource to help people  
in your organization work better together? What use is it to the  
outside world? And wouldn’t publishing your style guide give away  
all your trade secrets?  
Publishing your style guide for the world to see increases its  
visibility, increases accountability, and serves as an amazing  
recruitment tool.  
Putting your style guide behind a login or firewall reduces visibility  
and adds an unnecessary burden to your team and partners, which  
limits the resource’s effectiveness and potential. And the fears  
about giving away your trade secrets are completely unfounded.  
These are UI patterns, not nuclear codes.  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 173 Styleguides.io rounds up over 150 public-facing style guides from organizations across the world.  
In addition to making important documentation easier to access,  
a public style guide helps create organizational accountability.  
Publishing your style guide demonstrates your organization’s  
commitment to the design system, which creates a helpful bit of  
pressure to keep it an up-to-date and useful resource.  
Public-facing style guides are also hugely helpful for recruiting.  
Designers, developers, and people working in other disciplines  
want to work for organizations that embrace modern digital best  
practices, and \(as we’ve discussed throughout this book\) design  
systems are quickly becoming an industry-wide best practice.  
Publishing your style guide sends out a strong Bat-Signal that  
can attract passionate, pattern-minded people. For instance, style  
guide expert Jina Bolton went to work at Salesforce after seeing the  
company’s style guide for their Salesforce1 product.  
When I saw \[Salesforce’s style guide\] I thought it was beautiful  
and it’s why I wanted to join this team.  
- Jina Bolton  
174 ATOMIC DESIGN Since joining Salesforce, she’s helped create the ultra-successful  
Lightning Design System and helps manage their growing design  
system team. Jina’s story is not an isolated one; almost every guest  
Anna Debenham and I interviewed on the Styleguides Podcast  
discussed how helpful their public-facing pattern library was for  
attracting talent. All that means your public style guide makes your  
organization more competitive, not less.  
# Make it bigger  
A visible, cross-disciplinary, approachable pattern library is one  
that your team will come back to again and again. Use that to your  
advantage. Since the team’s eyeballs are already fixated on that  
one resource, there’s a big opportunity to extend it to include other  
helpful documentation like the voice and tone, brand, code, design  
principles and writing guidelines we discussed in chapter 1.  
Intuit’s Harmony design system includes a pattern library, design principles, voice and tone,  
marketing guidelines, and more. Housing this helpful documentation under one roof helps increase  
its visibility and effectiveness.  
Now, your organization may not need to implement every flavor of  
style guide out there, but the point is that creating a centralized  
style guide hub builds more awareness of best practices,  
increasing the documentation’s effectiveness.  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 175 Another way to extend the functionality of the pattern library is to  
include guidelines for native platform patterns alongside web-based  
patterns. We can look to Intuit’s Harmony design system once again  
for an example of how native mobile platform patterns for iOS and  
Android can live beside their web-based counterparts.  
Intuit’s Harmony pattern library includes buttons to switch between web, iOS, and Android for each  
pattern. This allows the team to maintain a mostly consistent design system across platforms but  
also document pattern divergences when they occur.  
# Make it context-agnostic  
The way your UI patterns are named will undoubtedly shape how  
they are used. The more agnostic pattern names are, the more  
versatile and reusable they become.  
Because we tend to establish UI patterns in the context of a broader  
page, it can be tempting to name components based on where they  
live. But rather than naming your component “homepage carousel”  
\(forgive my morbid obsession with carousels\), you can simply call  
it “carousel,” which means you can now put carousels everywhere!  
\(But for the love of all that is holy, please don’t.\)  
Another challenge for naming display patterns is that we tend to  
get distracted by the content patterns that live inside them. For  
instance, if working on an e-commerce site, you may be tempted to  
call a block containing a product image and title a “product card.”  
176 ATOMIC DESIGN But naming things in this manner immediately limits what type of  
content can live inside it. By naming the pattern simply “card,” you  
can put all sorts of content patterns inside it\: products, promotions,  
store locations, and so on.  
Fair warning\: naming things is really freaking hard. But there  
are strategies to help you create robust names for your patterns.  
Conducting an interface inventory \(as detailed in chapter 4\) helps  
remove patterns from the context of the page where they normally  
reside, meaning your team can create names that aren’t distracted  
by their context. I’ve conducted naming exercises with teams where  
we’ve blurred out the content residing inside a pattern so everyone  
can focus on the pattern’s structure rather than the content that lives  
inside it.  
A good exercise when naming patterns is to blur out the content so your names reflect the patterns’  
structures rather than the content living inside them.  
While naming things will always be a challenge, pattern names that  
are agnostic to context and content will be more portable, reusable,  
and versatile.  
# Make it contextual  
Showcasing UI patterns in a pattern library is all well and good,  
but you need to demonstrate context for design system users to  
understand how and where to properly use them. Most pattern  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 177 libraries show a demo of each UI pattern, but as we’ve discussed,  
those patterns don’t live in a vacuum. Where exactly are these  
patterns used?  
One way to demonstrate context might include showing  
screenshots or videos of a component in action. Material design’s  
documentation does a fantastic job at this; each component is  
rich with photos, videos, and usage details to give users a clear  
understanding of what these patterns look like in the context of an  
application, and demonstrate how each pattern should be used.  
Material design’s component library doesn’t just contain an example of each component; it  
thoroughly documents the component’s usage with plenty of images and videos to support it.  
Another way to show context is to provide lineage information for  
each pattern. As we discussed in Chapter 3, a tool like Pattern Lab  
automatically generates this information, letting you see which  
patterns make up any given component in addition to showing  
where each component is employed. This provides a sort of pattern  
paper trail that helps immensely with QA efforts, as it highlights  
exactly which patterns and templates would need to be tested if  
changes were made to a particular pattern.  
178 ATOMIC DESIGN Tools like Pattern Lab provide lineage information, allowing teams to see which smaller components  
are included in any given component, as well as where each pattern gets used.  
# Make it last  
Making a design system is an incredibly and important endeavor.  
But without proper maintenance, the value of your design system  
will depreciate much like a car that’s just been driven off the  
dealer’s lot. Instead, your design system should be like a bottle of  
fine wine that increases in value over time.  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 179 With proper maintenance, your design system should increase in value over time like a bottle of fine  
wine, rather than a used car that’s just been driven off the lot. Image credit\: Sabin Paul Croce on  
Flickr and Ray Larabie on Flickr  
As we’ve discussed throughout this chapter, making your design  
system stand the test of time requires a significant amount of time  
and effort. But isn’t that the case with all living things? Animals  
need to eat, and plants need water and sunlight in order to survive.  
Creating a living design system means giving it attention and care  
in order for it to continue to thrive.  
All that effort not only creates a better present for your  
organization, but sets you up for long-term success. Establishing a  
clear governance plan, communicating change, and implementing  
the other advice found in this chapter helps the design system take  
root and become an integral part of your organization’s workflow.  
Creating the damn thing in the first place is the hard part, but once  
established, you have a solid foundation with which to build on  
for years to come. Even if you were to burn everything down and  
rebuild a new system from the ground up, you’ll find your UIs will  
still need buttons, form fields, tabs, and other existing components.  
And you’ll need a happy home to display and document the system.  
Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater!  
180 ATOMIC DESIGN So there you have it. To make a maintainable design system, you  
should\:  
ɕ Make it official by allocating real time, money, and resources to  
your design system.  
ɕ Make it adaptable by counting on change and establishing a  
clear governance plan.  
ɕ Make it maintainable by seeking the holy grail and making it  
easy to deploy and communicate changes to the design system.  
ɕ Make it cross-disciplinary by making your pattern library a  
watering hole the entire organization can gather around.  
ɕ Make it approachable by making an attractive, easy-to-use  
style guide with helpful accompanying documentation.  
ɕ Make it visible by communicating change, evangelizing the  
design system, and making it public.  
ɕ Make it bigger by including brand, voice and tone, code, design  
principles, and writing guidelines.  
ɕ Make it agnostic by naming patterns according to their  
structure rather than their context or content.  
ɕ Make it contextual by demonstrating what patterns make up a  
particular pattern and showing where each pattern is used.  
ɕ Make it last by laying a solid foundation with which to build on  
for years to come.  
# Go forth and be atomic  
We’re tasked with making a whole slew of products, sites, and  
applications work and look great across a dizzying array of different  
devices, screen sizes, form factors, and environments. I hope that  
the concepts covered in this book give you solid ground to stand  
on as you bravely tackle this increasingly diverse digital landscape.  
By creating design systems, being deliberate in how you construct  
user interfaces, establishing a collaborative and pattern-driven  
workflow, and setting up processes to successfully maintain your  
design system, I hope you and your team can create great things  
together. Go forth and be atomic!  
CHAPTER 5 / MAINTAINING DESIGN SYSTEMS 181 Thanks & Acknowledgements  
This book is dedicated to my amazing wife Melissa, who supports  
all of my crazy ideas and somehow puts up with all of my shit.  
Thank you. I love you.  
I’d like to give a massive thank you to Dave Olsen, who took my  
nascent, poorly programmed Pattern Lab concept and transformed  
it into a legit and amazing piece of software. Thanks to the tireless  
work of Dave and Brian Muenzenmeyer, Pattern Lab is helping  
teams all over the world create atomic design systems. I’m forever  
grateful for all of your superb work, and consider myself fortunate  
to call you friends.  
To Josh Clark and Dan Mall for helping solidify atomic design as a  
methodology and for writing the foreword to this book. You trusted  
me enough to run with this approach and somehow convinced our  
clients it wasn’t totally insane. Without your input and the crazy-  
smart brains of early collaborators like Jennifer Brook, Jonathan  
Stark, Robert Gorrell, Kelly Shaver, and Melissa Frost, this book  
wouldn’t have existed.  
Thanks to Owen Gregory for copyediting the book’s manuscript  
and taking on the Herculean task of making me sound reasonably  
coherent. Thanks to Rachel Andrew for wrangling all the technical  
stuff that goes into making ebooks. And a big thanks to Rachel  
Arnold Sager for all your work getting the print version of the book  
laid out and ready for the printer.  
To Anna Debenham for all your amazing thinking about front-end  
style guides, your book on the topic, and your willingness to co-host  
a podcast all about style guides with me. I’m proud of the work  
we’ve done on Styleguides.io and I'm so happy we got to work  
together.  
To Jonathan Snook for your fantastic SMACSS methodology,  
and for taking the time to guide me through the process of self-  
publishing a book. Thanks for making such a scary endeavor a lot  
more approachable.  
182 ATOMIC DESIGN To Stephen Hay, who was the first person I heard articulate the  
need to break interfaces into smaller pieces. Thanks for being a  
continued source of wisdom and sarcasm.  
To Andy Clarke, who was talking about design systems and atoms  
before it was the hip thing to do. Thank you for all your writing and  
thinking, but you’re still not getting my dog.  
To Dave “Tiny Bootstraps” Rupert, Susan Robertson, Samantha  
Warren, Jina Bolton, Nathan Curtis, Paul Robert Lloyd, Harry  
Roberts, Nicole Sullivan, Brett Jankord, Tyler Sticka, Lincoln  
Mongillo, Nicholas Gallagher and the many others who have  
advanced the concepts of design systems, pattern libraries, and  
style guides. Thanks for helping me and so many others think more  
modularly.  
To Jeffrey Zeldman, Eric Meyer, Marc Thiele, Vitaly Friedman, and  
all the other conference organizers who gave me the opportunity to  
stumble onto the stage to ramble on about the concepts contained  
in this book.  
This book would not have been possible if it weren’t for the  
amazing work done by some amazing people in the web community.  
I’m so incredibly fortunate to work in such an open, sharing, and  
collaborative community; every day I look forward to learning new  
things from you all.  
And last, but certainly not least, thanks so much to my family for all  
your love and amazing support over the years.

190 ATOMIC DESIGN About the Author  
Brad Frost is a web designer, speaker,  
consultant, and musician located in  
beautiful Pittsburgh, PA. He’s passionate  
about creating web experiences that look  
and function beautifully on a never-  
ending stream of connected devices,  
and loves helping others do the same.  
He’s helped create several tools and resources for web designers,  
including Pattern Lab \(with Dave Olsen and Brian Muenzenmeyer\),  
Styleguides.io \(with Anna Debenham\), This Is Responsive, WTF  
Mobile Web \(with Jen Simmons\), and Mobile Web Best Practices.  
ABOUT THE AUTHOR 191 We’re tasked with making interfaces for more users in more  
contexts using more browsers on more devices with more screen  
sizes and more capabilities than ever before. That’s a daunting  
task indeed. Thankfully, design systems are here to help.  
Atomic Design details all that goes into creating and maintaining  
robust design systems, allowing you to roll out higher quality,  
more consistent UIs faster than ever before. This book  
introduces a methodology for thinking of our UIs as thoughtful  
hierarchies, discusses the qualities of effective pattern libraries,  
and showcases techniques to transform your team’s design and  
development workflow.  
To boldly go beyond “pages.” That’s the universe of modern design,  
and there’s no better guide to exploring it than Brad Frost. In Atomic  
Design, he replaces our outdated, closed workflows with exciting new  
collaborative ones, and teaches us to design not just pages but systems.  
Recommended for all web and interaction designers.  
- Jeffrey Zeldman, author, Designing With Web Standards  
Brad is suggesting that we’d be better web designers if we thought of  
what we’re building as a system. A hierarchical system that fits together  
to form larger parts. Because, spoiler alert, it is and we would be.  
- Chris Coyier, CSS Tricks
