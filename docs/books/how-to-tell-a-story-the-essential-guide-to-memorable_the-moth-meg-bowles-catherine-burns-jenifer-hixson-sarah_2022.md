It was one of those unseasonably warm New York evenings. We  
were at Cooper Union, and it was my first Moth event. I had  
rehearsed several times with the other storytellers, including a  
comedian, a New Yorker magazine staff writer, and a firefighter.  
We were all there from our different walks of life to tell our sto-  
ries. We were all in the same vulnerable boat. No notes, no  
memorization, nothing to paint with, except our memory, imag-  
ination, and courage.  
I was terrified. I was in the middle of a story about the scar on  
my arm. It was so quiet. I could hear people in the first row of the  
auditorium breathing. Why the total silence? Why had I said yes to  
getting up in front of eight hundred human beings, who had paid  
good money, to lay myself bare and embarrass myself in this way?  
I was there because I believe in the supreme power of story-  
telling. It’s been the one through line in all my work. It’s really  
the only superpower we humans have. Think about it. The cheetah  
is faster, the elephant stronger, the eagle can soar much higher  
than any Olympic pole vaulter. Storytelling is the best thing  
about being human. And I believe it can change the world. That’s  
right. Stories can and do change the world.  
I hope this book you are holding in your hands will help you  
\_ believe it too. \: xvi HOW TO TELL A STORY  
The patient and professional story coaxers at The Moth know  
the power of storytelling. They assured me when I first met with  
them more than a decade ago that everyone has at least one story  
to tell. It’s all in the way you tell it. You are encouraged to remem-  
ber texture, detail, sense memory, and what you felt like when  
the story first took place. These exercises make you listen to  
yourself, and in doing so, they unlock the true power of  
storytelling.  
And to understand each other better, we need a true diversity  
of stories, from a diversity of people. We need to hear, feel, and  
understand what it’s like to walk in each other’s shoes. This is  
what drove me to make my documentary series Taste the Nation,  
which is about immigrant and indigenous food and life in the  
United States. It was important to hear these stories from the  
people who actually lived them. Sharing their experiences on a  
mainstream platform helped viewers better understand their  
fellow Americans. The process of unearthing the stories left me  
with the belief that it’s always possible to learn something new  
about the human condition.  
Every time I hear a Moth story, I am reminded of this fact. For  
twenty-five years, The Moth has been uncovering the most com-  
pelling stories around us. It has brought so much listening pleasure  
as well as pathos to our ears. It has shown us, through real-life  
storytellers from all walks oflife, what it means to be fully human.  
Our stories tell us who we are, who we were, and who we  
hope to be. They're how we form our very identity. The stories  
we carry with us contain our lineage, hopes, dreams, and pain.  
They tell, too, of our anxieties about ourselves, the world, and  
our place in it. Stories are how we keep our collective history  
alive.  
That night at Cooper Union, somewhere in the middle of  
struggling to find my way through the deafening silence, I knew  
that my story was about more than just the scar on my arm. The  
wonderful folks at The Moth had helped me trust myself, to  
believe in the value of my story in all its gory and glorious details. FOREWORD XVII  
I needed to be brave. To be courageous enough to look at the  
truth of our lives through our remembered experience is to be  
changed by it.  
My tale began with a car crash that led to the scar on my arm,  
but through my retelling that night, I realized it was about some-  
thing much deeper than flesh. My story was about the often cruel  
and erratic nature of existence, losing faith in God, and the long  
path to finding my spirituality again through motherhood. That  
journey and the reliving of it on that stage also gave me newfound  
empathy for my own mother.  
And the silence that terrified me? It was the sound of others  
listening. It was the sound of human connection. The audience  
was right there with me, suspended and bound in the shared  
experience of storytelling.  
You don’t need to be a writer to be a storyteller.  
Your story is enough.

. de ree INTRODUCTION  
In June 2015, I was given the life-changing opportunity to pitch  
a story to Catherine Burns, artistic director of The Moth. Asa  
longtime fan and audience member, I was thrilled—and terrified.  
I often listened to Moth stories to be transported out of my own  
life, and to be transformed by the entertaining, deeply moving,  
and amazing lives of others. Now The Moth was calling me! Did  
I even have a story to tell?  
Adrenaline \(born of excitement and fear\) surged through my  
veins. This was a chance to hone my own storytelling craft with  
experts, and maybe even to be heard by Moth audiences all  
around the world.  
Storytelling lies at the heart of my professional life. As a pro-  
fessor of critical media studies, much of my teaching involves  
finding stories that can transform abstract concepts and history  
into relatable and compelling experiences. As an organizer striv-  
ing to make institutions more equitable, effective storytelling can  
not only dismantle false narratives but also cut through intractable  
political divides to reveal how power is currently working, how  
we got here, and what needs to be done. As a journalist, great  
stories are the beating heart of impactful reporting, essays, and  
narrative-nonfiction audio productions. -  
For all of these reasons, I enthusiastically accepted the invitation. xx HOW TO TELL A STORY  
But as soon as I hung up, I felt a fluttering of fear in my chest. My  
own stories had made friends and family laugh, but they were  
really just short anecdotes told to people who were being gener-  
ous. To make matters worse, my experience as a hip-hop artist  
had taught me that there’s a big difference between telling a funny  
story to a couple of friends and telling it to hundreds or thousands  
of strangers. On stage, everything but the power of your story is  
stripped away, and it is very easy to fall flat. The few times this  
happened to me, it felt like nothing could remove the stench of  
doom from the air.  
After an hour, the fluttering in my chest turned into panic.  
Every time I tried to summon a potential story from my past, a  
crowd of critical voices in my head would quickly impale it with  
a flurry of criticism\: No one cares about this. Get over yourself. You’ve  
never saved a life. Why do you get to stand in front of people and talk about  
your weird silly stuff? Jay Allison, the longtime producer of The  
Moth Radio Hour, had introduced me to The Moth team, and I  
reached out to him to explain my predicament. Jay told me,  
“Well, Chenjerai, Moth stories can be deeply inspirational, but  
they’re very different from the exclusively heroic or positive tales  
that some other places invite you to tell. I don’t know where you'll  
end, but asa place to start, remember that everyone is entertained  
by, and relates to, a train wreck. Stories about failure and learning  
can be powerful.”  
Failure! That was something I had a lot of. I could definitely  
remember and tell a story about that.  
Up until this point in my life, \[had presented myself, and been  
taken seriously, as a scholar, organizer, journalist, and hip-hop  
artist. Stories about the confusing, awkward, and downright  
embarrassing parts of my life, and the lessons that might be  
learned from them, had been pushed to the margins of my mind.  
They would spill out, poorly developed, at family dinners or on  
dates, or in the classroom. My friends and family and students  
welcomed the best parts of these stories and tolerated the rest.  
The pounding in my chest calmed enough for me to start INTRODUCTION XxI  
reflecting and jotting down some notes. My best bet was a  
story about some funny and painful moments in my career as a  
hip-hop artist.  
By the time my group, the Spooks, finished our last tour in  
2005, we had earned gold singles in three countries and a gold  
album in the UK, and had performed in front of more than a  
million people. After my music career slowed down, I was forced  
to learn new skills, figure out new ways to sustain myself, and  
forge a new identity—but I never really processed or properly  
mourned this tumultuous shift in my circumstances.  
When I was ready, I called Catherine, and she listened closely  
and supportively as I ran through several story possibilities.  
Breathlessly, I shared the story of meeting Laurence Fishburne on  
my own music video set as the Spooks were taking off. But I took  
forever to get to the main point, losing the thread several times  
along the way. Another anecdote involved me botching an Excel  
spreadsheet at a temp job. It was meant to illustrate the tragicom-  
edy of my post-fame life, but I stretched it out far too long and  
included a wealth of irrelevant details. I also told Catherine about  
meeting Laurence Fishburne for the second time, while working  
as a security guard at a film festival. But this time I had hidden  
from him, ashamed of my humbled station in life \(and my  
JCPenney suit\). It was a meandering, sloppy affair with a sad,  
deflating ending.  
After listening closely, Catherine recognized the seeds of a  
story—something that had elements of humor, tragedy, and  
drama, and would likely resonate with a lot of people. I use the  
term seeds because clearly my story wasn’t developed yet. When I  
first shared my story, I thought that having been famous—  
and then not—was the point of the story, and that meeting  
Fishburne twice was the punchline. I thought the ending of the  
story was me in my humiliated state. None of those initial  
instincts was correct.  
The lack of an ending was crucial. Laughing with me,  
\_ Catherine pointed this out by saying, “Wow, that second time Xx\] HOW TO TELL A STORY  
you saw Laurence feels so awkward and terrible. But I feel like  
that’s not the ending. I mean, you seem to be doing much better  
now. What happened?” When she asked this, something emo-  
tional and planetary moved inside of me. I didn’t know what  
happened. I didn’t have an ending because, even though my life  
had moved forward, some part of Chenjerai was still standing  
there in that JCPenney suit, feeling defeated and small.  
A day or so before the live show, the storytellers meet and  
share their stories for final notes and tweaks. This is a scary but  
ultimately beautiful part of The Moth’s process.  
I will never forget my first rehearsal. The day before, I was  
attending a protest in South Carolina. The rehearsal was going to  
be in person at The Moth’s offices. This meant that I had to drive  
from Clemson to New York. The good news was that the twelve-  
hour drive gave me plenty of time to rehearse my story. But it also  
allowed time for doubt to creep in. Was I really driving to another  
state to tell a story in front of one thousand people? With no  
music? Because one person in New York told me that this story is  
interesting? Maybe I needed to tell a more political story. After  
all, I was not here to simply entertain people. I became so filled  
with doubt and confusion that I called Catherine and proposed  
telling a different story. Catherine listened and was fully open to  
this. But her questions helped me realize that if1 was going to tell  
a political story, I should put the same time and effort into it that  
I had put into this one. I think she also understood that my sudden  
passion for this new idea was a by-product of second-guessing the  
story I was currently planning to tell.  
By the time I arrived in New York, I was back to telling story  
number one. But my doubt returned when other storytellers  
started confidently weaving their own tales at rehearsal. This  
anxiety didn’t last long, however. Moth listeners have a special  
way of holding storytellers up by laughing at what’s funny,  
“wow’’-ing at what is genuinely shocking, nodding in validating  
affirmation, and even shedding tears when moved. As soon as I  
shared my first punchline, the room laughed, and I felt better. INTRODUCTION xxi  
Relief flooded my body and I felt that I was hanging out with  
friends—that we were all going to make each other stronger and  
support each other through the process. My point here is that the  
horrifying feeling of pressure was necessary, because by the time  
I got to the big stage, I had already faced my fears.  
As I got closer to the show, I remembered a turning point in  
my story. I was applying for a new temp job, feeling defeated,  
wearing the same JCPenney suit, when I heard a Spooks song  
playing and I saw people in the temp office enjoying it. This  
reminded me that the power of my music wasn’t contingent on  
my own fame or hanging with celebrities. It was about the joy of  
dreaming up and shaping my art. The office workers were enjoy-  
ing what I had made, and they reminded me of the power and joy  
I had felt creating it.  
In the final scene of my story, I talked about sharing a lesson  
with my students\: Follow your passions, but be prepared to brace  
for impact. And after going to sleep thinking hard about the core  
message of my story, I woke up with the line “Sometimes you  
have to figure out who you're not before you can become who  
you are.”  
When I tried this line at the rehearsal, I felt the swell of recog-  
nition and affirmation wash over the room. Catherine nodded  
confidently in a way she hadn’t before and said, “Yes! That’s it.  
That’s the ending.”  
The Moth team lovingly pushed me toward a stronger  
ending—the real ending—and helped me recognize when I had  
found it.  
The Moth helped me understand that this was not simply a  
story about Laurence Fishburne, or even about fame. It was about  
being on the wrong path in life, having the courage to try things,  
and figuring out where our strengths really lie. It was about not  
letting the roller coaster of success and failure that all of us expe-  
rience lock us into the wrong identity or kill the lifelong magic,  
wonder, and power that should continue to live inside of us.  
This process helped me to understand this period of my life xxIv\_ HOW TO TELL A STORY  
better, not simply by imposing a narrative on it, but by allowing  
me to see this broken part of myselfas part of the journey to how  
I got to where I am now. I think that’s true of so many Moth  
stories. People love The Moth because there really is medicine for  
others in each of our stories, and since I’ve shared mine, I’ve  
hugged, shaken hands with, and listened to so many people who  
related to my journey of discovery. Even friends and family mem-  
bers who knew some pieces of the story have told me that they  
understand me better after listening.  
The Moth prompted me to take myself seriously as a story-  
teller. They asked me to reflect on my life experiences and  
consider how they might resonate with other people. This lesson  
matters tremendously in a culture where so many of us grow up  
learning that only certain people are storytellers and only their  
stories about their extraordinary lives are worth listening to and  
investing in. My first Moth invitation was the opposite of that. I  
was being told something that everyone should be told, some-  
thing that this book is telling you right now\: You have important  
stories to tell. They are stories that no one else can tell. But you  
have to be willing to do the work of developing them—and then  
work through your fears to share them.  
What’s crucial to recognize is that taking me seriously as a  
storyteller didn’t mean that The Moth staff validated everything  
I said or propped up all my bad ideas and rambling, pointless  
anecdotes. In some ways, their commitment to me—and to all of  
us as storytellers—meant the opposite. I had an open invitation  
to tell stories, and they had my permission to listen closely and  
respond honestly, laughing at what was funny, wrinkling their  
faces at things that seemed problematic, asking questions about  
things that were unclear, and nodding calmly at things that were  
interesting but not essential. By the end of my first experience  
working with The Moth’s directors, I would learn that, like all of  
us, I desperately needed to work through these uncertain  
moments, which were like raging wild rivers inside my body.  
This book is an invitation for you to take yourself seriously as INTRODUCTION xxv  
a storyteller-—to discover your stories, center what’s most import-  
ant about them, initiate yourself in the fire of live performance,  
and use your truths to break down false narratives, whether that’s  
on stage or over dinner with a friend. So, welcome! But brace  
yourself\: This process will take you to new places, connect you  
to new people, and unlock new layers of who you are.

WELCOME TO THE MOTH  
You are a multitude of stories. Every joy and heartbreak, every  
disappointment and dizzying high—each has contributed to the  
complex, one-of-a-kind person that you are today.  
While your experiences are ephemeral, your stories can  
be eternal.  
As we know from ancient scrolls, cave paintings, and the his-  
tories passed down by word of mouth from generation to  
generation, people have been telling stories since the beginning  
of time. The first utterance from one person to another is the  
earliest ancestor of The Moth.  
What do you think the first story ever told might have been  
about? Maybe it was just a series of screeches and howls. Screeches,  
howls, and pantomime probably did an okay job in a pinch.  
Language developed out of necessity. “There is water over there.  
Look out for the bear. I found some berries. Damn, fire is hot.”  
And eventually, “I went to go look for some berries, but I saw a  
bear, so I came back to sit by the fire, where I feel safe.” Perhaps  
all the first stories were cautionary tales that helped save lives, and  
that’s why we’re so hardwired to want, crave, and treasure them.  
Beyond the essentials \(“Water here. Berries here. Bear there!”’\),  
we long for more to make sense of the world around us. Over  
time, storytelling has evolved to serve many purposes, some 4 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
practical or frivolous, others righteous or evil, still others roman-  
tic, entertaining, cautionary, or incendiary. Sharing stories aloud  
is one of humankind’s best attributes—our magical ability to  
shape-shift into each other’s imaginations with the spoken word.  
Because we have the capacity for imagination, stories bring other  
people’s experiences to life, so we can see, and very often feel,  
events that didn’t happen to us.  
When you choose to share a story, you share a piece of your-  
self. Stories explain your heart, decode your history, decipher  
who you are, and translate it all to whoever takes the time to listen  
carefully. They're what make families, friendship, and love pos-  
sible. They’re both ordinary and exquisite. Stories are the  
currency of community. They tear down walls, unite cultures,  
and help people realize they are more alike than different, all  
while celebrating what is unique to you.  
Beyond survival, stories enhance our lives, deepen our bonds,  
and, if we tell them right, get us invited back to dinner parties. A  
well-crafted story helps you create a magical sort of clarity. It can  
illuminate an experience your audience could not have fathomed  
a few minutes before, or draw them so close that they imagine  
they can feel your heart beating. You could make them laugh out  
loud or bring tears to their eyes or stir them to action. You might  
make them feel seen.  
Time and again, your stories will reveal larger truths about  
yourself, and sometimes they'll point you in the direction of  
where you'll want to go next. When you craft a story, you hold  
each piece of your life up to the light and say, “Yes, that mattered”  
or “No, that wasn’t what I thought it was at all” and often “WOW,  
I did not realize this affected me so deeply.”  
Storytelling is vital to being alive. So know that you're not  
getting out of this! You will be telling stories. In fact, you have been  
telling stories. Every day. Since you started talking.  
This book will help you tell better stories. WELCOME TO THE MOTH 5  
WHY “THE MOTH”?  
The Moth is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the art and  
craft of storytelling, helping storytellers around the world—old  
hands and novices alike—hone their stories before telling them  
live to packed-out audiences. The rules are simple\: The stories  
must be true and they must be told without notes. A wise mattress  
salesperson once quipped, “You spend a third of your life in bed.  
Sleep in the best bed you can find!” Nobody can say for sure what  
fraction of your life you spend telling stories, but most would  
agree it’s a significant and important portion of your self-  
expression, so it’s worth investing your time and energy in the  
skills you need to be a great storyteller. The Moth is here to help.  
Most of us have a few fun anecdotes that we end up telling  
again and again, the greatest hits that we pull out on dates or  
when meeting people for the first time. We tell them at parties  
and work functions and across kitchen tables. We might work  
them into the conversation at an otherwise boring cocktail party  
\(“In case of social emergency, break glass!’’\). In the pages that  
follow, we will teach you how to turn those anecdotes into stories  
that mean something to you and give you the tools to deliver  
them with confidence and grace.  
This book is not Aristotle’s Poetics, Joseph Campbell’s The  
Hero’s Journey, or Scheherazade’s thousand and one tales. There  
are plenty of books on storytelling through the ages \(read them  
all!\). In this book, Moth directors help you shape and tell your  
own personal story, using decades of on-the-ground experience  
as the guides and midwives of the stories that grew The Moth  
from an exclusively New York series to a renowned global arts  
institution dedicated to building connection and community  
through true personal stories. 6 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
MOTH FOUNDER GEORGE DAWES GREEN, ON THE INSPIRATION  
BEHIND THE MOTH\: It’s hard to imagine now but back in 1997, when  
some dear friends and | launched The Moth, the idea that nights of per-  
sonal stories might be worthy of assembling an audience seemed a  
reach. Personal stories were seen as just that\: personal, not public, not  
to be shared with an audience. But all my life I’d noticed the mysterious  
power of the personal narrative.  
. Aporchful of siblings and cousins at a beach house near Savannah,  
Georgia. My aunt Alice giving us her memories of our great-grandmother  
Big Inez, imperious matriarch of Waynesboro, Georgia. | remember  
noticing that the story seemed to be happening to Aunt Alice as she  
spoke the words. And happening to all of uswith her, drawing us together  
as we listened.  
Anight when my shy father, after one and a half glasses of rye whis-  
key, conjured forth, for my neighborhood pals, a boyhood rafting trip on  
the Ohio River. Again\: As lovely as the story was, | was even more taken  
by the silent hum of the /istening—the strangely deep empathy of these  
ten-year-old kids for a man they hardly knew. Because his story trans-  
ported them to that river.  
And then once, in the early ‘90s, | was at a poetry slam at the  
Nuyorican Poets Café and a poet was reciting something long and surre-  
alistic, in that dead-poetry singsong that was all the rage then, and | was  
drifting off—as the whole audience was.  
Thenasmall thing happened.  
The poet finished her poem, then paused and said, “So this next  
poem is about . . . when my grandfather used to take me fishing. He'd  
wake me at four a.m. and we’d get in his station wagon, and this was back  
when station wagons had real wooden sides, and we'd arve me .  
this stream, and we'd fish all day for brown trout .  
| looked around. Everyone was giving their full attention. Fora \_  
moment, there was no trace of the sacred veil that separated artist from  
audience. We were all right there with her as though her memories were  
our own—and then she cleared her throat and went back to the singsong,  
and whoosh\: Down came the veil again. WELCOME TO THE MOTH 7  
| thought, Let’s have a night ofthe stories that poets use to introduce  
their poems, without the poems. | loved poetry, but how splendid to not  
have that veil!  
The notion of nights of stories took root in my head and started to  
grow.  
lt was an idea I'd take down from its shelf in my skull now and then,  
to play with, to add to. When | was walking to a café in the East Village, or  
riding the subway, |’d be concocting these evenings. Each night could be  
anchored by a central theme\: “Fish Tails” \(stories of catching fish or  
cooking fish\). “Cuba Libre!” “Civil Rights.” “Sheer Survival.” Each eve-  
ning, | thought, should feature a guest curator, an artist or writer or dancer  
or fisherman; we’d help them find a slate of raconteurs and assist in  
giving the stories direction and shape. For almost all the nights, we’d have  
smallish audiences—intimacy was key. We’d find compelling music  
pegged to the theme. We'd look for outlandish venues\: a barge for “Fish  
Tails,” a Cuban bar for “Cuba Libre!,” a graveyard for “Sheer Survival.”  
| started seeking advice. Many of my friends were baffled, resistant.  
They said, “Nights of music, sure, with maybe just one story—so people  
don’t get bored?” Or, “Why not find ‘traditional’ storytellers, and gear it  
toward kids!”  
But there was also steady, loving support, and gentle pressure. And  
finally, one night, at her apartment on West Fourth Street, Gaby Tana  
talked me into just going for it.  
“Well, okay,” | said. “One. We'll try one Moth. Just to see.”  
When Moth founder George Dawes Green held the first offi-  
cial Moth event in the living room of his New York City  
apartment in 1997, it was with these expressed goals\: Some people  
will tell stories. One at a time. No one will interrupt them. No  
one will interject that their uncle did the same thing. No one will  
one-up that person by saying they had two aunts and a brother-in-  
law who did that thing too. No one will ask to pass the gravy. The  
storyteller will have the floor for a time, and people will listen. 8 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
PEGI VAIL, FOUNDING BOARD MEMBER\: The stakes felt high that  
evening. We were reintroducing the idea of storytelling, stripped  
back to its bare bones. Would they like it?  
That first night was a bit bumpy, but by the end, everyone in  
the room felt they had been transported to new places. It felt like  
art, simply because stories, honored with space and time, are  
transformative. One night led to many nights and a movement  
took hold. And though those first few years were a little rocky  
\(and nearly depleted George’s bank account\), the spirit of that first  
night can be felt on Moth stages to this day.  
WHY TRUE STORIES?  
There is a powerful connection that comes from hearing someone  
share their memories and lived experiences. Some Moth stories  
feature first-person accounts from peoplé who've lived through  
events we've only read about in history books. Sala Udin took us  
deep into 1965 and the civil rights movement with stories of his  
life as a Freedom Rider. Dr. Mary-Claire King shared how she  
won the grant that led to her discovery of the BRCA gene. Dr.  
Kodi Azari took us through the harrowing surgery of the first  
transplant of a human hand. Flora Hogman told us about being a  
hidden child during the Holocaust. Hearing an eyewitness  
account from Rick Hauck, an astronaut who piloted the first  
shuttle mission after the loss of the Challenger, allowed us to be  
there with him when he landed in triumph.  
You don’t need to have made headlines to tell a fantastically  
gripping personal story. Eva Santiago told us of falling in love  
with her soulmate, Christopher, while he was incarcerated. Kim  
Reed shared what it was like to go home to Montana after her  
gender transition, where she was celebrated as the star high school  
quarterback. Jenny Allen described an embarrassing mishap with  
a wig while undergoing cancer treatment. Marvin Gelfand WELCOME TO THE MOTH 9  
remembered the freedom and independence he felt after getting  
his first library card. Gabrielle Shea told us about the perils of  
messing up the Thanksgiving mac and cheese for her potential  
in-laws. We rode shotgun with Adam Wade on his teenage Friday  
evening drives with his aunt and his yia yia.  
Some stories take a sweeping episode of history and break  
moments or interactions down into smaller, more intimate  
scenes. Others take what might seem like an ordinary event \(get-  
ting your driver’s license, a first kiss, the first time you voted\) and  
imbue it with all the magic you may have felt in that moment. In  
both cases, the authenticity of the teller is vital. We listen with  
different ears when we can feel and believe that a story is true.  
And so, true became the guiding principle for Moth stories.  
NEIL GAIMAN, MOTH STORYTELLER AND BOARD MEMBER\: How  
important is truth in these first-person stories? Lying is like play-  
ing solitaire and cheating\: It takes the fun out.  
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE LISTEN  
As The Moth grew out of that cozy living room and onto stages  
around the world, the creative minds at The Moth listened to the  
stories. Tens of thousands of them and counting. And through it  
all, the people who created the space for these stories and directed  
the tellers and told that guy in the back on his cellphone to knock  
it off and take it outside—those people took note of what makes  
the strongest stories. What pulls at your heart, makes your blood  
boil, your belly laugh, your eyes widen, or your brain tick. The  
Moth learned secrets about stories that really make you feel some-  
thing both familiar and foreign.  
Some of the best nights at The Moth can seem as though the  
storyteller and everyone in the audience are breathing the same  
breath. With each story, every brain in the room fires together.  
The hearts share beats per minute. — 10 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Imagine how excited we were when we learned that this feel-  
ing is backed up by science! A study led by neuroscientist Uri  
Hasson found that when a person is listening and comprehending  
a story, their brain activity begins to couple, or align, with the  
brain of the teller. The scientific term is “speaker-listener neural  
coupling.” MRI scans of two brains,-one talking, one listening,  
showed that the brains began to sync. Where the teller’s brain  
showed activity, or “lit up,” soon after, the listener’s brain lit up  
too. One catch is that this only happens when the listener is  
engaged and comprehending the story being told. In short, if you  
want to spark another person’s brain, your story needs to be good.  
This book will help you light up some brains.  
FATOU WURIE, MOTH STORYTELLER\: We left Sierra Leone and were  
displaced for over eleven years because of the civil war. My  
mother, deeply connected to her family, was left figuring the  
world out without her safe place—her mother, aunts, father,  
brothers, and extended family—to guide her journey as a young  
mother and wife. She would spend the whole day singing songs  
or speaking out loud to herself in her native language, Mende.  
She would pull my sisters and me close and tell us about her  
childhood. We didn’t always understand all the details, but seeing  
our mother light up while telling us stories made us light up too.  
Her excitement became our excitement, her sorrow our sorrow,  
and so on. Telling those stories is what kept my mother alive, kept  
her heart beating through loss after loss after loss—that is how I  
came to understand the power of storytelling.  
Imagine a room full of people listening—their brains align-  
ing. There is power in millions of strangers experiencing one  
person’s story. These darkened theaters and airwaves where peo-  
ple of different faiths and backgrounds listen together push us all  
to question our long-held beliefs—and what we thought was true  
before we listened is cracked, crushed, or finally cemented.  
At The Moth you can hear stories from people you know, WELCOME TO THE MOTH 11  
people you thought you knew, and people you might never meet  
otherwise. We may start as strangers, but by the end of the story,  
we are closer—and that is the ultimate point. The act of sharing  
personal stories builds empathy, and out of many stories, we  
become one community.  
It starts with a single story. ' é \~ =

NO NOTES, NO NET  
Storytelling is sacred; it is how we keep the dead living, and the living thriv-  
ing. It’s howwe show upas our most authentic self. It can permeate artificial  
boundaries of race, borders, gender, language, and unequal power. It is the  
language of the heart, reflecting the breadth of our humanity as individuals  
and as a collective.  
—FATOU WURIE, MOTH STORYTELLER  
There are many forms of storytelling across time and cultures;  
this book will cover what we call “Moth-style” storytelling\:  
sharing a true personal story, out loud and without any notes.  
It’s not always easy to sell a potential storyteller on the idea that  
they should get up ona stage to talk about themselves. “Like, why  
would I want to do that?”  
We tell them, it’s different for everyone. For some it’s the thrill  
of the ride and the opportunity to finally own the spotlight. For  
others, the more reluctant, we say, it'll help you look under your  
psychological bed and scare away what haunts you. It'll help you  
Humpty Dumpty yourself back together again. It’l\] help someone  
who’s going through the same thing and could use a road map.  
It’s your chance to change the tune, or set the record straight. It'll 14 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
make you friends or help you identify your enemies. Instead  
of rushing through life, it’s an opportunity to stop, sit back,  
and reflect.  
Believe it or not, people you've never met will line up to hear  
from you. The real you. Over the many years of The Moth, we've  
seen audiences of millions from around the globe gather to hear  
individual stories that reflect the world we are living in.  
What an extraordinary passport to experience the world from  
your point of view, to walk for ten minutes next to you and hear  
one of your stories.  
Early on, we established and refined a few parameters for  
Moth-style storytelling. While rules may feel restrictive, we  
believe these limitations fuel creativity\:  
Moth stories are true and told out loud, in the first person.  
Moth stories are not read or recited.  
Moth stories always involve stakes and some sort of transformation.  
Moth stories are told within a specific time frame.  
We will explore the why and how of each of these rules in  
more depth, but in our experience—without a doubt—they are  
the foundation of what makes a story successful.  
YOUR VERY OWN MOTH DIRECTOR  
If you've heard a story that you loved on The Moth Radio Hour,  
The Moth podcast, or at a live Moth Mainstage show, you should  
know that most tellers weren’t up there alone. What you heard  
was a collaboration. Each Mainstage teller—whether discovered  
at an open mic StorySLAM or on the Moth Pitchline, or over-  
heard recounting a wild story while waiting in the queue at  
Boots—is paired with a Moth director who helps uncover and NO NOTES, NONET 15  
shape the story, and shepherd it to the stage. \(You should consider  
this book your own personal director!\)  
The process always starts with a conversation where we mine  
for ideas. Perhaps you've already scrounged around in the mem-  
ory pantry and have an inkling of a story. Or perhaps you’re  
completely stumped for ideas, so we ask questions like\:  
¢ What are moments from your life, big or small, that stick  
with you?  
¢ What are the stories you can’t wait to tell a new friend, or  
the stories your oldest friend or partner always asks you to  
repeat?  
¢ Whatare The Greatest Hits of You?  
We listen to your answers, and then we ask more questions,  
many of which you will find in this book. We ask about every-  
thing that was happening in your life when the story took place.  
Why was this significant for you? We ask about your backstory  
and the things that led to this particular moment. What was dif-  
ferent? Why does it stand out for you? We’ll listen for hesitations  
and stumbles—anything that indicates perhaps there is more  
under the surface. \(There’s gold in those pauses!\)  
Sometimes the answer will include “It was the first time,” “It  
was the Jast time,” “It was the worst time,” or “It was the best  
time” —and we work from there. How was this time different  
from all the other times?  
Once we start to focus on a story, we ask the teller to consider  
a few bigger, often harder-to-answer questions.  
¢ What is this story ultimately about for you?  
¢ Why is this story important for you to tell?  
¢ How would you describe yourself at the beginning of the  
story, and who had you become by the end?  
These questions aren’t always easy to answer right away. The  
process helps you find the answers. By asking these questions, we  
are able to help you find the direction and heart of the story and 16 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
get a general sense of how you changed, which helps to define the  
overall arc.  
Once we get a good focus on the story, we start to look for the  
best way to tell it. We identify scenes and details that can bring  
the story to life. We ask you, “If this were a movie, what scenes  
would keep us glued to our seats?” Retrace every step, describe it  
in Technicolor. We often ask that you “blow it up big” and look  
at every detail you could play with, and then pick the very best  
and shiniest.  
Then we work on structure. Is there a smaller story within the  
larger experience that might make the story more interesting or  
relatable? For instance, in Amy Biancolli’s story about the death  
of her husband, we encouraged her to push into the detail of her  
wedding ring and use it to tell the story of their life together,  
bringing us to the moment she finally decided it was time to take  
the ring off.  
After that first phone call or meeting, we create an outline  
with bullets of how the story might be structured, with questions  
to consider at various points. The bones of the story are identified,  
constructed, and reconstructed, because the outline might  
change as we uncover something new. Like shoes, you gotta try  
things on! Sometimes they look great on the mannequin but the  
heels are too high for you, or they make a clacking noise when  
you walk that would surely drive you crazy. Like the shoe, the  
story has to fit. What you learn through the challenge and process  
of “trying it on” is powerful.  
Once the structure of the story is mapped out, we have you  
tell it out loud.  
The director is the storyteller’s first audience. We listen and  
reflect, with honesty, on what we are hearing. As directors, we  
listen each time like it’s the first time to see ifanything is confus-  
ing to the ear or if there are any details that are unnecessary. Does  
the story feel slow in some parts? Does that moment about the  
neighbor's rooster really belong? We note what makes us laugh,  
makes our hair stand on end and our eyes fill with tears, what NO NOTES, NONET 17  
makes us cringe with dread or gasp in surprise.  
We ask you to punctuate with emotion. And yes, just like a  
therapist, we'll ask\: How did it make you feel? You want your listener  
to feel it too!  
We help tellers focus their stories to make the overall arc as  
clear as possible, which helps determine what details need to stay,  
or go, or be saved for another story.  
Integral to the Moth process is a time limit. All storytellers, no  
matter the venue, should be mindful of time. On the Moth  
Mainstage we aim to feature stories that are between ten and  
twelve minutes long. \(At our open mic StorySLAMs, tellers only  
get five!\) We take timekeeping so seriously that a musician time-  
keeper is actually on stage with the teller. If the storyteller goes  
long, the musician will play a little note to signal that it’s time to  
wrap up. The playful threat is that if the storyteller continues for  
more than a minute, the musician will play again, and louder. The  
timekeeper strikes fear into every teller! That is by design.  
Completing a story within a given time frame takes a lot of con-  
sideration and planning. Mark Twain is said to have quipped, “I  
didn’t have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one  
instead.” The same is true with stories. It takes practice to tell a  
ten-minute story and not include every ingredient. We can’t send  
a violinist to your house, but we'll give you the tools to help you  
be mindful of the ticking clock.  
The last step in the Moth process is our in-person group  
rehearsal. All of the tellers in a show gather together, and we ask  
them to stand up, one by one, and share their stories. A mini-  
audience of fellow storytellers and Moth staff listens intently.  
This run-through gives storytellers a chance to experience a live  
audience. People often tell us that the rehearsal is the hardest and  
most intimidating part, but we can’t stress enough that it’s essen-  
tial. That’s why, eventually, you'll need to find a trusted person  
to act as a sounding board for your rehearsal run. It will show  
you where the nerves or emotion might hit, what scenes you  
might forget, or which details were confusing for the audience. 18 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
More than anything, getting through the rehearsal will build  
your confidence.  
You may be thinking, I don’t have a director to help me. Well, now  
you do! The people writing this book are those very people. We  
\(Meg, Catherine, Jenifer, Sarah, and Kate\), along with The  
Moth’s artistic and workshop teams, are here to give you the tools  
you need to guide yourself. We have broken down our process in  
this book and have posed all the same questions we would ask if  
you were on the other end of the phone with us. We’ll walk you  
step-by-step through the process in detail and throw in a few  
tricks for good measure!  
THE RULES WE PLAY BY  
In 2001, once again inspired by elements from the popular poetry  
slam model, we decided to provide a stage, a theme, and a host,  
and open up the evening to any ten people who had a story. We  
called these StorySLAMs. We made a few simple rules, set up  
parameters for crowd-sourced judges, and asked aspiring tellers  
to put their names in a hat for a chance to share a five-minute  
story. As we listened to thousands of stories in rapid succession,  
we noticed patterns and pitfalls. Killer beginnings, glorious land-  
ings, and common stumbling blocks. Each StorySLAM was a  
crash course, and we made note of what worked and what didn’t.  
In the early days of the SLAMs, we heard about Boris  
Timanovsky hunting down his grandfather’s headstone in Russia;  
Andy Christie staving off a midlife crisis with a jump from a  
plane; Faye Lane being cast as a string bean in a school play in  
Texas; Jen Lee selling Mary Kay products in the Midwest; Dion  
Flynn bonding with his stepfather while his mother was dying in  
the hospital; Jerald Hayes nearly missing his brother’s wedding\:  
and Sherry Weaver, single mother of four, hopping on the back  
of a motorcycle and falling in love. NO NOTES, NO NET 19  
JENIFER ON STORYSLAMS\: These weren't people we’d worked  
with prior to the show. It was an uncontrolled environment.  
What happened was a roller coaster\: some thrilling parts, some  
super-harrowing turns, bumps, a few sleepy sections, and of  
course, some stunning highs and some spectacular fails. But each  
story, limited to just five minutes, was over soon, and we were on  
to the next. It had a sort of jukebox feeling\: What story will be  
next?  
The audience kept coming back, and a culture grew around  
what happened in the room. We started off simply wanting to  
hear the stories, but we also got hooked on the electricity between  
tellers and listeners. A community was born.  
JON GOODE, MOTH HOST AND STORYTELLER\: Stories are what turn  
friends into family.  
Decades later, these open mic nights are in cities all around the  
world. The unpredictability can make the evenings magical.  
But, as you can imagine, there are many factors that can break  
the spell.  
We truly have no idea what stories people will bring to the  
SLAM stage. We’ve been knocked out by the tenderness and  
vulnerability of absolute strangers, and wondered how it 1s  
possible that an accounting admin from Detroit doesn’t have her  
own comedy special on HBO. But we’ve also had some record-  
scratch moments.  
From the start, the content at the StorySLAMs was unpredict-  
able and unruly. Not every story heard was one we’d want to hear,  
given a choice. A not-so-fun fact\: Across this great land, there are  
thousands of people willing to take the stage to confess a story of a  
time they weren’t able to make it to the bathroom. Incontinence  
stories from Miami to Melbourne. \(Technically, this does fall under  
the category of “vulnerable,” so hats off—pants off?—but we so  
dearly wish people would keep it above the belly button and bring  
the vulnerability of their hearts or minds and not their behinds.\) "290 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
We made a poster of how-tos that outlined the parameters for  
Moth-style storytelling and placed it in a prominent space on the  
stage so tellers could look it over when they signed up to tell.  
THE MOTH StorySLAM  
Telling a story tonight?  
It must be TRUE.  
The Moth is strictly nonfiction.  
It must be ON THEME.  
The story you've prepared should be intrinsically related  
to the theme for tonight's show.  
lt must have STAKES.  
A story needs action and the action must have consequences.  
What is gained or lost? What is the urgency? What is the  
conflict? What is the goal and who or what is blocking it?  
How did the trip from Point A to Point B change or shape you?  
It must be YOUR STORY TO TELL  
Were you there? Are you one of the “main characters”?  
Your involvement in the events as they unfold is essential.  
No journalism.  
Finally, it must be ON TIME. SLAM stories should be  
5 minutes long, plus a one minute grace period.  
GOOD LUCK!  
What we don’t want\: Stand-up routines. Repeat stories.  
Stereotypes. Rants. Essays. How-tos. Confessions. Lectures.  
Fictions. Gratuitous anything. \(SEE MOTH DON’T LIST.\)  
What we do want\: Hook us in. Make us care about you.  
Paint the scene. Clearly state your fears, desires, the dilemma.  
Make us invested in the outcome. Introduce the conflict. Make  
us worried for you. Impress us with observations that are  
uniquely yours. Rope us into the moment when it all goes  
down. Conclude as a different person\: Triumphant? Defeated?  
Befuddled? Enlightened?...CHANGED. NO NOTES, NONET 21  
Wish we could say that the bathroom stories were the worst  
things we have heard on a Moth StorySLAM stage. Not so. It is  
an open mic. While the majority of people bring warmth,  
humanity, madcap adventures, and heartfelt content, there have  
been some pretty painful, insensitive stories told.  
One ugly storytelling premise we’ve seen a lot is using another  
person as a prop in your story. I was feeling low and empty and  
hopeless. Like a real loser. And then I saw Julie bravely fighting through  
her very obvious obstacles, and I thought, Julie’s life is an absolute wreck.  
Poor thing. And yet she has the courage to face each day. I can’t imagine  
how HORRIBLE it must be for her to get up and face herself in the mirror  
every morning. I feel so much better about myself when I see her courage.  
Julie, you are my hero.  
Consider how this “story” sounds if you are Julie. Julie does  
not want to be your hero or the worst-case scenario you compare  
yourself to. Nobody wants that. \(Also, hello! Julie may be bliss-  
fully content!\)  
More disturbingly, we noted something deeper. To name the  
sins openly, we've been disheartened and aghast to hear  
occasional open mic SLAM stories that include blatant racism,  
sexism, ableism, and homophobia. All the negative -isms  
and -phobias. We needed to ask potential storytellers to truly  
examine what they were saying before they took the stage. To  
practice empathy.  
The things we didn’t want couldn't squeeze on the poster of  
the things we did want. So eventually we made another poster  
for tellers to peruse as they signed up to tell. It was a step in the  
right direction.  
We advise everyone \(including you!\) to consider these rules as  
you craft your story. These how-tos apply anywhere you might  
share a story, whether it’s ata Moth StorySLAM, at the pub with  
friends, or at work.  
As the poster states, we celebrate the diversity and the com-  
monality of human experience. \(It’s in our mission statement!\)  
Night after night, we watch as shared experiences between 22 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
strangers are recognized and celebrated—but we cannot ignore  
the fact that we all hear and tell stories through the lens of our  
own experiences and our own internal and external biases. We  
exist as the culmination of all our experiences, so we'll receive  
stories slightly differently—in some cases, profoundly  
differently. NO NOTES, NONET 23  
For us to honor and celebrate your experience, we, your lis-  
teners, need to trust that you honor and celebrate ours. That’s  
your responsibility as a storyteller.  
EVERYONE HAS A STORY—YES, EVEN YOU  
In 1999, we started Moth storytelling workshops, where we  
reached out to people who we weren't hearing on our stages. We  
gathered with local communities—nursing associations, veter-  
ans’ halls, local libraries, and so on—to craft stories in small  
groups. Time and again, people would tell us that they didn’t  
believe they hada story, but after a few sessions, one story sparked  
another and another, until everyone was sharing. At The Moth,  
we believe that everyone has a story, and we love helping people  
find theirs.  
JUDITH STONE, FOUNDING MOTH BOARD MEMBER AND STORY-  
TELLER\: Instructors in The Moth’s Community Program like to  
start each storytelling workshop by saying, “Sharing a story is  
an act of courage and an act of generosity.” Both are spectacular  
components, but it’s the second that moves me most—the gifts  
storytellers bestow on an audience. Thanks to the generosity of  
storytellers, we listeners are almost always granted the pleasure of  
simultaneously losing ourselves and finding ourselves in the story.  
We're restored to compassion and possibility and reconnected to  
our messy, marvelous, exasperating, exalted human community.  
For a while, at least, our hearts and minds are open. That’s good  
practice for after the stories are over.  
Most stories aren’t told on stage. Maybe you are hoping to tell  
a fun story at your next high school reunion or on a date or to get  
people excited about a new idea at work. Maybe you want to share  
a story more formally in a keynote, toast, or eulogy—or find the  
words to motivate others to advocate for a cause. 24 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Using real examples from beloved Moth stories to illuminate  
the path, we'll teach you our methods and techniques for unearth-  
ing, building, and sharpening your stories. We'll offer you  
practical applications for everyday storytelling moments. You'll  
be able to use these tools on all your stories going forward. “All of  
them?” Yes, you have more than one! No doubt.  
You don’t have to have a story ready to go as youre reading  
this now! You're just getting started. For some folks, finding a  
story is easy. You may already have one in mind and come to this  
process full of enthusiasm. Perhaps you lived through an extraor-  
dinary or historic event. Fantastic. This will be fun. But for the  
rest of you, most of you, don’t feel intimidated! It’s perfectly fine to  
feel stumped. We have ways of making you talk.  
Identifying the story you want to tell can be challenging.  
Expect some trial and error. Many are convinced they simply  
don’t have a story, some might not think their story is important  
enough to be told—but storytelling is for everyone. Your mem-  
ory is a pantry full of ingredients. You might not have a recipe in  
mind yet, but dinner will be served. The first step is to take your-  
self seriously as a storyteller. No matter which direction your life  
and your choices have taken you\: If you have lived and breathed,  
you have a story.  
But remember, this is not always a linear process; discoveries  
happen along the way. We’ve ordered this book logically, but  
know that you may jump backward before you turn the page—it’s  
all part of the \(beautiful\) process.  
Now, let’s open the pantry of your memories. That proverbial  
eleven-year-old can of sardines way up on the top shelf behind  
the cranberry sauce? That just might be the genesis of your  
greatest story. oF SRST S ORS ANS SO Ss ERIC OS SEL O16 Ok A 6 TS.O R610 8-016 Oe 8 U0\) 0.668 8 0 0 68 6.006

MINING FOR MEMORIES  
Awell-crafted story requires thought and care, but take a deep breath and  
revel in some good news! Your stories are like fingerprints; they are unique  
to you. Only you can tell them.  
—SARAH AUSTIN JENNESS  
Finding your story requires the hard work of sifting through all  
your life experiences, all the phone calls, alarm clocks, and dead-  
lines; the sunsets and taxes; the breakups and stumbles and epic  
fails; the home runs and stupid luck. You look through all that and  
try to identify the significant moments when you felt most like  
yourself, or the self you could finally see you wanted to become.  
Think about sitting down with an old photo album or scrap-  
book. \(If you don’t have one, you can create one in your mind.  
What pictures do you dearly wish you had?\) The photos and  
artifacts in your album, real or imagined, will conjure memories  
of people and places and situations. A postcard from a family  
vacation, a ticket stub from your first concert, photos from the  
summer of your first kiss, the tent falling down at your cousin’s  
wedding, the day you met your brother for the first time. Notice  
the wallpaper in your grandmother’s house. Smell what’s on the 30 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
stove. Remember how much you hated her meatballs? Each of  
these memories can help you find, and refine, your story. \(Sorry,  
Grandma.\)  
You are looking for the moments where perhaps something  
happened that showed you glimpses of who you truly are.  
Moments that altered your life’s course or led you to discover  
something new. Turning points have occurred multiple times  
during your life, from big obstacles to seemingly mundane  
choices; these turning points have affected and ultimately  
changed you.  
NESHAMA FRANKLIN, MOTH STORYTELLER\: I believe we're like  
Russian nesting dolls and everything we've done is still inside us.  
Just twist off the top, and there it is.  
Consider just one vivid memory. What about that time you  
had a run-in with a mime artist on your lunch hour? Or that  
Mother’s Day weekend you were asked\*to sing a solo hymn at  
church and forgot all the words? Or that time you found a plastic  
bag full of little toy cars you loved as a child in your grandmother’s  
closet, years after she died?  
If you have an inkling of an idea, explore it. Don’t be shy. The  
process of excavation will help you decide whether to pursue it.  
There is value in rejecting a story idea, but only if you take the  
time to really mull it over. In your head, a story idea is just a  
theory. Test it by saying it out loud. Often when you say some-  
thing out loud, it changes shape. When spoken, a story can feel  
less silly or scary. Remember, there is a good chance that someone  
hearing your experience will say, “Hey, me too.”  
Look for a place, an object, a friendship, that meant a lot to  
you. Or the opposite\: a place, an object, a friendship that almost  
destroyed you. Try to focus on just one moment!  
Think about a time when you . . .  
\* Felt an emotion\: doubled over with laughter, burst into  
tears, or lost your cool. MINING FOR MEMORIES 31  
\* Did something you never thought you'd do.  
\* Tried to be something or someone you aren’.  
\* Discovered something about yourself, your environment,  
your family, or the world.  
¢ Changed your relationship with someone—for better or  
worse, a little or a lot.  
\* Hada secret revealed—by you or someone else.  
\* Stood to gain or lose something that mattered to you.  
\* Madea tough choice for the right \(or wrong\) reason.  
¢ Found yourself saying, I do! Iwon’t! Hell no! I dare you. You  
couldn’t pay me to. It would be my greatest honor.  
The truth is, our lives are made up ofa million stories. Trying  
to stuff your whole life into one story won’t work. To cover many  
years in only a few minutes, you would need to reduce the story  
to a list of events that lack detail and are all given the same empha-  
sis, with no emotion or meaning. At The Moth, we refer to this  
phenomenon as feeling too “and then, and then, and then.” Long  
lists without much detail are boring.  
Focus on a time frame—whether it’s an afternoon from your  
adolescence or the week leading up to your fortieth birthday—  
and tell us about it in detail. In Moth storytelling workshops, we  
begin by identifying a scene. “In the movie of your life, what’s  
one scene you'll never forget?” One brave participant might say,  
“The time in sixth grade, when we moved.”  
Great! Now tell us for one minute\: What was the moving day  
like? How did you feel as the car drove away? Put us into that  
place. What do you remember seeing, smelling, touching? What  
did you hear? What do you remember saying? What kind of  
thoughts were running through your mind? Now, tell us again,  
but for three minutes. Really zoom in and stay in that day.  
The more you do this exercise, the more your memory  
will actually start to come back, and seeds for stories will start  
to emerge. 32 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
MEG ON MINING FOR STORIES IN A SOCIAL SETTING\: A few years  
back, a friend of mine invited me to her apartment in Manhattan for an  
informal cocktail party. She said that everyone she invited had some  
connection to our home state of Arkansas. When | arrived, | recognized  
one or two friendly faces, but everyone else was a stranger. | typically find  
these kinds of events difficult, with small talk and trying to find a way to  
connect, but the genius idea of our hostess, creating a theme for the  
evening, gave the guests a perfect entry into conversation. “So what’s  
your connection to the Natural State?” Everyone’s introduction turned  
into a little story about them. They went to college there, they worked on  
the Clinton campaign, they'd dated the hostess and had flown there to  
meet prospective in-laws. Each story gave context and a perfect place  
forthe conversation to start. The real beauty was we already had some-  
thingin common. It turned out to be one of the best cocktail parties ever!  
You may not always be given a perfectly themed evening, but when faced  
with the daunting task of making conversation with someone new, try to  
think of a question that might bring about a story from them. The tried-  
and-true “How do you know our host?” is an easy place to start.  
Compliments are always nice and can often break the ice. “Where did  
you grow up?” or “What’s something you’re looking forward to?” But try  
tosteer clear of the “What do you do for a living?” question. \(New Yorkers  
love to ask this one, but in other parts of the world—not so much!\)  
YOU ARE THE MAIN CHARACTER  
Moth stories are personal; in other words, they are your stories.  
Resist the urge to tell a story where you have no personal connec-  
tion. You don’t want to tell the story about the time your aunt  
Alma went to Jamaica unless you went with her, or unless that MINING FOR MEMORIES 33  
story directly affected you. Were you a witness? Did you have  
the ackee and saltfish too? Does this story relate to how you were  
raised or how your aunt loved you? Consider how the story  
is personal to you. It’s okay to tell us about something that hap-  
pened to someone else, as long as there is a correlation to how it  
impacted you.  
People are often drawn to the idea of telling a story that  
includes a loved one who passed away, and the same rule applies.  
If you can put the story of this person in the context of your life,  
in a tangible and emotional way, that’s a good place to start! But  
don’t forget that stories need a plot. Your uncle fueling your pas-  
sion for biking is great, but that’s an observation, not a story.  
Better to focus ona specific bike trip.  
When mining for potential material, out-of-the-ordinary  
events stand out in our memories and leave footprints. People  
naturally draw on injuries, calamities, disasters, and heartbreak  
for ideas. While personal struggles can be part ofa story, they do  
not make a good story on their own. A rule of thumb 1s to not let  
the trauma or the struggle be the story, but rather to make it the  
context of the story. Stories always need to go beyond “a bad  
thing happened.” \(And now, a rhyming Moth proverb\: All ouch  
and no yay? Hard to make the listener stay.\) Which is not to say that  
all stories need a happy outcome! But be careful not to make a  
laundry list of your woes. The point is that a lengthy account of  
all the ways your day/year/marriage is terrible isn’t a story, it’s a  
catalog of grievances—and the audience isn’t your therapist.  
THE KICKOFF  
Not all stories are epic. They can be born from the simplest of  
origins\: getting summoned for jury duty, accidentally dropping  
your keys down an elevator shaft, dialing a wrong number.  
Stories happen when expectations meet reality. Sometimes  
stories take place during an exception, an outlier event. 34 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Think back to those moments when you encountered some-  
thing a little out of the ordinary\:  
¢ Getting off at the wrong stop or exit.  
« Aphone number found in a pocket.  
¢ The eyes meeting across the room.  
¢ The last—I swear, the last—shot of tequila.  
¢ Akiss.  
° Alie.  
¢ A promise.  
¢ A betrayal.  
¢ A windfall.  
\* Acomeback.  
\* Your ex at the door.  
¢ The final straw.  
Or think of it this way\: Remember a time you broke a pattern  
ora habit. What was different from the everyday? A moment that  
interrupts the normal routine may be your inciting incident—“‘the  
thing” that kicks offa story, the first moment that shifted every-  
thing or set things in motion.  
Consider moments in your life when your patterns were  
broken\:  
¢ “I’m never without my phone, but one day I left it in my  
# car  
\>  
\* “Lalways walk this way home, except the time I decided to  
take a detour...”  
\* “I told everyone that I would never sign up for speed  
dating—but then . . .”  
An unexpected event usually kicks off the journey of a story—  
and the choices you make along the way lead to a bigger, lasting,  
overall change in you. Without this “out-of-the-ordinary hap-  
pening,” the story could not have taken place. Here are some  
examples of inciting incidents from Moth storytellers\: MINING FOR MEMORIES 35  
I’m commuting home from work. And when I walk into BART, San  
Francisco's subway system, I am instantly annoyed, because I walk with  
acane and I wear leg braces, and I noticed that the elevators and escalators  
are out of service. Which means that after sitting on my butt in my office  
for eight hours, I have to start off my commute by walking down three  
lights of stairs, down to the platform. And there’s nothing Ican do. That’s  
the only option. So I walk up to the mouth of the stairwell and I take a  
deep breath, ’cause I ain’t afraid of no stairs. And I put my hands on the  
inevitably sticky hand rail. And I begin my descent.  
—Aaron Pang, “Balancing Act”  
They had a display up for Black History Month that said, “From  
Bondage to Books\: Black History Month.” And it had a picture of  
Harriet Tubman and a picture of Colin Powell. And I looked at the sign,  
and I looked around the store like Is anybody else seeing this? J started  
to get heated. Like, the sign hurt my feelings, because it said to me in those  
few words that the history of Black people, of my people in this country,  
could be boiled down to the middle passage, slavery, and whatever it is that  
Colin Powell means to you. From bondage to books. “You were enslaved  
and now you can read. Congratulations.” I felt like I was in an argument  
with this sign, and Iwas losing, but I realized the sign didn’t have to have  
the last word. So I walked to the campus newspaper office, and I said,  
“Tm writing an editorial!” and they're like, “Aren’t you the movie review  
guy?” And Iwas like, “I’ve changed.”  
—R. Eric Thomas, “A Sign, a Satire, and a Scandal”  
The week of April Fools’ Day of 1981 began badly. That Sunday night,  
my husband told me he was leaving me. He had fallen in love with one of

When I was fourteen years old, I had a deeply meaningful experience,  
something so real, so raw, almost divine, that I knew it was going to shape  
who Iwas to become for the rest of my life. Isaw the Spice Girls on MTV.

I walk to the elevator, and I press the button, and as we’re waiting for the  
elevator to descend to the lobby, the lights go out. We're all looking around.  
We don’t know what happened. It’s two years after 9/11. Everyone’s a  
little jittery. We’re thinking, Hey, maybe this could be another attack  
or something. It’s 2003, most people don’t have cellphones. I don’t have  
a cellphone. About ten minutes later, they say, “It’s a blackout.”  
—John Turturro, “Stumbling in the Dark”  
One Sunday, I went to a picnic organized by Arab and South Asian  
students. As soon as I arrive, I meet the cutest guy. And this guy, his eyes  
were this beautiful green color. They were like the color of expensive olive  
oil. Now, this guy is talking to me, words are coming out of his mouth,  
but all I’m thinking is, Please be Christian, please be Christian,  
please be Christian. Somewhere in the words were “Pashtun” and  
“Pakistan.” My heart sank. Olive Oil is Muslim. You have to under-  
stand, we were absolutely forbidden from falling in love with Muslims. I  
mean, by the time Iwas ten, I knew that when a Christian Arab girl falls  
in love with a Muslim, one or all of the following would happen\: She is  
disowned, her mother gets a heart attack, or she dies in an honor killing.  
And Thad always obeyed my parents, never considered dating a Muslim.  
But when he asked me to dinner, everything went out the window, and I  
said yes,  
—Suzie Afridi, “Olive Oil Eyes”  
When you start mining for story seeds, memories might suddenly  
pop to mind. Don’t dismiss them as insignificant before you think MINING FOR MEMORIES 37  
about why they come to mind. What is it about these moments  
that sticks with you?  
All you're looking for are ideas at this point! Maybe you’ve  
already decided on one, and you're raring to go. We knew you  
had it in you! No idea yet? We’ve just begun!  
TOASTS\: Toasts are more observational than traditional first-  
person stories. You are inthe story, but your subject is the main character  
and hero. Whether the toast is for your best friend’s wedding, your  
nonna’s ninetieth, or your beloved colleague’s retirement, think of how  
this person has directly affected you \(and others too\)! You may have  
knowledge of the hearts they’ve touched, their madcap adventures, the  
punchlines and the punches, the way this person has shown up for you  
and for their community. Choose scenes and examples that tether us to  
who you’ re toasting. A beautiful toast gives the subject the gift of being  
seen.  
CH-CH-CH-CH-CHANGES  
Do you remember a moment that rocked you to the core? Curled  
your toes? Made you vow to never take a road trip with Ricardo  
again? That EUREKA! moment? Or softer epiphanies\: a time  
you were humbled, a heartbreak it took years to fully understand,  
or an act of kindness that still resonates in your life to this day.  
All Moth stories involve some shift in the storyteller’s perspec-  
tive as a result of something that happened. When mining for  
stories, consider moments of change in your own life. How have  
you grown over time? Think back. What was the catalyst?  
Was there atime that you...  
¢ Changed a belief you held? 38 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
\* Hadamoment when everything came into focus?  
\* Discovered you were stronger than you thought?  
\* Realized you were just plain wrong?  
¢ Tried a new haircut that gave you wings?  
At the end of your story, you area different you than you were  
at the beginning. I used to be like this, but now I know different!  
Nobody told kids anything in those days, so you just tried to figure it out.  
We found out what polio meant was hospitals, and hot packs, and painful  
therapies, and iron lungs. I stood in the doorway, and I was watching my  
mom, and she picked up my little sister’s shoes—her little summer  
sandals—and she held them in her hands for a moment. She held them  
like they were birds with broken wings, and she put them in a drawer. And  
she shut the drawer, and I saw tears in her eyes, and I knew.  
—Sister Mary Navarre, “Catholic School Dropout”  
“  
Think back to moments that built you up or tore you down.  
I was fourteen years old when, suddenly and disastrously, I fell in love  
with a girl in my class. She and Ihad been in school together since we were  
little kids, but we never really interacted there. And I don’t know why I  
felt so strongly so quickly, but I did, and I knew that she sometimes went  
to church down the street. So every Sunday I started walking over, and if  
she was there, I'd sit for the whole sermon and take notes. And if she  
wasn’t, I played pool in the basement with my best friend, Paul.  
—Max Garcia Conover, “Kid Religion”  
Was there something you were adamant about only to one day  
discover you were so very wrong? Did someone tell you some-  
thing that suddenly made everything shift into perspective? MINING FOR MEMORIES 39  
I got to know some of our clients. One of them was this therapist who came  
in for a few years in a Land Rover. And one day, he comes into work and  
he says, “John, I’ve thought for a long time whether I should tell you about  
this, but you've told me so many times how isolated and alone you feel.  
And there’s a reason for that. There’s this thing they’re  
talking about in the mental health world called Asperger’s syndrome. It’s  
a kind of autism, and you could be the poster boy for it.” And he says to  
me, “Normally, therapists learn not to diagnose their friends, or pretty  
soon they won’t have any friends.” But, he said, “I think this could mean  
a lot to you.” And he handed me this book and I iooked in it, and I saw  
how people with Asperger's can’t look other people in the eye. We’re  
uncomfortable. We can’t read body language. We say inappropriate  
things because we don’t understand social cues. And everything I  
read about this? It was me. And that truly transformed my life at  
age forty.  
—John Elder Robison, “A Complete Correct Human”  
Perhaps you spent your life following someone else’s rules and  
then decided you’d had enough. What happened then? How are  
you different now?  
In her story “The Curse,” Dame Wilburn and a friend decide  
to visit a psychic. As Dame walks into the storefront, the fortune-  
teller welcomes her.  
She locks me in a gaze and says, “You're cursed. You’re cursed! You’ll  
never find love. This is the worst curse I have ever seen. Your whole  
family—this is generational. I am floored by the level of curse that’s  
hanging on you.” And I’m standing there. And Igotta tell you, I’m pretty  
excited about this. Because all these years, I thought it was me! I thought  
I was too loud, too fat, too Black, too whatever. But if I’m just cursed?  
Hallelujah! Yes, that means we can fix it. All right, here we go.

CATHERINE ON STORIES DURING JOB INTERVIEWS\: In ajob  
interview, your prospective employer might say, “Tell me a little more  
about yourself!” or “Tell me about a work moment you wish you could do  
differently now.” This is an invitation to tell a very short personal story that  
illustrates your character, work ethic, or ability to problem-solve. Think  
through the stories in your arsenal before the interview and have one or  
two prepped. In an interview for a TV producing job, | once managed to  
work in a story about me surviving a runaway camel in Morocco without  
dropping the expensive camera | was holding. \(| got the job!\) But one of  
my favorite on-the-job stories is told by my friend Tim Bartlett. He once  
spent a year traveling solo through rural England, shooting a documen-  
tary. He took buses from town to town, and stayed overnight in the small  
villages where he was filming. One cold winter night, he missed the last  
bus that would take him to the next town. There were no taxis or hotels in  
the tiny village where he was shooting. In the end, he ordered a pizza,  
asked if it could be delivered to the place in the next town where he was  
staying, and then said, “Uh . . . can! gowith it?” The delivery guy took Tim  
and his pizza to the hotel in the next town. The story demonstrates that  
Tim is a creative problem solver, with an adventurous spirit and great  
sense of humor. |’d certainly hire him! There's no one right story. All job  
interviews are about determining two things\: Does this person have the  
skills needed to do the job, and do we want to spend every single workday  
with this person? Choose a story that will make your prospective new  
employer think\: | want this person on my team. MINING FOR MEMORIES 41  
DECISIONS, DECISIONS  
In your quest to find your story, think back to those turning-  
point moments in your life. Often they start with a decision. After  
you decided to do X, your day \(week, year, life?\) was different.  
Was there a time when you said YES! or vehemently NO!? Moth  
stories are all about agency—where something happens as a direct  
result of something you did or did not do. Think of those specific  
moments in your life when you made a choice that altered your  
course.  
DECISIONS AT WORK\:  
To quit your job.  
To fire someone.  
To switch career paths.  
To go back to school.  
To speak up or step back.  
DECISIONS WITH YOUR FRIENDS\:  
Falling in friendship-love.  
Letting people in.  
Shutting people out.  
Acknowledging jealousy or competitiveness.  
Discovering the dynamic that needs to change.  
DECISIONS WITH YOUR ROMANTIC PARTNER\:  
Beginning to date.  
Taking things to the next level.  
A breakup and a make-up.  
Redefining boundaries.  
Or ultimately calling it quits.  
DECISIONS ABOUT HOME\:  
A big move to a new place.  
Finding a community or choosing to leave one. 42 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Saying goodbye to your childhood home.  
Inviting someone in or throwing them out.  
Rolling up your sleeves for a transformative deep clean.  
DECISIONS ABOUT FAMILY\:  
Starting one, or adding to one.  
Breaking with one.  
Reconnecting with one.  
To loan money or not to loan money.  
Leaving or recommitting to the religion you were raised with.  
GEORGE DAWES GREEN, MOTH FOUNDER\: Every good story, I feel  
certain, hinges on a decision. Sometimes there'll be lots of deci-  
sions in the course of a narrative\: backtracks, double-downs,  
veerings off, choices made by other characters, your replies to  
those choices. But always, at the story’s core, will be one key  
decision. In the most powerful stories, your decision will be a  
tough one. \(Some of your audience will concur with your choice,  
some will be appalled!\) Good storytellers soon learn that what  
happened is of less importance\: Your audience really wants to  
know what you decided to do about what happened. I’ve often  
been told stories of harrowing auto accidents. I usually find these  
tales kind of dull. But once, a man told me of a long icy skid that  
took him over a bridge and into a small river. The car was com-  
pletely submerged, but the windows were shut and he had plenty  
of air—and so he had to make a choice. Should he lower the  
window, let the river come rushing into the car so he could try to  
escape, or just wait in that air-bubble for help? The story instantly  
took power. The decision.  
When you consider potential stories, it’s important that you  
think back to your frame of mind at the time. Decisions that seem  
minor now, like deciding what to wear to the school dance or  
asking for time off work to see a Spice Girls concert, might have  
felt monumental in the moment. As an adult, we know that it is a MINING FOR MEMORIES 43  
very bad idea for a nine-year-old to attempt to drive a two-  
hundred-pound motorcycle. But if you are a daredevil  
nine-year-old, of course you know you can handle it! It’s fun to  
hear from both perspectives. Your nine-year-old selfis still inside  
you. Let her speak!  
You are always making decisions that change the course of  
events. The decisions can be as enormous as a move to another  
continent or as small as a shift in perspective, as illustrated in Peter  
Pringle’s story.  
We first met Peter through the Innocence Project, and his  
Moth story “As If\] Was Not There” was about being in solitary  
confinement for a crime he did not commit. He is in a small cell,  
with no physical freedoms, and yet the story explores agency.  
When I heard these jailers discussing their role in my execution and the  
fact that the authorities had told them there would be a role for them in my  
execution, there was no doubt in my mind that I was facing death. And I  
tried as best as I could to distance myself from that, and as best as I could  
to curb my anger... . . And while I knew with certainty that the worst  
thing that they could do to me would be to kill me, until they did that, I  
was my own person. While they could imprison me physically, they could  
not imprison my mind or my heart or my spirit. And so it was within  
those realms of myself that I determined that I would live. And within  
that death cell, in that small space around myself, \[had my own sanctuary.  
And I learned to almost totally ignore what was around me.  
In “Beinga Foot Soldier,” Dr. Sybil Jordan Hampton describes  
being a fifteen-year-old in 1959, on the front lines of school  
desegregation at Little Rock Central High. She was the only  
Black student in a class of 544 people. At graduation she was sure  
she would never return.  
I thought to myself, I’m not going to miss anybody. This is over for  
me. I am going to go on with the rest of my life. | am not coming  
back in this building, and I am certain I will see none of these 44 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
people again in life. And then, there is this invitation to return to the  
twentieth anniversary in 1982. And I decided that, yes, I wanted to  
return because I needed to know what, if anything, had changed.  
Remember\: Choosing inaction is still a choice. There are plenty  
of Moth stories that have been built entirely around the decision  
not to act. How about the critical moment in time when you froze  
and did nothing at all, or the knowledge you kept to yourself, or  
the big leap you decided you were better off skipping?  
SARAH\: Taking ownership over the choice nof to act is rare, and  
can make an impactful story. I'll never forget hearing Megan  
McNally at a Moth GrandSLAM in Seattle. She told a story about  
how her close bond to her grandma was strained when Megan  
decided to give her baby up for adoption. She and her grand-  
mother never talked about the decision in the aftermath. In  
“Things Left Unsaid,” she said\:  
When my daughter turned eighteen and found me on Facebook, I told a  
staff meeting, but I didn’t tell Nanny. And a few years after that, when I  
learned that she'd graduated college, had moved to New York, and fallen  
in love, I didn’t tell Nanny. There were so many times I visited Nanny,  
when I tried to will myself to tell her about her first great-granddaughter.  
How scared I had been, wondering if I had made a mistake, how grief  
made me into something I wasn’t proud of, how my daughter turned out  
just fine without me, and mostly, how sorry I was that I had left her out  
of all of this, But the longer you wait to do something, the harder it is to  
do. In the last years of her life, Nanny and I talked all the time. We talked  
about everything except this one thing. When she had a stroke, I sat with  
her, and I knew it was my last chance, and I said, “Nanny, do you  
remember that I had a little girl and I gave her up for adoption?” And I  
never imagined that she would say, “No.” And when she died the next  
day, I became someone who had waited too long. MINING FOR MEMORIES 45  
Megan’s decision not to discuss her daughter with her grand-  
mother until it was too late results in her change. Megan’s inaction  
revealed a larger and irreversible truth to her. This was one of the  
deepest stories of her life, and we, in that Seattle audience, were  
witnessing it. I contacted her before we aired her story on The  
Moth Radio Hourand asked her a few questions. Megan told us that  
she’d lived with years of regret. She said, “I regret that I didn’t  
understand grief. That I never asked for help. That I let fear win  
out over love. I was so afraid for people to know how broken I  
was, and I was terrified to learn how much I had hurt the people  
Ilove. With Nanny, I regret that I never mustered the courage to  
bring it up, to just talk about it. And now there will never be that  
opportunity. It is, literally, too late.”  
Think back to that proverbial fork in the road, the path least  
traveled. You made a decision to act or not—where did that deci-  
sion take you?  
LOOK FOR THE OUCH  
Our biggest mistakes often lead to great stories, the kind that we  
are always asked to repeat, or that arrive at the party before we  
make our entrance\: “OMG! You’re the one who fell through a  
skylight at a rooftop party! I’ve heard about that wild night!”  
Sometimes that fame can feel more like infamy, but the beauty of  
a well-told story is that it can turn your most embarrassing  
moment into something you're proud of. “Whoops, I accidentally  
sexted our rabbi” could end up as your most requested party story!  
Mistakes are universal. Sharing our missteps and epic fails  
reminds people that it’s okay; we are all fallible. These blunders  
are our chance to learn or grow, to be better and sometimes not  
take ourselves so seriously because, if we’re honest, mistakes can  
be downright hilarious.  
Does thinking about a particular incident make you a little  
embarrassed? A bit worried? Ashamed? \(“I couldn’t possibly. 46 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
What would people think?”\) Go there! At least explore it! What  
you are reluctant to share might be exactly where you need to  
look. What do you have to lose by being honest with yourself?  
MIKE BIRBIGLIA, MOTH HOST AND STORYTELLER\: What I’ve found  
over the years is, you know youre on the right track with finding  
a story ifit makes you very uncomfortable to tell it. If you want  
to bail out at many stages of it, you know youre going in the right  
direction.  
People often want to tell a story that makes them look good,  
but to the listener it can feel self-indulgent and braggy. “I benched  
my bodyweight/won a Peabody/sailed a sea/successfully com-  
pleted a sixteen-hour surgery/memorized a concerto.”  
Extraordinary accomplishments are a potential setting for your  
story, but not the story. Telling people about all the big wins in  
your life is a very easy way to lose their interest. You’re talking at  
them, you're not inviting them in.  
We've all been at dinner with the person who found them-  
selves intoxicatingly fascinating and know the feeling of relief  
when it’s over. It’s okay to celebrate success, but that success will  
be more interesting if you tell us about your stumbles along the  
way. What was in it for you? What would happen if it didn’t get  
done? If there is a story in there, it exists in your relationship to  
what it took to get there, how you felt about it, and why.  
When working with Chenjerai Kumanyika on his story  
“The Two Times I Met Laurence Fishburne,” we wanted him to  
talk about being a hip-hop star in the ’90s, and what happens  
when you get your dream job at a young age, only to see it  
all disappear.  
Chenjerai was reluctant to appear too braggy or full of him-  
self, which is tricky when you are talking about actually becoming  
a music star! So we decided to start the story with an embarrassing  
scene about him screwing up at a job he was forced to take after  
his group broke up. MINING FOR MEMORIES  
47  
Now, when I say “my job,” what y’all should know is this was a tempo-  
rary job. And when I say it was a temporary job, what you should know  
is that my performance today determined whether I would be asked back  
tomorrow. So when I went in the boss’s office, here’s what she said\: “Hi,  
Chenjerai. Yesterday I asked you to make two hundred Gilmore Girls  
Thanksgiving Day Special DVDs. But the Excel spreadsheet that you  
made ordered more than that.” “Okay. How many more?” “One million  
Gilmore Girls Thanksgiving Day Special DVDs. Can you explain  
that, please?” I could\: I have no idea how to use Microsoft Excel. And I  
lied about my skills to get this job.  
Because we meet him when he’s down on his luck and failing  
at work, we're already on his side when we get to the later scenes  
with him riding on private jets and performing in sold-out  
arena shows.  
Another musical example is Rosanne Cash, who, in “Until  
the Real You Shows Up,” could have spoken about her multiple  
number one hit songs. Instead she talked about an album that did  
not produce hits.  
I was in the studio, waiting to play it for the head of the record company  
for the very first time. Iwas so proud. He came in, and he sat down at the  
recording console and we played the album start to finish. He didn’t say a  
word in between songs. And I thought, He’s speechless with the sheer  
beauty of this record. He’s stunned into silence. As the last note  
faded away, he turned to me and he said, “We can’t do anything with this.  
What were you thinking?”

| had little interest in chatting about Boppy pillows. It was not for me.  
Shortly afterward, amom emailed mea picture ofher infant in mid-acid-  
reflux-vomit. It turned out that our babies were born a day apart and we  
started to get together to mostly stare wide-eyed as we confessed our  
darkest feelings about new motherhood—our fears, our failures, every-  
thing we were doing wrong, and how full of anger we were about it. After  
one playdate she texted, “I’ve never related to you more than when you  
rage-kicked the air at the end of your story today.” A few days later, we  
brought our kids to the playground just before sunset. She handed mea  
tiny baby food jar she'd filled with some red wine. “Cheers,” she said.  
“This is hard.” Itwas. ltis. But it was the brutal honesty of the stories that  
we shared that made me feel like | wasn’t alone. I’ve sought out these  
conversations in the years since then, and built a community that feels  
like family and makes me a better parent.  
Even when real-life heroes tell Moth stories, they connect  
with the audience best when they reveal their less heroic sides,  
rather than talking about how they saved the day.  
When astronaut Michael Massimino started working on his  
Moth story “A View of the Earth,” he said, “I could tell you about  
the time I broke the Hubble Telescope.” What?? Yes, please! Mike  
was assigned to a shuttle mission to fix a problem with the Hubble  
Space Telescope. He and his fellow astronauts had spent years  
preparing for the mission—training for each step of the repair and  
planning for every possible problem. Without exaggeration,  
millions of taxpayer dollars had been spent. After years of train-  
ing, Mike finally found himself tethered to the shuttle, floating  
in space, a foot from the famous telescope—armed with his trusty  
tools. He started to remove the panel that protected the telescope  
and that’s when it happened—he stripped the screw. He couldn't MINING FOR MEMORIES 49  
get it out. Removing the panel was supposed to be the easy part,  
so much so that they never even considered it might be a problem.  
Years of training to fix a telescope that they now couldn’t get to  
because he’d stripped a screw. It was a simple thing, but in this  
instance, it threatened the whole mission. As he floated in space,  
he pondered the possible consequences of his mistake.  
I can’t get to the power supply that failed, which means we’re not gonna  
be able to fix this instrument today, which means all these smart scientists  
can’t find life on other planets, and I’m to blame fer this. And I could see  
what they would be saying in the science books of the future. This was  
gonna be my legacy. I realized that my children and my grandchildren  
would read in their classrooms, “We would know if there was life on other  
planets . . . but Gabby and Daniel’s dad” —my children would suffer  
from this— “Gabby and Daniel’s dad broke the Hubble Space Telescope,  
and we'll never know.”  
Most of us will probably never be sent to outer space by NASA.  
But who can’t relate to spending many hours of a life preparing  
for something important, only to be undermined by something  
as tiny and common as a stripped screw?  
Spoiler alert\: Mike ultimately figured out a way to fix  
the problem and the Hubble repair was completed—the day  
was saved! But the fact remains—the story’s hook lies in one  
smal\] mistake.  
What it really comes down to is vulnerability. There is some-  
thing comforting when people are willing to share the  
not-so-pretty sides of themselves. It’s as if they give the listener  
permission to relax. This is not a competition or an exercise to  
impress—I’m not perfect, so it’s okay if you’re not perfect too. When  
someone makes themselves vulnerable, the listener leans in, and  
a quiet bond is formed. It’s trust. This person trusts me enough to  
admit they screwed up or got it wrong. And that trust is the gateway to  
great empathy and memorable storytelling. It’s almost a cliché to  
say it now \(thanks, Brené Brown\) \(seriously, thanks, you are very 50 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
smart\) but vulnerability is power, especially when it comes to  
story. When we share our stories, we open ourselves to the oppor-  
tunity to connect with each other.  
DIRECTOR’S NOTES  
You are bursting with stories! Where will you start? Think back through  
the moments in your life you'll never forget—big events or smaller ones  
that changed you. If you have an inkling of a story idea, don’t shoot it  
down too quickly. Ponder it. Why does this moment stick with you?  
Think of moments where you made a conscious decision, big or small.  
What happened as a result of something you deliberately did or did not  
choose to do?  
Consider how the story is personal to you. If you’re including something  
that happened to someone else, remember it must have a direct  
impact on you, or the other person should be telling the story.  
Can you remember a moment where it all went horribly wrong? How did  
you recover? What did you learn? Don’t be afraid to explore those  
uncomfortable moments and share the not-so-glamorous sides of  
yourself. Our biggest mistakes often lead to great stories! Those mis-  
steps make us human, and that vulnerability creates connection with  
your listener.  
Remember not to let a trauma ora struggle be the story, but rather the  
context of the story. Stories always need to go beyond “a bad thing  
happened.”  
What was the inciting incident that set everything in motion? Perhaps  
you broke a pattern or interrupted your usual routine. What happened  
that shook things up?  
Think about moments that might have pushed you or pulled you in a  
different direction than you had planned. How might that moment have  
changed you? CHAPTER 4  
THE FOUNDATION  
Honesty and empathy do not flourish in the expectation of perfection.  
—MEG BOWLES  
Once you have the germ of an idea for your story, it’s time to start  
construction. You need no permits or hardhats, but you do need  
the general blueprints. It’s vital that your story has a strong foun-  
dation. A big part of the foundation is what the story means to  
you.  
Moth directors begin working with storytellers by listen-  
ing... and then asking open questions. Big questions. Little  
questions. Many questions. As we listen, we dig deeper, drawing  
connections and identifying patterns and themes. Why does this  
story, of all the stories in your life, resonate with you? Why do  
you care? What about it stuck with you? What effect did it have  
on you—big or small? By answering these questions, you are  
beginning to identify the stakes in your story.  
SARAH ON THE FIRST CONVERSATION\: As a director, my heart  
flutters before the first phone call with a potential storyteller,  
even though I’ve coached many hundreds of stories. The very 52 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
beginning of story crafting can be daunting, but we have to  
start somewhere.  
STAKES  
Stakes come from moments where you feel you have everything  
to gain or everything to lose. You might be fighting for your life,  
or you might be startled to realize that—oh no—you've slept  
through your alarm clock and you might not make your flight to  
your sister’s wedding.  
Stakes are defined by you, the teller—not your mother,  
brother, sister, or friend—and are born out of what you want/  
need/must have/can’t live without OR desperately want to avoid.  
Some stakes seem universal\: “I do NOT want to fall off the edge  
of this terrifying cliff’ But all stakes are personal. For someone  
else, the stakes might be “I need to visit the edge of this terrifying  
cliffand take a selfie to prove to Carlos that 1am adventurous and  
I'm doing just fine without him.” Your stakes resonate deeply within  
you, and part of your job as a storyteller is to make us understand  
your why. Sometimes stakes exist in smaller, narrowly defined  
situations, such as “I will get the bag of pretzels I paid for out of  
this \*%\#\$\# vending machine, even if\] have to knock it over or  
break the glass. Go ahead, call security! JUST TRY TO STOP  
ME!” In more rational moments, you might just opt for some  
chips instead, but in the parameters of your story, it is the pretzels  
or Armageddon. On principle!  
Stakes are what give a story urgency and energy. They create  
tension. They fill the listener with excitement or dread, and they  
give them a reason to go on this ride with you. Clear stakes estab-  
lish why you care, which tells us why we should care.  
In “The Great Escape,” Christopher Skaife, the longtime  
Ravenmaster of the Tower of London, sets up the stakes clearly  
when he tells us of a centuries-old legend. THE FOUNDATION 53  
The Tower of London has a great history, but it also has some ancient  
myths and legends. And one of the legends tells us that, should the ravens  
leave the Tower of London, it will crumble into dust and a great harm will  
befall our kingdom.  
At the time his Moth story took place, Christopher had just  
joined the team of Yeoman Warders who take care of the ravens  
who live in the tower grounds. On the first day his boss, Derrick,  
allows Christopher to take care of the ravens by himself, things  
go topsy turvy, and the stakes are raised even higher.  
Derrick said, “Don’t let them out.” Got that, absolutely. I made my way  
towards the enclosure, unlocked the padlock and went inside very, very  
cautiously. Bran, who was sitting on the perch, stuck his head up, looked  
at me, and with the loudest croak that he could make, sounded off. And  
I swear to this day, folks, it was a signal for an ambush. Because just as  
he'd done that, Moonin flew out of her little box, struck me on the chest,  
slid down my body, squeezed through my legs, and flew out of the enclo-  
sure. I turned around to see Moonin starting to get higher and higher and  
higher. Derrick had not taught me what to do if a raven was to escape. I  
stood there with my mouth open, like a little bird waiting to be fed. It was  
terrible.  
In “Unhooked,” Nathan Englander is a young tourist who  
finds himself being kicked offa train in Eastern Europe right after  
the fall of the Soviet Union.  
I’m terrified because this is a part of the world that swallows Jews. That  
wall came down ina day, it could go back up in a day. Half the world was  
trapped behind it for all those years. And I think, What have we done?  
Clear stakes compel the audience to champion you, root for  
you, and cheer you on. When working ona story, it is essential to  
keep asking yourself\: What are the stakes? Identify the moments  
where you felt you had something to gain or lose. 54 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
MEG ON CONVERSATION AROUND A TABLE\: Making conver-  
sation at a dinner party can often be daunting. When you’re the host, it  
can fall to you to keep the conversation going. This does not mean you  
have to take the stage and regale your table with tales of your most recent  
vacation. Sometimes the trick is knowing how to engage people and get  
them talking. While attending the Toronto Film Festival, | was invited toa  
dinner with Quentin Tarantino. Most of us around the table were com-  
plete strangers, so, as a way to break the ice, Quentin asked everyone to  
tell their favorite joke—and we went around the table one by one. | must  
admit it was intimidating being put on the spot in front of a legendary  
director like that, but in a way it bonded us, because we were all a little  
unsure. Some of the jokes were comically terrible, while others were  
hilarious! But it didn’t matter because it changed the dynamic, and  
suddenly we were all friends. Posing a question to the table can be fun\:  
What's your hidden talent? What’s the story of your name? Tell us about  
atime you pushed your limits. Many of the same prompts we use to find  
astory can be used to get the conversation flowing.  
THE WHAT AND THE WHY  
Often, there is a struggle between what you want and what’s  
working against you. Ask yourself\: What did I most want? Who  
or what was challenging me? A story is more compelling when it  
is clear what a storyteller wants and why.  
T was an expert on long-term memory. I knew everything about the  
anatomy and physiology. But I couldn’t do one thing to cure my father’s  
memory problems.  
—Dr. Wendy Suzuki, “Saying I Love You” THE FOUNDATION 55  
Stakes require tension. Where can you find them in the story?  
\* Aproblem that needs to be solved.  
\* Astruggle over a tough choice.  
¢ A question that needs to be answered.  
\* Amystery you're trying to get to the bottom of.  
\* Anunexpected event.  
Tension keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. Your  
listeners wonder\: What happens next? Will they or won’t they? How  
will this end?  
I was twelve years old and I was in my third foster home, and my very first  
foster father had just called. He called to say that he was very sorry to hear  
about my mother. But what he didn’t know was that nobody had told me  
that she was dead.  
—Samuel James, “Jenny”  
And one of them said, “Um, do you know what happened in that  
apartment?” And I felt my blood go absolutely cold. And I said, “Um,  
no, I don’t.” And he said, “Well, I’ll tell you, but you have to promise  
not to google it, because there are some things you can’t unsee.”  
—Caitlin FitzGerald, ““Marion and Me”  
Explore how the moment challenged or jeopardized your

Iremember, I wrote my first poem on my sixteenth birthday in 1968, and  
Iwas lying in bed, polishing my poem, then I heard the door banging. The  
Red Guards had come to raid our flat. If they saw my poem, I would get 56 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
into trouble, and my family would get into trouble. So, I had to quickly  
rush to the toilet to tear up my poem and flush it away.  
\_—Jung Chang, “Where Are You Going?”  
Stakes help the story become more than just a list of things that  
happened or a series of musings. They show the listener why the  
story is important for you to tell, and will ultimately support the  
overall arc of your story.  
Many stories are some version of SNAFU\: Situation Normal,  
All Fudged Up. The trip to grandmother’s house through the  
forest isn’t a story. It’s an essay about gathering flowers and a  
grandchild’s sense of obligation. But introduce the Big Bad Wolf  
into the mix, and suddenly we have stakes! Danger, an obstacle,  
a foe, something to overcome.  
All of a sudden, a rush of fire comes into the room, lights up over our head  
and banks down the walls. I mean, everything isn fire. It got so hot so  
fast that it forced me down to my knees. I turned around thinking I could  
go back out the same way we came in, but that exit was blocked by fire as  
well. I didn’t even see where the other firefighter who came in behind me  
was. I knew I was in a bad situation and I probably had to go through the  
rest of this house to get out.  
—Sivad Johnson, “To Bravely Do or Bravely Die”  
Say you have a story about a hellish airport experience where  
you end up losing your luggage. Okay, but people lose their lug-  
gage every day—so what? If you tell us that the luggage contained  
the only photograph you owned of your grandmother, suddenly  
you have given the story much higher stakes. We understand why  
this is more than a mere inconvenience. Your story of a hellish  
experience becomes more than just “this bad thing that hap-  
pened.” Perhaps you begin by describing the scene of you packing,  
and you mention sliding the picture of your late grandmother, THE FOUNDATION 57  
who raised you and loved you, into the pocket in the lining in the  
luggage. \(You never travel without it.\) Then tell the story of the  
hellish adventure, and when you get to the scene where the agent  
tells you your bags have been lost, you immediately bring us back  
to the image in our head of that photo tucked safely inside—the  
only photo you have—and suddenly you have given the listener  
a reason to care about you losing your bags \(outside of just “well,  
that’s awful/horrible/annoying’”’\).  
By weaving in the detail of the photo, you’ve brought mean-  
ing to the story. Your listeners instinctively put themselves in your  
position. They remember similar instances from their own lives.  
They connect with you.  
In his story “Have You Met Him Yet?,” former White House  
staffer David Litt has the simple task of handing over head-  
phones . . . to President Barack Obama.  
T reach into my pocket and pull out what looks like a hairball made out of  
wires. I don’t know what’s happened. I guess somewhere in that waiting  
room, I have just worried this thing into a hopeless tangle. And now I  
don’t know what to do, so I just hand the entire thing to the president of  
the United States. Now, if you work in the White House, you will hear  
the phrase “There is no commodity on earth more valuable than a presi-  
dent’s time,” which I always thought was a cliché. Until . . . I watched  
Barack Obama... untangle headphones... for thirty  
seconds . . . while looking directly at me.  
Stakes can be magnified by smaller moments, simple twists of  
fate\: missing the train stop, taking a wrong turn, being seated next  
to someone from your past at dinner—something that came out  
of the blue and tested you.  
I'd just moved to New York. I didn’t have a job. I didn’t have any friends.  
I didn’t know what I was doing, but Thad a lot of laundry. So I spent the  
days going up and down the elevator to the laundry department down-  
stairs. And one of these days, I was going back up in the elevator, swinging 58 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
my keys around my fingers, and the keys, as if by magic, dropped down  
the shaft between the doors and elevator. So I heard them clank clank clank  
clank. Down the shaft. To the bottom. And I just stood there and was  
like, “Oh my God, I have no wallet, no phone, no keys. I don’t know  
anyone.” I had met a very nice girl on the plane, but I didn’t know her  
number by heart. I did not know my neighbors, I had no bra on, and I  
had no shoes, And I was so hungry. I had no idea what to do.  
—Isabelle Raphael, “Shoeless and the City”  
INTERNAL STAKES VS. EXTERNAL STAKES  
Some stories explore internal stakes, in other words, what's going  
on inside your head\: Will I feel alone forever? Do I have what it takes  
to pass the test? Am I strong enough to forgive my mother? Others deal  
with factors outside yourself\: a bear, an audit, an irate neighbor.  
But many of the best stories are a mix of both.  
Stakes are defined by context. Where were you in your life at  
the time? About to graduate from high school? Hitting a rocky  
patch in your marriage? What things were happening in your life  
that were \(or could have been\) altered by this moment? What had  
you taken for granted? What had you spent too much energy on?  
Show your listener what was going through your mind—what  
you felt you had to lose or possibly gain. What put everything in  
jeopardy?  
Sergeant Major Mick Bolton said to me, “Can you use a pistol?” And I  
said, “What do you mean?” And he said, “We're probably going to have  
to fight for our lives. We'll be pinned down in these trenches. Can you use  
a pistol?” So we were just running, and, everywhere there was all this  
firing going on, and I really couldn’t see how we were going to get out.  
And the one thing that kept me going was I could see in my mind’s eye a  
picture of a little boy with curly hair and big, blue eyes, the color of the sea,  
which is my son, Lorenzo. And I had to get out for him. That Sunday I THE FOUNDATION 59  
was supposed to be hosting his seventh birthday party, a football party,  
and I just kept thinking about that. And I really, really didn’t want to die  
in that muddy field in Helmand.  
—Christina Lamb, “War and Ham Sandwiches”  
In Karen Duffin’s Moth story “The Speechwriter’s Lament,”  
Karen skillfully builds the stakes with every detail she chooses.  
She starts by telling us about her job, giving us the context of her  
story and what she stood to lose ifsomething went wrong.  
I was the speechwriter for the CEO of a very large company for several  
years. The thing about being a speechwriter is that it isn’t just about being  
able to write well, it’s kind of like being a professional best friend. You  
kind of have to be able to finish their sentences, be able to channel their  
voices. So you spend a lot of time together, you travel a lot together, you  
learn how to speak in their voice. Also, if you happen to be able to afford  
a speechwriter, you’re probably pretty busy. We might go to four or five  
countries in one week. We'd get on the airplane, I'd be like, “Where are  
we going? We’re going to Saudi Arabia?” So I pull out all the materials  
and teach him how to say hello in Arabic. So he’s placing an enormous  
amount of trust in me to be able to pronounce things correctly and tell him  
GDPs and things like this. You spend several years building up this kind  
of trust. I’ve seen people fail not for lack of talent, but for lack of ability to  
build a relationship.  
Karen has laid the groundwork for what is important to her.  
The trust she describes is what she risks losing. She goes on to tell  
us about working on a speech with her boss the night before the  
annual shareholders’ meeting. \(More stakes!\)  
I drop him off. I say, “I’m going to pick you up at six o’clock tomorrow  
morning, we're going to rehearse, and you're going to be great.”  
Igo home, finish the script, send it off to the producers. I go to sleep,  
set six alarms, just in case, for five o’clock in the morning, and I wake up 60 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
the next morning without the alarm, which is strange, because I never  
wake up without the alarm. There’s sunlight streaming through the  
windows. I’m thinking, “That is so weird. I’m in California, I'm not in  
Alaska. Why is there sunlight?” And then, it’s that movie moment where  
the audience would be screaming, “No!” And in my head, I’m screaming,  
“No!” I’m in slow motion leaping out of my bed, probably tucking and  
rolling and grabbing my cellphone, and it’s 7\:30. And he goes on stage at  
eight o’clock in the morning.  
Thanks to the earlier context, we feel the consequences  
\(stakes\) with her in this moment. She’s on the verge of losing not  
only her job but also her boss’s trust.  
There’s also probably twenty-two text messages, four voicemails, some of  
which are from him, and he’s seriously the nicest man on earth, which is  
what makes this story so much worse. Because he’s like a father who's not  
angry, he’s disappointed in you. He’s like, “Hi, Karen. It’s 6\:04 or  
6\:12. I assume maybe your car broke? I don’t know. I’m just going to  
drive myself.” So I have six of these voicemails. So I call \[the director of  
communications\] and she says, “It’s okay. I’m just so glad you're alive,  
because John had to stop rehearsal this morning and tell everyone, ‘I’m  
very, very sorry that I’m so off today and so flustered, because I think that  
one of my communications people died. I don’t know where she is.”  
He trusts her so much that the only explanation he can find for  
why she hasn’t shown up is that she must be dead.  
When she finally gets to the event, hours late, she describes it  
like this\:  
This was an audience of everyone who mattered to my career, all the  
executives in the company, all of the communications department, every-  
body's there. So picture your worst personal walk of shame. This is like a  
professional walk of shame. Everybody knows, because first of all, they  
thought I was dead. And now they know I’m alive and that I just slept  
in like I’m seventeen. THE FOUNDATION 61  
The beauty of this story is the way Karen builds the stakes.  
With each added detail, the stakes change and turn and elevate.  
Like a roller coaster, the action rises; you climb up the track click  
by click. She is creating and playing with the tension the listener  
feels, and she uses the tension to pull us through, until the moment  
we find out what ultimately happens.  
Ifshe hadn’t successfully built up the stakes, it would have just  
been a story about sleeping through an alarm clock—which,  
ultimately, it is—but the stakes invest us in the outcome.  
When you build out the stakes of your story, how can you set  
them up so the audience knows what’s important to you? Can you  
reveal something deeper about yourself through your motivation?  
A story that lacks stakes has no tension, and will fall flat. Find  
the moment—the unique and personal detail—that helps them  
feel what is at stake in the same way it felt for you. You want them  
to be on your side, cheering you on!

ANECDOTE VS. STORY  
People tend to use the words anecdote and story interchangeably,  
but actually they are. quite different. An anecdote is a short, amus-  
ing account ofa real incident or person. A story is beyond a string  
of occurrences; it deals with evolution. Ifyou don’t want or need  
anything, it’s not a story. A good story builds. By the end, things  
have intrinsically changed. Something about it has a lasting effect.  
You can’t go back. You can’t unsee it. You can’t un-be it. You are  
a different person because of the events that unfolded.  
Our anecdotes might have some dramatic or entertaining  
details, but they usually lack true depth. They are worth mining,  
because often there is more to these frequently repeated moments  
if we dig into them. Quite a few beloved Moth stories started out  
this way!  
When Ellie Lee was in college, her father’s grocery store—the  
largest Asian market in New England—burned to the ground.  
There were a lot of details that made the terrible event memora-  
ble\: Among them, the city of Boston had done work in the area a  
week before and had forgotten to turn the hydrants back on, so  
there was no water to stop the fire. Here’s what she originally told  
us that made it into her story “A Kind of Wisdom”\:  
It was just a disaster. They were trying to rig something from a nearby  
hydrant ten blocks away, and if things couldn't get worse, the fire jumped  
an alley and the building next door caught on fire. On the top floor were  
ten thousand square feet of illegally stashed fireworks . . . and it’s a  
surreal moment, because things are exploding, like in celebration.  
When Ellie dug in, she saw how this event changed her view  
of her father. Up to that point, she had seen him asa little ridicu-  
lous \(the way many teenagers view their parents\). Over the course  
of the fire, she came to see him in a new light. THE FOUNDATION 63  
I remember seeing three elderly women, and they were crying. And so I  
went up to them and I said, “Is everything okay? Why are you crying?”  
And the lady looked at me, and then she looked at my dad’s burned-down  
store, and pointed, teary-eyed, and said, “Where are we gonna go now  
that we don’t have a home?” And that was a turning point for me. I  
hadn’t really thought about my dad’s store in that way. I just thought it  
was something he was doing to provide for the family, but in fact he was  
providing for a greater community.  
Ellie’s Moth story includes the anecdote about the exploding  
fireworks, but with a richer, deeper context about family, respect,  
and community. The best stories are not just about the facts of  
what happened. We want to walk next to you through the story and  
understand.  
Say you get the wrong bag at the airport and finding the owner  
to return it to is an ordeal. Or you sit next to someone on a bus  
who, it turns out, was your deceased father’s best childhood  
friend. There is a beginning, middle, and end, but what’s the  
larger point? Action, characters, setting—all of the boxes are  
checked except for what it all means. The why of why you are  
telling it.  
Often the stories that we repeat again and again to our friends  
and family seem just fun and amusing \(“Tell the one about how  
everything went wrong at your rehearsal dinner!”\), but when we  
step back and reflect, bigger themes emerge \(“The bride and  
groom were nervous about two very different families joining”\).  
Why does the teller want to share the story again and again? Is  
there something deeper that’s drawing them to it? If you dig a  
little, there’s often meaning to mine from them, which is why  
they are important to you and get repeated \(“The disastrous  
rehearsal dinner bonded the two different families”\).  
We're not just exploring “this thing” that “happened” to you.  
Dig deep to find the roots of how and why it mattered to you. 64 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
DON’T THROW AWAY YOUR ANECDOTE\: Sometimes your  
amusing or illustrative anecdotes are the seeds for something bigger, but  
sometimes they’ re perfect just as they are. In casual settings, like in the  
waiting room at the doctor’s office or at your company picnic or ata PTA  
meeting, you may not have the time for a fully rounded story with big  
stakes and a tender, reflective ending. If Taye Diggs took mercy on you  
and your crying baby on a flight to LA, and said, “Hand him over,” then  
rocked him to sleep in two minutes—there’s your story! You can leave it  
there; no need to go into the insecurities you were having at the moment  
about your parenting. These social interactions and conversations are  
typically brief, and nobody gets the floor for five uninterrupted minutes.  
And yet these brief moments have impact, build connections, and invite  
others to share their experiences. One anecdote begets another, which  
inspires a volley of sharing and perhaps the beginning of new friendships,  
business relationships, and romances.  
A BIG LITTLE STORY  
Sometimes a small story will tie into a bigger event that inspires  
a change in the teller. That seemingly minor story will then be  
elevated into something with more meaning. We have a short-  
hand for this—we call it a Big Little Story.  
In “Head of Clay,” Jay Martel has to figure out what to do with  
a very heavy and ugly statue he inherits from his mother. The  
bigger story, the emotional story, is that the statue is a clay portrait  
of Jay’s own head when he was a teenager. Although he doesn’t  
want custody of the statue, he ends up feeling kind of hurt that  
neither of his parents have room for it in their downsized apart-  
ments. If he doesn’t take it, will they just put it out on the curb? THE FOUNDATION 65  
Ishmael Beah’s story “Unusual Normality” is about trying to  
fit in at a new school by playing paintball, a game his classmates  
enjoy. The bigger story is that, unbeknownst to his fellow stu-  
dents, Ishmael is a refugee from a war where he was a boy soldier.  
“Playing” war is in sharp contrast to his lived experience and  
gives him a window into the innocence of childhood.  
SUZANNE RUST, SENIOR CURATORIAL PRODUCER, ON THE ORIGIN  
OF THE BIG LITTLE STORY\: In a showcase featuring stories  
from women and girls, Mmaki Jantjies told the story “Meeting  
Nelson Mandela,’ about being a fourteen-year-old student in  
South Africa.  
Going into high school, I really battled with my self-confidence. I  
didn’t believe in myself, and I didn’t feel that I had much to offer  
the world. This despite my mom’s continuous words that  
“Mmaki, I believe in you.” “Mmaki, education is so important.”  
“Mmaki, hang in there. One day, all of this will make sense.” I  
remember the first day of school, getting there with my skinny self,  
with a school uniform so big and so baggy that the little dress went  
over my knees. And I remember looking at all the other girlk—  
their moms had agreed to alter their school uniforms to fit their  
little bodies. And on top of that, they had the trendiest  
hairstyles.  
Mmaki’s mother had read about an essay contest in the local  
paper and encouraged her daughter to enter. The theme was  
If I were king or queen for the day. With no mention of a prize of  
any kind, Mmaki reluctantly wrote the essay, sent it off, and  
forgot about it. But a few weeks later, she was called to the  
principal’s office. 66 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
I head off to the school principal’s office, and to my amusement,  
he was so excited to see me. He wanted to tell me that I had won  
an essay-writing competition, and that as part of the prize, I  
would be whisked off to the capital city of South Africa, Pretoria,  
to go to an award-giving ceremony. That essay-writing competi-  
tion had a prize after all! Anyway, I rushed home, told my  
parents, told my family. So much joy, so much excitement. My  
mom and I were then taken to Pretoria to a plush five-star hotel.  
Upon arrival, we were briefed on the award-giving ceremony and  
how it would go. We were then informed that as part of the prize,  
we would meet Queen Elizabeth and President Nelson Mandela!  
Mmaki’ story is special not just because she got to meet these  
icons but because of how the event transformed the way she  
thought about herself.  
I looked up. There were all the other finalists dressed in their baggy  
school uniforms with their traditional hair plaits. So I took my  
place in the line in my baggy uniform with my traditional hair  
plaits. I stood there and waited patiently. Queen Elizabeth came  
down the line, greeting every single finalist, until she got to me. I  
reached out, I curtsied, and we had a conversation about leader-  
ship, and what I thought about leadership at that time. She went  
off, and my heart started to pound. I was overflowing with emo-  
tion. As I heard Nelson Mandela’s voice come closer and closer to  
me, this voice that represented freedom for so many years was  
about to stand in front of me. And as I picked up my head, there  
stood this towering figure, Nelson Mandela. At that moment, it  
came to me, my mother’s words\: “I believe in you. One day, all of  
this will make sense. Focus on your education.” I stood there and  
T realized that I had so much to offer the world. Because despite  
the baggy uniform, despite the traditional hair plaits, Iwas stand-  
ing in front of Nelson Mandela because of what I had to say. THE FOUNDATION 67  
It struck me on first listen that Mmaki’s is a Big Little Story. In  
theory, a story about a schoolgirl winning an essay contest might  
seem pretty small, but because it connects to something bigger in  
the world that inspires a change in the teller, it’s elevated. And so  
the Big Little Story became part of our vernacular at The Moth.  
\(But a word to the wise\: Just running into a celebrity does not  
qualify as a Big Little Story. It’s very cool that you met Beyoncé, but  
beyond the giddy rush of excitement, did it really change you or  
the trajectory of your life?\)  
FINDING YOUR ARC  
Moth stories involve change and evolution. The change is the  
structural frame that helps you build your overall arc in the story.  
An arc, put simply, is\: Who were you at the beginning of the  
story, and who were you at the end? How do you live your life  
differently as a result of the events in the story, and why is that  
consequence meaningful to you?  
If you're telling the story about the time you dropped your  
keys down the elevator shaft, did you always keep your keys in  
your pocket after that day? If it’s about families bonding after a  
disastrous wedding rehearsal dinner, did you feel less fretful about  
attending family gatherings after that?  
All Moth stories document a storyteller’s transformation. The  
change can be\:  
Physical \(out of shape \~ now running marathons\)  
Situational \(terrible marriage \~ divorced and fancy free\)  
Emotional \(dreading each day \> now happy to wake up\)  
Behavioral \(lover of bacon \> vegan\)  
Attitudinal \(hated dogs \> now you have three\)  
The change feeds the stakes of the story. It can be the discovery  
you made or the habit you broke, but ask yourself\: Why should we 68 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
care about this shift in you? Why do you care? \(Maybe those dogs  
filled an empty void?\)  
SARAH\: \[fnothing changes, youre sharing a recap, or an eloquent  
summation. Stories hinge on change.  
One of the most rewarding things about crafting a story is  
recognizing the significance of an experience that has marked  
you. There’s a difference between the events of the story \(the plot\)  
and what the story is really about. As storytellers, we see how those  
pivotal moments continue to influence and alter us.  
Faith Salie’s Moth story is about choosing a dress to wear to her  
divorce proceedings, but the emotional core is about wanting to  
be fully seen by her former husband, one last time.  
Nikesh Shukla shared a story about learning to cook his mother’s  
recipes for chana masala and dal bhat after she died, but on a  
deeper level, re-creating those dishes was a way to conjure his  
mother’s memory and make him feel closer to her.  
Noriko Rosted told a story about choosing a pet sitter for her  
beloved cat, Spencer—but the story is really about finding an  
unlikely connection with her young neighbor.  
When you allow yourself the space to revisit these experiences  
from your past, you'll begin to see patterns and themes emerge.  
Often a storyteller will say, “I never realized this about myself.”  
By truly looking at your life, you start to connect the dots and find  
meaning in the story.  
MICHELLE JALOWSKI, MOTH DIRECTOR\: I love when a storyteller  
calls me and says, “I remembered something!” As they thought  
about whatever experiences are part of their story, something  
occurred to them that shifted their perspective and brought them  
some new level of understanding. THE FOUNDATION 69  
KATE ON TOASTS\: Moth stories hinge on change. A toast may not.  
| approached my father in the line for one of our StorySLAMs. He was  
smiling, proud to tell me that he was going to throw his name into the hat  
and tell the toast that he’d given at my wedding a few months before. He  
knew it was great; he’d had the room captivated and in tears. One friend  
was So moved that she had to excuse herself for a walk around the block  
to gather herself afterward. In the toast, his love for me was clear from the  
beginning—but there was no change. He never once doubted it! | looked  
him in the eye and said, “Dad, your toast was perfect, but if you’re going  
to tell itataSLAM ... | have notes.” Your toast can earn a standing ova-  
tion without an arc. Keep your toast celebratory, brief, and full of vibrant  
scenes. \(Worry about the arc the next time you’re at aSLAM!\)  
YOUR ONE SENTENCE  
At this point you’re on your way to developing a story. You've  
identified a moment or two, you have an idea of the stakes, and  
you feel deep down that something changed for you as a result of  
the events in the story. The next thing to try, before you build the  
story, is to distill it down to one sentence.  
What’s the trailer of your story?  
The sentence you choose will act as your road map. You don’t  
need to include it in the actual story—there’s no need to start with  
a stated premise. \(Please don’t!\) Just think of it as a path to help  
guide and focus your story. You can revisit the one sentence as you  
go along, using it to edit out details that might be distracting or  
take the story off course.  
Let’s look at a one sentence for “A Kind of Wisdom,” Ellie Lee’s  
story that we talked about earlier in this chapter. 70 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
It took a disaster for me to appreciate the important role my father played  
in our community.  
Inherent in this sentence are the plot and her arc.  
There was a disaster in the community. \(In this case, it was  
the devastating five-alarm fire in Boston’s Chinatown.\)  
Ellie’s father is somehow important in the community.  
Her father’s importance was not evident to her until the  
extreme circumstances of the fire made it clear.  
Ellie gains a whole new level of respect and admiration for  
her father when she sees him through the eyes of the  
community.  
The story would be so different ifjust one word of the sentence  
changed. The one sentence acts as your lens. You can tell several  
different stories about the same life event, but knowing what this  
version of the story is about will give your story focus. For  
instance, ifit involves going to a fancy New Year’s Eve party, the  
details you choose to highlight will be different if the main  
through line is about confronting your fear of crowds versus  
realizing your date is the love of your life.  
CATHERINE\: Occasionally, after one of the storytellers I’m direct-  
ing tells their story, Meg will ask \(either in the moment or later\),  
“Well, what do you think the story is about in one sentence?” My  
heart always sinks, because I know it means what the storyteller  
is trying to convey is getting lost. I always dread that question,  
even though finding the answer will always \(always!\) make the  
story much better.  
Remember, Moth stories are about you, so you'll only be using  
your point of view. To choose the angle of this version of the story,  
ask yourself\:  
Is this story about you versus yourself—an internal struggle  
\(e.g., realizing and admitting your addiction to Twitter\)? THE FOUNDATION 71  
Is it about you and your evolving relationship with another  
person \(e.g., learning your son neglected to mention you  
were going to be a grandmother\)?  
Is it about you versus the world around you \(e.g., navigating  
a busy rush hour commute as a person who uses crutches  
and leg braces\)?  
Defining what the story is really about early on helps you  
choose the details and moments to best support it as you build it.  
We'll revisit your one sentence later during the editing process,  
when it will help you choose between details that support your  
story and those that distract from it. For now, consider it your  
blueprint and refer back to it frequently.  
DIRECTOR’S NOTES  
e Ask yourself\: What are the stakes of your story? What did you feel you  
stood to lose or gain as a result? What did you most want/need/must  
have/couldn’t live without? Remember, stakes show us why you care,  
which tells us why we should care.  
© Does your story go beyond anecdote? You might have dramatic details  
or a string of amusing events, but it must go deeper! Ask yourself why  
this moment left a lasting effect on you so you can transform your  
anecdote into a story.  
e Whatis the arc of your story? Who were you at the beginning and who  
were you at the end? How were you changed? How do you live your life  
differently as a result of the events in the story?  
e Whatisthe story ultimately about for you? Howwould you distill it down  
into one sentence? Remember, you can tell various stories using simi-  
lar events—boiling it down to one sentence will give you the focus and  
clarity to guide and shape the story you want to tell. CHAPTER 5  
THE MATERIALS  
When | first speak to a new storyteller, | ask them dozens of questions. We  
talk through what stories they might want to tell, and | want to hear every  
detail. | sometimes refer to this as “dumping their bag out on the bed.” We  
sift through everything, then decide what to keep and what to toss.  
—CATHERINE BURNS  
As you continue to build your story, you’ll need supplies. Good  
news\: You have everything you need, but you’re going to have  
to scrounge around in the beautiful junkyard of your memory to  
find the pieces. Get out your metal detector. We're digging for  
treasure, but we'll hit a lot of pennies and bottle caps along  
the way.  
NARRATIVE STEPPING STONES  
You may know where the story starts and where it ends, but  
between those two points are a thousand choices. What critical  
pieces of the narrative puzzle do we need in order to follow along?  
Try making a list of bullet points that includes not only specific 74 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
moments but also the backstory and important thoughts or real-  
izations that lead you to the climax and resolution at the end.  
But remember\: Moth stories are not all plot \(this happened,  
and then, can you believe this happened?\); they always alternate  
between action and reflection. The action may take the form ofa  
specific moment \(or scene\) or perhaps a series of moments.  
Reflection may include reactions to what is taking place \(i.e.,  
thoughts and feelings\), or it may be background information that  
helps us to better understand the action and the stakes involved.  
Each of these beats is a potential stepping stone in your story.  
It’s a little like an outline; every step is important to the narrative  
flow. If you leave any one of them out, the story will be tough  
to follow.  
Have you ever heard a story and thought, Wait, how did they get  
there? Were you confused by some detail that suddenly seemed  
important to the story? Chances are the teller missed a narrative  
step. If the story starts with you flat broke in Detroit but in the  
next scene you are suddenly shopping for fancy perfumes in Paris,  
the audience will be confused. You have to include the scene  
where you get that big unexpected tax refund right after your  
girlfriend tells you it’s her dream to see the Eiffel Tower.  
As you share the story, it’s as if you, the storyteller, are driving  
a car, and we, the audience, are in the passenger seat. You know  
exactly where you're going, and which turns to take. Some houses  
you just drive by en route to the next turn. But sometimes you  
slow down and stop to tell us about what we're seeing and maybe  
how the person who lived in that house was the only person who  
really saw you for who you are.  
You do not need to literally include every step of the journey  
or every turn you took along the way. Jump cuts are allowed! You  
can tell us about the car ride without including that you got in the  
car, put the keys in the ignition, started the car, put it into reverse,  
and backed out of the driveway. You just need to think about the  
important steps that will take us through your story. What info  
do we need to know to understand the bigger picture? THE MATERIALS 75  
For example, take Jackie Andrews’s story “Feedlot Calves,”  
about getting pregnant at sixteen and struggling to make ends  
meet, but succeeding with the help of the community. The step-  
ping stones might go something like this\:  
Jackie opens in her family’s dining room, telling her par-  
ents she’s pregnant and wants to keep the baby.  
Next, we are in the hospital, where Jackie is holding her  
newborn daughter for the first time, realizing how much  
she loves her, and how determined she is that they will  
make their way in the world together.  
She gives us the context of her daily life, successfully jug-  
gling high school, chores, and a job at Wendy’s, all while  
caring for her daughter.  
She explains how her ability to care for her daughter was  
challenged when a wave of hospital bills started to arrive,  
and she couldn’t pay them on her salary at Wendy’s; she had  
to find another source of support.  
She provides context and backstory that show how she was  
raised by a fiercely independent father who would not  
allow her to seek public assistance.  
Then she introduces her father’s detailed plan to rescue  
newborn calves from feedlots, raise them, and sell them at  
auction \(including important background info on how  
feedlots work\).  
She tells us the farm crisis hits, and the price of cattle plum-  
mets \(important context that raises the stakes\).  
In the end, she takes us to the auction, where the mood is  
ominous. But when Jackie’s father tells other farmers about  
her efforts to pay her bills, they are deeply impressed.  
Despite their hardships, they bid high, and Jackie earns the  
money she needs.  
The resolution comes when Jackie is able to pay all of her  
bills and expresses her deep and lasting gratitude for the  
community who rallied to help her. 76 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Once you have all your stepping stones in order, you may find  
that you can completely skip some. Sometimes you need to see  
everything to realize the fastest path to where you're going. You  
can often jump-cut from one plot point to another without hurt-  
ing the story. We don’t need to see you measuring flour and  
mixing the batter, just take the cake out of the oven.  
We'll talk about various structures you can use in a later chap-  
ter, but for now, as you're beginning to build your story, you just  
need to identify the important pieces of information. Which parts  
of your story absolutely must have close-up detail, and which  
parts can you condense?  
In a Moth story, the teller uses three elements to get us from  
beginning to end\:  
1. SCENES illustrate parts of the story that are both compelling  
and critical to the arc. The climax of the story is almost  
always a scene.  
2. SUMMARIES move us through the time line and connect us  
to the next step \(“three weeks later,” “after a lot of trial and  
error,” “I completed my master’s degree and was finally  
ready,” “two kids and a mortgage later . . . ”’\).  
3. REFLECTIONS share your feelings and insights about what  
you learned, concluded, deduced, decided to change, or  
accepted.  
In Jackie’s story, outlined earlier, she opens with a short scene  
of the inciting incident that sets the stage for the rest of the story.  
In 1979, Iwas standing in the dining room of our western Nebraska  
farmhouse, and I was crying. I was telling my mom and dad that I was  
pregnant.  
Her opening scene places us firmly in the moment and intro-  
duces the stakes of the story right out of the gate. She goes on to  
summarize her father’s reaction and then takes us quickly to the  
next scene. THE MATERIALS 77  
It was my father who brought my daughter to my bedside, and he placed  
her in my arms, and he said, “Jackie, here’s your daughter, and you do  
the very best you can with her. But no matter how hard you try, you’re  
going to mess her up.” He said, “We all do. But if you love her and you  
let her know how much you love her, she’ll forgive you.”  
She reflects on her feelings.  
The easy part was loving this baby. From the minute I held her, I loved  
her more than I loved life itself; And I knew that she and I were going to  
fight our way through this world.  
She then summarizes the context of the life that she settled into.  
I'd get up in the morning and I would do chores, and then I would go off  
to band practice and to school. And I would race home after school to see  
her before I went off to work at Wendy’s. At night, I would come home  
and I would do the chores for the night and start my homework. And I  
would learn to sleep with that little baby right here in the crook of my arm.  
It wasn’t easy, but I felt like I was keeping my head above water until that  
wave of hospital bills hit, and they were enormous.  
She provides context and important backstory about how she  
was raised.  
My dad was the kind of man who loved democracy, and he loved children,  
and he respected people who made an honest living with their hands. But  
he hated capitalism, and he distrusted institutions, and he was scornful of  
a wasteful society. So he had said that we would live on this farm and  
everything we needed would come from the farm. And if we couldn’t get  
it from that farm, then we would barter for it.  
And she throws in a little scene to illustrate. 78 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Ican still see my father standing there with a piece of rotten fruit that we  
had gotten from a dumpster behind the Jack & Jill grocery store. And he'd  
say, “Jackie, look at this. Seventy-five percent of this pear is good, and  
someone’s thrown it away.” Then he'd cut off the bad part and we'd eat it.  
He just had this way of looking at the world.  
She continues, summarizing the plan to rescue newborn  
calves, raise them, and sell them at auction, explaining how feed-  
lots work. She weaves in scenes to illustrate how they put the plan  
into action and the obstacles they encountered, including the  
1980 farm crisis.  
Then Jackie brings the story to a close with one final big scene  
at the cattle auction after her father shares her story with his fellow  
farmers, many of whom are struggling financially themselves.  
And that sale starts, and herd after herd is just coming through this sale  
ring, and the price is so low that they’re practically giving these cattle away.  
And I get that feeling in my stomach that’s just tightening because my fate  
is kind of marching toward me. And my herd comes into that ring. Those  
farmers started bidding, and then they kept on bidding. And they started  
bidding on those cattle like they were some kind of prize breeding stock.  
And that price, it went so far beyond what those cattle were worth, because  
those farmers were voicing their approval of my ability to try and pull  
myself up and pay off these bills. And they voiced that approval with  
wallets that had been emptied in this farm crisis. They didn’t give to me  
from their surplus, they gave to me from their hearts. And I walked away  
with enough money, and paid that hospital bill off in full.  
She lands her story with a final summary, including her reflec-  
tions looking back on the experience.  
A couple weeks later, I graduated high school, and my daughter and I took  
off out of western Nebraska, and I went on to earn a college degree. I  
joined the army, and Iwas awarded a bronze star for my actions in Desert  
Storm. I have been able to travel the world, and I have seen magnificent THE MATERIALS  
79  
things, but a part of my heart has never left western Nebraska. It will  
always remain with the farmers who gave me a chance in life.  
As the storyteller, you are in charge of how you use scenes,  
summaries, and reflections. You are driving this tour bus through  
your story, and you choose which scenes your “passengers” see—  
what we cruise past or where we pull over fora closer look. If your  
story is about applying for your dream job as a law clerk, it’s  
probably okay to skip the fact that your parents ran a clown school.  
Or maybe, for the purposes of the story you are trying to tell, that  
is exactly where you metaphorically stop the bus and have every-  
one get out and take a closer look. “I had learned to walk on my  
hands but couldn’t figure out how to put ona tie that didn’t squirt  
water.”  
SARAH ON STORIES DURING JOB INTERVIEWS\: My father  
spent his career in executive leadership, and he believes in connecting  
the dots on your résumé through story. He says, “When you look at your  
résumé, what did you learn in each position that led you to the next? What  
is the story arc of your career, and why is this new position the right next  
step?” For example\: Maybe you were a bassoonist who then became a  
conductor and then ultimately interviewed to become a music educator  
because you wanted to inspire more young people to choose a career  
path of music. You might not know where the story of your career is going,  
but when you look back at all the different jobs, there has to be some  
connection. What did you learn in one experience that narrowed down  
what you wanted to do next?  
When Travis Coxson, The Moth’s executive assistant and office  
coordinator, applied for his job, he had just spent years traveling as a  
stage manager for Broadway tours. We worried that he’d miss being on  
the road. But in his interview he told us that when the pandemic shut  
down theaters, he was suddenly at home for long stretches of time. He  
\_ found he loved quiet mornings with his longtime partner. What used to 80 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
be acrash pad became a home. He settled into a routine and realized  
how much more grounded he felt. He wanted to pivot, and find a way to  
use his organizational skills for live theatrical events without living out of  
a suitcase. His story resonated with us, and we offered him the job. A  
person who can turn job changes into narrative stepping stones that  
relate to one another will distinguish themselves. Telling the larger story  
of your work thus far is an impressive way to show the prospective  
employer who you are and why you are the perfect person for this role.  
FINDING THE SCENES  
Finding the scenes in your story brings it to life. What do these  
moments look like cinematically, as little movies? Reconstruct  
them in your mind and recount them vividly, so we can see and  
experience them with you.  
In “My Dangerous Beauty Mission,” Esther Ngumbi describes  
a familiar rite of passage\: ear piercing.  
Iwas growing up in a Kenyan village where there’s no Walmart or Claire’s  
to go get my ears pierced, so I had to do it the old school way. I locked the  
door, and I took that needle and thread, and I placed the wall mirror so that  
I could see what I was doing. I start pushing the needle and I’m feeling pain,  
but my pain is overshadowed by the beautiful Esther I’m imagining I will  
look like. Oh, my first kiss, my first boyfriend! After a minute the needle  
pierces through my earlobe. I tie the thread and I repeat the process. I start  
pushing again. And after what seems like eternity, my second ear is done. I  
take a big sigh and take a minute to appreciate my beautiful me.  
By bringing us into this detailed scene, she makes the audience  
feel both the pain and the joy she experiences from taking matters  
into her own hands. THE MATERIALS 81  
In “This Is Going to Suck,” Matthew Dicks tells us about being  
sent to the emergency room after a near-fatal car accident.  
A nurse comes over and asks me for my phone number, and I give her my  
parents’ number. Then I give her the number for McDonald’, because  
I’m supposed to be working that night. She scoffs at it, but I say, “No,  
that drive-through does not run well without me, and they’re gonna have  
to get someone in,” and, bless her heart, she calls McDonald’s. My  
parents, they don’t show up. I find out later that when they heard I was  
stable, they went to check the car out first. I’m waiting for a surgeon,  
because it’s December 23 and they’re hard to find, and I’m feeling alone.  
But I’m not alone, because when she called McDonald’s to tell them I  
was out, those people started calling other people, and the waiting room  
is now filling up with sixteen- and seventeen- and eighteen-year-old  
kids. They roll my gurney to the other side of the emergency room and  
they open a door, and one by one each of my friends stands in the door,  
and they wave and they give me the thumbs-up, and they say stupid  
things to make me laugh.  
Matthew could have just said, “My parents were absent and  
so my co-workers and classmates became my chosen family.”  
Instead he lets us experience the beauty of that realization  
with him.  
In her story “Before Fergus,” Lynn Ferguson tells us about a  
takeout dinner that she and her husband will never forget.  
We arrived back home, my husband decides he wants some takeout food.  
Ihave this bizarre thing where I want to do a pregnancy test. It’s positive.  
So my husband arrives back with his little brown paper bag to be greeted  
with the immortal phrase, “Put your curry down, sweetheart, there’s  
something really big I have to tell you!”  
Lynn uses the simplicity of this scene to underscore a moment  
that changes the trajectory of her whole family.  
In her story “Cast in Bronze,” Trina Michelle Robinson talks 82 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
about researching her ancestors and describes a scene from her  
journey to Kentucky to retrace their steps.  
We finally get to the homestead where my family was enslaved. We get  
out of the car, and everything is largely overgrown with wild flowers and  
tall grass. Scott \[our guide\], he starts pointing everything out to me, like  
where the main house used to be, the native grass and plants and trees,  
just so I can get an idea of what my family would have seen. There were  
these beautiful ancient oak trees and cherry trees and goldenrod. It was  
fall, so things were starting to fade, but when they were hit by the sun they  
were just so beautiful. I hated it, because how could beauty live here?  
Scenes like Trina’s keep us present. They drop us into the story  
and let us experience it. Because we can envision the sun on the  
goldenrod, we can better understand her struggle to reconcile the  
physical beauty with the historical ugliness. Which of your step-  
ping stones could be told in a scene? Perhaps you start with a  
particularly exciting moment in your lifeé-or getting some surpris-  
ing news—for example, the day you discovered you had a  
winning lottery scratch ticket. Push in and describe the actual  
moment\:  
Where were you?  
Do you always buy a scratch ticket on the same day at the  
same location?  
Were you alone or with friends?  
Did you believe it, or did you have to ask someone to look  
at it and tell you it was true?  
Were you stunned into silence, or did you do a rowdy  
victory dance?  
Then what happened?  
. And so onand so on. THE MATERIALS 83  
GIVING SPACE TO A MOMENT  
a  
Scenes can be drawn from the active moments, places where  
something happens in your story and you want to slow down and  
explore. For instance, if your story begins with you quitting your  
job, don’t just tell us you quit. Show us where you were—-sitting  
anxiously in your boss’s office or losing your cool next to a frozen  
yogurt machine that just erupted with raspberry swirl. Was there  
a phone ringing or a kid standing nearby laughing uncontrolla-  
bly? What happened next? Did you stumble over your words, or  
did you take off that purple apron covered in yogurt and throw it  
on the floor before you stormed out?  
In “Rich City Skater,” Jacoby Cochran drops us right into the  
moment he’s called to perform in the high-stakes world of com-  
petitive roller-skating circa 1990.  
Now, if you’ve never been roller-skating in your life, a National Party is  
like the Grammys of roller-skating. I'm talking about some of the greatest  
roller skaters in America, all in one place, showing off their moves, their  
music, their style. At that moment, we were going through a roll call,  
which means every city comes on the floor and represents. So, you got  
people from Texas doing the “Slow Walk.” People from Detroit doing  
“The Ballroom.” Folks from Kentucky doing crazy between-the-leg  
throws. They were here from California to New York City to Florida,  
each with their unique flair, and the place was packed. The classic music  
was thumping. The synchronized lights were blaring. The fog machines  
were humming. At that moment, a song by the Godfather of Soul, James  
Brown, came on. And once you heard that “woooooo0” in the intro of  
“The Payback” you knew it was time for Chicago to get on the floor.  
In “A Soldier’s Story,” army veteran Ray Christian talks about  
confronting his post-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\) with a few  
disturbing scenes where we see him quick to anger, confused, and  
even delusional. Then he shares this\: 84 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
I find myself at the mall, and I’m sitting on the bench, just trying to gather  
my thoughts, and a middle-aged lady, she shows up, and she’s got her very  
elderly and frail mother with her. And she says to her, “Mama, I have to  
go to the bathroom. I want you to sit right here and don’t go anywhere  
until I come back. Okay?” And she leaves. And this old lady is staring  
at me and staring at me. I try to look away. She keeps staring at me, and  
then she slowly moves her trembling, frail old hand next to mine, and she  
holds it. And I start to cry.  
Her daughter comes back and she sees this and says\:  
“Mama, what are you doing? You can’t be just touching people like that.  
Sir, are you okay?” I said, “I’m fine.” And her mother looks up and says,  
“It’s what he needed.”  
Itis what I needed.  
Earlier in the story, Ray had shown us his erratic behavior.  
When we see him take comfort in a stranger’s gesture, we know  
he can no longer ignore the signs of his PTSD. It is the moment  
he sees it too.  
Scenes show us important moments, instead of simply convey-  
ing facts. Ruby Cooper does this in her story “Kirk’s Christmas  
Gift,” which explores her relationship with her son.  
She could have told us\: My son had charisma.  
But instead, she shows us\: He was seven years old when I took him to  
school for the first time. And I pushed him down the hallway in his  
wheelchair, and he was going, “Hi! I Kirk. Hi! I Kirk.” And waving like  
he was running for office.  
She could have told us\: I had a hard time saying no to my son.  
Butinstead, she showsus\: When he lost his tooth that year, I said, “Here’s  
what's going to happen. We're going to put your tooth under your pillow, THE MATERIALS 85  
and then the tooth fairy is going to come and exchange it for money.” And  
he said, “No. Mine bring pie.” I said, “No, no. The tooth fairy doesn’t  
deliver pie. The tooth fairy’s a little thing with a sack of coins.” And he  
said, “No. Mine bring pie.” I said, “Okay. . . . What kind of pie?”  
“Chocolate.” So the next morning, the tooth was gone, and there was a  
box with a chocolate pie in it, delivered by a fairy at the local bakery,  
This little scene of Kirk calling the shots and Ruby’s inability  
to resist paints a picture of the dynamic that plays out later on in  
the story.  
In “Shawnees Never Quit,” Alistair Bane recounts a time he  
was asked to sing a hymn in church.  
I turned to the organist, who was waiting patiently. I was like, “ ‘Michael,  
Row Your Boat Ashore,’ please, ma’am.” She smiled, nodded. “Good  
selection.” The music started, and about the place I felt like there should  
be some words, I started to sing. “Michael, row your boat ashore, hallelu-  
jah. Michael, row your boat ashore. . . .” It was about the time that I  
reached the second hallelujah that I realized that was, in fact, the only  
line I remembered. But Shawnees have never been quitters. So I decided  
there can be different versions of the same song. There can be, like,  
extended dance remixes, where vocals are looped repetitively. I closed my  
eyes, ‘cause sometimes it’s better not to see your audience. And while I  
stood there singing, I had plenty of time for existential questions, like  
Who is Michael? Why does God want him to row his boat ashore?  
And then finally I hit that line for the sixteenth time, and I stopped. The  
organist, who was not quite sure what was happening, continued to play  
fora minute, but when she realized it was finally over, she stopped in kind  
of an abrupt way. And then there was silence, and in that silence, I walked  
back down the center aisle. I started to climb back over my friend’s knees.  
As I did, our eyes met, and he just said, “Dude.”  
In Alistair’s story, the scenes build toward him giving in to the  
pressure of performing in church, in an attempt to make his host  
happy. In sharing his inner thoughts, Alistair strategically slows 86 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
his story down—thus building the tension, anxiety, and dread  
that he felt in that moment on the pulpit. Using this technique,  
Alistair not only reveals his vulnerability—he helps the audience  
physically feel that same dread.  
Some stories might be chock full of small scenes, while others  
may have only two or three more detailed, impactful scenes.  
Usually there is one big scene \(or the “main event”\) that the entire  
story is building to, which includes the climax. This is the scene  
without which there is no story.  
In James Braly’s “One Last Family Photo,” his family has  
gathered at the deathbed of his sister Kathy. The story comes to a  
head as they witness Kathy’s wedding held in the hospice room.  
My dad stands up. The nurse walks in to make sure Kathy’s not being  
coerced. Steve walks over to the corner and takes Kathy’s hand, and the  
preacher opens the bible and begins speaking very quickly, “Dearlybeloved,  
wearegatheredheretojointhismanandthiswomaninholymatrimony”—like  
an auctioneer. Because he needs to finish before Kathy falls back asleep.  
Kathy says, “I do.” My dad looks at Steve, and they shake hands.  
My mom says, “Congratulations,” and gives him one of her bony  
osteoporosis hugs. I pop open the champagne and pour it in the paper cups  
from the water cooler.  
And everybody is drinking a toast to the bride and groom when  
someone says, “How about a picture of the kids?”  
I walk over to the corner and stand on one side of Kathy’s bed, and  
my brother and sister stand on the other, and we pose for a photograph.  
We're looking out at a giant poster of the same pose, taken twenty years  
ago at my sister Corinne’s wedding, the only photograph of the four of us  
together ever taken. Corinne had it enlarged and put on Kathy’s wall to  
remind her of home.  
So, I stand there staring at how we used to look, posing for the last  
photograph we'll ever take. My mom and dad looking on, all of us  
together in a room for the first time I can ever remember, and probably the  
last—because of Kathy who, in the end, is showing us all how hard it is,  
but how beautiful it can be, to let go. THE MATERIALS 87  
BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS\: On her fiftieth birthday, Mary Domo,  
an early volunteer at The Moth, threwa party, and asked everyone invited  
to come prepared with a two-minute Moth-style Mary story. Mary has  
many friends from vastly different parts of her life\: her Hoboken crew,  
East Village neighbors, career friends, people from The Moth, people  
from Burning Man. The idea was for each guest to share stories. “That’s  
very Mary” could have been the theme. Each person only had two min-  
utes to paint a scene that showed her quirky genius. The little stories  
acted as introductions between people who had never met before. Mary  
felt loved, celebrated, and seen. All her guests felt more connected.  
On the other side of the world, in the Embakasi neighborhood of  
Nairobi, an eighteen-year-old birthday girl asked each adult guest to tell  
amemorable story oftheir eighteen-year-old self. Stories were shared by  
the girl’s grandmother and grandfather and everyone who was there to  
celebrate. The best story was the one her grandmother shared about how  
her husband \(the girl’s grandfather\) taught her how to drive a car. Moth  
instructor Maureen Amakabane, who was there, said, “It was so beauti-  
ful. The grandfather said that he’d tell his version of the story at next  
year’s birthday celebration! We all laughed. | was there with my young  
daughter, and not only did we get to know the family and neighbors bet-  
ter, but my daughter asked if we could do the same for her next  
birthday.”  
BEFORE WE EXIT SCENE  
As you craft your scenes, make sure to stay in the action and  
describe them from the inside. Be an active participant rather than  
a passive observer, and avoid telling from hindsight. Allow the  
moment to unfold the way it happened for you.  
Consider the difference between\: 88 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
I was scared when I walked in the room because I heard a noise.  
and  
As I opened the door, I heard a growling noise in the corner—and my  
heart started racing!  
Tell it as if you were standing in it and feeling it now.  
Ifa detail or scene is surprising, don’t ruin the surprise by  
telling us it’s coming! Give us the gift of feeling surprised along  
with you. Lose the preamble “and then the most amazing thing  
happened.” Setting the expectation might actually dilute it.  
Resist the urge to tell a listener what to think or feel, and let them  
come to their own conclusion.  
If your story is feeling flat or you notice your listener is  
tuning out \(or maybe you are!\), try finding a scene to make it  
more engaging. 4  
DETAILS  
The brand of margarine, the song on the radio, the texture of the  
blanket, the fragment of crime scene tape still on the doorframe,  
the feel of moss beneath your bare feet—details turn your scenes  
from black-and-white into Technicolor. They make the story  
vivid, real, and tangible. They are often the juiciest part. Believe  
it or not, even the most obscure details can make your story feel  
more relatable. They highlight moments, create emotion, add  
tension, and ultimately support the stakes and the arc ofa story.  
Details make your story unforgettable to the listener.  
MEG\: I often tell people to blow it up big—look at all the details  
and moments you have to play with. The first step is to assess  
everything you have and then decide which of the details really  
support the story you are trying to tell. THE MATERIALS 89  
In Leland Melvin’s story “A Moment of Silence,” he tells us  
about arriving at the International Space Station and being invited  
for a meal in the Russian segment by the commander. She told  
him to bring the rehydrated vegetables and they would provide  
the meat. He described the evening like this\:  
The smell of meat getting heated up. Their beef and barley, and our green  
beans with almonds, all being shared with people that we used to fight  
against, the Russians and the Germans. As we broke bread at 17,500  
miles per hour, going around the planet every ninety minutes, seeing a  
sunrise and a sunset every forty-five, I thought about the people that I’m  
now working with and trusting with my life. African American, Asian  
American, French, German, Russian, the first female commander of the  
International Space Station. Breaking bread, floating food to each other’s  
mouths. All while listening to Sade’s “Smooth Operator.”  
The specificity of details brings the scene to life. Instead of it  
was raining, tell us about the noise of the rain on the roof or the  
puddles that blocked the path.  
In Trisha Mitchell Coburn’s story “Miss Macy,” she describes  
the journey from her small Southern hometown to the big city  
like this\:  
Miss Macy and I boarded the train for New York City with a bottle of  
Drambuie and a brown paper bag filled with Southern fried chicken.  
Thirty hours later, we walked into the Waldorf Astoria hotel. We had  
never seen anything like it. It was out of a movie or something. And people  
sounded different, and they looked different. And our room was a far cry  
from the cinder block walls of my bedroom back in Alabama.  
You draw these details out from any \(or all\) of your senses.  
How did something feel, both emotionally and physically? Was  
there a sweet smell or an eerie whistling sound? Did someone use  
a turn of phrase that sticks with you? Was there a thought that ran  
through your head in the moment? 90 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
In Shaun Leonardo’s story “El Conquistador,” he paints the  
picture of what it felt like the first night he got in the ring as  
a luchador.  
The night comes, and it’s a rickety ring in some makeshift arena with  
folding chairs, and the mariachi music is blaring, and it feels glorious. And  
they call out my name, and all the blood rushes right out of my body. But  
I pull myself together, \[get pumped, and I step out in all white and gold.  
The knight in shining armor with a fourteen-foot velvet cape. I hit that  
ring and I’m looking good, and then I get my ass kicked.  
JODI POWELL, MOTH DIRECTOR\: We often forget the inner dialogue.  
It is equally if not more important to let us know what you are  
saying to yourself in the moment as it is to hear what you are  
saying out loud to everyone else.  
In discussing his story on The Moth Radio Hour, Francois  
Clemmons, a Black man, takes us to Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,  
where in a now iconic scene, filmed at the height of the civil rights  
movement, he and Fred Rogers, a white man, soaked their feet  
ina kiddie pool.  
So I took my boots off, put my socks over there, and we indeed put our  
feet in that same tub. I get chills thinking about what a statement it was.  
And he cared enough to say something. So we put our feet in the water  
together, and he had a little hose, and he ran some water there. Once  
again, you think about what the policemen did with the hose when they  
were so powerful, knocking people down. And here were two people in  
friendship using the hose to wet our feet.  
There are events or situations that a vast number of people  
have experienced\: falling in love, losing a loved one, being diag-  
nosed with cancer, coming out, the birth of a child. Many of the  
“stepping stones” in these stories will be the same for everyone.  
The challenge is to find the details that make your familiar life THE MATERIALS 91  
experience remarkable and uniquely yours.  
Consider the difference between “We kissed” and how Moth  
storyteller Jeni De La O described her first kiss with her husband.  
It was a kiss I could feel in my toes. A kiss I can still feel in my toes.  
Many people have been through some harrowing moments  
while driving, but in “That Thing on My Arm,” Padma Lakshmi  
takes us from being a passenger eating lunch in her mother’s car  
to the moment the car was hit.  
I was eating this rice. Suddenly I heard a loud bang! And I looked up,  
and I can remember the plate flying . . . and yellow rice everywhere, like  
confetti. And as the rice came down, all I could see was this beautiful,  
crystal-clear blue sky. No clouds, no cars, no road in front of us, no trees,  
nothing. Just endless, miraculous blue sky with these kind of yellow grains  
flying all around. Then, all of a sudden, I heard another thud. And then  
it was just stillness.  
When you dig into the scenes you’ve identified, details begin  
to emerge that might be interesting and bring more meaning to  
your story. Those tennis shoes that you wore every day for all of  
1986 might tell us a little bit about who you were in your youth;  
the random man at the grocery store who was laughing uncon-  
trollably in the produce section might illustrate how you thought  
everyone around you was acting unusual.  
Consider how Danusia Trevino shows us she didn’t want to be  
picked for jury duty in her story “Guilty”\:  
I got dressed for jury-picking day. I spiked my hair. I made sure my bat  
tattoo was in full view. I put on motorcycle boots, jeans with holes, and a  
T-shirt that said 1 Wanna Be Your Dog. 92 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Each of these storytellers used specific details to bring their  
scenes to life. Try it in your story. Instead of “I was nervous about  
a meeting,” share the playlist you blasted in your headphones to  
get you pumped as you walked into your boss’s office to ask for a  
raise. Make us root for you to get the R-E-S-P-E-C-T you  
deserve!  
MOTH FOUNDER GEORGE DAWES GREEN ON “BURIED TREASURE”\:  
There’s a bit of magic that raconteurs use, which I call “buried  
treasure.” Early in your story, in the first minute or two, you bring  
up some small detail—usually something physical, talismanic\: “So  
that was the day Uncle Wilkins took us to Coney Island. We all  
rode the Cyclone and the big Ferris wheel, and then crammed  
into a photo booth to take a strip of photos. Four shots, and  
before each one Uncle Wilkins called out a pose for us to  
assume. ‘Surprise!’ he said. We all tried to show surprise. ‘Fury!  
Sorrow! Exultation!’” \:  
Then, as your story goes on, you palm that detail. Forget it,  
leave it alone. Till you come to the end of your narrative, when  
you produce it again\:  
“... And the cop handed me Uncle Wilkins’s threadbare  
wallet, and I looked through it. There was a twelve-year-old gym  
membership, his expired driver’s license, and nothing else—  
except a long, folded cardlike thing. Which I unfolded. It was a  
strip of four photo-booth snapshots. The four of us assuming  
those poses. Surprise. Fury. Sorrow. Exultation.”  
Your listeners will have completely forgotten that photo  
strip—until you bring it up in this entirely new context. And now  
that they know the characters involved, the photo strip—the  
“buried treasure”—will be laden with new meaning. If you  
pull off this sleight-of-hand nimbly, it can be a powerful and  
moving device. THE MATERIALS 93  
DETAILS BUILD CHARACTERS  
When describing other people in your story, try looking for  
details and choices that will help us understand the character of  
that person the best. In “GFD,” one small detail says a lot about  
Micaela Blei’s classmate.  
She is a lipstick girl and Iam a ChapStick girl. So she knows more than  
me, right? And she’s not nervous about ninth grade at all.  
In “The Gig,” Christian McBride remembers meeting leg-  
endary musician Freddie Hubbard for the first time.  
Freddie Hubbard was a man with a huge spirit, a very macho kind of guy,  
who almost had, like, a mob boss mentality. To be a good musician wasn’t  
enough. He was very dramatic; he didn’t make the rehearsal, didn’t make  
the sound check, just showed up for the gig. I’m in the dressing room,  
shaking in my shoes, and Carl says, “Hey, Freddie, this is Christian  
McBride.” I was seventeen at the time, and Freddie just kind of looks at  
me and says, “Yeah, nice to meet you.” We go on stage and we play  
and to hear his horn up close like that, I almost had a heart attack. I  
thought, Oh my God, I’m playing with Freddie Hubbard. I can’t  
believe this.  
Many stories include a colorful family member. Instead of say-  
ing “My uncle was eccentric,” in her story “Ashes and Salmon,”  
Joan Juliet Buck quotes her uncle Don.  
“When I was bringing your grandmother’s ashes down to Cannes to bury  
them, somebody gave me a smoked salmon to cheer me up. I was not going  
to pack it in the suitcase, so I left the smoked salmon in the carrier bag,  
and your grandmother was in one of those pale-blue Pan Am overnight  
bags. I put them both above my seat in the plane, and when we landed at  
Nice, I collected the smoked salmon and I forgot your grandmother.” 94 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
In his story “The Met, Mrs. Vreeland, and Me,” about work-  
ing for the legendary Vogue editor Diana Vreeland, Andrew  
Solomon could have stated that she was opinionated about fash-  
ion. Instead, he gives us this\:  
We were walking through the Great Hall of the Metropolitan Museum.  
And she put one of her small, clawlike hands on my arm. And she said  
to me, “Young man, stop for a minute. I want you to look around this  
room, and contemplate the fact that every one of these people went into a  
store in which other things were available and selected what they’re  
wearing right now.”  
We asked storyteller Carl Banks to render the twin sister he  
lost to suicide more clearly in his story “Over the Bridge.” With  
limited time, he only had a few sentences to do it, and yet, a  
lifetime of memories to choose from.  
He went with this\:  
She was an amazing visual artist. She was an unrepentant radical with  
a touch of anarchist, but she had an extremely tender heart and was  
incredibly sensitive.  
He could have left it there but chose to add this rich detail\:  
She used to draw caricatures of tourists at Six Flags, and she was so sen-  
sitive that she couldn’t make any money doing it. She would always give  
the drawings away, either thinking it wasn’t good enough or thinking it  
was so good that they should just have it for free.  
The summary of his sister was good, but the Six Flags detail  
really paints a picture.  
It’s another way of connecting and engaging with your  
audience. We feel closer to his sister, and to Carl, because of this  
story detail. THE MATERIALS 95  
JENIFER ON RIBBON-CUTTING TOASTS\: On occasion, you  
might have to toast not a person but a place or thing, such as a hospital  
wing or a new branch or brand. In this case, you are likely toasting and  
celebrating the team responsible. What is the “personality” of the team?  
\(Scrappy, diligent, magically creative, fierce, intimidating!\) How is that  
“personality” reflected? Shed some light on how the team found each  
other and found unity in its purpose. Remember to focus on the why of  
their venture\: “Now we can heal more people/serve more clients/sell  
more.” Sometimes there is a very clear story are. You can nod to the  
process of development\: from seed to plant, from blueprint to brick and  
mortar. Make sure to include the challenges, because the valleys make  
the mountains seem higher, and a toast is a mountaintop-worthy  
celebration.  
THE PERILS OF DETAIL OVERLOAD  
Details can offer useful color, but don’t go overboard! Too  
many details can be distracting and fatigue a listener. If you go  
into great detail about something that doesn’t really connect to  
the rest of the story \(e.g., if you digress and tell us about your uncle  
Al, when he isn’t particularly relevant\), it can be confusing.  
Anytime a detail raises a question or causes a listener’s mind to  
wander, they’re off trying to figure out the answer to the question  
in their head while you’ve moved on. You lose your connection.  
It’s like having too many vases on the mantel—you can’t fully  
appreciate the beauty of one when there are others competing f  
or your attention. When directing a story, we’ll sometimes  
say, “The audience won't know where to look.” Choose a few  
details that really shine and capture our attention, and save the  
others for a different story where they can get their due. You are 96 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
a multitude of stories; they won't be in storage forever.  
When debating whether a detail is relevant, go back to the one  
sentence of your story. If the one-sentence summary of your story  
is\: This is a story about a dog who finds a home, you won't want to  
include the details about the cat unless they directly support the  
story of the dog.  
More details on the detail pitfalls to avoid\:  
TOO MANY SPECIFIC DATES. Mentioning multiple dates can  
make a story feel long and tedious. The listener might  
think the dates are important and get frustrated thinking  
they have to keep track. On March 9, 2009, I did this, then  
on September 21, 2010, I did this, then on November 24,  
2021... Are the dates really important? Is one crucial?  
Don’t tell us over and over what time it was or a specific  
date, unless that’s a driving force of the story.  
TOO MANY NAMES AND CHARACTERS. It’s enough to know you  
have twenty-three cousins, we don’t need all their names  
and ages. Say the name ofa persorin the story only if they  
are a key character. Once you name someone, the audience  
will think they need to remember that person because  
they’re integral to the story. Even if a person is a central  
character, it can sometimes be easier to refer to them by  
who they are \(e.g., “my dentist” rather than “Nancy”\) for  
the sake of simplicity. Any added characters must have a  
functional purpose in the story.  
TOO MANY GRAPHIC DETAILS. Don’t go into the gory details of  
an injury \(or the intimate details ofa romantic encounter\)  
if they aren’t what the story is ultimately about. Sometimes  
people will add in details they think are cool or shocking,  
but they end up distracting the listener. The teller has  
moved on with the story, but the listener is still back there  
thinking about the gratuitous image you’ve conjured.  
Make sure the details you choose support rather than com-  
pete with the story. THE MATERIALS 97  
DETAILS THAT MIGHT BE AT ODDS IN YOUR STORY. Situations are  
often complex, but make sure your story makes sense. If  
your story is about the time your father drove four hours in  
a snowstorm to pick you up after a bad date, it might not be  
relevant to share that he plagiarized his paper on Romeo and  
Juliet in high school. We only need to understand his char-  
acter as it relates to your story.  
MISLEADING DETAILS. Don’t mention that your uncle just  
finished plumbing school unless a pipe is going to burst.  
If you put too much emphasis on a detail, the listener  
will hold on to it throughout the story and be disappointed  
when you never come back to it. Whatever happened to  
the plumber?  
QUESTIONING DETAILS IN YOUR OWN STORY. Saying something  
like “I can’t remember the details of the argument” or “I  
was probably driving to school” might cause the listener to  
question whether you are remembering everything else  
correctly. Better to say, “Before class, we fought like cats  
pee  
and dogs!” Include the details you do remember instead of  
pointing out the ones you don’t. In most cases, the ones you  
remember will be enough to move the story forward.  
USING DETAILS TO SETTLEASCORE. This is not the time to grind  
your axe. We have found that when a storyteller shares a  
story and bad-mouths someone—an ex, a friend, a  
parent—they run the risk of putting the listener on the  
defensive. Human nature wants to protect people who  
aren't there to defend themselves. Your neighbor might  
very well be a jerk, but unless we know and care about you,  
we will most likely question your motives for telling this  
story. It’s important that you show the listener who you are  
first, and gain their trust, so that when you introduce this  
bad element, they will already be firmly on your side. 98 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
THE TRUTH ABOUT DETAILS  
At the end of every episode of The Moth Radio Hour, we hear  
producer Jay Allison say, “Moth stories are true, as remembered  
and affirmed by the storytellers.” Memory is imperfect, and some-  
times the way we remember our experiences is different from how  
the events actually unfolded. Think of Moth stories as an artistic  
time capsule of one person’s emotional experience of events.  
FRIMET GOLDBERGER, MOTH STORYTELLER\: Stories are not static;  
they grow, they shrivel, they stretch on one side and shrink on the  
other. Like people, stories evolve—even, and especially, our own  
stories. Memory is unreliable; we tend to remember things based  
on present perceptions. And in that sense, no person’s story stays  
the same.  
It’s impossible to remember our experiences with scientific  
accuracy. Stories rely on memories, not court reporters, and  
rarely can we roll back the tape. Memories are porous and imper-  
fect, and can be deeply influenced by internal bias. The truth we  
see, and therefore the truth we tell, is colored by every single  
experience we've lived through.  
DR. WENDY SUZUKI, MOTH STORYTELLER AND NEUROSCIENTIST\: Our  
memory is precious because it provides the scaffolding for who  
we are as a person, including defining our own personal histories.  
However, at the same time, our memories don’t act like a  
YouTube video, recording every move in precise detail. Instead,  
our memories are fallible, inaccurate, and can be modified liter-  
ally every time we recall them.  
To complicate matters further, the details and pictures that  
you've had etched in your mind for all these years could be pro-  
tecting the innocent, fanning the flames ofa grudge, or clouded  
by nostalgia. THE MATERIALS 99  
As youre considering and constructing your story, acknowl-  
edge that what you remember about these events is not all there  
was to remember. This experience left a lasting mark, but every time  
you recall it, you're recalling a memory of that memory. Details  
are bound to shift. Some may get lost, but some long-dormant  
details may also be brought back to light.  
We often have complex and conflicting opinions about events  
as they unfold. It is rare that we feel just one emotion. Multiple  
truths can exist in tandem, and you can acknowledge two or three  
\(or more!\) in a story.  
It is possible to be incredibly grateful for a lifeboat but also  
deeply resentful. Say you thought you weren't actually drowning  
and you didn’t need it and wished you could have proven how  
strong you were, but you're also relieved that you didn’t have to  
exhaust yourself. It all depends on the thrust of the story. Is this  
relevant to your arc? Sometimes that complexity is the story. The  
contradiction can be the focus of the story, but if it isn’t, it’s best  
to leave it out.  
TMI\: Divulging too much information in social settings can be  
uncomfortable. Think twice before adding a TMI laundry list of pet  
peeves, the saga of your bum toe, or a trilogy of pet tragedies. \(God, | miss  
Fluffy.\) Be conscious of what you’re sharing and the themes within these  
stories. With too many distracting details and digressions, your neighbor,  
fellow PTA parent, or potential new partner will wonder\: What is this  
person trying to say? What is the point?  
CATHERINE\: | was ona blind date, andinthe first minute, he told me  
the story of being fired just hours earlier. That was bad enough, but then  
he told me he was fired because, in his words, he was “grumpy, lazy, and  
likes to complain.” |t didn’t make me eager to sign up for a second date.  
SARAH\: Years ago, a first date told me a very serious story of his  
favorite vacation. He’d unexpectedly found himself at a nudist resort  
where he spent his days playing volleyball \(!\) and his nights at a club 100 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
on-site, where the dress code was “sport coat only.” He said this resort at  
first seemed strange but quickly became his favorite place. At the end of  
the story, he looked deeply into my eyes and asked, “Does this sound like  
something you would be interested in?” He purposefully used a story to  
illustrate something that brought him joy. It was a test to see if | might  
share that same interest. But—much respect to nudists—| politely said  
no. | loved the story, we just weren’t a fit—but | won't soon forget him.  
TRUTHS TO CONSIDER  
OUR MEMORIES ARE ALITTLE FAULTY \(AT BEST\). W hat if you don’t  
exactly remember a few of the details? Was it Wednesday or  
Friday? Was I eight or nine years old? Was his name Joe or John?  
Did I receive the care package from Mom before or after I filed for  
divorce? This is a time to make a chdice about what is most  
likely true. If this detail is not factually correct, will it make  
a difference to the essential truth of your story?  
REALLIFEIS MESSY. On Tuesday, you were sure you were in  
love. On Wednesday, you knew it would never work, but  
by Friday, you were engaged. Depending on the story  
you're telling, do you need to include Wednesday? Is the  
story still true without the day of doubt? Ifthe Wednesday  
blip is of no consequence, leave it out, or it'll just confuse  
the listener.  
UNCOMPLICATE THE TRUTH. It is okay to simplify ifthe simpli-  
fication feels honest. If your story has multiple details that  
happened at different locations or times, you can condense  
them into one scene or location. Say there’s a part of your  
story where something is mentioned at a church service,  
and then a few days later, something else was said at Bible  
study, and then at the next church service, another thing  
was said. It’s perfectly fine to take a little artistic license and THE MATERIALS 101  
Just condense all the things that were said into one time at  
church. Otherwise it will be confusing.  
EDIT TO MAKE THE TRUTHCLEARER. You might find omitting a  
character or streamlining events will make it easier to fol-  
low along. Do we really need to know that the cab driver  
heard the whole exchange? Does he recur as a character, or  
is this his only appearance? Grouping people together  
rather than listing them off individually might be less con-  
fusing\: my theater tech crew, everyone in Accounting. Or perhaps  
you reorder a chain of events or even leave a whole chunk  
of action on the cutting-room floor. \(It might be interest-  
ing that you stole the getaway car from your  
ex-father-in-law, but if we don’t have a ton of time, it is  
enough that you just have a getaway car.\)  
OWNIT. Part of the honesty in a story is also taking stock of  
your part in it. What have you done or not done to land  
yourselfin this predicament? Aunt Ethel was cranky at the  
family reunion? Well, did you leave out the part about  
when you were twenty and ran over her foot with your car?  
Showing your honest, banged-up self will generally make  
us trust you and want to root for you.  
IS THE POINT OF VIEW EVEN POSSIBLE? It’s hard to believe that  
you could remember a ton of detail from a story that hap-  
pened when you were four, or in a coma, or asleep. Don’t  
strain your credibility by telling a story that starts with  
your alleged thoughts in your mother’s womb.  
STAY IN YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE AND FEELINGS. If you say that  
someone was thinking this, that, or the other thing about  
you, your listeners are taken out of the story. They stop and  
question whether your assumption is plausible or not. How  
do you know what they were thinking? To stay on track, tell us  
what you knew to be true\: “John looked at me, and I  
instantly worried that he thought I was a fool” is probably  
more accurate. 102 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
MEG\: I once had a storyteller tell me something awful that  
another person thought about him, and I said, “They told  
you that??” and he said, “No.” So then I asked who told  
him and he said, “No one, I just have a feeling that they  
think that.” So I said, “Okay then, just say that. Let it be  
YOUR feeling, don’t state an assumption as a fact!”  
Moth stories are not fiction, and perhaps more important,  
human beings are smart. When we're truly listening—as Moth  
audiences do enthusiastically—we can sense when a teller is lying,  
and it pulls us out of the story. In film and literature, this is some-  
times referred to as an “unreliable narrator,” someone speaking  
in the first person whose version of events seems distorted,  
untrustworthy, or otherwise questionable.  
Details, when used well, can make your story not just inter-  
esting but also harrowing, exciting, rich, fun, and colorful. They  
engage your listener on a sensory level and show us who you are  
and what you’ve experienced. \:  
Stories are the original version of virtual reality—no goggles  
necessary.  
SARAH ON FAMILY STORIES AND ARTISTIC LICENSE\: My  
grandma Harriet told stories, many times with events just slightly out of  
order. I'd say, “Grandma, | was with you. That's not exactly how it hap-  
pened,” and she'd crinkle her nose, point her finger at me, and say, “I  
know. / spiced it up.” When you tell stories, some things may get switched  
around. If you get a big reaction for those Technicolor details, the narra-  
tive can grow and grow over the years—as you tell and retell—to become  
a“big fish” story or one that could seem like a tall tale even ifit’s true. You  
can spice your story up, like Grandma Harriet, but keep the plot grounded  
in your lived experience. The essence of the story can still be truthful,  
even ifyou skip forward, omit a beat, or reorder things slightly. THE MATERIALS 103  
BACKSTORY  
When something happens, and you just have to call your friend to  
share it, remember that your friend knows a lot about you—your  
background, opinions, and shared experiences—and it informs  
how they receive the story. Your listeners will only have the back-  
story you provide, unless you are famous—and even if you are,  
the audience probably knows nothing about you and your inner  
life. In iconic rapper Darryl “DMC” McDaniels’s story “Angel,”  
it’s important for us to know that while on a world tour with  
Run-DMC, he’d been suffering from debilitating depression,  
and had recently found out he was adopted. This is information  
the audience needs to know in order to fully understand his story.  
You have an endless backstory; the art is figuring out which  
parts are relevant. It’s hard to imagine telling a story about being  
fired that would not nod to your extraordinary history of thirty-  
seven firings, but we can’t possibly hear about everything from  
your childhood paper route to your corporate gig. Most people  
would instinctively gravitate to the biggest, boldest, or most out-  
landish firings, but sometimes it might be the smallest firing that  
has the most impact, such as being fired as the merchandise wran-  
gler of your kid’s Little League team. Perhaps being fired from  
that volunteer gig says more about your character and your emo-  
tional state than anything before.  
Backstory can be dropped in or woven through—you don’t  
need to start with it. Downloading all the backstory at the very  
top is exhausting and usually a bit boring. However, your audi-  
ence also doesn’t want to feel lost in a story out of the gate. They  
want in! Providing some backstory is an invitation. It lays the  
groundwork, giving listeners the context they need to interpret  
and understand the events with you.  
Decide how best to parcel out what the listener needs to know  
and when. Sometimes you might share the backstory before a  
crucial moment to allow your audience to fully savor that moment  
when they get there. Other times, you might start with a scene, 104 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
and then back up and reveal some important context from before  
this moment. It’s like saying, “When someone cut off my great-  
grandmother in the church parking lot, I was worried. I should  
back up and tell you that in 1944, she was arrested for uttering  
profane language in a public place and was released under a  
thirty-five-dollar bond.”  
Early in Vin Shambry’s story “Outdoor School,” he lets us  
know that he, his mom, and his little sister were struggling and  
had to live under a giant tree, and that he considered himself the  
man of the family. Then he introduces the exciting week that all  
sixth graders in Portland look forward to throughout elementary  
school\: a week in the woods, living in cabins, with teachers and  
instructors. Because we already know Vin’s living situation, we  
really get to enjoy him describing his bunk, the meals, the joy of  
just being a kid. He doesn’t need to give a ton of detail about the  
contrast . . . we get it.  
I only had two pairs of pants and two pairs of underwear, and no quarters  
for the laundromat. Matter of fact, I don’t even know if they had a  
laundromat. So I went to the counselor and I asked him. He told me that  
they would wash and dry my clothes for me, and I didn’t have to worry  
about it, and it was okay to run and jump in the river. Lfelt taken care of.  
At Outdoor School, I didn’t have a care in the world.  
We appreciate Vin’s carefree camp experience so much more  
because we know his backstory. And because he shared the close-  
ness of his family at the top, we also understand his ending, that  
though he loved Outdoor School, he was also haunted by worry  
about how his family was coping.  
Each story will be different! Decide how best to arrange the  
details for your story—and if all else fails, always err on the side  
of keeping your listener in the know! THE MATERIALS 105  
GETTING TO KNOW YOU\: What if you had just one short “great-  
est hits” story in your back pocket on a date? Something to lighten the  
mood and show your sense of humor or your adventurous side? We’ re not  
suggesting you over-rehearse before meeting your could-be soulmate,  
but to calm your jitters, you could think of a story or two. Small decisions  
that atthe time felt monumental may make good stories for a date. Think  
about the choices you made when you were growing into the person you  
are now. What about the time you switched your lunch table to sit with  
the chess club—or got busted copying CliffsNotes word for word? Did  
you tell a dad joke at your neighbor’s funeral but found the family loved it  
because they just needed a laugh? How about that one time you tried  
hitchhiking? Or the story of your dog Foxy’s adoption? Did you just drive  
from Taos back to Baltimore straight through the night and only make it  
through by blaring 90s pop hits on repeat? A very short story will give a  
new romantic prospect \(or new friend!\) a glimpse of who you are. Stories  
invite conversation. They encourage your “plus-one” to ask questions  
and share stories of their own.  
UP AND OVER  
At this point, like a roller coaster ride, you have your audience  
traveling up, up, up with all the tension you've built. You have the  
scenes and the backstory. The temperature is rising. The action is  
rising. But where is it all leading? The last and perhaps most  
important piece you'll need is the apex of your story\: the “main  
event”! Your entire story is built for this moment. It’s why we’re  
all on the edge of our seats. 106 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
WE NEED ARESOLUTION  
In the main event of your story, you come face-to-face with the  
dragon. This scene is the energy shift; it’s where the story turns  
the final corner and your resolution is apparent. Something is  
achieved, insight is gained, and you metaphorically win or lose  
what you set out for at the start. We now understand how the you  
at the end of your story is quite different from the you we met at  
the beginning.  
In David Montgomery’s “Spicy,” David’s shattered confidence  
builds and builds, until he finally gets to meet Victoria “Posh  
Spice” Beckham, famously the most aloof Spice Girl.  
Before I know it, I am thrust into brightness, now three feet away from  
my idol, and she squeals, “Oh my God, it’s you!” She seemed genuinely  
excited to see me. At these events, she sits at a little table, and she does not  
stand up for anyone or anything. If you want to get a picture, you have to  
lean across the table, and they take a Polaroid from the side, real personal-  
like. She asked how many shows I was actually seeing and did not believe  
me until I pulled out the evidence of the twenty-two ticket stubs. She got  
up out of her seat, grabbed me by the hands, pulled me to the red carpet,  
and said, “You are fabulous. We’ve got to get some pictures.” Mind\:  
blown. And it started to click. You know what, David? You’re not better  
off dead. You might even be special outside of Spice World, too.  
Consider how you will illustrate what changed for you. How  
will you land your arc? Do you get what you want in the end?  
Or are you—our fearless hero—back to square one and ready to  
start again?  
At the end of “Guilty,” Danusia Trevino is lovingly con-  
fronted by her fellow jurors.  
Each one of those eleven people talked to me. They didn’t say that I was  
wrong. They said they understood where I was coming from, but they didn’t  
think that the prosecution made their case beyond a reasonable doubt. And THE MATERIALS 107  
when I was still not convinced, they sent that older gentleman juror to talk  
to me. And he sat across from me and very gently said, “Maybe one day  
someone that you love very much will be in this situation where it will look  
like they committed a crime, but they are innocent, and this law that states  
that a person is innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt will  
save them. It’s not a perfect law, but it’s the law we were asked to follow in  
this court today. So please consider that.” And I couldn’t believe how much  
thought they all put into this. So I changed my vote.  
Danusia goes into the story thinking jury duty is pointless and  
rigged. Her entire mindset is changed by the morality of her  
fellow jurors, the people she previously thought of as “square” and  
small-minded. She leaves with new respect for the system and  
especially her fellow jurors.  
In Dr. George Lombardi’s “Mission to India,” the resolution  
happens in a strange and rather reverential moment while oper-  
ating on Mother Teresa.  
I said, “Let’s get that pacemaker out.” And they looked at me and said,  
“You want it out, you have to take it out.” I said, “I’ve never done that  
before.” I got a charge nurse and a basic tray, and I prepared the patient.  
The pacemaker box came out readily, but the wire, the wire that had been  
sitting in her right ventricle for several months, was tethered into place, and  
it would not budge. I twisted and turned and did all kinds of little body  
English. This thing was stuck. I started to sweat. My glasses fogged over.  
There had been stories that if you pull hard enough you can put a hole in  
the ventricle, and she could bleed into her chest and die within a matter of  
minutes. So in the most surreal moment, I said a prayer to Mother Teresa,  
for Mother Teresa, and the catheter came loose! I took it out. I cultured  
the tip, and I proved that this pacemaker was the cause of her infection.  
She got better. Her fever broke. She woke up. A couple of days later, she  
was sitting in a chair, eating.  
The tension that Dr. Lombardi creates as he describes per-  
forming the procedure on Mother Teresa’s heart pulls us into the 108 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
stakes of this crucial moment. With the wire removed, he runs  
the final test, which confirms his initial diagnosis. Our relief  
breaks along with Mother Teresa’s fever, bringing us to a natural  
resolution. And note\: This peak usually comes toward the end of  
your story, but it doesn’t have to. Where and how you order these  
narrative stepping stones is entirely upto you.  
AND-FHEN+ REALIZED\: \(YES. IT’S CROSSED OUT ON PURPOSE.\)  
By following the arc to the conclusion, we do not mean you  
should say, “And then I realized . . .” Please avoid this phrase at  
all costs. Often, people will cue the change in the story by saying  
“And then I realized” or “In that moment.” As clean and neat as  
it would be for us as storytellers, very often the big moments of  
our lives don’t immediately change us. Sometimes they’re the  
catalyst for change, the first domino in a beautiful cascade. We  
may realize the magnitude of an experience only in hindsight.  
The truth is, you most probably did not fealize it then. It would  
take years of meditation, the death of a toxic cousin, and a divorce  
for you to actually realize what happened. Having your bike stolen  
was a story-worthy start, but you cheapen your story by shoe-  
horning enlightenment into a moment that’s not there. Think  
about language you can use that is efficient and true. “It would  
take me years of therapy and two more broken hearts before . . .”  
“Sometimes I wonder if that was the beginning of the end. . .”  
It’s more truthful and possibly even more fun!  
And a magic trick\: You can just lift out “and then I realized”  
or “in that moment,” and the story will still work as is!  
When the doctor said I needed a kidney transplant, my boyfriend imme-  
diately volunteered. t-asn-thistmoment-Heatized he loved me. He  
loved me so much he was willing to put himself in harm’s way.  
As we summited the mountain, I could see for miles. I wasn’t afraid. Ant  
suddenty Heatized I had let go of my fears one by one as I made the climb, THE MATERIALS 109  
Or you can try giving the transformation more real estate in  
the story. Extra details act like a highlighter. Dress the moment  
up a little. Let it wear mascara or a bow tie.  
I was nervous, but I let him know I was moving out.  
Versus\:  
I agonized about letting him know I was moving out. Each weekend I  
was sneaking a box of my most precious belongings into a storage space. I  
was only able to find the courage to tell him after I had put the down  
payment on the moving truck and the date was set. I felt like he might be  
able to talk me out of it if the plan wasn’t solid and already in motion.  
It’s the same moment, just fully dressed. It directs the listener\:  
Look here!  
Sometimes the change in the story may not feel true to you in  
the present day. “That was a long time ago. I’ve changed. So much  
has happened since! My waking hours are no longer consumed  
with a burning desire to finally beat smug Yolanda at tennis.” You  
may have long ago moved on \(we hope so\) and not even know  
Yolanda anymore. But there could still be a great story there!  
Place yourself back in that time, and maybe perspective will  
reveal the real reasons why it was so important to you then.  
You may have processed and grown, but the passion you once felt  
for the game and for vanquishing Yolanda can live on. \(Take  
that, Yolanda!\)  
It’s fine to end the story anchored in how you felt at a particular  
moment in time. We go through many changes in life. Where  
one story ends, another begins.  
You, right now, are all of the stories that came before you. 110 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
PERSONAL STORIES FOR COLLEGE AND GRANT  
APPLICATIONS\: Kendi Ntwiga, a Moth Global Community Program  
graduate and instructor, told a Moth story of being picked on by the local  
schoolchildren, but working day and nightto score the top marks that  
eventually make her the hero of her Kenyan village. She uses this story as  
the basis for every grant application she writes for her organization,  
which encourages young women entering STEM fields. The story helps  
potential new funders understand her drive and commitmentto the next  
generation. She says, “Given the high number of applicants these days,  
going in with a personal story from the beginning helps you stand out and  
get shortlisted.” Aisha Rodriguez, Diavian Walters, and countless other  
graduates of Moth high school workshops used their Moth stories for  
their college essays to showcase their character and how they see the  
world. The stakes are high in all applications, so show your potential new  
school what was once on the line for you in another area of your life, and  
how you came out on the other side! \> THE MATERIALS 111  
DIRECTOR’S NOTES  
Identify the important information you need to build the arc of your  
story. Create a bulleted list of these narrative stepping stones. Which  
will become scenes, and which will be summaries or moments of  
reflection? What is your whole story building to? How will it resolve?  
Remember, you do not have to plot every literal step—jump cuts are  
allowed!  
Once you determine which of your narrative stepping stones could be  
potential scenes, decide how you will bring them to life cinematically.  
Recount them so we can see and experience them with you. Some  
stories might have many small scenes, others might have only two or  
three, but remember there is usually one pivotal scene that your story  
builds toward.  
Make sure to stay in the action and describe the scene from the inside.  
Allow the listener to experience your story by taking them through the  
events, the way they unfolded for you. Avoid telling from hindsight.  
What are the details that will make your scenes \(and your overall story\)  
memorable and uniquely yours? Draw from all your senses. Choose  
specific details to highlight important moments, create emotion, and  
build tension in your story, but don’t go overboard with distracting or  
overly specific details that might risk confusing your listener. When in  
doubt, revisit your one sentence and determine if the detail supports  
the overall arc of your story.  
Is there important backstory you need to drop in or weave through in  
order for your listener to understand the context of the story?  
How will you land your arc? How will you illustrate what changed for  
you? Can you show us how you are different now than you were at the  
start of your story? b

MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION  
If you don’t feel it, the audience won't feel it.  
—JENIFER HIXSON  
We are emotional beings. We feel nostalgic about people and  
places, sentimental about childhood. We cry at weddings and  
revel in surprise. We love passionately and mourn deeply. Beyond  
eloquent and invisible construction of the story, emotion is the glue  
that connects storytellers and listeners.  
Emotions are our common denominator. Listening to a story  
that is absent of emotion is like hearing an instruction manual  
read out loud.  
Your story explores universal feelings, but it will be toldin a  
way that is unique to you. The listener will recognize your will-  
ingness to be vulnerable.  
MARINA KLUTSE, MOTH DIRECTOR OF FINANCE\: No two journeys are  
alike. Our stories are unique, complex, and nuanced, but we can  
often find pieces of ourselves in the reflection of others.  
Shades of emotion color everything. Consider a simple sentence\: 114 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
“T wanted him to come over.” Now contemplate that sentence in the  
context of how you could have been feeling at the time\: grumpy,  
pessimistic, skeptical, tormented, ashamed, elated, invigorated,  
focused, prepared, delighted, anxious, stunned, livid, burned out,  
bummed out, confident, crushed, motivated, cherished . . . on  
and on. All our favorite stories bring the listener along to experi-  
ence a range of emotion.  
ALFONSO LACAYO, MOTH STORYTELLER\: | was part of one of the  
first-ever Moth high school StorySLAMs. Hearing some of the  
stuff my peers had been through gave me a different outlook on  
things. You never know what others might be going through,  
how they could be in pain and how they have grown from  
those times.  
By deepening the emotion, you allow people to experience  
your story. They may quietly empathize, or they might have  
a physical reaction to what they are hearing—they might get  
a chill, tear up, or laugh out loud. By sharing what you felt in  
the past, you are creating a connection with the listener in  
the present.  
Even a simple description of an emotion can bring a smile to  
your listener’s face.  
About two hours later, my roommate comes home. Joy is a concept that’s  
very hard to pin down, but you know it when you see it, and I saw joy in  
the eyes of my roommate. The dude is clearly excited about something.  
—Ashok Ramasubramanian, “Joy”  
Stakes aren’t possible without emotions. What’s in jeopardy is  
tethered to your frame of mind\: embarrassed, elated, fearful.  
Make us feel what you were feeling.  
Frimet Goldberger, in her story “My Knight in Shining MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 115  
Sidecurls,” gave this detail when talking about her first-ever trip  
to a water park in Florida, where she broke from the traditional  
rules of modesty that her Hasidic upbringing dictated\:  
It was a cloudy and muggy day, and I was wearing a bathing suit for the  
first time. On my head, I wore a chin-length wig with a Yankees sun visor  
securing it. So we make our way through the park, and I am wandering  
on my husband’\: tail, ogling this bevy of bikini-clad shiksas in all their  
tanned glory. I keep my arms on my chest, alternating between that and  
my thighs and knees and elbows, until I realize I am practically in the  
nude, and I just walk around in a self-conscious daze. My discomfort was  
so palpable. It was a constant reminder of the grave sin I was committing.  
I felt like everyone around me could see right through my shame.  
Frimet brings us into the tension by describing how vulnera-  
ble she felt in this moment. With each futile attempt to cover  
herself, we, too, can feel her shame and embarrassment.  
In “Quiet Fire,” Phyllis Bowdwin is assaulted by a street per-  
former and walks away in shock.  
I had just been blindsided, bullied, and blatantly violated by a strange  
man in the street with the approval of hordes of other strangers. And the  
thought that I had no way to protect or defend myself made me feel so  
powerless that I wanted to cry.  
Phyllis lets us in on her emotional state. We are with her in her  
despair, which is what makes the plotting and execution of her  
eventual revenge so deeply satisfying. The delight of the audience  
is palpable, because the mime artist deserved it! The joy at the end  
of the story is earned.  
While few listeners have ever been bullied by a mime artist,  
they know what it feels like to feel frozen in humiliation. They  
may have never delivered a big wallop of righteous revenge, but  
they know how good it feels to see a bully get their due.  
Scenes can help you get in touch with your emotions. As you 116 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
actively remember the moment you're describing, the listener can  
hear the emotion in your words and also your voice.  
When storytellers allow themselves to be vulnerable, to admit  
their flaws and anxieties and showcase their not-so-pretty sides,  
they allow the listeners to see themselves in the story. Take, for  
instance, Martha Ruiz-Perilla’s story “Opposing Forces.” As a  
dental student, Martha is forced to perform a complicated proce-  
dure at gunpoint.  
I was shaking. I had an idea what had to be done. I had seen it in books  
and in enormous slide projections in our oral pathology classes. But I had  
never done anything like this before. It would be really the first time. What  
I did know, though, was that if I made a mistake in my incision, and I  
touched the nerve that runs by that area of the face, I could cause the  
paralysis of half of this kid’s face for life. I also knew that if I let that  
infection progress, this kid could go into sepsis and die. And I also knew  
in the back of my head that if the army had been informed that the rebels  
were in the hospital, they could burst in at any time. There would be a  
cross fire, and I would become collateral damage by the end of  
the morning.  
The emotions in this excerpt also elevate the stakes. You can  
feel the tension and grasp what’s in jeopardy.  
And the man, the commander who had been pointing a gun at me this  
whole time, broke his silence, and he said, “Almost there, mi hijo.” And  
I was petrified. Because it was then that I realized whose child I was  
cradling in my arm. This was the commander's son. I couldn’t screw this  
up. \[had to do this right. I knew that if this kid got worse or if he died,  
this guy would come back for me. I was sure about that.  
It’s one thing to describe how something looked or sounded,  
but when you punctuate with emotion, you bring us into how  
you were actually feeling in the moment. If you don’t, the listener  
might misinterpret the truth of your experience. Consider MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 117  
the sentence “I signed the divorce papers.” Perhaps you were  
delighted\: free at last! But if you don’t share your emotions, the  
listener may presume you were devastated.  
A study by a team of scientists in Denmark looked at how  
listening to stories, especially emotional parts ofa story, can trig-  
ger emotional and physical responses in the listener. Their results,  
published in the October 2011 issue of Neuroimage, found that  
listeners’ heart rates might increase; they might have facial reac-  
tions, raised eyebrows, or increased blinking of their eyes; their  
palms might even get sweaty. All of these are signs that the listener  
engages with the emotion in a story.  
SARAH ON DATING\: On a first date, a man and | were talking  
about what we did for work, and he told me that as a boy, he dreamed of  
becoming a firefighter. As he grew older, everyone told him not to do it,  
so he went to college and became an engineer. His parents were so  
proud! But as the years went on, deep down, he knew he’d made the  
wrong choice. When he quit his engineering job at almost thirty and told  
his family he’d passed the civil service test and was accepted into the fire  
academy, they disapproved. They reminded him of the danger, but he  
knew that being a firefighter was his calling. He told me he put everything  
he had into the grueling training, then graduated and proudly joined the  
FDNY. He said he wouldn't trade it for the world. His parents are his big-  
gest supportersnow—and he’s FDNY for life. Then he asked me on date  
number two. \(And of course | said yes. Come on! | was so moved by this  
story!\) When you’re on a date, tell on yourself a little. Invite people in. A  
short personal story can calm your nerves and help your new potential  
partner to feel closer to you. 118 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
Many of us have been taught that hiding our emotions is a  
survival skill. We’ve been told, “Hold it in, don’t show your cards.  
Don’t signal weakness.” However, in storytelling, bringing the  
full breadth of your feelings to the table is the power move!  
ALISTAIR BANE, MOTH STORYTELLER\: If telling a story makes me feel  
vulnerable, it’s because I’m being real about who I am and what  
I experienced at a certain point in my life. When I am real, that’s  
when the audience will connect with me. IfI hold anything back,  
there will be a distance between myself and the audience. If I’m  
developing a story, and it feels safe and easy to tell, I know I hav-  
en't looked deep enough yet.  
It’s all right to cry, tremble, woot-woot, steam in fury, or sing  
hallelujah while you tella story. Actually, we typically discourage  
singing, but a modest and well-placed hallelujah never hurts  
if you're genuinely a hallelujah-hollering sort of person. \(Not  
recommended for beginners. And only one hallelujah per  
story, please.\)  
HUMOR  
Humor is a tempting and tricky force in storytelling. It can mag-  
nify your emotions or push them away.  
So often people will use humor to protect themselves from  
feeling vulnerable. They will get to an intense moment and throw  
in a joke, and the audience suddenly doesn’t know what to think  
or feel. It can end up creating distance from your listeners rather  
than drawing them in. It might make us laugh, but it might be an  
uncomfortable laugh of confusion. Ask yourself\: Are my jokes  
integral to the story arc? Am I avoiding something here? Am I  
distracting the audience \(and myself\) from a larger truth?  
Over the years, we've been pitched many stories of heartache  
and tragedy. Sometimes the teller will say, “But I wish my story MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 119  
could be funny. I’m afraid of bringing everyone down.”  
We get it! There’s immediate validation in laughter. It’s fun to  
bring joy and make people laugh.  
But you can’t force funny. Shoehorning a joke into a sad story  
doesn’t work.  
Humor shows up in varying degrees in many stories, even if  
they are harrowing or tragic, because life is strange and surpris-  
ing. Humor can live in the details you remember, the observations  
you make, the absurdity of it all.  
We laugh when something is funny, but also when we are  
nervous or stressed. Laughter can erupt out of disbelief, from fury,  
in camaraderie, even through grief. Laughter can release a pres-  
sure valve and make an intolerable situation suddenly bearable.  
Some things are so awful you just have to laugh—did I seriously  
just get a parking ticket while picking out my mother’s coffin?  
\(An informal and unscientific poll of the authors of this book  
determined that all of us can remember hilarious moments from  
the funerals or deathbeds of our most beloved family members.  
Five for five. The facts don’t lie. Even the saddest days have  
moments of levity.\)  
In Sarfraz Manzoor’s “Is Love Wild, Is Love Real?,” he talks  
about his reaction to the realization that his family does not  
approve of his budding romance.  
This is difficult. I’m meeting somebody who I absolutely love, who makes  
me happier than I’ve ever been, but my family are saying, “You've got to  
choose.” So what do I do? So, I do what I always do in situations like this.  
I turn to Bruce Springsteen.  
You may find that an event that is serious and important, even  
stressful to you in the moment, might end up being a hilarious  
romp ofa story once you've gotten a little distance.  
Take Michelle Murphy’s “Do You Know Who You're Buying  
This For?,” a story about falling victim to a scam caller who  
claimed to be running a federal investigation. 120 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
The “federal agent” tells me that with my identity, a car has been stolen  
in Texas, A woman is missing, the car crashed—and the missing woman's  
blood and eight pounds of cocaine were found. I was like, “Holy f\*\*\*!”  
T haven't been to Texas in ten years. My sister lives there, but I would  
never murder her and then get blown out on a baby’s weight of cocaine.  
That’s not my style. I was very upset by this news. I just started crying  
because I was like, “This is really intense. It wasn’t me, man, I didn’t  
do it.”  
Theyre like, “Okay, first thing, you have to do everything we say to  
a T, and you can’t tell anyone, because we're handling this at the federal  
level, we don’t want to involve the state.” First of all, what? Second of all,  
I'd already Slacked eight of my co-workers being like, “I’m under federal  
investigation.” They tell me this, and I’m like, “Okay, okay, from this  
moment forward, I will not break the law. I will keep this secret.” My dad  
even comes downstairs. He’s like, “Who are you talking to?” I’m like,  
“Get out of here, Dad! This is a federal investigation!” I’m taking this  
very seriously.  
In “Good News Versus Bad,” Erin Barker finds humor in  
a story about a disruption in her family when she was twelve  
years old.  
Because my dad and I were so close, I knew what ice cream meant. Every  
time my dad has bad news, he takes us out for ice cream. It’s kind of his  
MO. Don’t ever go to the Cold Stone Creamery with my dad, just don’t  
do it. Unless you want to find out that Grandpa has cancer, or your dog’s  
been put to sleep, or your nanny’s been fired for stealing your mother’s  
jewelry. Just don’t go.  
Not everyone is naturally funny. Maybe you will surprise  
yourself when you accidentally stumble over “the funny” in your  
story. Humor shows up in the details or the emotion ofa reaction.  
It’s almost always authentically, organically baked in. Your stories  
should always follow your natural conversational style and rhythm.  
We've seen attempts at comedy bring the house down—and MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 121  
we've seen them land with a thud. While we can’t teach you to be  
funny, what we can do is help you figure out how \(and if!\) you  
should use humor, and when to avoid it at all costs.  
TOAST DOS\: If you’ve been chosen to give a toast at an event,  
everyone knows that you have aconnection to the subject. Tell us some-  
thing lovely we might not know about them. The details you include can  
bring the subject of the toast alive for your audience, whether you’re  
reminding everyone of the time they sank the basket that clinched the  
playoffs, thanking them for insisting that you swipe right on the bee-  
keeper, or lovingly revealing that, when your sister was three, she spent  
two months insisting she was a cat.  
TOAST DON’TS\: This is not the place to enumerate the subject’s  
shortcomings. Some gentle ribbing may work, and an ancient vendetta  
featuring a botched cheerleading routine might be hilarious. But it cou/d  
also potentially open up a wound that hasn’t quite healed yet. \(Don’t  
mess with cheerleaders. They can bench-press a human!\) If you roast,  
make ita loving roast, not a biting takedown. Sure, one time your brother  
might have ratted you out to your mother for backing into the neighbor’s  
Car, and you were livid that you got grounded and had to drop out of your  
senior year production of Sweeney Todd. Maybe this makes it into your  
best man speech. But for the most part, if you’ve been chosen to give the  
speech, you probably have a whole lot of love for the groom \(even if you  
still want to give him a shave\). You may take a few jabs or share amoment  
where the two of you were at odds, but most of the speech will be a series  
of loving stories.  
WHERE’S THE PUNCH?  
As we’ve probably all experienced in real life, one of the easiest  
ways to get people on your side is to have a sense of humor about 122 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
yourself. It shows the listener that you trust them. It creates  
intimacy.  
TRISHA MITCHELL COBURN, MOTH STORYTELLER\: It was 2012. A  
sold-out show at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas. It was  
my first big Mainstage show, and I was the last storyteller. I was  
really anxious. I even asked the director if\] could go in the begin-  
ning of the lineup so I would not have to wait through the whole  
show. I had an out-of-body experience while I waited for my  
name to be called. When the host introduced me, I stood up and °  
walked toward the stage. There were six steps I had to climb, and  
I tripped on the third one. I reached forward and caught myself  
before I did a faceplant. I heard a loud gasp throughout the audi-  
ence. I stood up, turned around, and faced the audience, and a  
voice inside my head said, Bow. I took a huge bow and the audi-  
torium broke out in applause. They began to hoot and holler. I  
stood on that stage and told my story as if every person in that  
room were my best friend. .  
In “The Bad Haircut,” Alfonso Lacayo speaks to the audience  
like we’re all friends. He gives us a glimpse inside his mind as the  
events in his story unfold.  
My cousin starts cutting my hair. There was no mirror. You know how,  
like, when you go to a barbershop, there’s those giant mirrors? So while  
you're getting your haircut, you can kind of look up and check. I like that.  
That’ nice. There was none of it. So my cousin’s cutting my hair for, like,  
twenty-five, thirty minutes, and all of a sudden he stops, and he’s proud  
of his work. He’s like, “Dang, there you go, I got you, little man.” Gives  
me a high five. And Iget up, I’m like, “Okay, now I’m ready for school.”  
But I knew there was something wrong, ’cause as soon as I stepped  
foot into the house, my other cousin around my age looks at me and starts  
dying, crying, laughing all over the place, hysterically. I like jokes, you  
know. I want to know what's funny, too. So Igo to the bathroom and I  
come face-to-face with the mirror. I couldn’t believe what I saw. My new MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 123  
hairline was really far back, and my forehead was all shiny. I had, like,  
this windshield thing goin’ on. If you look closely enough into my fore-  
head, you can see your own reflection in it. It was crazy. It was just  
glistening.  
Sometimes, your most vulnerable moments, in retrospect,  
have alot of humor. In “Maybe,” Jessica Lee Williamson helps us  
laugh at a previously humiliating experience, singing a song from  
the musical Annie.  
When I was in the third grade, I decided to sing “Maybe” for the school  
talent show. And the moment I stepped up onto the stage, I found myself  
pondering some maybes of my own. Maybe I should have put some  
thought into it before I volunteered to sing alone in front of hundreds of  
people. And maybe I should have bothered to memorize the words to the  
song that I volunteered to sing alone in front of hundreds of people. I had  
seen the movie five or six times over the course of my entire life and  
somehow figured that would be enough. So I only focused on the feelings  
I would have while singing the song. And I only asked the important  
questions like, “Should I wear a curly wig, or will my short, newly permed  
hairdo suffice?” There was an instrumental version of the song playing  
over the PA system. And every time a new verse would kick in, I would  
take a deep breath and brace myself like I was getting ready to sing,  
sending out these tiny ripples of hope that I might just pull it together. But  
I never did, you guys. I just stood there and cried for two and a half  
minutes while the audience watched in a horrified silence.  
This isn’t to say that you should default to making yourself  
the punchline of your story. Owning your flaws or one-  
time mistakes can be a way to create a connection—to paint a  
funny, honest picture of who you are and own the whole you.  
Sometimes it can even feel powerful. In “Modern Family,” Sara  
Barron wonders if she should be more generous with her  
husband’s ex. 124 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
But the worst part of me . . . which is, basically, me . . . really wanted  
her to go away.  
But there is a fine line between playful self-deprecation and  
disparaging yourself with words or ideas that have been used  
against you. Ifa detail has caused yowto be targeted or bullied,  
making light of it as a form of protection can be harmful to you  
and others who have similar experiences.  
In her groundbreaking Netflix special Nanette, Hannah  
Gadsby says, “Do you understand what self-deprecation means  
when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins?  
It’s not humility, it’s humiliation.”  
Your humor should come from honesty and create a bridge  
from your experience to your audience. If you find yourself  
sharing personal details to beat your audience to a joke, or if  
you're sharing details that you actually do not find funny yourself,  
choose a different tactic. Your story should create a connection  
with your audience, and that should never come at your  
own expense.  
SUCH ACHARACTER  
Humor, when used properly, can show your point of view and  
deepen the characters in your story. In his story “Broken Heart,”  
Brian Finkelstein says\:  
Thaven’t had a physical since high school, for like twenty-five, thirty years,  
because my grandmother always said, “Don’t go to a doctor, because  
they’Il find it, and then you die,” which is crazy, except for. . . Grandma  
was ninety-nine years old.  
To show someone’s complexity, you may choose to mix a few  
serious details about the person with something lighter. Take Tig  
Notaro, in “R2 Where Are You2” MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 125  
So when I was little, I made a mess of my room, like any other child my  
age. . . . And when cleaning up my room, I was given an allotted time,  
and \[my stepfather\] Ric would come in, and whatever was out of place, he  
would put in a large trash bag. And then he'd lock it in the trunk of the  
car. Then I had to do chores to earn money to buy my toys back. I know,  
it sounds harsh, because it is. But to be fair, they were priced fairly. I could  
buy an entire Millennium Falcon, windup Evel Knievel, and stuffed  
monkey for, like, a nickel each. Totally reasonable.  
Ric was not cruel, so Tig’s levity puts the listener at ease and  
lets us laugh.  
Or consider how Phil Wang illustrates his mother’s personal-  
ity in his story “A Thpoonful of Thugar” while describing  
the props she created for his primary school’s production of  
Mary Poppins.  
She was charged with the job of designing the front of a newspaper that I  
had to hold in one scene. And the Edwardian headlines she went for were  
“Mrs. Pankhurst\: Clapped in Irons Again” and “Titanic\: Greatest Ship  
Ever Set Sail from Belfast.” Because my mother wants children to know  
two things\: that women are equal to men, and that death is always around  
the corner.  
In Phill Branch’s story “If the Suit Fits,” he overplans for his  
prom by designing a coordinating outfit for his date. While he  
sets the situation itself up as humorous, it is filled with myriad  
teenage emotions. His adult perspective allows room for some  
humor about his younger self.  
For my date, Icomb through all the hottest fashion publications of the time  
to decide what her look would be. I’m in the Sears catalog and Spiegel,  
JCPenney’. I ‘finally decide that she’s going to wear this mermaid dress,  
and it’s going to have some of the material from my suit, because my suit  
was the base. She would have this pink lace overlay at the top, and it  
would be great. I couldn’t actually draw or sew. So I took my scribble to 126 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
my seamstress—my friend’s mother—and said, “Do you think you can  
make this?” She said, “Sure, give me about a week or so, and I can put  
it together once you give me all the fabric and the things you want.” I said,  
“Great.” The plan was in motion.  
Thad no idea that asking my date to accept my design for her senior  
prom dress was going to be problematic, and Dana was not into it at all.  
So she broke up with me.  
To laugh with a storyteller one minute and then feel your heart  
swell with empathy for them the next can be a satisfying ride for  
the listener. Ifyou listen to Phill’s story in audio, you can hear the  
entire audience let out a collective, empathetic “aww” about the  
breakup. He continues\:  
Now, I wasn’t necessarily in the closet at sixteen, because I wasn’t con-  
scious, per se, that I was gay. But apparently, I was so gay that I wasn’t  
aware that designing my date’s prom dress in a white satin with a pink  
shimmer when it hit the light was essentially my coming-out quinceanera.  
For that whole school year where Dana was my girlfriend, it felt great.  
To just be one of the guys and to feel like I had the things that other guys  
had, and I could have this future, and maybe I can get married and have  
this life. It was really powerful, because I hadn’t had that feeling before.  
When she left, it was equally powerful, because it affirmed all the feelings  
that were starting to brew up in me that I was indeed broken, and I was  
hurting. But Ihad about fifty yards of satin, and somebody had to wear it.  
KATE ON DISCOVERING NEW PEOPLE AT DINNER\: After  
college, | moved into the attic of a Victorian mansion in Newport, Rhode  
Island, where | bunked with the other actors who were hired to play the —  
Astor family in the year 1891. We studied Victorian life obsessively, and.  
one of our favorite traditions from that era was the “turning of the table.”  
At formal dinners, the seating was very intentional. Couples who arrived MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 127  
together were never placed next to each other. Guests were expected to  
speak only to the people seated next to them, turning to the person on  
their left for one course and the person on their right for the next, back  
and forth until dessert. By the end of a long meal, the hope was that every  
guest had started two new friendships \(or maybe something more!\). It  
made for exciting evenings. Take a note from Lady Astor at your next  
dinner party. Save the chatting with your room mate forthe Lyft ride home  
and seek out newstories from a stranger.  
SMILE THOUGH YOUR HEART IS ACHING  
There’s a reason those iconic drama masks show both sides\: com-  
edy and tragedy. Laughter is joyous, but it can also break the  
tension of an emotional or harrowing moment. Say you've just  
worked up the courage to tell your children that your cancer has  
returned and the audience is filled with dread thinking about  
your children being heartbroken. Just as you're about to tell them,  
a neighborhood dog begins howling at the moon, which inspires  
other neighborhood dogs to howl too, until there is a crazy  
chorus of many dogs, and it won't stop for three full minutes and  
all of you can’t stop laughing. That’s a moment of joy in a scene  
of tragedy. It makes the tragedy more bearable, complicated,  
and beautiful.  
DANIEL TURPIN, MOTH STORYTELLER\: Humor is a psychological life  
raft. Reasoning and rationale only get us so far. You can wrap  
your mind around actions, or forgive them, or reason them into  
submission. But I’m not sure you can recover from tragedy with-  
out humor.  
Sometimes both the teller and the audience need a respite from  
the pain or suspense, and humor acts as a release valve. These  
moments can’t be conjured. We'd never advise a teller, “During 128 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
that harrowing chase scene, how about throwing in a joke about  
pretzels?” Never. But very often, in conversation with a teller  
about an intense story, they’ll share an unexpected detail that will  
make us laugh.  
In “The Good and the Bad,” Daniel Turpin describes the  
aftermath of a frightening altercation with a burglar.  
I grab the phone, and I dial 911. And I go to the doorway, and I have  
this surreal moment where I’m watching this man run across my yard, this  
man that threatened my life and hurt my mother. And I think I can catch  
him. I’m faster than he is. But I know he has a gun, so I tell the police, I  
describe what he looks like, what he’s wearing, and describe the car he gets  
into hidden behind the trees. But as I watch him drive away, I make  
another decision. I go after him. And I jump in my truck, and I tear out  
of my driveway, and I’m still talking to the police. But then the phone goes  
dead . . . because it’s the landline.  
By including the silly unexpected detail of what happened in  
the moment, he allows us to feel the relief of laughter after the  
stress of the situation. The humor is intrinsic to the story—it’s  
truly what happened, and looking back at it, it’s just funny.  
Including this detail also lets us know that despite this intense  
experience, he and his mother are most likely going to be okay.  
A moment to laugh together is like a gift to the listener; it  
bonds you with the audience. It can be a way of taking care of  
them and giving them a brief moment of relief in the middle of  
an emotional scene.  
In “The Alpha Wolf,” Elizabeth Gilbert gathers at the death-  
bed of her partner, Rayya, with Rayya’s two ex-wives.  
We came into the bedroom, and Gigi put on sacred music, and Stacey lit  
a candle, and then the three of us got on the bed, and we wrapped our  
bodies around her body, and we took turns telling her all the last things  
that she needed to know if she could still hear us. That we loved her, that  
she was incredible, what a grand, stellar life that she had lived, that we MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 129  
would never be the same for having loved her and been loved by her, that  
she had forged our hearts in the furnace of her power, that we would always  
iove her, and that we would never stop telling the world her name. And  
then it was like this silence descended, and this portal opened from some  
distant, uncharted part of the universe, and this river of the infinite entered  
into that space, and we could feel it, that it was taking her very gently from  
us. And that’s when Rayya opened her eyes and said, “What the f\*\*\*  
are you guys doing?” And we're like, “Nothing. Nothing.” She’s like,  
“What’s going on?” I’m like, “Definitely not a bedside death watch, no.”  
We're wiping sheets of tears from our eyes. She goes, “Babe, why are  
Stacey and Gigi in our bed?” I’m like, ““They’re not, they’re just . . .  
dropping off some mail.”  
Elizabeth pulls us into this moment in such a deep way that we  
are almost holding our breath with her. When Rayya busts out  
with her line, it gives us \(and Elizabeth\) a little break, allowing us  
to catch our breath before the final scene of Rayya’s inevitable  
death. Without this, it would be hard to stay in such an intense  
space for an extended period of time.  
FISHING FOR PUNCHLINES CAN BE DEADLY  
Humor in storytelling should never feel forced, manipulative, or  
canned. Are you in the moment, or have you constructed the  
moment? The audience can feel the difference.  
If you find yourself adding a detail that is simply a joke, that  
doesn’t give us an insight into characters or location or move the  
story along, you're likely overengineering a moment that the  
story doesn’t need. Even the best comics have to learn this lesson.  
JENIFER ON WORKING WITH COMEDIAN DION FLYNN\: Even seasoned  
storytellers who host for The Moth can be tempted to build in  
too many laughs. Dion Flynn put a bunch of jokes in a story  
involving his work as a Barack Obama impersonator. I suggested  
a few to cut, not because they weren't funny, but because there 130 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
were too many. Some jokes support the story. Others pull people  
out. At one point, Dion steps away from his story line to do a  
demonstration of how he learned to do the Obamia voice. It was  
a hilarious and relevant stop along the way. But if there are too  
many funny asides, you'll either let the air out of your story’s tires  
or cause your audience to lose the path. During our live rehearsal  
for the show, Dion decided to try a joke that I suggested he cut.  
Crickets. To his credit, right after the joke, he said, “Well, that  
joke didn’t hit. I’m gonna cut that one!” \(Which got a laugh.\)  
Seems improbable, but sometimes a story with fewer jokes ends  
up being funnier.  
Comedians have a love/hate relationship with The Moth,  
because this form challenges them. Professionally funny people  
are used to measuring their success by the number of laughs they  
get. It’s hard to convince them that their stories would improve if  
they could let go of some of their jokes.  
Years ago, in a rehearsal for a Mainstage that happened to  
include comics and writers, almost all of the director’s notes for  
the storytellers were about jokes they should cut. The comedians  
were putting the emphasis on the jokes first and the plot of the  
story second.  
MIKE BIRBIGLIA, MOTH HOST AND STORYTELLER\: We kill jokes and  
we leave them on the cutting-room floor, even great jokes that  
we love, because it has to be about the story. If the jokes can help  
the story, then it’s like the most incredible marriage, but if they  
can't, it’s a strange relationship.  
For comedians, there is the added hurdle of learning to love  
the quiet in the room. It’s a big adjustment for people who have  
honed their craft by tallying laughs per minute. MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 131  
HASAN MINHAJ, MOTH HOST AND STORYTELLER\: For years and years,  
I was doing stand-up, and it was at The Moth that I learned to  
appreciate the silence. In comedy, you're focusing on a setup and  
punch, but at The Moth, I could start talking about other really  
powerful human emotions\: love, pain, regret, humiliation. You  
can take an audience only as high as you take them low.  
A storytelling audience can be just as engaged silently together  
as they are laughing together. Both are stunningly intimate. When  
you learn to tune in to the feeling in the room during the heavier  
parts of the story, you can intuitively sense it. It’s a charged silence.  
We've come to refer to this as “the sound of the audience  
leaning in.”  
HOW NOT TO BREAK YOUR FUNNY BONE  
Here are some things to be mindful of when thinking about  
humor in your story\:  
DON’T STEP ON THELAUGHS.... When you make jokes, the  
audience will \(hopefully!\) respond. Give them time to  
react. Don’t race through. If you keep plugging along,  
without taking a slight pause for the laughs \(which people  
often do when they’re nervous\), the audience will miss  
what you are saying. If you keep this up, the audience  
members will worry that they’1l miss more of your story  
and will actually laugh less to avoid stepping on your words.  
... EVENTHE UNEXPECTEDLAUGHS ... Laughter from the audi-  
ence can come at any time in your story, and sometimes,  
getting a laugh where you didn’t expect it can be startling.  
Try to savor the surprise, pause for it, and then keep going.  
... BUTALSO DON’T BE THROWN IF THELAUGHS DON’T COME. The  
line you think is funny might not get a laugh. We’ve seen  
storytellers who are telling a repeat story fumble because  
they get to a certain line orjoke and expect a response. And  
oh, the agony as they pause and wait for a laugh that never 132 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
comes! Different audiences react to different things, and if  
you don’t get laughter where you're expecting it, never  
fear—maybe they’re hanging on your every word and can't  
wait to see how it ends. Just stay on track with the next beat  
of your story. Better to be in the moment every time you  
tell it and enjoy the genuine response from that night’s  
crowd. Who knows when and where you'll get a reaction?  
These stories are alive and a little bit different every time  
you tell them.  
TOASTS, WHEN THE ROOM IS ABUZZ—OR JUST BUZZED\:  
Given that toasts are usually given at events like weddings and  
celebration-of-life parties, the crowd may have had a few drinks. There  
are also other distractions, like food and noisy silverware, side conversa-  
tions, a photo booth with props, a clown, a beautiful skyline view of the  
sunset, and so on. Don’ttake it personally! You may gettons of laughs and  
tons of tears, or you may be upstaged by a toddler who has decided at that  
exact moment she hates her tights. No matter what’s going on, the sub-  
ject of your toast is listening. Stay the course and share from the heart.  
What’s most important is that your loved one feels celebrated and seen.  
ARE YOU READY TO TELL YOUR STORY?  
Part of our job as directors is helping people decide if and when  
they are emotionally ready to tell their stories. Sometimes it is  
clear that a story is begging to be told, and that the teller is  
equipped to do the unearthing necessary to bring it to life.  
However, turning people’s real lives into art can be messy, and  
sometimes storytellers are not ready. MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 133  
Beyond the question of being emotionally prepared, the per-  
tinent details for a story can be tough to access because the story  
is still unfolding. It takes time to gain insight into a big life event,  
whether it’s radically changing careers or surviving a tornado.  
Your perspective is too narrow when you're still in the midst of  
processing \(or living!\) the experience. It’s important that you let  
some time pass, especially with a more serious story. We joke that  
it needs to be at least ten years after a death and five after a divorce,  
and we're only half kidding \(though a psychologist once told us it  
may be the reverse, because apparently divorce can be more trau-  
matizing than death!\).  
“DEJA VU, AGAIN”\: CATHERINE ON WORKING WITH COLE KAZDIN\:  
Back in 2006, Cole Kazdin told a story about waking up with  
amnesia after hitting her head in a bad fall. Her story was engag-  
ing, with riveting scenes and intense details, but we struggled to  
figure out how to land her arc. The night of the show, she was  
radiant on stage, and her loyal boyfriend, who had seen her  
through the accident, was beaming at her from the front row. But  
when we listened back to the audio, something felt slightly off.  
We couldn’t put our finger on it. Here is a moment from her  
original ending\:  
Eventually, I did recover. My head recovered. I have a slipped disc  
in my back that is a reminder forever of this accident, but my head  
is back. I have my childhood memories, I have emotions, and I’m  
pretty much back to the same person I was before the accident\: a  
vegetarian writer who dates Adam. I wonder, though\: Is that who  
I am in my core?  
Not long after, she and her boyfriend broke up, and she  
moved to Los Angeles. Eventually Cole and I revisited the story.  
It turned out that at the time of the accident, Cole and her boy-  
friend were actually broken up. When she was hurt, he rushed to  
her side and they got back together. At first things went well, but 134 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
as her amnesia slowly lifted, things between them became strained  
once more. They eventually broke up . . . again . . . for the same  
reasons they’d broken up the first time. Cole actually found this  
liberating, It meant that some fundamental part of her was still  
intact after the accident. This realization became the new ending  
to her story.  
It took about six months for me to recover. My memory just came  
back slowly over time. And I must have been fully healed, because  
a few months after that, Adam and I broke up, again. Only this  
time, I knew it was coming, because we'd done it before. When I  
got myself back, I realized nothing had changed, but this time,  
there was something comforting about that, because it meant I  
finally knew who Iwas, and it meant I could move forward. Even  
without my memory, I was still me.  
During the first version, Cole didn’t realize it, but she was still  
living her story. This new, truer ending thanged the arc and  
transformed her perspective.  
SCARS VS. WOUNDS  
On her public radio show On Being \(which we love and highly  
recommend!\), Moth storyteller Krista Tippett once asked Nadia  
Bolz-Weber, a trailblazing Lutheran minister \(who is also. a Moth  
storyteller\), how she knows a personal anecdote or story is ready  
to go into one of her sermons. Nadia answered that she always  
tries to “preach from her scars and not her wounds.” The first time  
we heard it was a eureka moment for us, and the phrase has  
become part of our vernacular because the same is true in  
storytelling.  
Some stories deal with shocking events and trauma. It’s  
important that the teller has done some healing before they try to  
share the details. Ed Gavagan was a successful carpenter when he MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 135  
was stabbed and left for dead on the street one night in New York  
City. His healing was more than physical; his whole life had been  
disrupted. Many years after the stabbing, in “Whatever Doesn't  
Kill Me,” he said\:  
As I was sitting there, thinking about these feelings of what was happen-  
ing to me, I realized I could never get back to where I was before. That  
guy. That business. That whole life was just gone. I lost it. I had never  
believed that I had lost it. I always thought I was trying to get back to be  
that guy. And as I thought about it, I realized I gotta do something new.  
And it felt liberating.  
The perspective Ed describes can come only after you have  
had the distance you need to process events.  
Ophira Eisenberg’s story “The Accident” opens with a teen-  
ager running a red light, hitting Ophira’s mom’s car and taking  
the life of her best friend, Adrienne, who had been sitting next to  
her. Her story ends years later with the discovery ofa letter.  
So I unlocked one of the drawers, and a letter caught my eye, and it was  
from Adrienne’s dad to my mother. It was written about a week after the  
car accident, just after the funeral. It had never even occurred to me that  
there was a funeral, because the whole time, I was in operations, and there  
was all this attention on me. It was the first time I'd ever thought of that.  
He wrote that he didn’t blame my mom for what happened, that is  
when God wanted to take Adrienne, and his family prayed for us and  
my recovery.  
Td never thought of what my mother went through, because she never  
showed me her pain or vulnerability for one second. I can’t imagine the  
blame she felt, the guilt, the responsibility of taking care of someone else’s  
child, and then it all going horribly wrong. But she showed nothing  
but love.  
I wasn’t really the strong one; my parents were the strong ones, because  
they had carefully led me to this place where I could live like an absolutely  
normal sixteen-year-old kid. And Adrienne was never gonna be sixteen. 136 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
It hit me hard, staring at the handwriting of her mourning father. And for  
the first time, I sat down at that dining room table, and I cried.  
Ophira lived through this experience at eight, gained a deeper  
understanding at sixteen, but told it beautifully in her thirties.  
Sometimes it takes years to process.  
We ask storytellers to go back to a moment, to see it in their  
mind and share the story from inside the memory. Warning\: It can  
be emotionally taxing to revisit traumatizing events or situations.  
One storyteller who had a particularly challenging childhood  
would need to take a long nap after she rehearsed her story, just to  
calm her brain. It can be difficult to relive these intense moments.  
The choice is always yours.  
HOW WILLI KNOW?  
You may be wondering\: Am I ready? We might never get a chance  
to work with you \(though we hope we might!\), but there are  
some “tells” we’ve noticed over the years that may lead you to  
“press pause.”  
When directing upsetting stories, we pay attention to any  
signs that a story is still raw for the teller\: Their drafts are late and  
dates to talk are rescheduled last-minute. In extreme cases, the  
storyteller may get lost in the details of a graphic scene. They are  
caught in the trauma while exploring the story, and when they  
stop talking, they might be disoriented. These signs can indicate  
that they may still be living the story and may not be ready to tell  
it publicly.  
Strong emotions don’t preclude you from being able to tell  
your story; as listeners, we are hungry for that honesty. But an  
audience has to feel that you are still in command, that you'll  
be able to get to the next part and ultimately bring us to a satisfy-  
ing conclusion.  
If you are halfway through crafting your story and find your-  
self overwhelmed with feelings about the events, put the draft MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 137  
away and come back to it in a week. Two weeks. Three weeks.  
Three months. Does it feel any different?  
If your heart rate quickens or you have tears in your eyes in this  
one part, that’s okay! That means you are in the story. Let us see  
and feel that emotion! But if you’re still feeling overwhelmed and  
worried that you'll start crying and won't be able to stop, and your  
stomach is in knots, that’s your body saying no. And remember,  
it’s probably not a “No, never tell this” but a “No, not yet.”  
You have to control your story; the story can’t control you.  
MEG ONASTORY YEARS IN THE MAKING\: Jeremy Jennings called the  
Moth Pitchline and told us about how after being stationed in San  
Francisco guarding the Golden Gate Bridge, he had been  
deployed to be a guard at Guantanamo. He was not military  
police, nor had he been trained in how to work with detainees,  
and he described how traumatizing and confusing he found the  
experience. He was conflicted about his duty to serve and the  
conditions and treatment of the detainees he had witnessed. We  
talked at length, and I sent him notes on how he might approach  
telling his story—and then I didn’t hear from him for quite a few  
months. His story stayed with me, but it was clear to me that he  
just wasn’t ready.  
Six months later I reached out to ask how he was doing. He  
apologized for his silence, and I told him I understood that he  
wasn’t ready, and it was okay. He wanted to try again. So after a  
few phone calls and emails we managed to pull together a first  
draft and got his story into a pretty solid structure. But he still  
wasn’t ready to actually tell it. The idea of standing up and sharing  
it with someone other than me was just too much. So we pressed  
pause again.  
JEREMY JENNINGS\: I’m not sure why I called the Pitchline. I imag-  
ined enjoying the same catharsis that the storytellers on the radio  
seemed to achieve, and I wanted some of that. The first telling of  
the story on the Pitchline felt more like a confession of crimes, 138 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
guilt, and sorrow for what I saw and did in Guantanamo. I didn’t  
think anyone would call me back. I don’t think I ever intended to  
actually tell the story on stage, and when someone did call, it was  
a bit frightening. It wasn’t just that the story was emotionally  
distressing. I was also deliberately violating the secrecy that the  
government had imposed upon everything that happened to the  
people inside that prison. Moving the voice in my head into the  
telephone was one step, but telling this story to the public was a  
more risky step in many ways. I might come across as an apologist  
for war crimes, as a terrorist sympathizer, or as trying to make  
myself look less complicit than I was. I worried that few  
Americans would sympathize or understand. Paranoia set in, and  
I even imagined former detainees or al Qaeda or my own gov-  
ernment hearing my story and coming after me or my family.  
It would be over two years before I found myself flying to  
NYC for rehearsals. In the intervening time, I had finished a  
second bachelor’s degree, ended a marriage, and started graduate  
school. I felt more confident about my identity as a veteran and  
my values. I was still worried about unintended consequences but  
resolved to tell my story anyway.  
MEG\: When Jeremy arrived at rehearsal, he was worried about  
whether he could make it through the story. Between his nerves  
and emotions, he had a hard time getting the first few lines out,  
but he persevered. After rehearsal, you could see the relief on his  
face and a newfound confidence in his body language. When he  
finally stood on that stage and he shared the experience, you  
could see a change come over him. He said he felt empow-  
ered—so much so that he reprised it for an audience of three  
thousand a few months later.  
If all the pieces of your story are white-hot and charged, you  
need to take a step back. It is not a show of bravery to tell a story  
before you are ready. It is actually, actively, a disservice to yourself  
and your lived experience. MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 139  
Some people may never feel like enough time has passed —and  
that’s fine. That’s honest.  
JENIFER ON WORKING ON A VIETNAM WAR-THEMED SHOW\: In 2016,  
I co-directed a show that was based on stories that explored the  
Vietnam War. I found an article about a Vietnam veteran in New  
Jersey named Glenn and invited him to participate. He was an  
extraordinarily brave man, both in action and in spirit. He’d  
received two Purple Hearts. In his writing, he fearlessly con-  
fronted what he’d witnessed and done in the war and how he felt  
about it. He wrote back to tell me he was honored to be invited  
but after thinking about it for a long while, he decided it was best  
ifhe didn’t. Writing had helped him process many of his feelings,  
but telling the stories to an audience would be too much. He said  
his battle with PTSD was daily and while his physical scars had  
healed, the emotional ones had not.  
And right there, Glenn put into practice the maxim “Tell  
stories from the scars, not the wounds.” The night of the show, he  
wrote to wish us well. And when a Moth Radio Hour featuring  
stories from the show aired, he listened and wrote to say that he  
was mesmerized and frozen in place from start to finish.  
While I was sorry that The Moth’s audience didn’t get to hear  
one of Glenn’s powerful stories, I’m so grateful that he made his  
boundaries clear.  
By contrast, sometimes sharing an emotional story with an  
audience can be healing. Constructing the narrative allows the  
teller to create order in their story rather than feel overwhelmed  
by the many emotions and details. For some people suffering with  
PTSD, sharing the story of the traumatic event can help them  
reshape their own narrative, allowing them to find some level of  
control over the story. The storyteller proves to themself that they  
have agency. |  
In fact, veterans’ hospitals and the Association of the United  
States Army are using storytelling as a way to help treat PTSD. 140 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
From AUSA.org\:  
If you are afflicted with PTSD, then telling your story allows the  
brain to make new connections to that memory. You are not only  
attaching words to your experience, but you are attaching the  
feelings and sensory impressions that you felt at the time. And in  
doing so, the stuck part of the brain can finally stand down. It will  
realize that the danger is not happening. It can stop firing as if  
youre in immediate danger.  
However, making these connections is not without its chal-  
lenges. To tell the real story of what happened to you is to relive  
some of the worst moments of your life. Emotions will be dredged  
up in unpredictable ways. You might either feel too much emo-  
tion or none at all. War often desensitizes its warriors, detaching  
them from their feelings. But for this type of treatment to be  
effective, the soldier must connect their emotions about the event  
with what was seen, smelled, tasted or touched at the time... .  
The aim is to make sense of what was likely a chaotic experi-  
ence in which you were helpless. ... But remember that  
alleviating PTSD symptoms does not mean you will forget what  
happened to you. Or forget that you are a different person than  
you were before. Or forget about what happened to those who  
died. It just makes it easier for you to live a life that truly honors  
the memory of your service.  
We have worked with many tellers over the years who have  
suffered PTSD from active military service, surviving a natural  
disaster, or experiencing violence, and we have witnessed first-  
hand how the process of building, shaping, and sharing a story  
can be healing.  
“LIFE AFTER DEATH”\: MEG ON WORKING WITH DAMIEN ECHOLS\:  
Damien spent eighteen years and seventy-eight days on death row  
in Arkansas for a crime he didn’t commit. While I was working  
with Damien, I began to worry that he was suffering from PTSD MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 141  
but hadn't been given the medical help he needed to diagnose it.  
He shared his story with me mere months after his release from  
prison, and at first I thought it was too soon, but he had been  
processing and living with his trauma for eighteen years and felt  
compelled to tell us what he had lived through.  
The film director Peter Jackson, who had helped secure  
Damien’s release by funding a DNA investigation, had loaned  
Damien his apartment in downtown New York City, and I went  
there every day for almost two weeks prior to Damien telling his  
story live on stage. He insisted on practicing every day, and I could  
see how important it was to him. The act of telling it over and  
over was not only preparing him for sharing it in front of an  
audience, but also seemed to be building him up in some way.  
And by the time we got to the night where he would share it in  
New York, he seemed confident—nervous, but confident. I  
spoke to him the next day, and he said something I will never  
forget. He thanked me for working with him and said, “After I  
was finished, I felt lighter somehow, like I had left a piece of the  
trauma on stage that night.” The experience of working with  
Damien was the first time I truly felt how healing and important  
storytelling can be.  
Storytelling can help people process and heal, but PTSD is a  
serious condition, and we encourage you to find an organization  
that is skilled in working with trauma rather than go it alone.  
Fundamentally, it’s up to you to decide if you are ready to tell  
a particular story. Be honest with yourself. You may be ready  
now, in ten years, or you may never be ready—but if and when  
you are ready to share, there will be an audience to listen.  
TELLING STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED  
Longtime Moth host Peter Aguero hosted a show in New  
Bedford, Massachusetts, and after a teller shared a story about 142 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
losing a loved one, Peter reminded the audience how the simple  
act of hearing that story brought their memory to life. He then  
asked the audience of over a thousand people to say the name of  
someone they had lost who meant the world to them. In unison,  
a thousand names were said, and then for a moment everyone in  
the room was silent. We were reminded of our shared human  
experience, and with it came a deep feeling of empathy for each  
person in the room.  
To tell a story about someone who has died is to conjure them  
back to life, if only for a few minutes, and allow hundreds or  
thousands of people to meet them.  
KATE ON TELLING A STORY ABOUT HER LATE MOTHER\: When I told  
my story for the first time, I told it for an audience of 2,700 at the  
Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in Portland. And Id had all these  
thoughts about what it would feel like. But the thing that I didn’t  
realize until I did it was that it was the closest thing to bringing  
her back. Because I felt like when I told it, for those twelve min-  
utes, all of us thought of her at the same time, and how often do  
you get to do that? To be in a room with thousands of strangers  
who, for those moments, are holding your loved one in their  
thoughts right with you.  
But if the story is also about their death, then with every lov-  
ing detail of their life that you include, you also grow closer to  
telling the details of their death. This can feel painful, almost like  
having a piece of them die once again. You might throw in new  
detail after new detail to avoid arriving at that painful moment  
because you can’t bear to let your loved one go.  
If you're not ready to go through this, the story is not ready for  
an audience. MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 143  
ON DEALING WITH EMOTION IN EULOGIES\: You rarely, if ever,  
feel ready to deliver a eulogy. For many people, the thought of breaking  
down into tears while giving a eulogy fills them with dread, but funerals  
and memorials are sad occasions that often take place when the grief is  
still fresh. Focusing on the details can anchor you, but choose them  
carefully. You may not be ready to revisit some moments, but having  
something specific to call back to—an afternoon making a pie together,  
the time you both decided to meet in Penn Station or went skinny dipping  
in Walden Pond at three a.v.—can help you put one word in front of the  
other and bring your audience there with you. The experiences that were  
so special, often more so in hindsight, have another chance to come  
alive. For a few moments, you’re in one intimate space together, one  
colored by grief, but not exclusively.  
It’s okay if you cry through some of it. \(The people who are at the  
remembrance service will most likely also be crying.\) The advice we give  
for eulogies is the same we would offer a storyteller when they reach a  
particularly emotional part of their story. If you start to feel the emotions  
creeping in, pause, take a breath, acknowledge the emotion, and wait  
until it feels manageable. Don’t try to push it back or ignore it, because it  
will only make it more difficult for you to get the words out. If you know  
from rehearsing that you always cry ata certain point, then it’s absolutely  
okay for you to give your listeners a little warning\: “This partis alittle hard  
for me” or “This is where I’m gonna cry.” Acknowledging it gives you the  
power to face it, and by sharing this with your listener, you let them know  
you are okay. Unless they have a heart of stone, no one will judge you for  
feeling, especially when you’re talking about someone you have loved  
and lost. 144 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
“FRANNY’S LAST RIDE”\: CATHERINE ON WORKING WITH MIKE  
DESTEFANO\: In the early aughts, we met the late comedian Mike  
DeStefano when he was cast in our show at the U.S. Comedy  
Arts Festival. Mike’ was a scruffy, no-BS sort of guy who was born  
and raised in the Bronx. He did not suffer fools gladly, and came  
across as a bit gruff. But I’d come to learn that he was quite soft  
on the inside, a deeply generous and empathetic man who had  
seen tough days and, as a result, had a ton of compassion for his  
fellow humans.  
His story was about his wife, Franny, and breaking her out of  
hospice to take her on one last motorcycle ride. Franny had died  
of AIDS, and Mike had never talked about this publicly. We  
decided to invite him to tell his story in New York City first. We  
hoped he’d be less nervous there, in front of strangers, than at the  
festival, where he’d be performing in front ofa lot of people from  
his industry.  
He’d been mesmerizing in rehearsal, but when he got on  
stage, talking about Franny in front of an audience was much  
more intense than he'd anticipated. The reaction of the audience  
to the quirky and free-spirited Franny was palpable. He started  
throwing things into the story that I’d never even heard! I was in  
the audience, panicking, watching the time run out. At ten min-  
utes, he hadn’t even started the main action sequence. Mike later  
told me that it was joyful to feel an audience fall as deeply in love  
with Franny as he had, and he leaned into that.  
Mike went nearly twenty minutes in that first telling and we  
were worried he wouldn’t be able to pull it off at the festival, but  
he lovingly begged us to give him another chance. A few months  
later, he took the stage again, and in just ten minutes he nailed it.  
Here, Mike has taken Franny out of hospice to show her his  
new bike, and she asks him to take her for a ride in spite of her  
being in a hospital gown with an IV. MAGNIFYING THE EMOTION 145  
And then she just put her arm around my belly and started rub-  
bing, and she said, “Can we go on the highway?” And I thought  
of all that we'd been through and all the suffering. And I said,  
“Yeah, we could do that.” So we got on I-95, And I had it up to  
eighty. And she was just screaming with happiness. Morphine bag  
was flapping over her head. And that wind—I always imagined  
the wind on a bike making you feel free, you know? It’s so pow-  
erful. And for ten minutes we were normal, and that wind just  
blew all the death off of us.  
As we mentioned, getting to the moment of the loved one’s  
death can feel almost like having them die once again. Take com-  
fort in the idea of the three deaths, as celebrated in the Mexican  
tradition of Dia de los Muertos\:  
The first death is the failure of the body.  
The second is the burial of the body.  
The most definitive death is the third death. This occurs when  
no one is left to remember us.  
Through our stories, we are able to keep the people we love  
alive long after they leave us. 146 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
DIRECTOR’S NOTES  
e Punctuate your scenes with emotion. Put yourself back in the moment  
and describe how you felt both physically and emotionally. Your listener  
may not relate to a specific situation, but we all know what it feels like  
to be elated or embarrassed or so nervous your heart races. Emotions  
connect you to your listener and allow them to experience your story  
and feel what you were feeling. Remember, stakes aren’t possible  
without emotion.  
A moment to laugh together is like a gift to the listener. It can be used  
to relieve the tension of a painful or suspenseful moment and can bond  
you with the audience. It can help illustrate your point of view or deepen  
our understanding of characters in your story. But the humor in story-  
telling should never feel forced. Your stories are best told in your  
authentic voice.  
Are you ready to tell this story? You need distance and perspective to  
fully process an experience, or chances are you're still living through  
it. Stories involving trauma or deep upset must be told from a place of  
healing. Strong feelings do not preclude you from sharing a story, but  
if you feel you’re not in command of your emotions, press pause until  
you've had achance to more fully process. It is not a show of bravery to  
tell a story before you’ re ready. CHAPTER 7  
STRUCTURING YOUR STORY  
The end ofa story is like the end of agood meal. We’re sated but it doesn’t  
mean that we'll never be hungry again.  
—KATE TELLERS  
Consider all of the stepping stones you’ve unearthed and could  
possibly use in the story you're crafting. What is the best way to  
order these moments? Have you picked the best scene to start with?  
How will the story unfold from there?  
Your story is like a puzzle that can be put together in a hundred  
ways. We’re looking for the optimal way.  
We could dissolve into a discussion of all the classic literary  
structures you could apply, but there is no one way to effectively  
structure a story. The best structure supports the story you want  
to tell and allows all the parts and elements to flow together seam-  
lessly, without confusing the listener. It should feel organic and  
authentic, never forced or prescriptive.  
When reading, you can revisit a sentence if it didn’t make sense  
the first time. You can linger on it to make sure you understand the  
meaning. But with live storytelling, the listener can’t press rewind,  
so you have to be clear with the scenes and images you paint. 148 HOW TO TELL ASTORY  
If your first memory of meeting someone many years ago is  
a fun scene that gives us a lot of rich background, perhaps you'll  
want to include that as a flashback somewhere in your story.  
Or maybe your story is more of a mystery, and telling it in any  
order other than chronological will spoil the surprise of finding  
out “whodunnit.”  
Structuring your story can be a little like playing with the  
pieces of your puzzle. Don’t be afraid to move things around! A  
story is a living, breathing thing; nothing is permanent. As direc-  
tors, we find that stories often follow one of the structures below.  
Pick the structure that supports the journey you want your audi-  
ence to take.  
ALISTAIR BANE, MOTH STORYTELLER\: When you tell a story, you  
have to take your listener somewhere. You can’t keep driving  
around the block.

CHRONOLOGICAL  
Often the most compelling structure is one that lets a story unfold  
for the audience in the order that it happened.  
Suzi Ronson’s “The Girl from Beckenham” takes us from her  
teen years growing up in London, learning to style hair at the  
Evelyn Paget College of Hair and Beauty, to landing her first job  
at a local salon, where one of her weekly clients, a woman named  
Mrs. Jones, brags about her musician son, David\:  
I didn’t take much notice until one day she mentioned the song “Space  
Oddity,” and I looked at her and I said, “ ‘Space Oddity,’ you know, I’ve  
heard that on the radio. Are we talking about David Bowie?” She said,  
“Yes. ’'m his mum.”  
Suzi tells her story in chronological order, and we experience  
the surprise with her\: We ride with her as she meets David’s wife, STRUCTURING YOUR STORY 149  
Angie; we stand next to heras she meets David to cut his hair; and  
we share her nerves as she experiments with hair color to create  
the now-famous signature red hair of Ziggy Stardust.  
I chopped his hair off, and after I'd finished, his hair wouldn’t stand up.  
It just kind of flopped. And I’m looking at it and I’m kind of panicking,  
and I can see he’s not looking too happy. So I said, “As soon as we tint  
the hair it’s going to change the texture. It’s going to look great. I can  
promise you, it’s going to stand up.” I was praying I was right. I went and  
experimented with color, and I found the color, Red Hot Red, with 30  
volume peroxide to give a bit of a kick. There were no products in those  
days. You didn’t have gels or fixatives. There was nothing to help me  
make it stand up. So used Gard. It was an anti-dandruff treatment that  
I'd used on the old girls at the salon that set hair like stone. The second he  
looked at himself in the mirror, with that short red hair, any doubts he had  
completely disappeared. I mean, Angie and I looked at him in awe. He  
looked fantastic.  
From there, she takes us on tour with Bowie and his entou-  
rage. And she ends by saying\:  
I met so many interesting people throughout that time, you know, and  
heard so much wonderful music. I’m so grateful to David for taking a  
chance on me, and taking me on the road with him. My haircut’s on  
British currency now, the Brixton ten-pound note. Who would have  
thought I could have done that?  
If we knew who Suzi was going to become at the top of the  
story, we d miss out on the thrill of meeting David Bowie and her  
pivotal role in creating that iconic image. By the end, she can  
hardly believe the turn her life has taken, and we can marvel too,  
because we experienced it with her beat by beat.  
Sometimes a story wants to be told step-by-step, especially if  
it’s a little complicated or even a bit of a mystery. For example, if  
you are Terrance Flynn, and your story, “C’est La Vie,” has a big 150 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
reveal, like, spoiler alert, almost dating a serial killer, you wouldn't  
start by saying, “In 1985, I narrowly avoided going home with  
Jeffrey Dahmer. Let me take you back. One night, as a college  
student in Milwaukee. . .”  
Telling it in the order it unfolded might be exactly what builds  
tension and suspense best.  
Bottom line\: Don’t assume you have to get fancy with your  
structure. Sometimes the best way is to simply start at the begin-  
ning and tell it from there!  
TWO CHRONOLOGIES IN TANDEM  
Another structure involves cutting back and forth between two  
stories that unfold simultaneously. Each story has its own tensions  
and conflicts—though they are often connected to each other—  
and they eventually resolve together.  
Comedian Anthony Griffith worked closely with former Moth  
executive and artistic director Lea Thai to structure his story,  
“The Best of Times, the Worst of Times.” It charts three appear-  
ances he made on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, which  
coincided with the illness and eventual death of his two-year-old  
daughter. In the second sentence, Anthony sets up the two threads.  
In 1990, I took my wife and child to L.A. from Chicago to seek my fame  
and fortune. And after a couple of weeks, I got two important phone calls.  
One was from a talent coordinator offering me a chance to do stand-up  
comedy on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, and the second call  
was from my daughter's doctor saying that her cancer had resurfaced.  
Everything we learn about his emotional state is told through  
both stories.  
I thought everything was great, because we had the cancer before and we  
had beat it, so I was sure we'd beat it again. And I was going to be per-  
forming for millions of people on The Tonight Show. STRUCTURING YOUR STORY 151  
He then takes us through the next few months, moving us  
through his first appearance and his daughter’s illness.  
A special moment of that night was running into Johnny Carson in the  
parking lot. And he said, “Hey, you were extremely funny, and I want  
you to start working on your second set, because I want you back.” Now,  
by the time I got the official call for the second Tonight Show, my  
daughter was admitted to the hospital. And I don’t know if you know  
about cancer, but it’s almost like fighting with a gangbanger. You can beat  
it, but if it comes back, it’s coming back with friends, and it’s coming to do  
serious damage.  
As his emotions change and deepen, he keeps us tightly teth-  
ered to the two stories.  
In the evening I would work on my second set, because after all, I’m a  
clown, and that’s my job, to make people laugh. And Iwas a clown whose  
medical bills were rising, who was one step from eviction, whose car was  
one step from being repoed. My comedy is getting biting, and it’s getting  
dark, and it’s getting hateful. And the talent coordinator is worried because  
he’s all about the network, and the network is nice, nice, nice. And we  
started to butt heads, because he wanted nice, and I just wanted to be real,  
because I was hurting and I wanted everybody to hurt.  
Both stories head toward the conclusion side by side.  
While I was preparing for the third appearance, the doctor called me into  
the office, and I knew something was wrong because he was crying,  
and. . . doctors don’t cry. He wouldn’t really look at me. And he said,  
“That’s all we can do.” So I said, “Okay. How much time does she  
have?” And he said, “About six weeks.” ;  
And then he brings both stories to their heartbreaking  
conclusion. 152 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
When I did my third Tonight Show, my daughter had died. I had six  
applause breaks. No one knew I was mourning. No one knew I could care  
less about Johnny Carson or The Tonight Show. In 1990, Ihad three  
appearances on The Tonight Show. I had a total of sixteen applause  
breaks. And I would have given it all up just to share another bag of fries  
with my two-year-old daughter.  
The tandem telling works well because the two story arcs  
show us how Anthony’s attitude and excitement about his work  
shift enormously as his daughter’s illness progresses. The first arc  
is deepened by the second arc. Anthony’s heartbreak over losing  
his child is made worse by the fact that he must provide for his  
family by being funny on stage.  
Part of the story’s power lies in the fact that two contradictory  
things can happen at the same time. Anthony explores what hap-  
pens when your greatest personal success and your greatest  
personal tragedy coincide. Telling them in tandem illustrates the  
complexity in a deeper way. We see how over the course of the  
story he goes from being excited about appearing on The Tonight  
Show to not caring because his grief has blotted out everything  
else in his life. If the focus of this story had been his daughter and  
the brave way she faced sickness, then we might not need his  
comedy career in the background. But the story focuses on how  
humor and anger lived side by side in him, and so neither of the  
story lines fully lands without the other.  
THE FLASHBACK  
Telling your story chronologically is often the most simple and  
straightforward structural choice, but sometimes it’s more effec-  
tive to mix things up. You might consider using a flashback—a  
tool used to temporarily pause the story to give the listener infor-  
mation. Sometimes a flashback is vital and integral to the story,  
but other times it just helps draw the picture. STRUCTURING YOUR STORY 153  
There are many ways to use a flashback.  
THE CLASSIC FLASHBACK  
You might be telling your story chronologically but decide, when  
you reach a compelling moment, to flash back to provide context  
or allow your listener to linger in the excitement. A flashback can  
add energy into a more quiet, cerebral part ofa story, or it can act  
as the brakes in a fast-moving one.  
In “Treasure Island,” Boots Riley is driving across the Bay  
Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco, in the early 1990s,  
with his band \(The Coup\).  
One morning we were driving back across the bridge. Pam the Funkstress,  
The Coup’s DJ, was driving, and I was sitting in the back with some other  
folks that had been in the studio. And we realized we left our keyboard  
player at the studio. And so we needed to turn around, and the only place  
to turn around on the Bay Bridge is Treasure Island. And at this time  
Treasure Island wasn’t full of condos like it is right now. It was a naval  
base. So we got off on Treasure Island, made that turn, and started  
heading back up the hill toward the bridge, when all of a sudden, we hear  
a siren, and it was the military police stopping us.  
The cops stopped us and asked us all for our IDs. There were a bunch  
of us in the car. We all gave them our IDs. They asked Pam for the regis-  
tration, and I said from the back, “The registration’s in the glove  
compartment.” So somebody opens the glove compartment, and a waterfall  
of bullets come down.  
Now let me explain how those bullets got there.  
Boots then hangs in this moment of tension and uses it as a  
place to look back at the historical context of Oakland in the years  
leading up to this scene. Had Boots started by setting up the facts  
of the backstory, it would have made for a less compelling and  
personal beginning. Stopping and recounting how past events  
have influenced the scene he describes elevates the stakes and 154 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
tension. We learn about threats white supremacists were making  
against the Black community at large, including kill lists that  
targeted Boots and his band members.  
White supremacists didn’t like us, and we ended up on one of those lists.  
And it’s not a good feeling to know that there are crazy people looking at  
a list of people that should be killed, and you are one of them. So we  
bought guns.  
We also didn’t want to get messed with by the police. So we did it all  
the way legal. We registered them, we went to the shooting range to make  
sure we knew what we were doing with them, and we transported them  
legally when we needed to transport them.  
That meant carrying it in a lockbox while it was unloaded, in the  
trunk of your car. What I didn’t realize before I told somebody to open the  
glove compartment was that we had recently been to the shooting range,  
and there was a box of bullets that was open, and they came raining down  
like a waterfall.  
And they seemed to be going in slow motion; and I feel like I thought  
the longest Oh sh\*t that I could ever think. And in seeming slow motion,  
the cop pulls out his gun and has it two inches from Pam’s head, and says,  
“Put your hands up! Everybody, put your hands up!”  
At first the bullets are a surprise element that play with  
perception—the listener questions why they're in the glove com-  
partment and makes assumptions—and then Boots gives us the  
backstory and explains the context. Now we know what he  
knows, and when he comes back to that moment and we see that  
cascade of bullets for a second time, we think Oh sh\*t too!  
Using the flashback plays with the listener’s perspective. At the  
beginning the listener may think and feel one way, but after you  
flash back and give context, they think, feel, and understand ina  
new way. The key here is to not take too long to get back to the  
scene you want to rejoin, or you run the risk of people forgetting  
the details you described earlier and not making the connection.  
You want your flashback to flow seamlessly into your story. STRUCTURING YOUR STORY 155  
THE CLIFFHANGER  
While a classic flashback can happen anytime in the story, a cliff  
hanger is exclusively used in the beginning. Opening your story  
with a short scene, ora few lines describing a critical moment, can  
create drama and tension and introduce the stakes right out of the  
gate. You can pause the scene and flash back to explain how you  
got there, leaving your listener hanging \(What happened?!\). Then  
tell the story chronologically until you return to that edge-of-  
the-cliff moment you opened with. The unresolved opening  
keeps everyone invested throughout the story. Again, the trick is  
to make sure that the scenes connect in a way that’s clear to the  
listener.  
In “Home Cooking,” Michael Fischer opens with a scene  
involving a confrontation with his fellow prison inmate.  
JR looks at me and he says, “Do you realize that I could kill you right  
now, stash your body under your bunk . . . and just take the pretzels?  
And nobody would even know?” JR and I are at the end of a hallway and  
around a corner. We're in a blind spot and we both know it, as far from  
the guards as we can get.  
He then goes on to tell the story of his relationship with his  
mother growing up. How he had treated her and how he had  
taken her love for granted, and how much he regretted that now.  
Eventually he works his way back to the opening scene.  
My mom sends me cards, even though I call her on the phone every few  
days, because she thinks it’s good for the officers to see me getting mail. She  
thinks they’ll be nicer to me if they’re reminded that in addition to being  
an inmate, I’m also a human being who has a family. She wants them to  
know, just as she wants me to know, how much I’m loved. So the only  
person who's going to eat these pretzels, while I’m still alive, is me.  
Ican tell JR wants to fight about this. He’s got his head tilted to one  
side; his arms are crossed in front of him. He’s\:just waiting for me to say 156 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
the wrong thing. But my hands are in my pockets. I’m scared, but I try to  
keep my voice steady\: “If that’s really where you're at, that you're gonna  
kill somebody over pretzels, then I don’t know what to tell you, man.  
They're not for sale.” .  
JR stares me down, weighing his options. He stomps off down the  
hallway, empty-handed.  
The scene serves as an introduction to the story, and when  
revisited near the end, it serves as the climax leading to the  
resolution.  
As strange as it sounds, something about hanging on to that bag of pret-  
zels, come what may, makes me feel just a little bit better. Not because I  
like the pretzels all that much anymore; they’re actually too salty for me  
these days. Not because there won't be some other guy threatening me over  
food someday soon, because I’m sure it’s only a matter of time. My mom  
will never even know the standoff with JR happened. But at least it’s a  
moment—one small moment—when I’ve done the right thing. Something  
Ican build on. It’s a time that I protected the love that she’s always shown  
me instead of just throwing it away.  
But storyteller beware\: The technique of opening with a cliff-  
hanger gets a bit overused, and not always successfully. We tend  
to tell stories chronologically, so if you start somewhere other  
than the natural beginning, you want to make sure you maintain  
that conversational tone. Otherwise, it can feel theatrical and  
clumsy rather than organic. It might weigh things down and  
make it feel longer if it takes more time for us to get into the heart  
of the story. If the structure feels awkward or complicated when  
you tell it, then it will probably end up sounding that way to your  
listener as well.  
In an early draft or run-through, a storyteller will often use a  
cliffhanger to set up their story, only to end up chopping it off  
later, and suddenly the story feels lighter by starting at the natural,  
obvious beginning. STRUCTURING YOUR STORY 157  
Note that the order ofa story can take care of your listener. If  
a story explores a tragic event, and the listener can see it coming,  
it causes them to sit in painful anticipation. Sometimes that dis-  
comfort can serve a story, but often it can be distracting. If your  
audience is busy dreading, they aren’t hearing what you are say-  
ing. They are emotionally guarding themselves, and they aren’t  
fully connecting. We’ve found this especially true in stories  
dealing with violence or the loss of a child or loved one. It isn’t a  
hard-and-fast rule, but if your story is causing your listener to feel  
dread, an earlier reveal can help relieve it.  
MULTIPLE FLASHBACKS  
Instead of one flashback as a frame for your story, consider weaving  
shorter flashbacks throughout. Each flashback can give context  
and motivation for what is about to happen in the main story.  
“PULLING BACK THE TURBAN”\: JODI POWELL ON WORKING WITH  
HARJAS SINGH\: We centered the story around a pivotal moment  
for Harjas\: the traditional Sikh turban-tying ceremony. The story  
focuses on his evolving relationship with his turban. We wanted  
to keep the focus on the ceremony and decided to use flashbacks  
to give context and support the arc. We began with Harjas waking  
up on the morning of his thirteenth birthday and then flashed  
back to him being three years old to show his life and routine up  
until this moment.  
This transition from boyhood to a man would be marked by my  
very own turban-tying ceremony. I was nervous because I didn’t  
know what the turban would feel like but was also excited to fol-  
low in the footsteps of my father and grandfather, whom Id seen  
meticulously tie their turbans every morning, like it was a part of  
their bodies. Ever since I was three years old and my hair was long  
enough to be tied into a bun, a jooda, my mom would sit me down  
in front of her, my back toward her, She’d oil my hair, then comb 158 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
it, braid it, and then tie it into a bun. Then she'd cover my jooda  
with a one-foot-by-one-foot square cloth called a patka.  
As he prepares for the ceremony, he illustrates his nervousness  
around donning the turban by flashing back to his memories of  
the first time he wore his patka to school.  
After my grandfather had dropped me off at the bus stop and all  
the parents had left, some kids came up to me, circling around me  
like vultures, trying to touch my patka, asking\: “Is that an egg on  
your head?” “No, dude, that’s a tomato.” “Is that a ball? Can I  
play with it?” “One kid would try and smack my head. I tried to  
fight back, but it didn’t matter. It was the first time it really sunk  
in that someone would try to hurt me for how I looked.  
Flashbacks in live storytelling can be a bit tricky. You rely on  
the audience following you and being able to hold on to the  
different aspects of the story. To help his listeners, Harjas added  
lines that signaled when we were in the present and when we  
were in flashback.  
I sat down in front of the Guru Granth Sahib, kneeling, as my  
grandfather started laying down layer after layer of the turban.  
With each layer that went around my head, I thought back to the  
times when things became really rough\: After 9/11, an anti-  
turban rhetoric took hold of the world, even in my little town  
in India.  
The day of the ceremony was a linear story base, and by weav-  
ing in flashbacks, we were able to hear the advice given by family  
members, learn the history of the tradition, and get a window  
into Harjas’s ever-changing relationship to his turban leading up  
to this moment. This is often how we naturally remember things\:  
We have significant moments, and then we go into the catalog of  
our minds and think, Where did I first see or think like that? Much STRUCTURING YOUR STORY 159  
like the central image here—the process of laying down layer after  
layer of turban—Harjas’s perspective has been shaped by accumu-  
lating layer after layer of experience, each infused with elements  
of the past and the present. In the end, he brings us full circle\:  
I decided to wear it to school for the first time, the same place where  
I had been ridiculed for wearing my patka when I was five. And  
as I stood in front of the mirror and tied it, I questioned again,  
“Why can’t I just blend in?” But this time the answer came  
from within\: Why try to blend in when you were born to  
stand out?  
Used skillfully, a flashback can add energy and build up the  
stakes of a story, introduce important background information,  
or be used as punctuation to give the listener a deeper understand-  
ing. It can act as a reminder that the past and the present live  
together in every moment.  
WHEN DECIDING WHETHER TO USE A FLASHBACK, ASK YOURSELF THESE  
QUESTIONS\:  
1. Does the flashback help the story move forward? Will it  
be more engaging if people sit in suspense for a while? Or  
is it distracting?  
2. Does the flashback add essential details that would oth-  
erwise bog the story down at the top?  
3. Is the flashback short enough that the listener won’t lose  
track? Does the time jumping back and forth disrupt the  
flow of the story?  
THE CALLBACK AS FRAMING  
If you open your story by using a particularly meaningful scene,  
you can call back to it at the end as a way to frame an entire 160 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
story—opening with it and then reflecting back can help illustrate  
how much the journey of the story has changed you and help you  
land your arc. We see this in Abeny Kucha’s “The First Cow.”  
Beginning\:  
When L first arrived in Portland, Maine, I walked off the plane with my  
twelve-year-old brother, and my eight-year-old daughter, and my two little  
boys, four years old and two years old. The woman from social services  
who met us took us directly to this room with a conveyor belt. I had never  
seen anything like it before. We stood there in silence, watching the bags,  
and she asked me, “Do you see your bags?” And I told her I didn’t have  
a bag. Only the plastic bag I was carrying. That’s all we had. And she  
said, “Right. Okay. Well, then, let’s go home.” And that word,  
home—I hadn’t had a home since my village.  
Ending\:  
And now, we made it. My children would never walk two hundred miles  
again. They would never starve again. And they will always be happy,  
even when I’m not around. Once again, I thought about the last few  
years. When my daughter graduated from law school, I was so very proud  
of all my children. Today, I think about that first day in the Portland,  
Maine, airport when the woman said, “Let’s go home.” And home means  
hope to me. Home means I would never, ever run again.  
The callback differs from a cliffhanger in that you are not  
leaving your listener in suspense and then resolving the moment  
later. Instead, the opening scene is the first step in your story.  
When Abeny refers back to the opening scene, we are reminded  
how much she has been through on the long road to finally feel-  
ing like she is home. When she repeats the phrase “Let’s go  
home,” we feel a depth of meaning that we did not feel at the  
beginning. The listener has a new, deeper understanding of that  
very first scene because they have been on the j journey through  
Abeny’s story with her. STRUCTURING YOUR STORY 161  
“MAN AND BEAST”\: CATHERINE ON WORKING WITH ALAN RABINO-  
WITZ\: Alan was a big-cat expert, and his story was about  
convincing the National Assembly of Belize to preserve thou-  
sands of acres of land to protect jaguars. When we started working  
on the story, we began with a scene of him on the floor of the  
assembly, nervously waiting to give his address. Then we flashed  
back to when he was a child, unable to speak because of a .  
debilitating stutter. Young Alan had developed a love for animals  
because, like him, they were unable to speak, and he swore  
that if he ever learned to talk, he’d become a voice for  
animals. From there we worked our way back to the scene in the  
National Assembly.  
But we found that the backstory was so moving that it needed  
a lot of space, and by the time we got back to the National  
Assembly, the listener would have forgotten where the story  
began. Understanding his background gives important context  
to the emotion he felt speaking before the Belize government,  
because he knew that if his voice shook or stuttered due to nerves,  
it would undermine his message. So we decided to lose the flash-  
back structure and tell the story in a linear fashion, starting with  
his childhood, but with a callback of the opening scene at the end.  
Here is the opening\:  
I was five years old, standing in the old Great Cat House at the  
Bronx Zoo, staring into the face of an old female jaguar. I remem-  
ber looking at the bare walls and the bare ceiling, wondering what  
the animal had done to get itself there. I leaned in a little toward  
the cage and started whispering something at the jaguar, but my  
father came over quickly and asked, “What are you doing?” I  
turned to him to try and explain, but my mouth froze, as I knew  
it would. Because everything about my young childhood at that  
time was characterized by the inability to speak.  
This gives listeners a lot of the facts of the story through a  
scene rather than just listing them off. \(That he’s a little boy, he 162 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
has a stutter, but he can talk to animals, adults don’t understand  
him.\) Then we end in a similar scene, one in which the healed  
adult Alan encounters a jaguar in the forest.  
I knew I should feel frightened, but I didn’t. Instinctively I squat-  
ted down, and the jaguar sat. I looked into this jaguar’s eyes, and  
I was so clearly reminded of the little boy looking into the face of  
the sad old jaguar at the Bronx Zoo. But this animal wasn’t sad.  
In this animal’s eyes there was strength and power and sureness of  
purpose. And I also realized as I was looking into his eyes that  
what I was seeing was a reflection of the way I was feeling too.  
That little broken boy and that old broken jaguar were now this.  
Suddenly L felt scared. I stood up and took a step back. The jaguar  
stood up too, turned, and started to walk off into the forest. After  
‘about ten feet, it stopped and turned to look back at me. I looked  
at the jaguar, and I leaned a little toward it, the way I had at the  
Bronx Zoo so many years before, and I whispered to it, “It’s okay  
now, it’s all going to be okay,” and the jaguar turned and was gone.  
By calling back to the earlier jaguar encounter, we are  
reminded how far Alan has come. The two jaguar encounters  
serve as bookends and become symbolic of Alan’s journey. When  
he triumphs, getting the land set aside, we cheer with him,  
because we're also cheering for the little boy Alan. The structure  
served the arc of the story much better than ifhe’d started in the  
present and flashed back.  
WHEN A SMALLER STORY CARRIES THE WEIGHT OF A  
LARGER STORY  
Sometimes a story is so overwhelming that it’s hard to fathom.  
Everyone has had their heart broken by the end of a promising  
relationship—that’s something we can all relate to—but when  
youre telling a story amidst a more harrowing or epic event, it’s STRUCTURING YOUR STORY 163  
challenging for a listener to comprehend and relate.  
If you have any concern that the main event might be hard to  
absorb \(or isn’t particularly relatable\), using a smaller story as a  
frame can help. In Carl Pillitteri’s “Fog of Disbelief,” he puts a  
human face on an unfathomable disaster.  
“FOG OF DISBELIEF”\: MEG ON WORKING WITH CARL PILLITTERI\: In  
2011, Carl was working as a field engineer inside the Reactor  
Unit 1 turbine building at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power  
Station when an earthquake struck. The story of the disaster itself  
is overwhelming and hard for a listener to connect to or imagine.  
The details and the magnitude of what happened feel chaotic.  
We chose to focus on a smaller story Carl shared, about a  
restaurant where he would regularly dine and his relationship to  
the owner who would welcome him. He begins the story by  
describing the restaurant and then reveals where the restaurant is  
located.  
For many years, I have worked along the northeast coast of Japan,  
and when assigned there, I would frequent this one particular restau-  
rant five, six nights a week. Over the years, Icame to grow very fond  
of the older woman who owned and operated it. She didn’t speak  
any English, and I didn’t speak any Japanese, but we shared a  
friendship just the same. Upon arrival, I would always slide open  
her door and take a half step in and look at her, as if to say, “Hey,  
Mom, I’m home,” and she would greet me with this warm and  
welcoming smile, and she was always happy to see me. She knew  
what I was there for, the same thing every time, her amazing pan-  
fried chicken dish. She was a motherly figure to me as well. She was  
always giving me extra things to eat, and just generally a very nice  
woman. I would stop there so often after work just to rest and relax,  
yet I never knew her name or the name of her restaurant. We all  
referred to her fondly as the Chicken Lady. Her restaurant was  
located just south of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear generating  
station, where in 2011 I was working as a field engineer. 164 HOW TO TELL ASTORY  
When he introduces the location, the context is suddenly  
changed.  
Carl then takes us through the story of the terrifying and now  
famous events of that day. Nine months later, when Carl is finally  
allowed to go back to Fukushima and to his apartment, he stops  
by the restaurant first to check in on the owner.  
I returned to the exclusion zone on December 3, and after several  
checkpoints, I was given protective clothing from head to toe again,  
not to go to work, but to enter the community and neighborhood  
where I lived. And I asked my escort to take me to the restaurant  
first, and when I pulled her door open this time, I was tearing  
cobwebs with it, and that was unsettling to me, because it was  
obviously clear that no one had opened that door in nine months.  
And it just made me wonder and worry more about what had  
happened to her.  
This leads him on a search to find the owner. It’s not just him  
who’s hoping she survived; we are hoping she survived.  
That night I reached out to The Japan Times, and asked them  
if they could help me find her. Is she with family, is she going to be  
okay, can I help her? And eventually they did find her, and they  
told me her name. For the first time, I learned her name. And it  
was Owada. Owada is her family name, Mrs. Owada-san. And  
they told me the name of her restaurant was Ikoi, and they told  
me that Ikoi in Japanese means rest, relax, and relief. And I’m  
thinking, what a wonderful name for a little place. I used to stop  
there so often after work to rest and relax. And now I had this  
relief, you know, in knowing that this disaster didn’t take her, that  
she was alive. And then finally, on February 19, 2012, Mrs.  
Owada-san sends me a letter. “I have escaped from the disasters  
and have been doing fine every day. Pillitteri-san, please take care  
of yourself. know your work must be important. I hope you enjoy  
a happy life like you seemed to have when you came to my STRUCTURING YOUR STORY  
165  
restaurant. Although I won't be seeing you, I will always pray for  
the best for you. Arigato gozaimasu.”  
By using the story of Mrs. Owada-san, Carl is able to illustrate  
life before and after the tragic event—how his relationship with  
this woman changed, and how their lives were both changed  
forever. The frame allows the listener to feel a personal connec-  
tion to this historic disaster and Carl’s experience. Mrs.  
Owada-san was also a unique part of Carl’s experience. Others  
telling a story about Fukushima may not have had Mrs. Owada-  
san in their lives.  
Asa storyteller, you should constantly ask yourself\: What was  
unique to my experience? Why am I the only person who can tell  
this story? How can I best deliver my story to an audience who  
may not have lived through the same thing?  
Often when you're telling a story about an event, especially a  
tragic event, it can quickly become a recounting of a series of  
things that happened. The dreaded and then and then and then. By  
finding a smaller detail or story within the larger events—a nar-  
rative thread—you are able to give the story an arc instead.

lf you’re called upon to give a eulogy for someone, try to ground it in  
specific and idiosyncratic details that show us the depth of their charac-  
ter, their kindness, or their spicy side\: “He always saw me move my ball  
on the golf course and never said a word,” “She told people she only  
watched documentaries, but | know she was hooked on The Real  
Housewives.” |t helps give people a sense of the unique space that per-  
son’s\{ife took up in the world. x  
CHOOSING A UNIQUE LENS  
While Carl Pillitteri used a smaller story to help us grasp the -  
depth of his experience, sometimes viewing your story through  
a unique lens, such as a small detail or distinct perspective, is what  
makes it easier for your listener to relate. Not everyone will know  
what it’s like to experience homelessness, but we all know what  
it felt like to be a child. Sharing a story from that perspective  
grounds us in a relatable context.  
“A BRATZ LIFE”\: MOTH DIRECTOR JODI POWELL ON WORKING WITH  
TALAYA MOORE\: Growing up, Talaya lived for a time in NYC  
housing shelters. When we were first discussing her story, she told STRUCTURING YOUR STORY 167  
me about these Bratz dolls that she loved as a nine-year-old. Her  
descriptions of them were so lifelike they dominated the story,  
and she recalled every detail\: the color of their eyes, their boots,  
their assigned characteristics. And that’s when I thought that this  
was not just compelling but also empowering. I realized the story  
could be told through the eyes ofa nine-year-old, with her main  
characters being these larger-than-life dolls.  
My obsession with Bratz began when I was eight years old and I  
was gifted one for my birthday. So, Bratz are dolls, kind of like  
Barbies, but better. They didn’t have these unrealistic dimensions.  
Instead, they stood about ten inches tall with these huge heads,  
full lips, curvy physique, and they had the coolest makeup. And  
also, they had these glittery punk-rock boots that I loved. I knew  
I was hooked, and I wanted more, but I could not ask my mom  
for more, because we were homeless. We had been homeless for over  
a year, and she had bigger worries, like if she had enough money  
for train fares or food, what borough we would end up sleeping in,  
and if I had a clean uniform for school. So I knew that if I wanted  
these dolls, I would have to get them myself.  
Throughout the story, the Bratz dolls give a glimpse into her  
childhood experience navigating the shelter system with her  
mother\: They become a sort of mirror in which we get closer to  
understanding Talaya. We see how her bond deepens especially  
with the doll that is most representative of her, Sasha.  
Sasha was beautiful. She was Black, and I was Black. She was  
gorgeous. She had this long, dark brown hair, and her clothes were  
the best out of all the Bratz. And in the pamphlet that she came  
with, they told me things about her, like how she wanted her own  
urban clothing line, how she wanted to be a music producer, she  
had two parents and her own room. She just seemed like she had  
it all, and I wanted that. I had this carry case where I could keep  
only one Bratz doll, and I always chose to put Sasha in it. Inside 168 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
it was blue velvet and had a spot just for Sasha, and on the other  
side was her wardrobe, where I kept all her clothes neatly stacked.  
It was like her room, and sometimes I would pretend that it was  
my room. And for a second, I felt like the other third-graders in  
my class\: Ihave a room and a closet full of clothes. It was me and  
Sasha’s world.  
One day, when Talaya comes back from school, she discovers  
that her Bratz dolls are missing. She is thrown into a panic and  
immediately grabs her mother’s phone and calls the police. The  
police arrive, but they tell her there is nothing they can do.  
One of the officers bent over and said, “I’m sure they’ ll turn up.  
They’re just dolls.” Just dolls? They were more than just dolls to  
me. They were my family, especially Sasha. She was my role  
model, my ride or die, my best friend. She was the first to know  
about my crush on Adolphus Butts in the third grade and how he  
looked like milk chocolate. She also was there with me that night  
where I slept in my coat and my shoes in this nasty motel, and I  
held her tight the whole night. She was also there when I wanted  
to jump in the bed with my mom but there wasn’t enough space.  
That night, before bed, I was on the top bunk, and I just kept  
looking at the dresser, and it was empty. And L felt empty. I went  
to bed with my pillow wet, and I woke up with my pillow wet.  
And my mom asked me what I wanted for breakfast, but I didn’t  
have an appetite.  
Spoiler alert\: Talaya is eventually reunited with her dolls.  
I was holding Sasha, and I realized that when they were gone,  
that was the first time I actually really felt homeless. And having  
them back, I felt whole again. And that’s when I realized that  
Sasha was . . . she was there for me. These dolls were there for  
me. Everyone has someone or something that may get them  
through the day or even a year, and for me, for nine-year-old me, STRUCTURING YOUR STORY 169  
it was Sasha. It was this Black plastic professional businesswoman  
who doubled as a superstar in my eyes. And she was a constant  
reminder that, in a world filled with uncertainty, there could be a  
happily ever after.  
Rather than tell us about her overarching experiences of  
being without a home, Talaya was able to focus on what it felt like  
as a nine-year-old, and the dolls were the vehicle for this. They  
gave the story a framing that was surprising, original, and  
relatable.  
THE BETTER TO TELL YOU WITH  
Structure can sometimes feel abstract—perhaps because the best  
structures often seem invisible and natural—-so let’s put every-  
thing we’ve discussed to use. Most of us know the story of Little  
Red Riding Hood. Let’s pretend for a moment that this is a true  
story.  
THE ONE SENTENCE OF THE STORY COULD BE\: After a trip through  
the woods to visit her grandmother, Little Red Riding Hood  
learns the importance of listening to her mother.  
THE NARRATIVE STEPPING STONES ARE\:  
Little Red Riding Hood’s mother asks her to take a basket  
of cake and wine to her grandmother who is not feeling  
well, and instructs her not to stray from the path in the  
woods.  
On her way, she meets a wolf. She tells him she is on her  
way to visit her grandmother.  
The wolf suggests she step off the path to pick flowers for  
her grandmother \(thus buying him time to run ahead to  
her grandmother’s house\).  
When Little Red Riding Hood arrives, she sees that the  
door is open and nervously calls out for her grandmother,  
but there is no answer. 17 o HOW TO TELL A STORY  
She goes to her grandmother’s bed and sees her lying there  
looking very strange.  
Little Red Riding Hood questions “Grandma,” thinking  
her enormous eyes, hands, and mouth look strange  
until... finally...  
The wolf eats her up \(brutal!\) and falls asleep.  
Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother are rescued  
when a hunter finds the sleeping wolf and cuts him open.  
And Little Red Riding Hood vows to always listen to  
her mother and never stray from the path in the woods  
ever again!  
The story is told chronologically, but it also could have been  
told\:  
Starting with a cliffhanger of Little Red Riding Hood  
arriving at her grandmother’s house, finding the door open  
and coming face-to-face with the wolf in her grand-  
mother’s bed, then flashing back and telling the story  
chronologically, working back to this moment.  
It could begin with Little Red Riding Hood wandering  
off the path to pick flowers in the forest and then flashing  
back to a scene of her mother asking her to take a basket to  
her grandmother but not to stray from the path.  
It could even be told from a different point of view—e.g.,  
from inside the wolf!  
Choose a shape for your story that will be most compelling  
and least confusing for your audience. Try a few on for size before  
you decide. A thoughtful structure gives you the road map you  
need to be calm and confident in the telling of your story. You  
know the route, you're on your way. STRUCTURING YOUR STORY 171  
DIRECTOR’S NOTES  
How will you order the moments and scenes you've identified? Which  
structure will you choose? Pick the one that feels organic and best  
supports the story. Forcing the story into a complicated structure will  
make it feel overworked and will be harder for you to tell.  
Would it be better to let the story unfold for the listener the way it  
unfolded for you? Would telling it another way spoil the surprise or the  
mystery? If so, then telling it chronologically is probably your best bet!  
Flashbacks can support critical moments and change the listener’s  
perspective within the story. Use a classic flashback to temporarily  
pause a story and add necessary information. Choose a cliffhanger to  
add tension and create drama to give the story a running start. Or use  
multiple flashbacks to give backstory and illustrate motivations.  
Sometimes flashbacks are vital, but other times they simply help you  
draw a picture of a moment. Be careful to ensure your flashbacks  
support your story—you never want to risk confusing your listener!  
Near the end of your story, you can call back to the very first scene to  
create continuity and help you land the arc. \(Sometimes the arc comes  
full circle!\)  
When dealing with traumatic, epic, or historic events, try to find a  
smaller, personal story to use as a frame or narrative thread. This helps  
ground the listener and allows them to relate to a story that might  
otherwise be hard to fathom. CHAPTER 8  
BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS  
Takeoff and landing are considered the most dangerous parts of a flight.  
And so it goes with stories.  
—JENIFER HIXSON  
Entrances and exits are deceptively simple, but they can be the  
parts of your story you have to work the hardest to articulate. We  
can’t stress enough how vital your first and last lines are. They  
define your story’s parameters and are the story version of hello  
and goodbye.  
You most likely wouldn’t choose to meet your partner’s par-  
ents for the first time in a bathrobe. Similarly, you want the  
opening of your story to be presentable, fully clothed, best foot  
forward. Good-memorable. As the saying goes, you have only one  
chance to make a first impression.  
Same with your exit. When you end your story, you need to  
leave the audience feeling resolved, like they understand where  
you've taken them. The central question of the story has been  
answered; a different you has now been revealed. The change is  
evident. There probably won't be a Q and A to tie up any loose  
ends. You want your ending to feel like you mean it. 174 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Over the years, Moth storytellers have handled their entrances  
and exits in some memorable ways.  
Ari Handel, “Don’t Fall in Love  
with Your Monkey”  
Beginning\:  
“Don't fall in love with your monkey,” my adviser warned me, but I didn’t  
listen. There are some things you have to learn for yourself.  
Ending\:  
I wrote a thesis, and the thesis is 364 pages long and is filled with facts  
and data and graphs and theories. But the most significant page for me is  
the first one, which says simply\: “Dedicated to the memory of  
Santiago.”  
With his first sentence, Ari takes us right into the heart of the  
story’s conflict \(his adviser’s warning not to get emotionally  
attached to his lab monkey\). The last sentence ends the story with  
Ari so emotionally invested that he dedicates his doctoral thesis  
to his monkey, Santiago.  
It’s helpful to think of the beginning and the ending as a  
launchpad and landing pad \(or the first and last stone in your path  
of stepping stones\). You unpack the memories, you weigh the  
importance of each one. You contemplate why you revisit and care  
about these memories and you start to understand how they’ve  
changed you, how they’ve made you who you are. Finding the  
very beginning and end can often “crack it”—and make clear to  
you, the teller, the why of the story.  
Dante Jackson, “The Prom”  
Beginning\:  
Back in middle school, I wasn’t really the type of kid to let myself have  
any fun. I was afraid that if I let myself have fun, I would end up being BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS 175  
judged, and I don’t like being judged. So eighth grade rolls around, and  
prom ts coming up... .  
Ending\:  
And I'm busting moves I never thought were possible for me, and I wasn’t  
aware of this until I took the time to look around and I was in that little  
circle they made—and everybody was like, “Ayyy! Go Dante, go  
Dante!” And it turns out that was one of the best nights of my life. My  
life up until that point was like I was locked in a dark room, but I decided  
to unlock the door, and I took a step out, and I learned how to dance.  
As you dig into what the experience means to you, start to  
think specifically about examples, short scenes, or details that are  
reflective of the larger idea you’re exploring. Is there a scene that  
takes us into who and where you were at the beginning of your  
story? And is there one that shows us where you have landed at  
the end? Crafting these scenes can help crystallize exactly what  
this telling of the story 1s about, since many events 1n our lives can  
hold multiple story-worthy elements.  
Lemn Sissay, “Proof of My Existence”  
Beginning\:  
The first thing that I was given when I left the Social Services, was my  
birth certificate. Up until then, for the first seventeen years of my life, I  
thought that my name was Norman. The birth certificate had my mother’s  
name and my name, Lemn Sissay.  
Ending\:  
There was another letter from my mother dated 1968, pleading for me  
back, to a social worker to whom she had me fostered for a short period of  
time. The social worker, his name was Norman. He’d named me after  
himself. 176 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Asin Ari’s story, Lemn’s first and last lines parallel each other.  
He includes very specific details in his opening sentence that set  
up his search for information about his early life. He ends with  
those very same details, only now with the discovery he made  
after fighting for access to his files.  
Having these details come back is satisfying for the audience.  
Specificity is important throughout a story, but relating the end  
of the story to the beginning reminds the listener of where we  
have all, collectively, just come from. The end is set up in the  
beginning and the beginning informs the end. There’s a narra-  
tive balance.  
In Kate Braestrup’s “The House of Mourning,” a chaplain  
well versed in adult tragedy is confronted with whether her prac-  
tices will apply to a five-year-old child.  
Kate Braestrup, “The House of Mourning”  
Beginning\:  
Nina’s mother came up to me, and she said, “I have a problem. Nina,  
my daughter, wants to visit her cousin Andy.” I looked over and Nina was  
hanging by her knees from the swing in her back yard. Her hair was kind  
of sweeping the ground. I said, “How old is Nina again?” She said,  
“Five.”  
I should probably mention that Andy was dead.  
Ending\:  
Nina walks right up to the dais where Andy’ little body lay, covered with  
his quilt his mom had made him when he was a baby. And she walks all  
the way around the dais touching him, making sure he’s all there. She  
smooths the hair back from his brow, and she sings to him. She puts his  
Fisher Price telescope in his hand so that he can see anything he wants to  
see from heaven. And then she says, “I’m ready to go, but he’s not gonna  
be getting up, so I have to tuck him in.” So she walks around the dais  
again, tucking him in very carefully, and then she says, “I love you, Andy  
Dandy, goodbye.” BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS 177  
You can trust a human being with grief, even a small human being. I  
tell the other game wardens, “Walk fearlessly into the house of mourning,  
for grief is only love that has come against its oldest challenge. And after  
all these mortal years, love knows how to handle it.” I don’t need to have  
confidence. I certainly don’t need to have to feign confidence anymore in  
that because I have Nina. And with her parents’ permission, so do you.  
Kate’s beginning and ending show us that even young chil-  
dren have the capacity to face the complexity of death.  
Faith Salie, “What I Wore to My Divorce”  
Beginning\:  
The night before I flew to my divorce, I was standing alone in my bra and  
underwear and basic black pumps, trying on dress after dress.  
Ending\:  
I wish I could go back and tell that motherless, partnerless, childless  
woman, standing in front of a rented mirror, trying on dress after dress f  
or her divorce, that what seems to fit you now may not suit you at all a  
season hence, and you’ll outgrow old favorites and slip effortlessly into  
something new.  
Faith ends with a callback to the first scene but concludes by  
addressing her change in perspective.  
Musih Tedji Xaviere, “Unwritten Rules”  
Beginning\:  
Growing up in Cameroon, all I ever wanted to be was a writer. My  
parents’ plan was for me to become an accountant and then get married,  
in that order, but being a writer was my dream.  
Ending\:  
My parents still don’t get it, but recently they stumbled across positive 178 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
reviews of my novel and they seemed proud. . . . The rules and traditions  
are changing. Slowly but surely, more women writers have a chance.  
Xaviere sets up her parents’ rules regarding what she must  
become, and by the end, we understand that she has literally  
written her own story. She has become what she always wanted  
to be, and her parents have come around. With this ending,  
Xaviere lands her own arc, and her parents’ arc too.  
If takeoff is seamless and you know where you're going, the  
story can feel like it’s telling itself. Storytellers report that the story  
is the most fun once it has reached altitude, meaning the essential  
facts have been communicated and the landing spot is in sight.  
Being prepared makes all of it so much more enjoyable!  
AND... ACTION!  
Storytellers use the first few sentences or the opening scene to set  
the stage and the tone of the story. In film terms, this usually  
includes an establishing shot \(1.e., the big landscape view that sets  
you in the middle of the environment you need to know\).  
Every family has secrets. In my family, the secret was me. I was secret  
because I was Black. These days, you'd say I was biracial. But in the  
JSifties, when you were born, there was no biracial. You were either born  
Black or you were born white. End of story.  
—June Cross, “Secret Daughter”  
When I was fifteen years old, I lived for a while in a mausoleum in the  
back of a cemetery in New Rochelle, New York. And when people find  
that out, they often ask me if it was creepy. And it really wasn’t. I didn’t  
find it particularly creepy.

hooks us in, sets us up, and brings us along! It can...

There was a hard knock at the door in the middle of the night. I saw three  
men in military uniforms. One of them, the KGB major, handed me a  
warrant for my arrest.  
—Victor Levenstein, “Surviving Comrade Stalin”  
Iam one of thirty-seven yeoman warders, commonly known as Beefeaters,  
that live and work within the ancient fortress, the Tower of London, right  
in the heart of London.  
—Christopher Skaife, “The Great Escape”  
It’s 1943. Nice, France. It’s in the middle of the war. The Germans have  
just invaded the town. I’m seven years old. I’m standing on the platform  
of a train with my mother. A very tall man with a long black robe  
approaches us, and my mother gives me to him. I don’t remember how we  
said goodbye, but I never saw her again.  
—Flora Hogman, “My Name, Embroidered”  
It was an early spring day in 1975, and my two younger brothers and I  
were waiting in a cargo airplane to go to America. We were with about  
fifty other orphans, mostly babies and young children.

In August of 1998, I was trying to give birth, and it was well attended.

father\), my foster brother, and two women who were also awaiting the  
birth of their first child, who also happened to be my child.  
—Carly Johnstone, “A Perfect Circle”  
I was walking down the street in New York City, in the East Village, and  
it was a glorious day, and the sun was bright, and I had the love of my life

Embakasi Central, Kenya.

I’m at Mesa Grill, right here in New York City. I was editor in chief of  
Vibe magazine, and I was feeling pretty good about myself. I'd moved up

myself\: And what I didn’t realize is that in a few short moments, platinum  
recording artist and Grammy-nominated emcee Foxy Brown was gonna  
come in there and threaten to beat my ass.  
—Danyel Smith, “Foxy”  
Choose the details carefully, because the audience may tune  
out if it’s too much work to stay with you. You want the audience  
to think, What happened next?, not Why am I hearing this? What does  
this have to do with anything?  
There is no need to start by telling us what the story is about  
or do any setup \(“I’m gonna tell you the story about the day I  
became a man’\). If we know the end, we’re less likely to lean in  
and listen to the details of your story. Let us wonder what hap-  
pens. Let us learn what the story is about with you so that we are  
in sync. This shared experience is one of the most beautiful things  
about storytelling. Please don’t take it away from us! If you tell it  
well \(and we know that you can!\), we will be deeply invested.  
COMING IN FOR A LANDING  
One of the most challenging parts of storytelling is the ending.  
\(We hate seeing things come to an end!\) Those final moments are  
so precious and can make or break the story. A great ending can  
take the listener’s breath away and leave them speechless or fill  
them with a giddy delight that causes them to high-five the per-  
son sitting next to them! A bad ending can leave them questioning  
why they just spent their time emotionally investing in something  
that wound up having no point.  
The creative team at The Moth reviews every story told on  
our stages, and there are times we think\: \(with love\), Ack! They 182 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
fumbled the ending! Usually this is because the story left us hanging,  
or it finished in a way that had no relation to the beginning. You  
want to leave the listener feeling satisfied and grounded; you don’t  
want to yank them off the ride before it has ended or have them  
meandering in circles, begging for it to stop.  
EARNED ENDINGS  
A beautiful ending makes us feel the power and potential of the  
story and puts everything in perspective. Sometimes it’s so mov-  
ing we almost forget that we didn’t love the rest of the story.  
Those are the stories we feel inspired to rework with the ending  
in mind. We ask\: “How can we build the story so that it is worthy  
of that ending?”  
LARRY ROSEN, MOTH DIRECTOR\: Imagine hearing a complex story  
about the troubled relationships in someone’s family. The story  
concludes with a beautiful scene in which the storyteller’s uncle  
tells him how proud he is, they embrace, they both cry, and the  
storyteller says, “This is all | ever needed.” And you think to  
yourself\: It’s an emotional ending, but something’s off. Why am I not  
feeling it? As you think back through the story, you realize the  
storyteller never mentioned wanting or seeking the approval of  
his uncle. He may have told us other things about the uncle—his  
stinginess, perhaps even his coldness—but nothing about the  
missing approval or why it was important to him. Without that  
context, the end can feel unearned, leaving audiences skeptical of  
everything they’ve just heard.  
The events of a story can pose a question that is answered  
when the story concludes. Your story may have a well-crafted  
answer \(ending\), but it will only really “click” if we understand  
the question!  
The ending is the last thing we hear, and it has the potential to  
sour the entire story. A bad ending—one that’s confusing, glib, BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS 183  
arrogant, indifferent, or manipulative—can even make the audi-  
ence angry.  
STATE YOUR CHANGE  
Endings are often rooted in the change you experienced\: Who  
were you at the beginning of the story versus who are you now?  
How did this story and these events leave you feeling different  
about yourself or the world around you?  
It took us eighteen years from the day that we arrived here for me to be  
granted an American citizenship. On January 29, 2009, Iwas sworn in  
as an American citizen, and I pledged allegiance to my new homeland.  
And it is through my children, my two-year-old son and my unborn child  
in my womb, that I will make sure that this gratitude that overflows in my  
heart every single day will continue to live on long after I am gone.  
May God always bless our America.  
—Dori Samadzai Bonner, “A New Home”  
I went from someone who couldn’t even admit he had a crush on someone  
to asking a girl out to prom with my ukulele, having my first kiss, and  
more important than that, establishing a really special connection with  
someone I like. I just kept thinking, I did it.  
—David Lepelstat, “Let It Go”  
When the police arrived—and the police department was there, because  
I’m a pretty noted figure in my city—they offered not only counseling but  
to relocate me if I needed that to happen. Despite my kids’ fears or even  
my own, that intruder had given me a gift. For the first time in my life, I  
knew that I'd been tested, and not only survived but prevailed. And I’m  
now ninety-seven, still living alone.  
—Betty Reid Soskin, “The Test” 184 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
STICK IT!  
Over the years, we’ve witnessed storytellers get to the end of an  
amazing story, and then end in a weak place by saying something  
like, “Well, I guess that’s my story” and wandering off stage,  
effectively taking the air out of the whole experience. The best  
stories feature endings that are succinct and strong—the story-  
telling equivalent of a mic drop.  
Use your last line to land us somewhere special and unique to  
you; don’t waste it on a broad concept. For example, don’t say, “So  
that’s my story about heartbreak.” Instead, try, “She hurt me so  
badly that some days, when I woke up, it was all I could taste for  
hours. But she taught me how to love.”  
We often say that by knowing your last line you can dismount  
with certainty. This isn’t the Olympics, but you still want to stick  
that landing.  
Because that night I realized an important lesson—that sometimes the  
most horrible night, the most horrible day, could change on a dime, when  
there’s a knock on the door. And music and joy arrives.  
—Taylor Negron, “California Gothic”  
After a while, my home attendant and my sister left me alone with my  
boyfriend. I won't go into details, but I will tell you this\: It was the best  
New Year's Eve I ever had. And I want people to know that even though  
T have a disability, I can still move. I understood that someone could see  
me for the woman that I am, and not just my disability.  
—Janice Bartley, “Italian Stallion”  
The week we separate, they tear down my family home of twenty-five  
years, and my Jeep gets stolen. I have this keychain with three keys on  
it—one to the house I don’t live in anymore, one to my family home that’s  
been torn down, and one to my Jeep that’s been stolen. God is banging on BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS 185  
my hood. So I toss the keys, head to art school, and join my tribe.  
—Tricia Rose Burt, “How to Draw a Nekkid Man”  
Ifyou can’t figure out the ending, don’t worry—it isn’t always  
immediately clear. Your ending requires reflection, sorting  
through all the possibilities, sitting with the events to figure out  
what they mean to you. If you can’t find a satisfying ending,  
sometimes you need to look back at the beginning, because a key  
to your resolution may be there.  
TOASTS\: When it’s your turn to take the “stage,” do it with confi-  
dence, share what you’ve prepared, and then know how you’|I exit. Who  
do you give the floor to, where does the mic go, and, most important,  
what’s your last line? Remember, you want to leave them “wanting more”  
rather than checking their watches. And if all else fails, say, “Cheers!”  
ENDINGS TO AVOID  
As directors, we know that telling a story can be both thrilling  
and tiring. People often want to rush to end a story—or they’re  
so relieved to be done that they subconsciously fall into a  
“Hollywood ending” template. Here are a few kinds of story  
resolutions to steer clear of.  
The Perfect Bow  
We don’t recommend you end your story ambiguously, but this  
is not to say you have to tie it up in a bow. The happily ever after  
thing can work, but not often. Sometimes if a story is too pat, or 186 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
“neat”, at the end, it can seem false. The ending can dilute the  
deeper aspects or negate the importance of the story you shared.  
Many stories end in a messy and perhaps still-complicated place.  
Try to resist the urge to make things too perfect.  
The last lines of Hasan Minhaj’s story “Prom” are a great  
example of how everything isn’t picture-perfect at the end, but  
we still feel satisfied.  
There are days where I feel like I can forgive Bethany, and there are days  
where Lfeel like I can’t. I’m working on it. But I’m gonna try to be brave.  
I’m gonna be brave for me and Dad.  
The “Not Cleared for Landing”  
Storytellers can sometimes struggle with where to end. They  
circle their ending like they’re circling a drain, which can exhaust  
the listener. They include half a dozen sentences, and each one  
could be a last line on its own. They say the same thing several  
different ways—or they'll be unsure and offer up several options  
as possible ends \(But wait! Which is it?\). Or they reach the end and  
then tack on a joke for a laugh.  
Take this \(made-up\) ending\:  
I still can’t dance. At the end of the wedding, my mom took me out onto  
the dance floor and we just stood still and talked while Fleet Foxes played.  
Just like always, she met me where I was and let me be the awkward goof  
that Iam. I hope I can be that for other people in my life; I hope I can be  
that for my partner. We are partners for life, in our own special dance.  
Seeing the way my mom opened her arms to my partner made me love her  
more. She has always put family first. Family, whether blood or chosen,  
has always mattered most. She was my first family, and now we are one  
more. My mom was my first dance, my best dance, and she is still my first  
call. Hey Siri, call Mom.  
There’s so much love in this ending! But what is the story  
about? The big events in our lives can be full of emotional BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS 187  
arcs—sometimes homing in on the ending can help you choose  
the story that you want to tell.  
The “Fable Time with Aesop”  
In this Moth style of storytelling, you don’t need to announce the  
moral of the story. Even though stories can be “teachable moments,”  
they should never feel that way. No need to tell the listener what  
they should think or take away from the story. Instead, keep it in  
your experience. How it changed you. How it made you feel.  
Note the last line from Monte Montepare’s “Nowhere to Run.”  
This experience was going to present me with my own personal demons  
in their most aggressive forms. And if I tried to run or hide from them, they  
were going to kill me. If I was going to survive, I was going to need to be  
brave, learn how to stand my ground and look them right in the eye.  
His ending is grounded in how his experience changed  
him—it isn’t a moral for us all to live by, but his own personal  
revelation about the direction he intends to take moving  
forward.  
The “Reader, I Married Him”  
Leaping forward in time is also a pitfall. For example, the story is  
about a tragically awkward courtship that seems doomed, but  
then the last line is, “And we’ve been married for twenty-four  
years now.” It’s cute—the audience will usually clap—but it feels  
gimmicky, and we sort of consider that cheating.  
SATISFYING ENDINGS  
The best endings are true to life. They should make your listener  
feel, understand, or relate to something without you having to  
tell them what that something is. All the steps in your story  
should lead to an ending that answers any questions you may  
have raised along the way. Here are a few things to keep in mind 188 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
when considering how to close your story in a satisfying way for  
your listener.  
. The Story Stops Here  
Sometimes the logical ending for your story may not be true in  
the present. For instance, it’s okay to-stop your story of adopting  
a feral cat on the day you brought it home even if, in the years  
since, your daughter developed an allergy and you had to find the  
cat a new family.  
Have you seen an ECG ofa heartbeat? It’s no coincidence that  
one heartbeat is also what a story arc looks like, and the end of one  
heartbeat leads to another, just like stories do. The end of one  
story will become the very beginning of your next.  
Grounding Uncertainty in Truth  
Often the storyteller isn’t sure how one part of their story might  
end, as in the case of Cynthia Riggs, who told an epic love story  
about a man from her past reaching out to her after sixty-plus  
years. She reveals that she met Howie as a young adult sorting  
plankton in a university lab, and they bonded by writing secret  
cryptograms on paper towels that they would pass back and forth.  
And lo and behold, sixty-two years later, he sent her a package—  
when she was eighty-one and he was ninety—that included all of  
those paper towel cryptograms from sixty-plus years ago,  
wrapped in archival plastic, with a new note on top, in code.  
When she deciphered the note, it read\:  
T have never stopped loving you. Howard  
Cynthia told us that at the time, her children were adults and she  
was a mystery novelist; she was happy with her independent life.  
She also let the audience in on her romantic past, for context.  
Now, you need to know a little something about my background. I wasn’t  
totally off men, but I was a little uncomfortable, because I’d been married BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS 189  
for twenty-five years to a very brilliant but very abusive husband, and  
though we were divorced for thirty-five years, for twenty of those years he  
had stalked me, so I was not comfortable opening any doors to any kind  
of intimacy. But these paper towels . . .  
This cryptogram from Howie led to months of letter writing  
and a slowly but steadily developing romance, as they discovered  
how similar their decades apart had been.  
When she ended her story the first time, she hadn’t seen Howie  
since their work together in the marine biology lab all those years  
ago. She had no idea what the future held, but she was able to land  
her story in truth. She told us she had just purchased her airplane  
ticket, and she’d be on her way to meet him in just a few days!  
Cynthia ends with a decision to take action and try it, and see if  
this relationship with Howie will deepen, which isa far cry from  
where she started the story. Even though, at the time the story  
ends, they haven’t met again, she is able to put a period at the end  
of the story. The resolution is satisfying, while still being full of  
possibilities.  
Howie has changed my life. I had been pretty much closed up, but he gave  
me some very gentle warmth. He also introduced me to a kind of a calm  
love that I had never thought of before. He introduced me to a sweet  
passion—you'd be surprised what you can do in letters and codes—but  
most of all, the thing that has really affected me a lot is that he gave me  
back a sense of great self-worth. And with that, I hope you can all find a  
Howie or his equivalent.  
AAAND ... SCENE  
Similar to beginning in the action, ending in the action, or in an  
active scene, can help to amplify the emotion, as these storytellers  
demonstrate. 190 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Over the blazing fire, I spotted Mama. She had tears in her eyes as she  
listened. My heart quivered with joy. I might have lost my book battle  
with her, but I had won the war. No, we had won the war together. Our  
books have been burned, but not our story, not our hope. That was when  
I knew my college dream would come true, even though it still seemed  
dangerous and impossible.  
—Wang Ping, “The Book War”  
So here she was, six months after the amputation, and right there in the  
middle of the street fair, she hikes up her jeans leg to show me her cool new  
leg. And it’s pink, and it’s tattooed with the characters of High School  
Musical 3, replete with red-sequined Mary Janes on her feet. And she  
was proud of it. She was proud of herself. And the marvelous thing was  
that this six-year-old understood something that it took me twentysome-  
thing years to get, but that we both did discover—that when we can  
celebrate and truly own what it is that makes us different, we’re able to  
find the source of our greatest creative power.  
\_  
—Aimee Mullins, “A Work in Progress”  
We pack the apple cake in the bag. As we enter the hospital, it’s cold and  
it smells like medicine. But as we get to my grandfather's room, everyone’s  
surrounding him and creating some warmth, and I try to discreetly hide  
the bag behind my back, but my grandmother sees, and she goes, “What  
do you have there, Luna?” And I hand her the bag, and she pulls out the  
apple cake, and then she tells my grandfather, “Look, Luna made apple  
cake.” He looks down at the cake, and then he looks back up at me, and  
he smiles. And I just feel this rush of memories flowing back to him, of  
every time we've made apple cake together. And even though he was in  
the hospital, it felt like we had made it together once again.  
—Luna Azcurrain, “Abuelos, Apples & Me” BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS 191  
Grief just suddenly crashes over me. My mom is gone. She won’t be able  
to show me how to cook this stuff. I can’t follow simple recipes and she’s  
gone. Her food is gone. I’m not sure how I’m going to honor her in this  
new home. So I sit down in the middle of the kitchen floor and I cry. The  
smoke alarm is still going. I look up because there’s a smell in the air.  
Somewhere amidst the smell of smoke and burnt sesame seeds and mus-  
tard seeds and cumin seeds there is also the smell of onions, and garlic, and  
ginger, and chilli, and my house smells like my mom’s kitchen. For a  
second, just for a second, it starts to feel like home.  
—Nikesh Shukla, “Salt in the Sugar Jar”  
I’m acting. With Anthony Hopkins. Outside the van, Jonathan Demme  
watches with pleasure. For those few moments, we three are the party.  
—Josh Broder, “Cut”  
I asked my father to join me on the Pakistan Day parade. Iwas not a little  
girl anymore, and Iwas in uniform. I saw a little girl looking at me, at my  
shining boots, gold buttons, and my blue uniform, and dreaming dreams  
to do the impossible. With tears in my eyes, I stood under the shining  
spring sun, shoulder to shoulder with my father, and saluted the passing  
parade.  
—Quratulain Fatima, “The Sky Is the Limit”  
THE RAPID WRAP-UP  
Ending in summation also makes for a satisfying landing. This  
does not mean ending in a moral; instead, articulate how you, the  
storyteller, have changed.  
Td like to think that I changed the way she thought about people of  
color—that we weren’t whatever it was that those people were teaching her, 192 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
and that she might reconsider the prejudices that she had. As for myself, I  
got a job that gave me something to do every day, which I desperately  
needed. I had left Indiana to change the world, and I didn’t. I couldn't.  
But I realized that even if I couldn’t change the world, I could change a  
little piece of the world that I was in, and that was enough for me.  
—Stephanie Summerville, “Life Support”  
Out there in the cold, I realized something. It took one man to alienate  
me and make me feel like I completely didn’t belong. But then seventeen  
amazing nerds let me know that I did! And I knew right then that these  
were my people, Boston was my city, and I wasn’t leaving the U.S.  
anytime soon.  
—Ali Al Abdullatif, “The Patriots Game”  
I aced that interview and got the job. That was the day I got in touch with  
my other side. She doesn’t make many appearances. She’s available on an  
as-needed basis. I call her my Quiet Fire.  
—Phyllis Bowdwin, “Quiet Fire”  
It’s not like I went back to school and I was all of a sudden this Indian girl  
who ate Indian food at lunch and listened to Indian music and wore  
Indian clothes and spoke in Hindi. But I began to realize that I didn’t  
have to pretend to be someone I wasn’t, and I began picking up pieces of  
myself that I'd let fall.  
—Saya Shamdasani, “Priceless Mangos”  
My marriage died, but I lived on. I hope both of my kids grow up to be  
wonderful people. The types of people who bring so much joy to everyone  
around them that their absence would be a tragedy, because that’s the type  
of person that Henry was. He died twenty-four years ago, and it’s still  
fresh, but I’m no longer miserable. In fact, I’m well on my way to BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS 193  
becoming the happiest person I know. And I think that fact would have  
made him happy. He also doesn’t visit me in my dreams anymore. And  
I can finally admit that I’m comfortable with never seeing his face ever  
again, in my dreams or otherwise, because at the end of the day, what will  
an old man like me have to say to his fourteen-year-old friend that hasn’t  
been said already.  
—Kemp Powers, “The Past Wasn’t Done with Me”  
And in the end, the only thing that I could do for her in those last harrow-  
ing hours was nothing. Was nothing. Except to surrender to my  
powerlessness and to have to let her go, and to have to watch her go, and  
she went down swinging and battling to the last awful breath. And it was  
brutal. And it was beautiful. And she was brave. And I howled like a  
wolf when she was gone. And I will never stop telling the world her name.  
—Elizabeth Gilbert, “The Alpha Wolf”  
In Baghdad I was weak, and I couldn’t belong to an organization or an  
entity to help me stay and defend my city. But in America I’m strong, and  
today Iam a sergeant in the Army National Guard, because I can belong  
to an organization that can prepare me to defend my adopted country and  
do my part as a citizen. Because I know how it feels living under terror-  
ism, and I don’t want to ever experience that again.  
—Abbas Mousa, “Leaving Baghdad”  
When the main event is over, and we have the answer we need  
to resolve the story and complete your arc, you have only a few  
sentences to go. Choose a last line that your audience will remem-  
ber, the thought that you want to reverberate with them well after  
you leave the stage. 194 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
CALLS TO ACTION AS A TOOL FOR ADVOCACY\: Moth stories  
often end on a note of personal reflection, but if your goal is to use your  
story to move people to invest in change, tap into the emotion, land your  
arc—but atthe end, adda call to action. “And this is exactly why you need  
to vote in the county election this Tuesday! Stand up and be counted!”  
DIRECTOR’S NOTES

FROM PAGE TO STAGE  
There’s nothing quite like sitting shoulder to shoulder in a room full of  
people who are all quiet, spellbound, and listening with you. To me, it’s  
magic.  
—CHLOE SALMON, MOTH DIRECTOR  
In 2004, on a very cold night in January, The Moth produced a  
show at a theater in rural Massachusetts. It was one of our very  
first shows outside of New York City. The audience was small,  
and the room was \(literally and figuratively\) a bit cold. Mark Katz,  
a longtime Moth favorite, told a story about being a speechwriter  
for Bill Clinton. He began his story, but not long after, he stopped.  
He seemed to have forgotten his place. He tried to start but  
stopped again. Mark finally said, “I’m sorry” and left the stage.  
Gasp. Record scratch. Everyone froze. No one was sure what to  
do—this had only happened one time before. But eventually  
everyone took a breath and we moved on to the next story.  
After intermission, Mark came back on stage and jokingly  
said, “So as I was saying...” and finished the story beautifully.  
He went on to tell it in a few more shows, and always nailed it.  
So what happened on that cold Massachusetts night? Mark 200 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
knew the story by heart, but he was so caught up in remembering  
the words and saying them in a particular order that when he  
forgot a word, he lost his place.  
MARK KATZ\: Here’s what I remember from before I blacked out\: I  
walked onto that stage very excited to tell my story. Too excited.  
I didn’t just want to tell my story that night; I wanted to tell the  
hell out of my story. But something went haywire. I struggled to  
recall my opening line and then two sentences in, I honestly  
forgot what story I was there to tell. Offstage prompting from  
The Moth producers failed to register with my stalling brain. The  
sequence of events recounted above is entirely accurate\: The  
room was stunned and eerily silent as | mumbled, “I’m sorry” and  
stumbled off stage.  
After The Moth team determined that I was not unwell but  
had merely experienced every storyteller’s worst nightmare, they  
cleared me to return to the stage after intermission.  
This time, instead of relying on the room, I took my emo-  
tional energy from the narrative unfolding. In effect, I retreated  
to the interior of my mind where I imagined myselfin the setting  
of my story—in this case, a small hotel holding room where I was  
wearing a tuxedo, holding an egg timer, and engaged in a terri-  
fying encounter with the president of the United States! By the  
time my story was over, I had told it as well as I had first set out to.  
At least, in my mind, anyway.  
Delivering a story on stage takes practice, preparation, and yes,  
alittle courage. In this chapter, we offer tips on how to keep your  
cool, amp up your confidence, and tamp down your nerves.  
MEMORIZATION VS. FAMILIARIZATION  
Many people fear getting on stage and forgetting their story—as  
in, completely forgetting—and standing in terrifying silence while FROM PAGE TO STAGE 201  
an audience watches them wither inside. The anxiety is under-  
standable, and we also understand why people think that  
committing a story to memory is the best way to avoid a mind  
freeze on stage. But in the twenty-five years we’ve been directing  
stories, only a handful of storytellers have totally blanked on stage,  
and always—always!—they were the ones who relied heavily on  
word-for-word memorization.  
Think back to learning the alphabet. Almost all of us remem-  
bered our letters by singing the little song. Have you ever caught  
yourselfin an alphabetizing task needing to sing the whole thing,  
or a section of it, in order to determine ifthe P goes before the T?  
That’s why you shouldn’t memorize your story. On stage, you  
can’t go back to the start and speed through to find where you are  
in the sequence.  
People feel the need to know their story word for word because  
they are afraid of leaving something important out, but this isn’t  
an acting monologue. No one in the audience will fault you for  
dropping a line; only you know what happens next. When you  
tell a story, you want to be able to really fell it, not recite it. If you  
memorize, you aren’t remembering your story as it happened,  
youre recalling what you wrote down and you're less present in the  
room. You risk losing the connection with the listener.  
Many of us have been taught to be a formalized version of  
ourselves when “presenting.” To tell a great story, you’ll have to  
let some of that go. While it may seem counterintuitive to prepare  
in order to be more casual, it is the key to your confidence on  
stage. Stick with the voice of the real you—the backyard-in-jeans  
you, as opposed to the suit, tie, and Spanx you.  
When preparing, you can organize your thoughts in a few  
different ways. Some people think on paper, so they like to write  
out their entire story before they say it out loud. Others prefer to  
just write out bullet points that serve as a guide. \(Think of your  
stepping stones!\) Some folks never write anything down at all.  
There is no right way! And yes, we know—this is a how-to book,  
and we're telling you there is no right way! But it’s the truth! 202 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Think of the text as your road map—you don’t need to memorize  
every street; you just need to know where you're going. Of  
course, there will be certain turns of phrase that you love and will  
repeat the same way every time, but you don’t need to remember  
each and every word. You just need to familiarize yourself with the  
general course of your story.  
That said, a warning\: If you choose to write it out, it can be  
hard to get off the page. You run the risk of falling in love with  
the way you wrote it, and the breakup will be messy! But if you  
are one of those people whose process includes the written word,  
we suggest you boil the draft down to bullet points before you  
begin practicing.  
This “cheat sheet” can help you distill the major scenes of your  
story into short sentences or phrases. Try doing it with just ten  
bullets. While you rehearse, you can glance down to find your  
place if you get lost. Eventually, tell the story with the cheat sheet  
facedown on the table and only turn it over if you're truly lost.  
And finally, tell it with no cheat sheet at all! Look, Ma, no hands!  
Also, remember that regardless of your method, what’s on the  
page is just a representation of the path your story takes. Sometimes,  
in the energy of telling it, you’ll throw in some new detail that  
popped into your brain in the moment, and it will be the best part  
of the story. Give yourself the freedom to just tell it.  
Moth stories are conversational and involve an exchange  
between you and your audience. Their physical presence and  
responses will affect the way you tell your story. It’s okay to react  
to the unexpected laugh from row three. And you'll only seem  
more human when you pause and say, “Wait, I forgot to tell you  
the garage door opener was broken!”  
These stories are alive. To some degree, stories are never  
“done.” They are supposed to be a little different every time you  
tell them. The story will be pushed or pulled a little based on how  
your day is going, whether your pants are too tight, if you're  
slightly distracted with worry that your parking meter might run  
out mid-story... FROM PAGE TO STAGE 203  
“CENTS OF LUCK”\: SARAH ON WORKING WITH FLASH ROSENBERG\:  
Flash Rosenberg is a visual artist who was working on a bittersweet  
story about never hearing the words “I love you” from her father.  
Together, we crafted the story for weeks leading up to the  
Mainstage. It was clear from the considerable time she’d invested  
that this story meant a lot to her. But on the day of the rehearsal at  
The Moth’ office, surrounded by a few staff and the other story-  
tellers cast in the show, Flash was almost in tears. She could barely  
remember the order of the story at all. She started with her setup of  
being a quirky creator, and a bit about her relationship with her  
father growing up, but then she stopped and jumped to the end of  
the story and stopped again. She kept saying, “I can’t remember  
what I wrote” and she asked to reference printed notes. At this  
point, with only a day to go before the show, we were all worried.  
Our hearts broke for her. We knew she had crafted a unique and  
lovely story; it just wouldn’t come out. And during one very long  
pause, fellow cast member \(and style icon\) Simon Doonan popped  
up and said, “Flash! You are an artist. Why don’t you DRAW your  
outline?” And we gasped. That was it! And that’s exactly what she  
did. In the end, this artist needed to draw her story outline in order  
to remember it. Once she had the visuals and could hop from image  
to image in her mind, she was confident and ready to take the stage.  
And in the end, art saved the day, and the story was a success.  
We know we just told you that it’s best to never memorize. But  
there’s one exception to this rule. The only things we suggest you  
memorize—and we stress, the only things—are the first and last  
lines of your story. Knowing your first line allows you to start  
strong out of the gate. Most people are quite nervous when taking  
the stage. When you know your first line, it can help you push  
through the nerves and anchor your story. Yes, the first thirty  
seconds will probably be scary, but don’t forget, you crafted that  
strong opening. By the time you're on your third sentence, the  
story will be driving itself—over hill and dale. Your last line is in  
sight! There’s no stopping for tolls or gas. You're on your way. 204 HOW TO TELL A STORY

USING A STORY TO OPEN A PRESENTATION AT WORK\: Bill  
Robinson’s daughter brought him to the Chicago Moth StorySLAM as a  
Father's Day gift. Bill had always been drawn tostories, but after his night  
at The Moth \(where he actually got on stage and was ranked third in the  
competition!\), he decided to use stories to open his presentation to the  
board of a professional association as their new VP of membership. This  
group was so risk averse that he had tosend them his PowerPoint slides  
of data twenty-eight days in advance to review, but in the three presen-  
tations he gave, he always surprised them with a personal story at the  
top—ike one about trusting his gut and boldly ignoring GPS directions.  
The tactic was effective; Bill raised \$15 million for his new initiative. He  
says, “Stories change where people’s heads are in the room, and |  
wanted everyone to make decisions from their hearts.”  
SAY IT OUT LOUD  
These stories are built to be shared, and now’s the time to test your  
wings! You have an almost fully baked draft of the story, either  
written in bullet points or up in your brain. The next step is to tell  
it out loud to yourself—the words must leave your lips whether  
you tell it into a mirror, out of a window, or to your cat or house-  
plant. In this first telling, you're listening to see if there are edits  
or additions that might help enhance the structure of the story.  
When you run your story for the first time, most often it will  
get longer, because you’re remembering your way through it.  
That is okay! It’s part of the process. Bushwhack your way from  
the first line to the last in roughly the right order. We sometimes  
jokingly refer to this as the “free to flop” version, because the  
point isn’t to tell it perfectly. You just need to get it out of your 208 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
mouth. As you get more comfortable telling it, you will become  
more efficient with your words. This is your opportunity to try  
things—see what works and what feels honest to you, and edit  
out the rest!  
Ifyou need to sneak a peek at your notes, that’s okay, but this is  
your opportunity to take a leap off the page. The majority of first  
drafts are overwritten, so the first time you tell it, you will proba-  
bly find some redundancies, some sections that feel long and thick.  
There may be some phrases that sound unnatural when spoken.  
You may even decide to record yourself and listen back. Take note  
of any parts that feel awkward, extraneous, unnecessary, or repet-  
itive. You might stop and start and forget where you are at times.  
Honestly, it might feel bumpy, but this is an essential step in the  
process. Throughout this chapter, we'll highlight some other  
pitfalls to look out for on the road to smoothing out your story.  
STORIES EVERYWHERE\: You never know when you'll hear the  
story that will alter the trajectory of your life. Be open to stories in all  
places. Commutes really can take you where you need to go.  
JENNIFER BIRMINGHAM, FROM “THREE THINGS”\:  
| jumped into the cab, and the driver was chuckling in the front seat.  
He told me that he had witnessed the kiss and it looked really good. I said,  
“No, it was not good, it was awkward,” and | told him the story of how this  
had been my first first date in fifteen years and it was all too much. The  
driver introduced himself as Pablo and told me that he himself had been  
ona sabbatical from dating, and then he told me all his theories on dating  
as he drove me home to Harlem. When we got to my building, he turned  
off the meter and we talked for another forty-five minutes, all the while  
holding hands between that little window. And | wish | could tell you this  
was the night | fell in love with Pablo, the wise man of the New York City  
taxi fleet. It wasn’t, but it really did feel like the universe put Pablo in ne  
path to mere ita little easier for me to move forward. FROM PAGE TO STAGE 209  
IT’S ALLIN THE TIMING  
Moran Cerf, a professor and neuroscientist, has told stories on the  
Mainstage, and he’s probably the fastest talker ever to appear at  
The Moth. In an interview for The Moth Radio Hour, Moran said,  
“I don’t worry about the time limit. . . . Ifit’s running too long,  
Pll just talk faster.”  
We love Moran, but we don’t recommenda fast-talking work-  
around if you don’t naturally speak that way. Better to edit the  
story down to the most essential beats than require us to wear a  
seatbelt in order to listen. We want to hear every word!  
While Moran fits hundreds of words into a minute, many-  
time Moth storyteller Edgar Oliver is the opposite. He speaks . . .  
so . . . Slowly. Asa result, the number of actual words Edgar utters  
in one of his stories is far below average.  
Here is what Moran managed to get in during the first minute  
of his Mainstage story, “The Dream Recording Machine”\:  
So I’m a neuroscientist, and I do research on people. We don’t get a lot of  
fame doing that, but I actually, I can tell you a story about how I did  
somehow end up being famous for that. So in my research, I’m working  
with patients undergoing brain surgery, and we tried to do all kinds of  
things to help them, but we also do research with these patients. And one  
of the things I did in the last couple of years was a study where we took  
patients who are undergoing brain surgery, and they put electrodes deep  
inside their brain during surgery to help them for clinical reasons. But we  
also did something where we told them, “We're going to show you pictures  
and see how your brain looks when you see those pictures. And we can  
have a map of your brain when you see those pictures. And then we can  
basically know how your brain looks when you think of those things.” So  
the patient could sit in bed and think about the Eiffel Tower. We would  
see a pattern that they organized from before, and we would picture, we  
would project a picture of the Eiffel Tower in front of their eyes. So patients  
would basically sitin bed... 210 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Two hundred fifteen words in his first minute!  
Now compare that with the first minute of Edgar’s story whe  
Apron Strings of Savannah”\:  
Mother used to always say to us, “Savannah is a trap. It'll try to imprison  
you. Even if you manage to get away, it’ll find a way to drag you back.”  
Mother also used to say, “Beware of other people. They won’t understand  
you. We're different. We're artists.” So all throughout my childhood, it  
was just the three of us—Mother, Helen, and me. And then there was  
the world as though we were lost in it. We were like three lost children,  
Mother, Helen, and me. No one ever made it into. . .  
Just ninety-two. Less than half the words of Moran!  
We are not suggesting you speed up like Moran \(few could  
pull off a story at this speed\) or slow it down like Edgar! Just tell  
your story at the pace you'd use to talk with friends over dinner.  
See how long it takes so you get an understanding of your natural  
cadence. Later, consider the time frame you've been given and  
make edits from there.  
“STANDING UP”\: SARAH ON WORKING WITH ED KOCH\: In preparation  
for a Mainstage more than a decade ago, Meg and I traveled to  
Mayor Ed Koch’s New York City office. The former mayor  
kindly greeted us. He looked to be seven feet tall, much taller than  
I had imagined, and his desk was huge, to match his frame. Meg  
and I must have looked like elves staring up at him. Mayor Koch  
wasted no time, and launched into his rehearsed story, but—uh  
oh!—1t’s an entirely different story than the one he pitched for  
the show. My eyes were wide, and I’m taking notes and at the end,  
he says, “I’ve timed it. It’s two minutes. What do you think?”  
After a beat or two and fast diplomatic consideration, I say, “Well,  
Mr. Mayor, I liked that story! And it would be perfect if we told  
two-minute stories at The Moth, but with all due respect—we  
don’t. We tell ten-minute stories at The Moth.” And he looked  
off for a few seconds of thought, and then nodded and sata, 0 il FROM PAGE TO STAGE 211  
give you six. But that’s it’” The night he took the Moth stage to  
tell “Standing Up”—his story about World War II—he opened  
with\: “When I first thought about this, I thought I would tell a  
funny story. I know two. But they don’t make ten minutes, so  
instead, I'll tell a serious story.” And yes, for the record, his story  
clocked in at 5\:29.  
- Though you probably won’t have a timekeeper gently playing  
the violin to tell you it’s time to wrap it up, you generally have an  
idea of an appropriate time range you're aiming for. Believe it or  
not, it’s completely possible for you to tell the same story in two  
minutes, five minutes, or ten minutes, depending on which  
details you feel are crucial to understanding what the story is  
ultimately about.  
It’s hard for most people to gauge how long they’ve been  
talking. A storyteller who is practicing a ten-to-twelve-minute  
story will often be surprised when their first telling is twenty-six  
minutes long. They will say, “But it didn’t feel that long!” If you  
have to meet a certain time frame and you’re running long, we  
advise you to make friends with your timer. While you're telling  
it, try to find places where you can tighten things up. Can you say  
something more simply, using fewer words? Can two sentences  
be pulled into one? Maybe you don’t need that extra description—  
one is enough! If you run it with your timer a few times, you'll  
start to become more efficient with your words. It’s important to  
feel the time so you can bring your story into the right range.  
Another tip for hitting your allotted time limit is to break up  
your story into parts. How much time will you give to your  
beginning, middle, and end? Think of your time frame as a bud-  
get. If you have only ten minutes to tell your story, how are you  
choosing to spend that time? For example, do you choose to give  
two minutes to the setup, five-ish to the middle, and three to the  
end? Spend wisely! If you take eight minutes for the setup, you'll  
have only two minutes left for the heart of the story. Not enough!  
Ina ten-minute story, your stakes should be established in the first 212 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
few minutes. You'll need the remaining time to round out the  
arc of the story and come to a conclusion. Practice hitting your  
marks by editing yourself to get there. Then go back and put it  
all together!  
We often use the term critical choices to describe the editing  
process. Pruning makes stories stronger—cut off some of those  
leggy branches, and you’ll end up with more beautiful roses. Edit  
out anything that might take the story off course.  
SKAL, A VOTRE SANTE, PROST, CHEERS! In the sixteenth  
century, people would put small pieces of toast in the bottom of their  
wineglass \(to improve the taste of wine\). It was customary to drink down  
to the toast when honoring someone. It was also the custom to throwthe  
glass into the fireplace! These days, thankfully, lifting a glass and saying  
a few words will suffice. When called upon to make a toast, one to two  
minutes \(maybe three, tops!\) is considered appropriate. Short and sweet  
is the way to go. \(The Gettysburg Address was around three minutes  
long—and it changed a nation.\) We recommend that stories in other  
social settings come in under three minutes as well. Open up the floor so  
others can share too. ;  
You can revisit your one sentence. Ifa detail or scene feels out of  
place, ask yourself if it supports your one-sentence summary.  
Does it relate to what the story is ultimately about for you? Does  
it move the story forward? Is the overall story arc clear?  
It’s often better to err on the shorter side when practicing,  
because your adrenaline combined with the energy of an audi-  
ence and their reactions \(especially if your story is humorous!\)  
will always make your story expand slightly. FROM PAGE TO STAGE 213  
TENSES  
Editing The Moth’s anthologies allowed us to fully articulate one  
of the major differences between the written word and the spoken  
word\: the use of tense.  
Generally, when you write, you choose a tense and stick to it.  
But when we transcribed the words that the storytellers actually  
spoke, it became obvious how many of our best storytellers  
switched tenses frequently throughout their stories. It wasn’t  
usually noticeable in audio or live, but when we read them on the  
page, it jumped out. Our former editor suggested that we “just  
pick a tense and stick with it,” which seemed reasonable, since  
that’s the way we're taught to write. We tried it, but were sur-  
prised to find it crushed the “liveness” and immediacy right out  
of the stories. We lost the storytellers’ natural voices and the  
feeling of being present in the room with them.  
In live storytelling, you have more freedom to play with tenses  
than you do on the page. In general, when people talk, they jump  
back and forth between tenses. Most people do this naturally, so  
don’t get too caught up in overthinking it. But asa storyteller, you  
can use tense deliberately, as a tool to help define or shape  
moments in your story.  
Looking at Carl Pillitteri’s story again, he describes the  
moment he is working in Reactor Unit 1 at the Fukushima power  
plant when an earthquake hits. He begins his description in the  
past tense \(technically, for our fellow grammar nerds, past  
continuous\).  
And we were squeezing each other with every jolt that this thing’s throw-  
ing at us. And we were huddled up, you know, three grown men like three  
little boys, and I began to pray earnestly aloud for all of us. And it  
appeared that the Japanese boy on my left was praying in Japanese, and  
we were standing just yards in front of this massive turbine and generator  
which was spinning at 1,500 rpm being driven by the steam coming right  
off the Unit 1 reactor. \: 214 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
But then, at one of the most heightened moments, he drops  
into present tense.  
And it was at 100 percent power, and the sounds that began to come out  
of this turbine catch my attention, and I start to realize that it sounds like  
it wants to come apart, and it’s going to explode, and it’s going to pepper  
us against the walls. As if to galvanize and confirm my fears, I hear my  
American co-worker from afar in complete darkness scream, “It’s gonna  
blow. It’s gonna blow.”  
Like Carl, many great storytellers play with tense to draw the  
audience in. They might start out in the past tense, but then  
switch to the present tense at a crucial moment of drama so we're  
right there with them. The present tense can be used like a zoom lens  
in film, bringing you right into the heart of the action and indi-  
cating to the audience that this part is important, so they should pay  
special attention.  
Another example of this is Journey Jamison, who was just  
sixteen years old when she told her story “Theory of Change”.  
\[STARTING IN THE PAST TENSE\] And I never imagined going outside and  
putting myself in danger to help anybody. But it turns out that I didn’t  
have to, because seconds later \(NOW SHE SWITCHES TO THE PRESENT\],  
my back door flies open and a young man, nineteen years old, comes in  
holding his neck. It’s bleeding. And he’s just saying over and over again,  
“T’ve been shot! Can you help me? Can you help me?” And I just say\:  
Ves 1?  
A bleeding man enters the room with her, she switches to the  
present tense, and we are there with them.  
Be mindful that tinkering too much with something as natu-  
ral as tense can make your listener feel manipulated. A good rule  
of thumb when thinking about tense is that your story should  
sound like it would if you were sharing it with a friend. Starting  
offin the present tense can feel too dramatic—more “one-person FROM PAGE TO STAGE 215  
show” than intimately sharing a story. It might feel bold to start  
in present tense, but it can change the dynamic with the listener  
and it creates a subtle distance. A person starting a story by saying,  
“I’m standing in the middle ofa war-torn city” might sound like  
the aural equivalent of someone doing a “reenactment” ofa scene.  
There’s a real risk that the audience will see you as more of a  
performer, and judge you accordingly.  
Also, starting in the present tense can sometimes lead to con-  
fusion. When a man in his forties begins a story by declaring, “I  
am six years old and it’s my first day of kindergarten,” the brain  
of the listener automatically questions this statement. Of course,  
after a moment, they catch up to the device, but that’s it—it’s a  
device, and that device can be off-putting. And when that hap-  
pens in the first sentence, you have to win the listener back.  
This can be especially confusing for the listener if, say, the  
storyteller looks like they’re in their twenties and they start  
with, “I’m seventeen years old.” The listener is left thinking,  
Are you? You look a little older. . . It can take them a beat to catch  
up, and during that beat they’re distracted and may miss the  
next five things you say. Better to just say, “I was seventeen years  
old.” In this case, using past tense will help your listener feel  
more present.  
As you tell your story, remember that you will likely change  
tenses naturally. You don’t need to comb through for  
consistency—let your tenses live!  
REPETITION CREATES A SPOTLIGHT  
If something is important to the story, shine more light on it!  
Repetition can show the listener where to look. They don’t have  
words on a page to refer to, so sometimes you have to find another  
way to underscore an important detail. Ifa point is particularly  
critical, dedicate a few sentences to it, to ensure the audience hears  
it. You can even slow down saying it, to signal\: Hey, you don’t want  
to miss this! Or simply repeat the detail for-effect. 216 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
I spent 10,000 hours practicing—10,000 hours!  
At the end of the road we saw a dead body—a dead body!  
Repetition can be another way of saying, “Did you hear that?”  
This is especially good when one detail is important to under-  
standing the entire story. If the audience misses it the first time,  
they will be lost later on—so make sure they don’t miss it!  
In “Eye Spy,” Michaela Murphy uses repetition to make sure  
the audience absorbs a critical detail that’s crucial to understand-  
ing the story\: the moment when she discovers her uncle Al has a  
glass eye.  
And then my uncle Al, who never, ever played with us, ever, comes into  
the water to play chicken fights with us. And he puts his daughter, my  
cousin Eileen, up on his shoulders, and then I get up on my cousin Kevin’s  
shoulders and we're having chicken fights, and it’s like actual family fun  
fora moment. And we're, like, you know, hitting each other, falling in  
the water.  
And then I take my foot and I accidentally kick the side of my uncle  
Al's head really, really hard, and his eyeball pops out of his head, falls into  
the water, and sinks.  
It pops out of his head, and it sinks.  
FLOWERY LANGUAGE  
Tempting as it may be, there is no need to use big words and  
flowery language in your stories. Talk like you talk, not like you  
write. It will make you a better storyteller, and it just might help  
you see your writing in a new way.  
ADAM GOPNIK, NEW YORKER STAFF WRITER AND MOTH STORY-  
TELLER\: I sensed in myself that I had become, in some ways \(and  
doubtless still am in every way\), an unduly fancy writer. That is, FROM PAGE TO STAGE 217  
that the sort of curlicues and ornamentations of erudition had  
begun to drown out my ability to simply tell a tale about what had  
happened. But I think writing is a business of perfection. You  
want every sentence to glow and shine, and have its own little  
balance and structure and charm. A story’s not like that. A story  
can tolerate a lot of rough stuff in the course of its being relayed,  
as long as what’s being related is significant. You can’t write that  
way. Readers are not forgiving of imperfection. But don’t you  
think listeners are totally unforgiving of insincerity?  
The one thing that will make an audience turn on storytellers  
is if they seem to be performing or disconnecting emotionally in  
some way.  
Either find the poetry in straightforward speech, or skip the  
poetry and say things in a more direct way.  
RAY CHRISTIAN, MOTH STORYTELLER\: Be genuinely and authenti-  
cally you. Whatever that is. However flawed. However different.  
The more fabricated you try to be, the less poignant your story  
feels to the audience. It may sound perfect, but unless it’s delivered  
from your heart, with all the intensity you felt in the moment, it  
doesn’t feel perfect, and that’s when the magic happens.  
SALTY LANGUAGE  
Stories should always sound like you, but if your everyday patter  
sounds like a scene from a Quentin Tarantino film, consider the  
audience. Some people seem to curse more when they’re nervous.  
It can be jarring, and f-bombs are not something the audience gets  
used to. Are you willing to lose listeners? If not, can you tone  
down some of the cursing? The age-old notion of a well-placed  
f\*\*\* is a good rule of thumb. There are times when it seems  
nothing else will do! Don’t diminish the power of the word by  
using it like punctuation. 218 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
JENIFER\: My grandmother once and only once said “damn it” in  
my presence. She was on her knees scrubbing our kitchen floor,  
and I passed through with muddy boots for a fourth time. I can  
still feel that “damn” in my stomach. I was scorched. She meant  
business, and she pulled out the big guns. I felt the power  
of language.  
Consider Jon Bennett’s story “Curses!,” about a father who  
absolutely never uses profanity and is eternally correcting those  
around him with his puritanical “There’s no need for that  
language!” Later, when the father is faced with a situation so  
extreme that he lets out a curse, the audience falls apart with  
delight. Good curse.  
An entirely un-prudish man from Louisiana once mentioned  
that every time someone drops an f-bomb in casual conversation,  
it feels like he’s been slapped in the face. Maybe you intentionally  
want to slap people in the face with your curse. Great, but you  
might only get to slap them once before they recoil/tune out/shut  
down/disengage. If you want to reach people far and wide, maybe  
there is another word you could use. You can also suggest a curse  
without actually saying it. \(What the . . . do I mean by that?\)  
In Sheila Calloway’s story “True Justice,” she describes a  
moment of intense frustration where she lost her cool and let a few  
choice words fly. Instead of telling us exactly what she said, she  
phrases it like this\:  
I knew in my heart of hearts that this judge would never give this kid  
expungeable probation. And the frustration just grew in me. And the  
more I talked to the DA about it, the more smug he seemed to be, and he  
would answer me, “Well, he did the crime, he’s gotta do the time.” And  
he kept saying that over and over and over to me. And it just built inside  
of me, the anger was so deep, that all of a sudden I snapped, and I  
immediately put down my files and I pointed my finger in his face and I  
said, you don’t know what justice is, you are blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  
bleep, bleep, bleep, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, BLEEP BLEEP FROM PAGE TO STAGE 219  
BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP BLAH, BLAH. Now, mind you,  
this was a courtroom full of people. There were attorneys, my supervisor,  
my poor client, all watching this. But at that moment I didn’t care who  
was watching. All I thought was, This is not right; this is not fair.  
THINGS TO BE MINDFUL OF WHEN PRACTICING YOUR STORY OUT  
LOUD\:  
\* STANDUP! It’s important to stand when you practice telling your  
story—there is an immediacy to standing, and it actually  
engages the brain in a different way. Scientists at Texas A&M  
studied three hundred students using standing desks and found  
their cognitive engagement went up by 12 percent. Turns out  
the old adage that we think better on our feet is true.  
\* TRY YOUR STORY WITHOUT ANET. “I’mso nervous, I need notes!”  
We understand you'll want to use them in the beginning, but  
as you practice more and more, you should eventually try doing  
it without the notes, even if you don’t feel quite ready. Better  
to see where you get tripped up and smooth out the bumps.  
Using notes gives you a false sense of security \(plus, stories are  
always shorter with notes, so you won't have an honest running  
time\).  
e  
AT THIS POINT, YOUR STORY MIGHT NOT EVEN MAKE COMPLETE  
SENSE. DO NOT FRET! When you first separate yourself from the  
page, you may find that you have finished a section and don’t  
know where to go next. This could mean that you don’t have  
all of your stepping stones in place. And now you know! This  
is a good time to step back and think about what the key  
moments are in the story that connect each beat to the next and  
give it its larger shape.  
¢ PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE YOU LOSE YOUR PLACE\: If, as you're  
telling the story in draft form, you lose your place or zone out,  
it means something isn’t working, either structurally or emo-  
tionally. Can you reorder? What's the greater truth? What’s a  
very simple way to say it? Maybe the detail you keep forgetting  
isn’t necessary! Your subconscious can be'a great editor. If you 220 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
continue to get lost, maybe you're trying too many fancy tricks  
with your structure. Go back to a chronological telling and see  
how that feels.  
\* ZHUZHTHE STAKES. If you find your story is falling a little flat,  
or after telling it, you think, So what?, you may need to “punch  
up” or, as we like to say, zhuzh the stakes! What is the moment  
of tension? Do you need to build on it or turn up the heat?  
What did you stand to lose, and is that clear in the setup? Is  
there something for your listener to invest in? You can tell us  
you want to stay dry in the rain, but once we know you're  
wearing your sister’s brand-new suede boots . . . without her  
permission . . . the stakes of the rain are amplified.  
LISTEN FOR WHAT DOESN’T FEEL AUTHENTIC TO YOUR OWN VOICE.  
Are there places in the story where you falter or where it doesn’t  
sound like how you speak? Change it! As you get to know  
yourself as a storyteller, you’ll probably discover phrases or  
rhythms that are natural to you.  
ISOLATE AND PRACTICE THE END OF YOURSTORY. The beginning  
of your story tends to be rehearsed more frequently, because  
you start it in the shower or on your commute, but then your  
phone rings or you have to swerve to avoid a cat. You ask,  
“Where was I?” and then you start at the top again! Be sure  
to spend some time finessing and going over how you’ll land  
the story. Start at the fifty-yard line and make your way to the  
end zone.  
¢ IF YOU’RE FINDING IT HARD TO LET GO OF THE WORDS YOU’VE  
WRITTEN, PRACTICE TELLING THE STORY USING ALL DIFFERENT  
worDS. It will take you a little longer, but it will show you that  
you know your story, and there is no one right way to tell it, as  
long as the meaning is there.  
TELLING IT TO OTHER PEOPLE  
Storytellers are often worried that if they tell the story again and  
again in practice, it will get stale. And it’s true that there may be FROM PAGE TO STAGE 221  
a point when the story starts to feel a little flat. But we sometimes  
tell a storyteller that they have to get “‘better-worse” before they  
can get “better-better” again, meaning it’s okay to practice it to  
the point of it feeling a little tired to you. The story is getting into  
your system. That’s why the piano teacher makes you do the  
scales, so when the improv solo comes, you can reach for any note  
and be sure that you'll hit it. It will come alive again the second  
you tell it to a group of people, and it’s only through repetition  
that you can get to know your story well enough to be truly  
comfortable telling it in front of others. The more you have the  
beats down, the more you can play with it and feel at ease respond-  
ing to the reactions of your listeners.  
And now comes a moment of vulnerability\: telling it to  
another person. Cue the nerves! But if the end goal is to tell this  
story to a group of people, whether as part of a work talk or as a  
wedding toast, it helps to tell it to a friend first. An audience of  
one friend is “fresh ears,” and can give you much-needed feed-  
back. \(And if that is still too much, you can even record yourself  
telling it and listen back.\) Informal is ideal here! Think of this like  
a rough draft.  
You've heard “practice makes perfect,” and the closest thing  
tc a “perfect” story is when the teller is confident, prepared, and  
in the moment on stage. Stories should feel off the cuff, but they  
should not be off the cuff, as you've likely surmised.  
NOTES ON DELIVERY  
One of the last things we focus on in rehearsal is delivery. While  
we don’t want you to perform your story, there are certain things  
you have to be mindful of in order to tell it well.  
¢ REMEMBER THAT YOU KNOW YOUR STORY BETTER THAN ANYONE  
ELSE. If you lose your place, don’t panic, just take a breath. If  
you mix something up, cop to it, jump back, and add in a detail. 222 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
People will only love you more. You lived this. Just think,  
What’s the next thing that happened in the story, chronologically?  
Continue there. And then, if you get to a part that you forgot  
to set up? Just tell us what you forgot to tell us!  
IT’S GOOD TO TAKE A BREATH BEFORE YOU SPEAK. Take the  
moment in. Remember, your listener is choosing to be there.  
They want to hear you share your story. They are looking up at  
you with an open heart and mind. There’s no need to feel rushed.  
SPEAKING OF FEELING RUSHED, CONSIDER THE SPEED OF EACH  
SECTION OF YOUR STORY. Stories can feel bland if they’re told at  
the same pace all the way through. Don’t give every moment  
in the story the same weight! A story is like a song; it has vari-  
ance. It’s not a metronome, simply keeping the beat. In places  
that are serious or dramatic, or that include a lot of integral  
information, you might want to slow down. But of course if  
there’s a moment in your story where things are chaotic or  
exciting, you might pick up the pace.  
SILENCE CAN BE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE WORDS YOU SAY.  
There is a rhythm to how you deliver your story, and a few  
pauses throughout are essential. A breath punctuates the story  
and can let the audience know what is most important. A pause  
after a huge plot point can also help the audience take in what  
just happened. If something is a big deal, put a little space  
around it to give it extra weight! When we write, we create  
paragraphs to group ideas. When we speak, we create para-  
graphs with our voices by pausing. Taking a beat can signal to  
a listener that we are changing gears or changing scenes. If you  
pause before you flash back or jump ahead, it gives the listener  
a chance to stay with you.  
ACTING IS A DIFFERENT ART FORM. Sometimes if the person is  
“acting” the story out, it can be distracting. Gesticulating is  
perfectly fine—we are not storytelling robots—but a full-body  
reenactment of the story is a different art form. Moth-style  
storytelling is more like “live documentary” than long-form  
physical comedy, acting, or mime. If you aren’t someone who FROM PAGE TO STAGE 223  
typically talks with your hands, don’t start now.  
¢ WHEN SHARING DIALOGUE, PUT THE “I SAID,” “SHE SAID,” ETC.,  
BEFORE THE QUOTE. This is what we do when we speak natu-  
rally. It’s the opposite of how we often write, so when  
storytellers try to do it in the reverse order, they tend to sound  
very written. And once you establish who is talking, you can  
also drop the “he said” /“she said” /“they said” altogether.  
Notice how these lines differ\:  
“How old is Nina?” I said.  
“Five,” she said.  
But if you switch it up...  
I said, “How old is Nina?”  
“Five.”  
. . it flows well. This will make your story sound more  
natural.  
¢ USE THE PERSONAL “I” INSTEAD OF THE COLLECTIVE “YOU.”  
Sometimes tellers get a case of the “yous.” Keep the story  
rooted in your own experience instead of generalizing. To  
generalize is to subconsciously step away from the bigger feel-  
ings—it can create distance for the audience, too, and take  
them out of the story. Compare these two versions of Kiri  
Bear’s “A Natural Mother.” Here’s how she could have told it\:  
As a parent, you always consider that what your kids think  
about you doesn’t matter. Your job is to show up, to love t  
hem. What they do is completely up to them. But you find out how  
much they love you.  
Here’s how she actually told it\:  
Asa parent, I'd always considered what he thought about me didn’t  
matter. My job is to show up, to love him. What he does is com-  
pletely up to him. But I found out how much my son loves me  
because the thought of never seeing me again was devastating. 224 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
USE THE PERSONAL “I” INSTEAD OF THE COLLECTIVE “WE”\: Using  
“I” instead of “we” language keeps the story personal. What is  
true for you might not be true for “all microbiologists” or “all  
Angelenos” or “all the single ladies.” Your story is an opportu-  
nity to speak exclusively for yourself.  
SEE THE MEMORIES. If you're describing a specific moment in  
time, especially one that is seared into your brain, try to go back  
to the memory, or as we like to say, “drop into the moment.”  
See it in your mind as you're telling it. A new detail may sud-  
denly flood back and make your description that much richer!  
You might find yourself experiencing the emotion of the  
moment, which will in turn influence your delivery.  
BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERHYPE A MOMENT. Avoid saying things  
like “And then the most amazing thing happened” or “And  
then she said the most hilarious thing.” Often when you set  
something up as being the most anything, it somehow falls flat.  
The listener is like, That’s not THAT amazing. It’s not THAT  
hilarious. It comes down to human nature. People don’t really  
like to be told what to think. When you set something up like  
this, the listener instantly goes, I'll be the judge of that! Ifyou drop  
the declaration and just say the actual thing, nine times out of  
ten your listener will think it’s the most hilarious or amazing  
thing!  
NO SPOILERS! Resist the urge to tell us what will happen before  
it happens. Often people will throw in a sentence like “And  
then something happened that would change my life forever.”  
This is like telling us the end of the story before you get there.  
It might feel dramatic to you, but it can actually kill the energy  
of the moment. Before that moment happened, no one told  
you it would change your life forever; try to recount it the way  
it unfolded for you so your audience can experience the same  
element of surprise or suspense you did.  
BEWARE OF FILLER WORDS.  
\* “YOU SEE?” People often have a phrase or word they pause  
on while they’re preparing for their next sentence. Um and FROM PAGE TO STAGE 225  
like are the most common. It’s good to be aware if you're  
doing this, because after the twentieth like, right? or literally,  
it can become a bit tedious and ultimately fatigue the  
listener.  
\* “YOU KNOW?” No, we do not know. We may be familiar  
with the themes or circumstances of your story, but we do  
not know your story. That is why we're listening. Also  
avoid these phrases\:  
As you can imagine . . . Can we?  
It goes without saying . . . Does it?  
You understand . . . Do I?  
Typically, tellers don’t even realize they’re dropping these  
phrases. Stay aware, and you can lift them right out.  
° “SO...” If we had a nickel for every time a storyteller  
opened their story by saying, “SOOO,” we would have . . .  
a huge pile of nickels. Starting with so is another thing that  
people aren’t aware that they're doing. Some storytellers  
default to this as a way to claim the space and share their  
voice without committing any word, thought, or emotion  
to the room. But rest assured, the audience is on your side.  
Instead, just take a minute and center yourself. Know your  
first line, and deliver it confidently. You will be so great.  
\* DON’T PRACTICE TOO CLOSE TOSHOWTIME. We find that if you’ve  
rehearsed too recently, it’s easy to leave something out in the  
actual telling because you'll think you’ve already said it \(because  
you did . . . a few hours before!\).  
DIFFERENCES IN STORYTELLING CULTURE\: The Moth teaches personal  
storytelling workshops for people all around the world. Everyone  
is welcome. One workshop of twelve people may have folks from  
twelve different countries and many different religious faiths. \(At  
times, we’ve even had participants from warring countries in the  
same storytelling group.\) Respect is of utmost importance. Over  
the years, we've learned that storytelling in other cultures can be  
very different from Moth-style storytelling. 226 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
In one workshop, a doctor crafted a story about a harrowing  
experience at the start of her medical career. In early drafts, she  
shared the backstory of growing up as the eldest child in a privi-  
leged and supportive Ethiopian family. She tells her father she  
wants to be a nurse, and he says, ““Why don’t you become a doc-  
tor?” She then details her path to medicine. The story builds to  
one stark scene on her first day of rounds in the local hospital. She  
enters a ward through swinging doors to find dozens of women  
in cascading states of distress, all in critical care because of unsafe  
abortions. She had never seen anything like this; she had never  
known that some women in her own community resorted to  
terminating unwanted pregnancies in secret, risking death.  
As she rehearsed the story in the Moth workshop, she unex-  
pectedly switched from “I” to the collective “we” once she  
entered the hospital ward. She described the scene vividly, but it  
was told from the perspective of all the new doctors, rather than  
from her own individual experience. To our ears, we had lost the  
singularity of her character. .  
When we mentioned this, she said that in her culture, using  
“T” is considered showy. Garish. People do not tell stories about  
themselves. She said to shine a light on the self, as opposed to the  
community as a whole, was thought to be narcissistic. But she  
decided to try a personal lens for this story just as an exercise in the  
workshop to explore her own perspective and motivation.  
Moth-style storytelling is one of many ways to tell a moving  
story. After workshops, we encourage participants to take the  
tools that feel most helpful for their future storytelling. While  
reading this book, use what aids you and discard what doesn’t.  
Share stories that only you can tell, and share them in a way that  
is authentic and true to you. FROM PAGE TO STAGE 227  
ON MAKING SPACE FOR STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED\:  
Casseroles and flowers are nice, but sometimes the most meaningful  
thing you can do for a grieving friend is to make space for them to share  
their stories about a loved one they lost. Asking broadly for stories might  
feel overwhelming, so instead start small—ask about a tradition, a  
memorable meal, or what made them laugh. You'll allow them to spend  
. time outside of their grief and may inspire amemory that adds brightness  
to their mourning. Let the stories build upon each other. Your friend may  
be comforted by hearing stories from other people who loved their  
loved one.  
KATE\: My mother’s birthday is always hard for me, so last year |  
texted my high school friends and asked them to share a memory of her.  
The day was punctuated with short memories\: her excellent hummus,  
her obsession with Sérgio Mendes’s Brasileiro album. My favorite? One  
friend said that she was the first adult he came out to. It made the day  
for me. 228 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
DIRECTOR’S NOTES  
When you say your story out loud for the first time, it will be long,  
because you’ re remembering your way through it. That’s okay! As you  
tellit, listen to how you’ve structured and ordered your pieces. Is every-  
thing in the right place? Does it all flow together?  
Listen for where you might make edits. Are there phrases that are  
redundant or too many details that might cause confusion? Is there a  
spot you trip up on every single time that you just need to let go? Is there  
something you say in two sentences that could be said in one? The  
more you tell it, the more efficient and comfortable you will become  
with your words,  
There is no need to rush to the end. Savor certain moments and accel-  
erate when the story calls for it. Lean into the quiet and more thoughtful  
moments, and enjoy the laughs when they come!  
Remember, your story is alive! It will be different every time you tell it.  
Your tenses may switch up or a detail might spring to mind as you  
remember the moments you’ re describing. This is not a recitation.  
Find a trusted ear to listen to a run-through of your story. Ask them the  
same questions you asked yourself. Is there anything confusing or  
distracting? Were there points in the story that felt superfluous? \(Were  
you tuning out during that part about the goat?\) Did they need more  
info about anything to better understand? If nothing else, a run-through  
with a trusted listener will help you build your confidence. CHAPTER 10  
ALL THE WORLD’S A STAGE  
Years ago, we produced a Mainstage in Detroit. The stage manager at the  
theater kept asking me how many towels we needed. He was stressed. He  
was holding a few white hand towels and was eager to know how many  
more he should find. | told him\: no towels. Then the supervisor came. He  
said, “We have fifty towels. Will you need more?” | thanked him and said no,  
The Moth only needs a single standing microphone. Our setup isso simple,  
he was shocked. \(Turns out the Insane Clown Posse played that stage  
regularly and needed towels because their lively shows generated a lot of  
sweat.\) But there are no towels at The Moth. You may sweata bit during the  
telling of your Moth story, but in twenty-five years, no one has ever needed  
a towel!  
—SARAH AUSTIN JENNESS  
The Moth Mainstages have been held all over the world, in places  
as wide-ranging as the iconic Sydney Opera House, Golden Gate  
Park in San Francisco, New York’s Lincoln Center, an amphithe-  
ater in Tajikistan, a cave in Stockholm, the Kenya National  
Theatre in Nairobi, and on the floor of the United Nations.  
The storytellers sit in the first row of the audience and the host  
calls them up to the stage individually. They share their stories, 230 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
center stage, and then return to their seats. This reminds us that  
the storytellers are not performing their stories—they’re sharing  
their personal experiences. There is no fourth wall. The story-  
tellers are not “them,” with “us” in the audience. It’s only us.  
We're all together. Anyone in the audience could be telling a story.  
Often people will say, “Oh, I couldn’t tell a story at The Moth,  
I’m not a performer.” Even just the idea of being in the spotlight  
is terrifying for some people. You may worry that you will forget  
what you're going to say, or that you'll say the “wrong” thing, or  
that no one in the room will care. But working through these  
fears will allow you to be comfortable enough to connect with  
the audience.  
Other first-person theater forms, such as cabaret and solo  
shows, often feature people “playing” themselves in a heightened  
sense. Production elements like music, props, and lighting cues  
might add to the theatricality of one person’s true story shared on  
stage. This can be magical, transportive, moving—all the things  
we love about live theater—but these forms are not what we  
aspire to at The Moth. We don’t want you to “play” you. We want  
to meet you. The real you! No pancake makeup, dance moves, or  
deep curtain bows required.  
MELVIN ESTRELLA, FOUNDING BOARD MEMBER\: The Moth audience  
wants you to take it high, and they'll help you get there. They are  
rooting for you. I’ve never seen another audience like that, ever.  
Moth shows, and personal storytelling shows of all sorts,  
attract an audience who want to be transported. How often do  
you get to hear fully formed stories from the hearts of strangers?  
Sometimes the stories will overlap with the audience’s experi-  
ence, other times they might not. How often do you have the  
chance to walk for ten minutes in someone else’s shoes? Or have  
your long-held beliefs challenged? .  
Compelling storytellers create an intimacy that can make a  
room feel small just by their ability to make individual ALL THE WORLD’S A STAGE 231  
connections. When you share a story with 3,000 people, you want  
the listener to forget the other 2,999 people in the room and feel  
like you're sharing the story with only them. Maybe you’re just  
telling your story to two or three people. The same rule applies.  
ABBAS MOUSA, MOTH STORYTELLER\: Do not worry about having  
the perfect words or worry about your stage performance. You're  
‘not acting in a play. Do not wonder whether your story is good  
enough, or what others might think. Storytelling is a lot more  
than this. Your story is unique, just like other stories are, so focus  
on reliving that experience or event, and translate your feeling  
into words. That’s what gives the best delivery to your story, and  
that’s what the audience wishes to see.  
At The Moth, our setup is deceptively simple\: We always have  
one mic, kept on the stand. The microphone grounds the story-  
teller. The single storyteller on stage grounds the audience. No  
props, no set, no PowerPoint graphics, no light changes. There  
are no production elements to lean on, and that’s on purpose. We  
want the tellers and their stories to speak for themselves.  
Our number one stage rule\: Don’t touch the mic. Fussing with  
the microphone or gripping the stand for dear life is distracting  
and can mess with the audio. Unlike a stand-up comic, Moth  
storytellers can’t walk off their hot, anxious, happy feelings with  
the mic. You have to express whatever you are feeling through  
your story. Nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide!  
We’ve noticed that people who handle the mic with ease or  
rock it back and forth are perceived as pros. The audience thinks,  
Oh, this is a performance or worse yet, He’s going to try to sell me a  
vacuum cleaner at the end. When you invite the audience into the  
world of your story, it’s important that they feel the story is com-  
ing from your heart and not part of a routine.  
Back in the day, we made an exception for our storyteller  
Darryl “DMC” McDaniels, the rapper who founded and fronted  
Run-DMC. But after he told his first story, he said that he’d 232 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
rather leave the mic on the stand like everyone else. And ever  
since then, we like to say that if Darryl McDaniels can leave the  
mic on the stand, everyone else can too!  
You may not aspire to ever stand on a Moth stage; maybe  
you're reading this book to learn to tell stories at work or at dinner  
parties. Wherever you plan to tell your stories, we suggest you go  
it alone\: no bells, no whistles. Just you. Straight up.  
NERVES  
At The Moth, we ask people, many of whom have never practiced  
public speaking, to go onto a stage in front of hundreds \(or thou-  
sands!\) of people and share pieces of their lives. They do so with  
no podium, notes, or special effects, and trust that the facts of  
their life, intentionally woven together, will engage a room full  
of strangers. It has all the pressure of a first date that is also being  
recorded at broadcast quality. It’s like the most profound revela-  
tions of therapy, but with the potential for applause.  
By now you've read many pages about the power and exhilaration  
of sharing your story, but for so many of us, it is fraught with fear.  
Nerves often arise when people worry about screwing up their  
story. But we have good news\: The only way to really fail is to  
think there is only one right way to tell your story. You have all the  
answers. You are the only person who can tell it with authority!  
DAN KENNEDY, MOTH HOST AND STORYTELLER\: Even if a little part  
of the story didn’t go exactly the way you wanted it to, you realize  
the audience was always on your side, from the moment you got  
on that stage, because you are them, and they are you, and you  
were all in it together.  
MICHELLE JALOWSKI, MOTH DIRECTOR\: One of my favorite things  
about this work is how much it reminds me that everyone is just  
a person, which is very humbling and also confidence-inspiring. ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE 233  
Every single person I’ve worked with—including seasoned hosts  
and professional actors, musicians, and performers—gets nervous  
about getting up on stage and telling a Moth story. It’s a leveling  
platform, and I love that about it so much. It’s a constant reminder  
that everyone is a flawed human being, trying to figure it all out  
as they go along. As long as you're willing to be vulnerable, you  
can tell a compelling story.  
Remember\: It’s natural to be nervous! Nerves are good; they  
mean you care.  
SHERMAN “O.T.” POWELL, MOTH STORYTELLER\: When I get on stage,  
I block out the audience so I don’t have the jitters. My batteries  
get charged once I get into the rhythm of the story, and once I  
have the rhythm, I’m HOME, whether there are two people in  
the audience or two thousand.  
SO WHAT DOI DO WITH MY NERVES?  
During the rehearsal for a show that featured a blues musician, a  
celebrated journalist, a passionate patissier, and a famous actress,  
Jeremy Jennings stood at the front of the room preparing to share  
his story. The story explored his conflicted emotions around his  
deployment as a prison guard at Guantanamo. Jeremy became  
overwhelmed by nerves and found it difficult to get through his  
first few lines.  
JEREMY JENNINGS\: I was literally choked by a panic attack. I could  
feel all of the eyes in that small room on me, and I couldn't get the  
words out as I tried to breathe. Kathleen Turner, a veteran actress  
and star of movies from my childhood, sat there unfazed and  
immediately suggested that I “shake it out! Go ahead, just shake  
it out!” I start jumping around, waving my arms and making  
strange noises. Her unflappable expectation that I was going to 234 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
tell the story, that I couldn’t just run away, helped get me through.  
I managed to push on, and I told the story, but it was rough. I ran  
into Kathleen in the elevator afterward, and she said nothing  
about my meltdown, just treated me like another colleague.  
The night of the show, it was still difficult to get through the  
story, but the response from the audience was amazing. At inter-  
mission, so many people came and shook my hand and thanked  
me. I was overwhelmed with kindness and support. A few people  
even leaned in, with tears in their eyes, to share personal experi-  
ences similar to my own, and they were grateful to know they  
weren't alone. It was liberating, and reframed how I saw myself in  
my own story.  
Okay, so everyone gets nervous! If you don’t have Kathleen  
Turner at your disposal, how do you get through the nerves?  
SHANNON CASON, MOTH HOST AND STORYTELLER\: The anticipation  
to go on stage is nerve-racking. I actually hate the feeling and  
would rather be doing anything else. I think, Why am I doing this?  
I could be eating pizza instead. I could be doing anything besides going  
on stage to tell a crowd about the deep, terrible, and funny things that  
happened in my life. Then I get a flash\: I’m doing what I’m meant to  
do. I tell myself that someone in this audience needs to hear this  
story. And at that same time, I need to tell this story forthem .. .  
and for myself. I have to find a reason. Some or ANY reason  
beyond just being in front of a crowd to talk about me—if that  
was the case, I’d just go eat pizza instead.  
PRESHOW NERVES  
To deal with nerves, some people have preshow rituals. They may  
listen to music before going on. They eat a special food, or they  
don’t eat at all. Some people have one glass of wine or a shot of  
whiskey \(note\: one\). ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE 235  
Some people exercise to use up all their pent-up energy, while  
others find ways to be still and get out of their heads—like getting  
a massage or catching an early matinee. Kate’s preshow ritual is  
to get a manicure. It keeps her away from screens or useless busy  
work. The plus? When she talks with her hands on stage, they  
look good.  
You may not be totally confident, but try to tap into your  
courage! In her story “The Spy Who Loved Me,” Noreen Riols  
reminds us that “courage isn’t the absence of fear, it’s the  
willingness—the guts, if you like—to face the fear.” You're going  
to be nervous, so just accept it and put a positive spin on it.  
Really, what’s the worst that can happen? Remind yourself you  
can do this! Maybe you come up with a personal mantra to build  
yourself up.  
SIMON DOONAN, MOTH STORYTELLER\: While trawling The Strand  
bookstore one rainy afternoon, I stumbled upon a biography of  
Judy Garland. . . and voila! There it was. The antidote to my  
anxious cringing. Here’s the deal\: Judy, back in the day, had a  
unique way of battling stage fright. As she walked from her dress-  
ing room, she would repeat, out loud and proud, a helpful little  
mantrasit went asfollows\: “PO \* ent, F\*\*\* em. F\*\*\* em.”  
It was Judy’s way of refusing to be intimidated by an audience.  
She reduced her fear of failure by big-upping herself. By the time  
she reached the stage and opened her legendary pipes, she had lost  
all fear and negativity, and was ready to love her audience, to share  
her gifts, and to connect.  
Maybe mantras aren’t your thing and you prefer to don your  
headphones and block out the world around you. Many storytell-  
ers will listen to a track of music to set their mood.  
DANUSIA TREVINO, MOTH STORYTELLER\: The day of the show, I  
usually need a lot of quiet time by myself. I listen to music, often  
Bach, to take down any defenses. Once I get to the theater, I find 236 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
myself needing to listen to something that would open me up  
further and bring joy to me. For some reason a song by Arcade  
Fire, “The Suburbs,” has become my go-to. I put my earphones  
on and dance to it about fifteen minutes before I tell my story.  
Not only does it take the nervousness out, but it also makes me  
feel so happy to be alive.  
PETER AGUERO, MOTH HOST AND STORYTELLER\: While dressing for  
the show, I always try to listen to “That Old Black Hole” by Dr.  
Dog. I’m usually dressed by the time I hit the line “Who am I to  
tell the truth? I don’t even know what it is. I don’t know how to  
say it, but I know that I can show you.” That whole passage pretty  
well sums up my intent for the evening.  
When in doubt, do a power pose\: hands on hips, feet apart, and  
chin in the air. It’s a little trick to make you feel invincible.

ONSTAGE NERVES  
Sometimes when that adrenaline kicks in on stage, your nerves  
take over. Your body defies you, and no amount of power posing  
or positive affirmations will control it. Here are some tips to keep  
in mind\:  
\* NOONE KNOWS IF YOU MESSED UP. Remember, as youre telling  
your story, the audience will have no idea where you're head-  
ing. Only you will know if your story is progressing in the way  
you prepared it. Don’t be worried if you reorder things or have  
amomentary blank. Just think\: What happened next? Storytelling  
is a journey for you and for the audience.  
HAVE WATER ON HAND FORA MOUTH OF SAND. It’s surprising how  
quickly someone’s mouth can go dry when they’re nervous.  
Sometimes it can get so dry that they have trouble speaking.  
Water is your friend. Set it discreetly somewhere close where  
you can grab it. Your audience will far prefer you pausing for a ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE 237  
sip rather than muscling through with cotton mouth.  
GIVE YOURSELF A HELPING HAND. We get asked a lot, ““What  
should I do with my hands?” The standing mic centers and  
grounds the teller on the stage. If you don’t have a mic, find  
another way to feel grounded\: Plant your feet, stand up straight.  
Do what feels natural to you. If you tend to talk with your  
hands, that’s fine! But fidgeting can be distracting. And no need  
to cross your arms for protection—you're among friends.  
Whatever you do, please don’t put your hands deep in your  
pockets and jingle your spare change around. The microphone  
picks that up . . . we learned the hard way.  
BRACE YOURSELF. When taking the stage in front of a packed  
house, the lights are usually so bright you can only see a row or  
two of faces in the front. Usually in the first few minutes of  
telling your story, the silence of the audience intently listening  
is loud. But the first time you hear the audience respond with  
a laugh or gasp, you'll be reminded that youre standing in front  
of upward of a thousand people, and it can throw you off. You  
might suddenly become distracted by your nerves all over again  
and risk losing your train of thought. Even if your audience is  
small, the first time you hear them respond can be a little sur-  
prising, but try to stay focused, breathe through it, and push on!  
IT’S OKAY IF YOU SHAKE, RATTLE, AND ROLL. Sometimes a  
storyteller is visibly shaking—hands trembling, knees knock-  
ing. We’ve seen some of the most confident people, some who  
have done downright heroic things, appear terrified on stage  
when they begin their story. But when they get going, and  
often when they hear the first response from the audience, they  
settle in and the nerves calm. Sometimes a storyteller will sim-  
ply call attention to it. They will quite literally say, “Wow, my  
hands are shaking” or even just “I’m a little nervous.” When  
storytellers do this, the audience will often give them a little  
cheer or break into encouraging applause and remind them  
that they are on their side. Just the thing the teller needs to  
keep going! 238 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
NERVES IN A BUSINESS PRESENTATION\: If you're in a professional  
situation where you’re not comfortable drawing attention to your  
nerves—say you’re using a story to open a pitch for new business or a  
board presentation—you'll want to eliminate the chances that they’ll  
become obvious. If you have notes, read them from a screen, since paper  
notes in your hand might shake with you. If you feel your voice trembling,  
pause and take a deep breath before you speak again. You may not be  
able to outwardly acknowledge your nerves, but a moment of silence can  
steady you. If you’re worried about your knees shaking, especially if you'll  
be ona raised stage where your knees are at your audience’s eye level,  
fashion can be your friend! Cover those knees and wear something loose.  
DYLAN PARK, MOTH STORYTELLER\: When I stepped onto the stage  
to share my story for the first time in front of 1,200 people at  
Lincoln Center in New York, my mouth was bone-dry, and I  
remember gripping a water bottle so tightly that it could’ve burst.  
In the dozen or so Moth Mainstage shows I did all over the coun-  
try following that night, I always carried a bottle of water with me  
onto the stage. If 1 was ever feeling overwhelmed or too emo-  
tional, taking a quick sip was a good way to reset myself.  
Catherine has her own preshow ritual. She goes to each sto-  
ryteller she’s directed and reminds them that they have worked  
hard. They know their story inside and out. It’s their story. They  
can’t get the lines wrong. In fact, there isno wrong. All they need  
to do now is to please have fun on stage.  
We know this may sound obvious, but sometimes storytellers  
get so nervous they forget to enjoy the experience. This saddens  
us. We promise, the first minute of telling your story is usually  
the scariest, but once you get a few lines in, you will feel the  
audience is with you. ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE 239  
PHYLLIS BOWDWIN, MOTH STORYTELLER\: When | step out on that  
stage, facing an audience of ten or ten thousand, stage fright and  
nervousness fade away, because I have what I need\: I have my  
truth. I let go, lose myself, open my mouth, and let my story flow.  
And remember, most audiences will be on your side. People  
want to see other people do well! And we may be biased, but we  
believe Moth audiences are the best in the world! We hear this  
again and again from ourstorytellers.  
BLISS BROYARD, MOTH STORYTELLER\: When I’m ata show listening  
to a Moth story, I always get the feeling that my fellow audience  
members and I are holding hands underneath the table—all of us  
collectively invested in the teller’s fate.  
KATE ON NERVES BEFORE A BUSINESS PRESENTATION\: A lot of the  
time when | give a keynote or business presentation, | am part of a highly  
produced series of events that have been planned down to the minute.  
I'll take the stage after a PowerPoint on Q3 earnings and before a depart-  
menta! awards ceremony. The production team will have my slides  
loaded and strap a mic to me way too early sol can spend thirty minutes  
hoping no oneis listening to my heart beat. When they count down to me  
onstage, there is no turning back. What helps me is to remember that the  
presentation is finite. | will goon stage, and even if it raises the roof, there  
are three presentations scheduled after mine. Sol remind myself thatit’s  
thirty or forty minutes, and whatever happens, |’II most likely walk off of  
the stage alive. How lucky am |? It keeps the stakes in perspective and  
helps me show up as my best self. 240 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
EMOTION ON STAGE  
If your story deals with anything emotional, chances are you will  
feel it when you share it with other people in a way you didn’t  
when you practiced by yourself. Your voice may get wobbly, and  
tears might appear. That’s not a bad thing. You want to be present  
and feeling the emotions around the events that you're sharing!  
There have been so many occasions when we have seen a  
storyteller share their story and suddenly become overwhelmed  
by the very emotion they're describing. They have told their story  
to us, one-on-one, multiple times without incident. But there is  
something about being vulnerable in front of other people, being  
heard and feeling the connection, that brings the emotion out.  
You might feel out of control and exposed, but the most commu-  
nal moments in stories can come from this space.  
TIG NOTARO, MOTH STORYTELLER\: My story for The Moth ended  
up making me cry. And it’s so funny to me that I found myself that  
touching that I made myself cry. The story was very fresh and hard  
for me to tell, and so it was very emotional. And that’s very dif-  
ferent from my comedy. I had never done that before, gotten on  
stage and just said, “Here’s a story to tell.’ And it wasn’t really  
funny . . . but I enjoyed it. I liked the feeling of the pressure being  
off to be hilarious through the whole thing. There were natural  
moments and beats where I got laughs and I just rested in Okay,  
well, they’re just listening to this part. And then there were about two  
or three times where I almost started crying. So it was uncom-  
fortable, in that I had a little bit of stress, where I didn’t want to  
have a breakdown. And I remember Sarah telling me, “It’s okay.  
It’s a safe place if you want to cry.” And I was saying, “I believe  
you, but I really don’t want to start crying.” And then it was  
making me laugh to think\: What if I really abused that and sat  
down and had a cry on the stage that night, to where everyone  
was so uncomfortable and didn’t know when to interrupt and be  
like, “Okay, that’s enough crying.” ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE 241  
So many times a storyteller has said, “The last thing I want to  
do is cry.” If you do feel your emotions creeping in—you’re get-  
ting choked up or your eyes fill with tears—fighting the emotion  
will only make it worse. It’s important that you remember to  
breathe! If you try to push those emotions down, you will get more  
choked up. Just take a breath, feel the emotion—and then, once  
you're ready, carry on.  
People are often afraid to show their emotions, but these feel-  
ings signal exactly what is important to you. Your audience will  
lean in, not judge you. They will understand that this story mat-  
ters to you. There is beauty in the emotion!  
WHO IS YOUR AUDIENCE?  
The audience plays an important role in the art of storytelling. It’s  
a conversation, a give-and-take. You, the teller, feed off the  
energy of the audience as they \[insert reactions here\]. This rela-  
tionship between the teller and audience is a crucial part. It’s less  
in your control than other elements of storytelling, but aspects of  
this relationship are still important for you to consider. Some  
audiences may have a similar common denominator, like a room  
full of pediatricians at a medical convention, a Pride Club gath-  
ering ona college campus, ora table of dinner guests at a political  
fundraiser. Some audiences may be more diverse in identity and  
experience—and there may be instances where you'll be sur-  
prised by who is sitting in those seats in front of you. You may not  
know what part of your experience overlaps with theirs or if this  
is something they’re hearing about for the first time.  
There is power in telling your story to those who can relate  
wholly; there is power in telling your story to those who cannot  
relate; and there is ultimate power in choosing which story to tell  
to whom.  
In 2015, we produced a private show in which three  
Dominican Sisters shared their stories with their community. 242 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Despite the common Catholic faith of everyone in the room, this  
event did not feel like Mass. In fact, the tellers volleyed with the  
audience, gasping and laughing together at familiar details. One  
teller, Sister Mary Navarre, surprised herself by adding a sponta-  
neous line. She remembers, “When the audience began to laugh  
and clap and join in, I knew it was going to be okay. I felt free to  
improvise, which led me, in the middle of my story, to make the  
rather shocking remark \(for a sister\)\: “Can I say pissed?’ That  
remark has been quoted and making the rounds ever since.” Later,  
while describing the lessons she learned in Catholic school, she  
asked the question, “Why did God make you?” As she continued,  
the audience called out, “To know, love, and serve Him in this  
world,” in the way that someone else might sing out lyrics at  
Madison Square Garden. By the end of the evening, the room was  
electric; hundreds of people with a shared faith were hooting and  
stomping their feet in community.  
If your audience doesn’t have a similar background or voca-  
tion, you may have to add context to avoid possible confusion.  
Before you take the stage, you will want to consider whether the  
audience is familiar with elements of your story. Are there  
important details you need to provide? Words you need to define?  
Geography we need to orient ourselves?  
If you're a scientist speaking to a group of residents at a town  
hall, you will lose the technical lingo in order to make your story  
more accessible to the nonscientists in the room. Ifyou know that  
the majority of the people might not relate to your particular  
experience, you might acknowledge that by adding in a bit more  
context in order to draw them in closer. If you’re from New  
Orleans and your grandfather had a jazz funeral, you might need  
to give more detail for people who aren’t familiar with life in the  
Big Easy.  
Being aware of what your audience needs to “technically”  
know is different from what ideologies or experiences your audi-  
ence brings into the room. Sharing a story with people whose  
lives you presume have been different from your own can be ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE 243  
exciting—but in some cases can feel daunting. It does not come  
without risk. -  
DAME WILBURN, MOTH HOST AND STORYTELLER\: If you re lucky, you  
will have the chance to speak to an audience that is not in your  
comfort zone. We all like to talk about how humans are one big  
family, but, like most families, we don’t always get along.  
\) In 2018, The Moth asked me to host a show at the National  
Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada. As a Black woman  
from Detroit, this did not seem a natural fit. The out-of-town  
storytellers agreed with me.  
Now, the sight of hundreds of pickup trucks in a theater park-  
ing lot may be normal for a lot of folks, but for those of us with  
darker skin and/or immigration-status issues, it was a reminder of  
how out of place we felt, so far away from home, surrounded by  
people who seem so different. Nestor Gomez shared that he was  
fearful that his story would not be received well once they realized  
it was about crossing the border undocumented. This feeling of  
being outsiders was amplified when a local photographer touched  
our First Nations storyteller Bobby Wilson’s braid. I watched  
Bobby’s eyes widen, and then he calmed. It was clear no harm was  
meant; the slight was more a lack of awareness than malice.  
The Cowboy Poetry Gathering is famous, and one of the  
most well-known poets was doing a reading at the same time as  
our show. We all figured that our audience would be small. But  
when I walked on stage, the house was packed and the applause  
was thunderous. In an instant, the doubts went away. I started  
with my greetings, and we got going.  
Nestor drew the audience in as he shared his memories of  
crossing the border into the United States.  
T heard a noise far in the distance. At first I thought, Oh,, it’s gonna rain,  
it’s probably thunder, but then I realized that it wasn’t thunder; those  
were helicopters. I was only fifteen years old, and I had never seen heli-  
copters in my life before, so got really excited, and I started to try to look 244 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
at the helicopters, and the coyote grabbed me and threw me on the ground  
and told me, “This is no time for sightseeing.”  
—Nestor Gomez, “Undocumented Journey”  
Ata time when we felt the nation being torn apart with issues  
around immigration, the room was silent. It was a story of love  
and courage and terror. After he was done, the applause was some  
of the loudest of the night. No one seemed to be mad or ready to  
turn him in; they listened. It was a reminder of what The Moth  
means. It is an opportunity for us to prove that we are one family.  
That we can and must sit in a dark and quiet room—a boardroom,  
a living room, any room we can get to—and listen to each other's  
stories. That wasn’t the first time I was uncomfortable, and the  
Lord willing, it won't be the last.  
NESTOR GOMEZ\: I half expected them to start booing once they  
realized that my story was about crossing the border undocu-  
mented. But in spite of my fear, I knew that I had to share my  
story, and help give voice to those that face the same undocu-  
mented issues that I did.  
An invitation to share a story with a group whose experience  
varies greatly from your own can bring a different set of pressures  
and considerations. The responsibility of being the only person  
representing a community or culture can feel overwhelming.  
You might find yourself questioning the intent of the group invit-  
ing you to speak. Will they hear the story you are trying to tell,  
or will it instead feed a narrative they are looking to perpetuate?  
When Frimet Goldberger worked on her story “My Knight  
in Shining Sidecurls,” about leaving her Hasidic community, she  
was conscious that it could be used against a group of people who  
were already the subject of criticism and attack. It was important  
for her to be respectful. She didn’t intend her story to be an indict-  
ment; it was more of an exploration of her own experience of ALL THE WORLD'S ASTAGE 245  
leaving the only way of life she had ever known. While her life-  
style and the way she practiced her faith had changed, her love and  
respect for her family and community had not.  
FRIMET GOLDBERGER\: Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, the  
famous twentieth-century rabbi, philosopher, and theologian  
who marched from Selma to Alabama with Martin Luther King,  
Jr., once said, “Wise criticism begins with self-criticism.” At this  
point in my journey, I ask myself\: What am I accomplishing by  
telling this story, and whom am I hurting in the process of this  
telling? If the answer is not immediately clear, I will sit on it.  
When I drafted my story, I did so knowing that my family mem-  
bers wouldn’t be in the audience, but that nagging voice that they  
might someday hear it after it’s aired still gnawed at me—and to  
this day! And maybe it’s my own self-doubt, or perhaps I am  
conscientious of the pain my story could inadvertently inflict on  
others, namely a community that is already heavily marginalized.  
Of course, that does not negate the realities of the grimy under-  
belly within, but I always wonder whether people are capable of  
holding conflicting truths and understanding nuance. As I grow  
up and start ticking off the awkward thirty-five-to-forty-four  
age-group box, I realize that no society is immune to problems—  
that in leaving the community, which I had to and don’t regret, I  
traded one set of problems for another. My sisters are happier than  
Iam in a life I could not live. So where does that leave my story?  
In an uncomfortable space of multiple, conflicting realities.  
Frimet carefully considered the details that were most import-  
ant to her story, while respecting the many truths that lived  
in tandem, and consciously sidestepped details she felt could  
feed stereotypes.  
Sometimes a storyteller will take the stage and be surprised, or  
even caught off guard, by who is in the audience—but you may  
intentionally choose to take on the challenge of sharing a story with  
an audience whose experience might not’overlap with yours. 246 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
SUZANNE RUST, MOTH SENIOR CURATORIAL PRODUCER\: Damon  
Young, an African American writer, shared a very complex,  
multilayered story about race and the power of the N-word on  
stage at The Moth. And while I hate to spoil the ending for those  
who haven’t heard it, his story brings up so many important issues  
for us all to reflect on.  
Damon had grown up hearing stories about family and  
friends getting into fights with someone who had called them the  
N-word. The teller always came out as the conquering hero with  
a wild tale to tell, a sort of rite of passage. Damon himself wanted  
such an “honor.” He wanted that cred, but it never came. No one  
ever called him the word.  
Eventually, while he’s still a young man, he gets his wish.  
While he’s standing waiting at a bus stop, a guy in a pickup truck  
leans out of the window, hurls the word at him, and then drives  
off, leaving Damon without his moment of victory, without the  
fight, without a story. Damon is stunned. Suddenly, he breaks out  
into an ugly laugh and has an epiphany.  
I just realized how ridiculous it had been for me to want this to  
happen, to want this terrible, awful thing to happen, and to assign  
any level of my racial identity or my Blackness to how white people  
treated me. And that’s the last time I did it.  
As curator, I had reached out to Damon to see if he wanted to  
tell a story. When he came back with the idea for this story, I’m  
not going to lie . . . as an African American woman who has a  
deep problem with the word, I was a little shaken up. I loved the  
story, but should we do this? Several discussions took place in the  
office, and feelings were mixed among staffers of all races. Several  
of my colleagues shared my fear, not so much because of the story  
itself, but because it would be told to a primarily white audience.  
We worried that this intricate and powerful story would fall on  
ears that would have difficulty navigating and appreciating it. But  
Damon’ story speaks truth about race, identity, and power in this ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE 247  
country. It felt like the right story to tell for our times, and  
Damon was convinced that this was the story he wanted to tell.  
He told us\:  
This story was the center of my book What Doesn’t Kill You  
Makes You Blacker because it is an irreverent, uncomfortable,  
transparent, and \(occasionally\) hilarious dive into some of the  
genuine absurdities of existing while Black in America. Part of  
this story’s draw to me is the uniqueness of it and the anxiety I  
had—and still have—in sharing it. These are the same rationales  
that went into me choosing this for The Moth. Also, I knew that  
sharing this in front of a predominantly white crowd of hundreds  
would be uncomfortable for me too, so this became a bit of a per-  
sonal challenge to see if I could pull it off and hit each of the notes  
the way I wished to.  
The night of the show, when Damon shared his story  
“Fighting Words,’ as he guessed, the audience was primarily  
white. As I sat there with them, I could sense that many people  
weren't sure how to react. There was some awkward laughter,  
people shifting in their seats, and I wished that in the crowd there  
had been more people who could have personally related to  
Damon’s story—he would have gotten a much different reaction.  
CJ Hunt, our host that night, was able to give Damon’s story  
the supportive landing that it deserved.  
I feel so seen by that story. I've waited my whole life to be called  
the same. I just loved your story. The way you capture the absur-  
dity of having violence be part of your identity and a rite of  
passage, I think is resonant to anyone who is Black. And, I  
imagine, partly resonant to any of those who have an oppressed  
identity, this wild way where you need a confrontation to see  
yourself. And L also love the story because it makes me think about  
a theme that has been running through the stories tonight about  
what it means to know who you are without depending on seeing 248 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
a reflection of yourself in other people. \[just want to say thank you  
again. That’\: all.  
I was grateful for CJ that night. Stories are universal. Everyone  
can benefit from hearing a good story and perhaps learn some-  
thing from it, but learning isn’t the same as relating. Stories like  
Damon’s, and many others we have shared on Moth stages, can  
land very differently on the ears of a white person versus a Black  
or brown person. This is also true for stories from Asian, Latinx,  
Indigenous, or LGBTQ people or tellers with disabilities. It’s  
great to share and enlighten others, but it’s both comforting and  
empowering to see some people in the crowd who are nodding  
their heads in agreement, laughing in the right spots, and mouth-  
ing the word, “Yes!”  
Regardless of whether people relate fully or not at all, they  
bring their own opinions, interpretations, and explanations to a  
story. People hear stories through the lens of their own experi-  
ence. And no matter how much you practice or how clearly a  
detail is explained, you will come across people who will infer  
something counter to what you meant.  
On many stages around the United States, Samuel James  
shared his story “The Little Pink General Lee,” which is about  
coming to understand his white maternal grandmother’s rela-  
tionship to both him and his father. In the story, he said\:  
She was a loving grandmother, there was no doubt about that. It’s  
absolutely true. But she was also a cruel person who would manip-  
ulate her own grandchild in order to make his father suffer for their  
race. Both things are true.  
After one show, several people came up to him to say how  
his experience mirrored theirs, but after another show months  
later, several people came up to him and said how great it was  
he had forgiven his grandmother. Nowhere in the story had ALL THE WORLD’S A STAGE 249  
he said this—this idea had been projected onto his story by  
the audience.  
SAMUEL JAMES, MOTH STORYTELLER\: Most storytellers don’t think  
of their stories as works of art. But they are. And like any form of  
art, once you put it out there, it’s the audience’s to interpret. Some  
people will relate, and some people will hear something they may  
\_not have considered before. But there are some people who won't  
get it. People said they loved my story, but they didn’t always hear  
it. There is nothing I can do, but I keep telling it and concentrate  
on the people who do relate.  
People might not fully relate to or interpret a story the way it  
was intended the first time they hear it, but stories live on. Certain  
elements of a story might stick with a listener. They might find  
themselves understanding a story differently after experiencing  
or witnessing some new event. It might even inspire them to  
listen again. The potential impact of a story is not limited to the  
moment it is told; it is long-term.  
Tell your true story where and when you are comfortable. Our  
only note\: It is a disservice to yourself to change your story \(and  
your lived experience\) based on what you think the audience  
wants to hear. An honest story told to a group of people who have  
not lived through the same experience can create a lasting ripple  
effect. Discomfort is a catalyst for change—but you decide which  
spaces are right for you. One person’s no-fly zone is another per-  
son’s empowerment. 250 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
DIRECTOR’S NOTES  
The first minute of telling your story is usually the scariest, but once you  
settle in and feel the audience, it will get easier.  
Nerves are normal and expected. It’s how you manage them that  
counts!  
e Findawayto pump yourself up or calm yourself down, whether it’s  
quiet affirmations and a cup of tea or blasting ABBA in your head-  
phones before the big moment. Whatever works for you!  
e Before you begin, find a way to ground yourself. Plant your feet,  
stand up straight, take a deep breath. Don’t rush to the start; it will  
throw you off balance!  
¢ Don’t be afraid if your nerves show—they only mean you care.  
e Acknowledging your nerves to the audience is okay—it will only  
endear you to them. Trust and know that people want to hear from  
you, because who’s better than you?  
e Water is your friend—have it handy. There is nothing worse than  
suffering through a dry mouth, for both you and your listeners!  
If your story deals with an emotional subject, you will likely feel the  
emotion the first time you tell it to other people. Running your story with  
someone beforehand will show you where the emotions might creep in  
so they don’t catch you by surprise. If you need to, stop, take a breath,  
and feel the emotion. Don’t try to hold it back—you will only get more  
choked up.  
Consider whether there are elements of your story that might need  
more context so your listener can understand and follow along.  
Technical, experiential, and cultural details may need more explana-  
tion, depending on whom you're addressing.  
Honor your lived experience and never base your story on what you  
think an audience wants to hear. Remember that where and when you  
tell your story is entirely up to you. ee a ee aS Oe Me eRe SAAR OLS ee bey Riv.ip! we \(Sy Bla BLK aK, wi ie.@ elle Ke Wie.e aches ce

HERPPEE EFFECT  
Stories weave us together as human beings. And yes, they can be a tool of  
power. True power. That’s why it’s more important than ever to hear more  
stories from more kinds of people, especially those who have been and are  
usually silenced.  
—CARMEN RITA WONG, MOTH STORYTELLER  
Once you've developed a story, what can you do with it? As events  
unfold in our daily lives, much is out of our control, but in pro-  
cessing and telling our stories, we are powerful decision makers.  
The act of telling a story can feel triumphant. Sharing a story of  
celebration in which the problem is solved, the home team wins,  
and your mom says you can keep the dog, can be as much fun for  
you, the teller, as it is for the listener. But even a story where you  
get kicked in the teeth, dumped, or duped feels better when  
you're in charge of the telling. Hindsight, oversight, and com-  
mand of the situation means it has all been processed, digested,  
and reconstituted. Owning it feels good. But stories are meant to  
be shared and can also bring about significant change in those  
who listen. 256 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
STORIES IN SCHOOL  
Adolescence is unforgettable, whether you loved it \(some people\)  
or found it excruciatingly awkward \(most people\). Our teenage  
years are some of the most transformational in life\: so many firsts!  
Consider how your life would be different if you had shared stories  
with fellow students in your high school. If you'd had the courage  
to talk about the things that really mattered to you. Imagine if  
teachers had more of an opportunity to listen to students’ stories,  
or share their own.  
For decades, The Moth has worked with high school students  
and educators to provide space for young people’s voices and use  
storytelling workshops in schools to build community.  
One spring afternoon, high school students who had been  
participating for weeks in a Moth workshop at the Beacon School  
prepared to tell their stories on stage in the school’s black box  
theater. Aleeza Kazmi was nervous as she watched the room fill  
with an audience of her peers. The crowd was restless; students  
were whispering in the back. She stepped out on stage and began  
her story with a memory from elementary school, when the stu-  
dents were asked to draw a self-portrait to be hung on the  
classroom wall.  
I started drawing so slowly, going around my lips and my eyes, and was  
coloring in all one direction. And I was watching as the oil pastel melted  
into the paper and my face came alive, and I colored inside of the lines.  
And when I looked down, it was like I was looking into a mirror. This  
girl Thad just drawn is exactly how I see myself. And Lfelt my teacher over  
my shoulder. She loved it when people drew well, and so I was getting  
ready for her to praise me, to say, “Aleeza, that is the most beautiful  
self-portrait I have ever seen. I’m gonna hang it above my desk so everyone  
who comes in can see it.” And instead, the teacher says, “Aleeza, that’s  
not your color.” And I’m confused by this, because I don’t understand how  
colors can belong to people. But before I can find a way to ask her, she’s  
gone to the oil pastel box and started looking for it. And she doesn’t find THE RIPRBLE EPFEC TS 257  
the color that she’s looking for, and so she goes to the crayon bin. Now,  
every school had this infamous crayon bin that had bits and pieces of  
wrapped-up and gross crayons that had been rolling around forever. My  
teacher is rummaging through it, and she reaches in and she pulls out this  
little nub of a brown crayon. And she hands it to me. And I’m still really  
confused by all of this, but I noticed my friends are staring at me and my  
heart is beating really fast, and I want this to be over.  
Aleeza goes on to explain how this memory stayed with her  
and the question of identity lingered with her throughout ele-  
mentary and into middle school. After she told her story, she said  
she was able to forget about the audience \(because the lights were  
so bright she couldn’t see them from stage!\) and just shared the  
story from her heart.  
On the first day of sixth grade, this one kid comes up to me and says,  
“What race are you?” And I had never been blatantly asked this question  
before, and so I didn’t have a prepared answer. I thought back to that  
teacher and that brown crayon, so I told him, “I’m brown.” And he gets  
this confused look on his face and he says, “What do you mean you’re  
brown? Brown isn’t a race.” And I couldn’t believe it. I couldn’t believe  
that \[had finally said, “I’m brown,” and it still wasn’t enough. And then  
the little six-year-old girl deep inside of me gets really angry. And I said,  
“You know what? If I say I’m brown, then that’s it. I'm brown.”  
At this point, the room was quiet and she closed with\:  
And today, if you ask me to draw a self-portrait, I'd draw a confident  
young woman who’s proud of her Afghan and Pakistani heritage, who is  
a proud American. And I would find the most beautiful, soft oil pastel to  
color in my face. No one would have to tell me to pick it up, and it would  
be my first choice.  
After five minutes, it was over. Aleeza told us she felt a rush of  
adrenaline from being vulnerable in that way on stage. A few 258 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
weeks after the show, a student she did not know well approached  
her on her way to class. Aleeza told us\:  
She was one of the few other brown kids in my school. She told  
me that she saw the show and loved my story, and felt really  
connected to it. I realized that even though I couldn’t see the  
audience, they could see me. Like, really see me. And for the first  
time, I understood the true impact that sharing our stories can  
have\: It can bring people together and make them feel truly seen.  
It is rare in life—but particularly in the life of a young per-  
son—to be listened to uninterrupted for five minutes. By sharing  
a personal story, students claim their agency. They share these  
lived experiences themselves without interference. The result?  
Young people tell us they have greater confidence, greater con-  
trol, and a richer sense of belonging.  
What happens to adults when they stop and listen to young  
people—and vice versa? Sharing stories between teachers and  
students breaks down barriers, invites a greater understanding,  
and dismantles the hierarchy. Educators who “walk the walk” as  
storytellers experience the vulnerability of sharing a story.  
Oftentimes they’ ll tell stories from when they were a young per-  
son; it’s a chance to just remember what it’s like to be in the shoes  
of their students.  
Telling a story gives teachers a deeper sense of what they’re  
asking of their students. One teacher told us how frustrated she  
gets with her high schoolers when they say, “I don’t have anything  
to write about!” But when it came time to brainstorm ideas for  
her own story, she had the same experience. The process gave her  
a better understanding and empathy for her students.  
Neema Avashia, an educator and Moth alumna, has been a  
civics \(citizenship\) teacher in Boston for years. At The Moth,  
Neema crafted a story about the senseless death of Angel, one of  
her beloved students, who happened to be a graffiti artist. In the  
story, she and two of her former students register their sorrow in THE RIPPLE EFFECT 259  
what Neema calls “the ultimate act of grievance”—they graffiti  
the side ofa building together, with a tag in Angel’s honor.  
One of my students says, “I’ve been carrying this can of spray paint  
around all week. I don’t know what to do.” I say, “I think Iknow. I think  
we need to go tag something.” I’m not just a civics teacher during the day,  
I'm a civics geek at night. My students know I don’t drive more than five  
miles above the speed limit. I just am pretty square. So this student is like,  
“You're a civics teacher. You’re not supposed t6 do this.” What they didn’t  
know is that for the previous eight months, I had been trying to meet with  
city leaders, with the superintendent, with street workers, with anyone I  
could get to listen to the fact that in Boston last year, sixteen young people  
under the age of nineteen were killed. And of those, four were my students.  
I was doing all of this advocacy, and it wasn’t doing anything, and it also  
wasn’t helping me. I didn’t come away feeling better. Then there was this  
spray can. I was like, “Well, nothing else has worked. Being a civics  
teacher and using those strategies hasn’t accomplished anything.” So we  
went behind the school, and we basically took turns tagging. In Boston,  
when young people are killed, their friends in the community create a  
hashtag. So we tagged \#Angel’s World and the students said, “Angel  
would f\*\*\*ing love this.” And then, “Oh, sorry, actually, I forgot that  
you were my teacher for a second.” And right then, that hierarchy between  
teacher and student, it just flattened, and we were just mourning, and we  
were trying to figure out how to connect with Angel, and how to connect  
with each other. So we took our pictures, some with me in them, some  
without me in them, and I said, “You better not post pictures with me in  
them. That could get me fired.” Because at the end of the day, I’m still  
their civics teacher,  
We grow up being told who we are. In school, we are taught  
how to communicate, and we worry about “right” and “wrong”  
answers. When young people are invited to work on their per-  
sonal stories, they are in charge; they decide what stories they  
want to tell, how they want to tell them, and ifthey want to share  
them with an audience. 260 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Often when we ask young people to share their stories, we  
hear\: “But nothing has happened to me!” That doubt is com-  
pounded when the teller has been habitually dismissed because of  
their age. Ifit matters to you, it will matter to your audience. We  
will care if you care. You can tell a story about anything, in your  
own voice and with your style of expression. That permission can  
be very freeing.  
A FEW EXERCISES TO USE IN THE CLASSROOM \(WITH STUDENTS OF ANY  
AGE!\)\:  
° “IUSEDTO\_\_——s—SC BUTNOWI\_\_\_\_ Cw” Taka few  
minutes to brainstorm one-sentence stories that tell us one  
way you are different now from who you once were. Any  
change will do! Big or small.  
\* “THE OBJECT EXERCISE” is a take on show-and-tell. Think of  
an object that has meaning for you. Tell us what the object  
is, how it came into your life, and why it is important to  
you. What would it mean if you lost it? This is always a rich  
brainstorm that helps us talk about stakes.  
\* “LIFEWEB” is a way to generate story seeds quickly. Write  
your name in the middle of a piece of paper, then draw  
spokes extending from it. On each spoke, write something  
that’s important to you\: people, places, activities, and so on.  
What is a moment or memory that comes up when you  
think about a person/place/thing that is important to you?  
Use these ideas to inspire your story.  
ANOTETO PARENTS\: Try pulling these out during your next long  
drive. Maybe start with one of your own to break the ice, and  
your kids might follow suit.  
The Moth’s high school curriculum—a resource for brain-  
storming and story crafting—is available for free online, for  
educators around the world. THE RIPPLE EFFECT 261  
STORIES AT WORK  
Sometimes a quick catch-up by the copier can be a breath of fresh  
air between spreadsheets. But beyond our human need to social-  
ize or shake out the sales data, stories have a practical impact at  
work too. They bring meaning to the transactional and amplify  
culture, tying employees back to each other and their work.  
Storytelling is an empathetic communication tool that can elevate  
the effect that organizations have internally and in the world.  
BRING YOUR “\{” TO T-E-A-M  
For years, the notion of “team-building” at work was often met  
with eye rolls. Please, not another trust fall/ropes course/corn maze.  
However, data proves that organizations are better when their  
people feel connected to each other. According to Forbes maga-  
zine, “teams who score in the top 20 percent in engagement  
realize a 41 percent reduction in absenteeism, and 59 percent less  
turnover. Engaged employees show up every day with passion,  
purpose, presence, and energy.”  
Most organizations are not set up for focused listening. They  
prioritize efficiency, multitasking, and results. Personal storytell-  
ing gives colleagues a way out of the superficial interactions that  
can happen during the awkward wait for the microwave.  
Some people know very little about the co-workers they reg-  
ularly pass in the hallway. You can rightfully assume some  
similarities with your colleagues\: similar education in technical  
fields, similar politics in a social justice nonprofit. And maybe you  
noted that their Google profile photo is a cat in a dress.  
Creating a space for individuals to share their personal stories  
and respond to their colleagues’ can transform the internal  
dynamic of your organization. And because it requires vulnera-  
bility and some time, it’s likely that it won’t happen without  
intentionally making the space for it.  
In our MothWorks program, where we lead workshops and 262 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
host private events in business settings, the pressure is high for  
participants. They are being asked, for their job, to be vulnerable  
in front of their boss or their boss’s boss, with the knowledge that  
they will immediately be given notes by a stranger from a non-  
profit arts organization whose logo is a bug. Very often this means  
that the first-draft stories that we hear are safer—simpler, with  
lower stakes.  
KATE ON LEADING A MOTHWORKS WORKSHOP\: During a session  
with a global communications company, a man stood and told a  
short story about how, at the end of his senior year of college, he  
and his buddies threw all of their mattresses out of their dorm and  
then leaped onto them from the second-story window, scream-  
ing, “I’m alive!” It was clearly a story he'd told at bars a hundred  
times for a few laughs. In the first telling, it seemed like he wanted  
to be the type of guy who would throw furniture and bodies out  
of windows. But in his breakout group, colleagues who had never  
heard this story challenged him to think more deeply about his  
stakes. He landed on this\: The event occurred on the day that his  
friends were getting offer letters for their first jobs. From the day  
that he entered college, he felt like he was out of his league, and  
on this day, he was the only person he knew without a plan for  
after graduation. He felt terrible and worthless. Now “I’m alive!”  
wasn't just about being a goof with senioritis. He was yelling it to  
remind himself that he was, at least, that.  
In one short breakout session, using personal storytelling, his  
colleagues helped him discover a deeper truth about his life, and  
in turn deepened their understanding of the person who they  
interact with every day.  
Stories beget stories. We find that if one person shares a story  
of getting kicked out of the marching band in high school,  
another teller might identify a rebellious thread in their own story.  
Subthemes emerge organically, The energy shifts. THERIPPLE EFFECT» 263  
Stories break us out of our professional identities. After a  
recent workshop at a large tech company, a participant wrote\:  
Six of us all work in different parts of \[the tech company\]—aales,  
customer success, product, engineering, marketing, and data  
science. We would not have known each other, and now, we  
are connected by each other’s defining life moments. I felt seen  
and known, and I feel I see and know my co-workers as beauti-  
ful, unique individuals, rather than “yet another standard  
tech person.”  
AFEW STORYTELLING PROMPTS TO USE AT WORK\: Instead of kicking off  
a meeting by reading the agenda that everyone has in front of  
them, why not start it with a story from a colleague? Give one  
lucky volunteer a prompt \(and a time limit\) to inspire what they’ ll  
share.  
Prompts can tie to...  
¢ The work\: Tell us about a time you realized this work was  
important to you.  
¢ The theme of the meeting \(for example, expanding into  
new markets\)\: Tell us about a time you knew you had to  
leave home.  
¢ Company values \(for example, acting with integrity\)\: Tell  
us about a time you had to stand up for what’s right.  
You'll be surprised at what you'll learn in three minutes, and  
how the mindset of the room can shift and tee up more empa-  
thetic and impactful conversations. Draw from a hat to see who  
goes next!  
BUILDING AN INTERNAL CULTURE  
We were invited to host a workshop to celebrate a software com-  
pany’s Great Manager Award recipients. One participant,  
Alexandra K., shared a story that was surprisingly vulnerable. She 264 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
told us that a few years earlier, her team had issued a complaint  
about her management style. Confronted by this, she was deeply  
ashamed. Fortunately, her manager didn’t “write her off,” and she  
enrolled in a comprehensive 360 review process to get to the  
bottom of what was going on and fix it properly. That, in part,  
was why being acknowledged as a great manager meant so much  
to her now. Alexandra said\:  
It was hard to share this story, making eye contact with leaders  
across my business who I respect and who I have worked closely  
with, and just hoping knowing this about me isn’t going to  
change things. But then toward the end, when I could see peo-  
ple’s reactions and feel the release of all the pressure, it was actually  
empowering to own the story.  
After the workshop, she was inspired to keep sharing it\:  
I’ve actually found myself revisiting it with my team, especially as  
we come up on reviews and promotion cycles or career-growth  
conversations. It just reminds us that we're all human beings. And  
I think it’s helped them really appreciate when I say, ‘I’m here for  
you’ or “This didn’t go as we planned, and that’s okay. Let’s not  
dwell on what we could have done differently. Let’s talk about  
what we're going to do next time. It’s not just lip service, because  
there’s a whole personal narrative behind that, that they have lived  
with me and that they have seen play out positively for me.  
But her story didn’t stop there. She says\:  
When I think about my impact on company culture, I think  
about the multiplier effect of story. What I do affects the eleven  
people that report to me, but then it reaches out to their circles—  
the blast radius of this change is powerful.” She shares her story of  
failing forward as part of their new-hire onboarding presentation  
to hundreds of people monthly. “People reach out to me all the THE RIPPLE EFFECT 265  
time saying, “That story was validation that I made the right  
choice to join this company. The culture of our company is why  
people uproot their lives, change industries, leave a fancy title on  
the table. We have to communicate our culture to them on their  
\_first day, and this story does that.  
MAKING DATA IN PRESENTATIONS MEMORABLE  
Recently we had a global media agency approach us after they lost  
a pitch to a competitor. They handed us the deck they used—  
seventy-five pages, mostly data. It was clear that they needed to  
make their information more compelling. We often get calls from  
people who simply cannot live through one more PowerPoint  
dense with data \(“assault by information” is a phrase we hear again  
and again\). Even in the most technical lines of work, every person  
in the room is a human with a heart and mind, and those hearts  
and minds are bored. To be truly called to action—to be swayed  
to sign off on an idea, increase a budget, change the way they do  
their day-to-day—people need to know why they are doing it.  
Sometimes your stories are closer than you think! We worked  
with a tech company who was struggling to tell the story of how  
cutting-edge and sensitive their experiments were. They were so  
proud of their data and they wanted to share all of 1t—which made  
their communication, frankly, tedious. But then, over lunch, one  
of them mentioned that they have to schedule experiments  
around a train station over two miles away, because vibrations  
from the arrivals and departures were picked up by their highly  
sensitive equipment. We all looked at each other and said, “That’s  
it! That’s your story!” That the work they did was so precise that  
a commuter train two miles away would affect their results. Years  
later, we still remember that story; the data was supplemental.  
Cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner is credited with saying,  
“We are twenty-two times more likely to remember a fact when  
it has been wrapped in a story.” 266 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
When using storytelling to communicate data . . .  
\* START THE DATA PRESENTATION WITHA STORY. Open with a story  
to set up the “why” before you share your data findings.  
For example, Moth storyteller Lindiwe Majele Sibanda  
starts her agricultural research presentations with a short  
story of growing up on her grandmother’s farm in  
Zimbabwe and the hope that their harvest would feed the  
whole village.  
\* DROP DATAIN THROUGHOUT ONE LONGER STORY. Use one story  
as the spine of your entire presentation and pause to share  
critical data points. \)  
\* USE A STORY AT ANY POINT WITHIN THE PRESENTATION TO  
ILLUMINATE A CRITICAL DATAPOINT. Your story is a way to pause  
and give space to information that is crucial for your audi-  
ence to understand.  
STORIES WITH FAMILY  
Photographs are moments frozen in time, while stories are living  
and breathing. What if instead of family photo albums, we had  
family story albums? A place where you could hear the stories of  
your ancestors? Which would you rather hold in your lap?  
Through stories, you can conjure facets of your loved ones’ lives,  
their joys, and their sorrows. You probably know a few treasured  
family stories—how your parents met, what everyone did on the  
day you were born—but don’t you wish you knew more? Many  
say that our ancestors’ stories tell us who they are and, by exten-  
sion, who we are.  
A comfortable rhythm can develop with people who are a part  
of your everyday. We assume we know how others feel, or that  
they know how we feel. Stories help you underline the significant  
feelings that can get left unsaid. They’re a chance to stop and say  
it, whatever “it” is. This type of sharing can take an ordinary day  
and make it an occasion. TEERIPPUS EFFECT. 267\:  
Ellie Lee decided to share “A Kind of Wisdom” with her fam-  
ily. It was a story about finally recognizing what her father had  
done for their community in Boston’s Chinatown.  
ELLIE LEE, MOTH STORYTELLER\: When I first played the story for my  
parents, they cried. My dad is not a very emotional person, so it  
was incredible to have that magical moment together. It’s one thing  
to tell someone you love them. It’s another to be able to convey  
that in a story, to express other depths of meaning, emotion, and  
connection. Perhaps he thought all his hard work and sacrifice was  
something he did without much acknowledgment because that’s  
what's expected as a parent. He was really surprised and touched  
that I chose to use the space that The Moth provided me with to  
honor him, and to show the world how much I loved him.  
Stories can also help us connect with a family member who is  
far away.  
CATHERINE\: When I was still a baby, my dad was drafted into the  
Vietnam War. With him away so long, and me so young, he was  
worried that his only child wouldn’t know him when he got  
home. So Mama had an 8 x 11 picture of him printed and framed.  
She sat it on the floor in a corner of the living room, so it’d be at  
eye level for me. Every day she sat me in front of the picture and  
would point at it, and say, “Daddy, daddy, that’s your daddy.” She  
told me stories about him, even though I was too young to  
understand. She realized the talking calmed her down and helped  
her stay connected to him. Her only other contact with him was  
the occasional letter. When Daddy came home, he flew into  
Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. In those days,  
you'd walk down the stairs of the plane right onto the runway,  
and your loved ones could meet you on the tarmac. The way  
Mama tells it, as she approached the plane, she saw my father  
come down the stairs, and I broke away from her and ran toward

ENCOURAGING OLDER GENERATIONS TO SHARE THEIR STORIES  
When storyteller Tomi Reichental’s grandson was studying the  
Holocaust in grade school, he told his teacher that his grandfather  
was a survivor. She in turn invited Tomi to speak to her class. A  
shy man, he never discussed his experience of being a prisoner at  
Bergen-Belsen as a six-year-old boy. The memories were too  
painful. But because he had never really talked to his grandson  
about his experience during the Holocaust, he decided it was  
something he needed to do. After he spoke-to the classroom,  
something shifted in Tomi, and the importance of bearing wit-  
ness became a driving force. In the years since that day in the  
classroom, Tomi has become an active member of the Holocaust  
Education Trust in Ireland, where he lives. He broke his silence  
only after being asked to share his story by his grandson.  
Our loved ones’ stories might hold keys to the past—whether  
they were eyewitnesses to history or they’re the only one who  
really knows why your two great-uncles stopped speaking, set-  
ting off a family feud that has lasted to this day. Perhaps you have  
always wondered why your great-grandmother was so good at  
the tango. Have you asked her? Encouraging loved ones to share  
their stories helps us to know them better, but also allows us to  
keep a piece of them with us after they are gone. What may seem  
mundane to them may be thrilling to you. \(Whaaat, you worked in  
a munitions factory during World War II? You mean like Rosie the  
Riveter??\) Unbeknownst to you, every older person you know has  
had love affairs, work dramas, wild times, and crushing disap-  
pointments they may not have shared with you. Are there stories  
that went over your head at Thanksgiving when you were  
younger that you want to hear again? Now is the time to ask!  
SARAH\: My grandpa Jack was in the throes of dementia when I  
recorded him talking about his life. He had no short-term mem-  
ory left, but with the help of photographs, my grandmother and  
I were shocked and delighted to know that his long-term THE RIPPLE EFFECT 269  
memory was still intact. With each black-and-white photo we  
revealed to him, he was transported. He told us of his lake vaca-  
tions in the summer as an only child; Jerry, his beloved hound and  
companion; and his doting parents. “My father was an insurance  
salesman. He cared so much about his few clients, he kept visiting  
and asking if they were all right and if they needed more insurance.  
They didn’t need more insurance. He needed more clients.” The  
photographs lit up not only detailed memories from the past but  
also his dry sense of humor that we worried had vanished.  
Photos and musical recordings can unlock buried memories  
and long-lost stories for all. They are an easy gateway into the past.  
For those of you who want to give a nudge to the older  
generations \(or even old friends, your sister, that teacher you’ve  
kept in touch with all these years later\), here are some prompts to  
get you going. Grab your phone, a pen, anything you can use to  
record them.  
What is the story that everyone tells about you?  
Which memory still makes you laugh?  
In the movie of your life, what are some scenes that you'll  
never forget?  
Tell us about your first kiss. Your first love? Your first  
heartbreak?  
What is the greatest challenge that you’ve overcome?  
When have you felt certainty in your relationships, a choice  
you've made, or your work?  
Tell me about a moment of regret.  
What were your favorite moments from growing up?  
Do you remember when \_\_\_?  
What is something that you want to be remembered for?  
Tell me about a risk you wish you'd taken.  
What was it like the first time you set foot in the city you  
now call home?  
Tell us about a time you were proud of yourself.  
Tell me about the one who got away. 270 HOW TO TELL A STORY

ATIP ON RECORDING PEOPLE\: Sometimes they get shy when they  
know they are on camera. Recording in audio can be much less  
intimidating than a video camera. Most smartphones now have  
a voice memo setting, or you can point a video camera away and  
Just capture the audio. You may find your loved ones will quickly  
forget about the recorder as you go along!  
IN REMEMBRANCE  
Conjuring memories can feel like tiny visits from the person  
you've lost. Sometimes the process of gathering stories—  
connecting to loved ones and reaching out to those who would  
otherwise be strangers—can add dimension to the person that  
you knew. The stories create a prism that enables you to view  
their life. THERIPPLE EFFECT 271  
MICHELLE JALOWSKI, MOTH DIRECTOR\: When my dad died, I felt  
untethered, like my connection to the world was severed some-  
how. I really wanted to gather my community around me to  
commemorate him in a way that felt both mournful and joyful.  
The problem was, most of my friends didn’t really know my  
dad—he was a pretty insular guy. So I had to think of how to  
celebrate him in a way that was bigger than him—that was about  
him and his place in my life, but also his legacy, that of all fathers,  
and the patrilineal lines that we all descend from.  
On a warm July night, I invited about twenty-five people to  
gather in a corner of my yard. I started with a short eulogy for my  
dad—yjust a few things to get a taste of who he was. He was a  
trendsetter, always on to some new thing way before it was offi-  
cially trendy, like big sunglasses and track suits, and cellphones  
way before they were ubiquitous. He was cool—handsome and  
charming, he was often a favorite at family events. But sometimes  
too cool, and there was definitely some toxic masculinity involved  
in our relationship that had always been difficult to negotiate. But  
I always knew that he loved me. I called him Aba, the Hebrew  
word for dad, and I always knew how much he loved being an  
aba. My sister and I were the most important people to him—we  
know for sure because his passwords to things were often some  
combination of our names. When I was done, I acknowledged  
how hard it can be to honor our fathers—that often, the relation-  
ships are complex. I invited people to share stories about their  
own fathers and what they’ve inherited from them. It was quiet  
for just a moment before the first person spoke. People shared  
beautiful reminiscences about their dads—the love of music and  
appreciation of art that their dad always modeled for them, the  
sense of adventure their father imbued in everything he did. The  
time he flipped off a racist and made a joke, letting my friend  
know that racists deserved the finger and also that it’s okay, and  
often important, to laugh about hard things sometimes. There  
were also some less fond memories—of stubbornness inherited  
and anger passed down. 272 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
One by one, almost everyone shared something with the  
group. Hearing the commonalities in so many of our experiences  
made me feel more connected—to them, and to my father and  
to their fathers. By the end of the night, the feeling of being  
untethered and unwhole had abated somewhat, and I felt grateful  
for community, friendship, and storytelling.  
Telling these stories is also a way to make sure precious mem-  
ories of beloved family members get passed on to future  
generations. Telling and retelling family stories helps cement  
them in our collective memories.  
SUZANNE RUST, SENIOR CURATORIAL PRODUCER\: My mother, Edna  
Rust, died when I was just twenty-two, and my father, Art Rust,  
Jr., when I was in my forties. Losing them left a huge hole in my  
life, but their stories keep them around. I am forever weaving  
stories about my parents into conversations, and my children,  
Julian and Sofia—who never got the chance to meet my wonder-  
ful mother—often toss her stories back to me, and through them,  
they have a pretty good idea about her. They know that when she  
was a teen, she was invited to tour Europe with Katherine  
Dunham’s dance troupe, but that her mother said, “No, there will  
be no hoochie-coochie dancers in the family!” They remember  
how she met my father at a dance at the Savoy Ballroom in  
Harlem, and how he sauntered over to her with his address book  
out, even though she was with a date. They know that before my  
mother wrote books with my father, she was an adored elemen-  
tary school teacher. I still occasionally have her former students  
see my name in print and reach out to me asking if I’m her daugh-  
ter, and share sweet stories about her.  
They know that their grandfather loved playing stickball on  
St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem and how he cried when his  
beloved “bat” Betsy accidentally fell into a sewer. They’ve heard  
the story of how he and his cousin Irving hated summer camp so  
much that they tried to hitchhike their way over seventy miles THESRIPPLE-ERPECT 273  
back to Manhattan but were picked up on the highway by a state  
trooper. They understand that despite the racism that he endured,  
their grandfather grew up to be one of the first Black sportscasters  
in the country with his own radio show. They comprehend that  
he was beloved by many, because once people find out who their  
grandfather was, they share a story about listening to him on the  
radio or meeting him in person, and what that meant to them.  
Talking about my parents is like sprinkling a little handful of  
fairy dust that brings them back to life for a few moments. I’m a  
big believer in celebrating my parents’ birthdays every year. I  
make their favorite meal and pour them a drink \(vodka and tonic  
for her, rum and Coke for him\), but really, it’s just another excuse  
to talk about them and have a good laugh ora cry and repeat our  
favorite stories about them. Usually both. It is a ritual so normal-  
ized in my family that my daughter assumed everyone did it.  
For me, the best stories help capture the essence of a person\:  
What made them laugh? What got them riled up? They offer a  
glimpse into what made them tick. They add color and vibrancy  
to the picture of someone who is no longer physically here, and  
they keep their memory alive.  
I'd like to think that when I’m gone \(hopefully a long time  
from now!\), my kids will remember my birthday, have a cocktail,  
and share their favorite stories about me. That’s how Id like to  
stick around.  
STORIES IN THE WORLD  
The year 1982 was the first time a U.S. president \(Ronald Reagan\)  
invited notable, but not necessarily famous, people to the State of  
the Union address. During the speech, he’d call them out and tell  
little stories about their situations, their personal successes, or  
their needs. This practice was adopted by all the presidents going  
forward because it makes for eftective, impactful communication.  
It’s one thing to say, ““My policies help people” or “We are in dire 274 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
need of a new initiative,” but the human stories tell it large. A  
story exemplifies what has been accomplished or what needs  
doing far better than any statistics.  
Presidents tell personal stories about others because they are  
the most direct and critical path to the human heart and mind.  
What was once “other” in the audience’s mind now becomes  
familiar and recognized. Story is the tool that helps us see behind  
the too-complicated \(or too-sensitive\) issues.  
Leaders from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Malala Yousafzai, from  
Martin Luther King, Jr., to Greta Thunberg, from Mahatma  
Gandhi to Colin Kaepernick, have all harnessed the power of  
their personal stories to amplify the shared experience of a larger  
community, a nation, or a people—all as a means of calling peo-  
ple to action and driving monumental change.  
Moth stories have been told on the floor of the United Nations,  
in front of presidents, and to members of Parliament. They’ve  
been told on buses and trains, matatus and rickshaws, in line at  
the grocery store, and behind podiums to present the findings of  
elaborate \(and complicated\) research studies. They’ve been told  
on elevators, on family farms, to strangers, straphangers, and  
lawmakers. And what have all these scenarios shown us?  
Well-told stories have the power to make significant change ona  
global scale.  
SARAH LEE NAKINTU, MOTH STORYTELLER\: I told my story to the  
European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium—and they committed  
to considering a new budget for more investment in sexual and  
reproductive health for youths, and access to services that will  
enable them to make informed decisions about their lives.  
Not all of us will bear the mantle of history, or even have the  
opportunity to run for student council, but strong storytelling  
skills can \(and will!\) transform individuals, build communities,  
and change worlds, however big or small. THERIPPLE EFFECT© 275  
ADELLE ONYANGO\: The Moth helped me confront aspects of  
grieving my mother, and it showed me the power of storytelling—  
a power that I then decided to use to amplify Africans’ stories.  
I built my podcast, Legally Clueless, to give Africans agency  
over their stories and to help us learn about each other  
through storytelling.  
STORIES INCOMMUNITY  
In 2008, The Moth was asked by the U.S. State Department to  
direct a storytelling show in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. As the show  
began, our team and State Department contact looked out at the  
crowd nervously. Half the audience was wearing Western cloth-  
ing and the other half traditional Tajik tunics and dresses with  
colorful headscarves. It had been ten years since their civil war  
had ended, but few people ever talked about the war. Music pro-  
fessor Anoid Latipovna Rakhmatyllaeva stepped onto a delicate  
old wooden stage covered in gorgeous carpets and shared her  
story about raising her children by herself during the war because  
her husband had been kidnapped and forced into the army. She  
told of nervously standing down soldiers with machine guns and  
machetes to prevent them from destroying the instruments at the  
college. She decided to play the Moonlight Sonata for the soldiers,  
and they were transfixed and agreed to leave in peace. At the end,  
Anoid had the entire crowd raise their voices together and recite  
a famous Tajik poem about how the people will go on. Later, over  
dinner, Anoid and her friends and family said the past ten years  
had passed in silence. No one in the community felt they could  
talk openly about what they had experienced. To tell her true  
story, and be heard by the audience, felt like a breakthrough.  
Telling our stories and listening to the stories of other people  
reminds us that we’re in this together. We are all making our way  
through a world that is sometimes joyful, oftentimes embarrass-  
ing, and never, ever perfect. 276 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
STORIES FOR ADVOCACY  
Some storytellers endeavor to use their voice for advocacy and  
raise awareness around global health and human rights. People  
want to stand up and be heard, and use story as a tool to deliber-  
ately change the world to be healthier and more equitable. Stories  
reframe our worldviews. They debunk preconceived notions and  
challenge long-held traditional beliefs.  
We met Nkem Osian through our work with Voices of  
Periods, a storytelling initiative launched by HealthyWomen and  
Myovant Sciences whose mission is to elevate conversations about  
menstrual health. Nkem was raised in a Nigerian household  
where talking about anything “below the belt” was taboo. For  
years she hid her heavy bleeding. One day at church, her sister  
looked over and noticed that Nkem’s gums were white. She was  
rushed to the hospital, where her doctor took her vitals and told  
her they were “not conducive to life.” She was diagnosed with  
fibroids, which she only then learned her mother also lives with.  
Despite her mother’s objections, she shares this story now as part  
of her work advocating for funding and research, and says,  
“It’s really liberating. Why keep this struggle to myself when I  
can help other women sharing this struggle? I can let them know  
through my knowledge what I’ve gone through and my  
challenges. I can’t keep this information to myself. I find that  
so selfish.”  
Most storytellers say that while it can be challenging to  
share a personal story, they felt it was truly important to do so.  
And it is important. To own your story is to take back the  
power—and challenge dominant and sometimes false \(or even  
deadly\) narratives.  
In “Go Back and Tell,” writer, poet, and activist Hannah  
Drake shared a sweeping story about racial tensions in America,  
framed by her eye-opening trip to the Door of No Return in  
Senegal and a heartbreaking visit to a plantation in Mississippi.  
It’s a powerful story, and a difficult one to hear—and sometimes THE RIP PES EPREGIS 277  
to tell—but Hannah was up for the challenge.  
We asked her what the experience was like, and she talked  
about the subject of her most requested poem, “Spaces.” She said,  
“Many of us are called to be space makers. We're there for a rea-  
son. That’s why I stand in these spaces, even when it makes me  
uncomfortable. I know I’m making space for people that will  
come behind me.”  
SISONKE MSIMANG, MOTH HOST AND STORYTELLER\: Bearing witness  
is a form of action. It’s sometimes the single most important thing  
that we can do in order to fix everything within us that  
is broken.  
Stories are told in courtrooms, and in protests, and to shine a  
light on inequities. Over the years, we’ve taught storytelling  
workshops with communities of all sorts\: the Innocence Project,  
LGBTQ alliances, and veterans’ groups, just to name a few. The  
Innocence Project, which works to exonerate the wrongfully  
imprisoned, is our longest-standing workshop partner. The Legal  
Aid Society, Trial Lawyers College, and other legal groups use  
tools of storytelling in legal proceedings.  
Stories can be used to influence policy—nationally, locally,  
and globally—and can show us that what we think we see is not  
all there is to be seen. Stories take you and your audience from  
binary thinking into something more complex. Hearing one  
person’s lived experience has the power to dismantle a previously  
held belief.  
We’ve read studies on the devastating effects of climate  
change, but when Hannah Morris shared her story “Counting  
Down the Tides,” about working on an archeological site at  
Mission Santa Catalina de Guale, on an island off the coast of  
Georgia, we felt the impact. Hannah described doing what she  
called “archeological triage.” They were trying to protect the  
sixteenth-century Spanish mission, where 2,432 people were  
- buried, from the rising tide. 278 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Lfound myself knee-deep in water, covered in sand, holding a floodlight.  
And we were working into the night, because we didn’t know what would  
be left of this site in the morning when the tide went out. Like any research  
project, we only have so much time and money, and we had been counting  
down not the days we had left on this dig, but the tides. We have three  
tides left. We have two tides left. And this night we had no tides left. This  
was it. The monster was in the water with me that night. It was coming  
in with this tide and swimming around my feet. And it was telling me  
exactly what the consequences of climate change would be.  
How different would the conversation about a global issue be  
if you could hear from someone who actually lived it?  
Studying infectious disease? Listen to a story from a person  
who had to keep vaccines cold while delivering them to rural  
communities in the summer.  
Discussing natural resources? Hear from a young scientist  
who, against all odds, helped marine life thrive in Bali by design-  
ing a “fish bank” with local fishermen.  
Considering the factors of economic mobility? Hear a wom-  
an’s story of choosing to leave paid work in order to care for her  
ailing husband.  
Recognizing gender inequities? Listen to a story in which a  
woman in Cameroon attempts to publish her first novel.  
Debating the American justice system? Go on a journey  
with a just-paroled man, navigating the subway for the first  
time, alone, on his first day out of prison, trying to get home  
before curfew.  
If you are using a story as a tool for advocacy, you generally  
don’t have five full minutes of uninterrupted attention. You prob-  
ably have only a minute or two, so what can you do in that time?  
\* FIND THE MAIN EVENT. What is the big scene that your whole  
story is leading up to? Shrink-wrap it. Can you tell this  
scene in one minute? Now what are the two or three things  
your audience must know for this event to make sense?  
\* TOWHOMWILL YOU TELL THIS? Are you telling your story to THE RIPPLE EFFECT 279  
teenagers? Fathers? Nurses? A broad audience? Point  
out the details and context that will help them relate.  
Remember, the same basic plot and arc can be told from  
many angles.  
\* ADDTHOSEDATAPOINTS! Well-placed story-related facts and  
figures help to paint a picture. “One hundred percent of  
Chicago’s Urban Prep Academy graduates—all Black  
males—have been admitted to college.” Too much data  
may weigh the story down, but a well-placed point or two  
can raise awareness of the greater situation at hand.  
\* ADDACALLTOACTIONATTHEEND. Yourstory is your platform!  
Point people in the direction you want them to go. Sign  
this petition; vote for gender equality; invest in small busi-  
nesses. The sense of community will motivate the audience  
to learn more. Make the most of that.  
What if one person was moved by your story? Now imagine  
what happens when you bring ten people together to hear it.  
Stories spark conversation. You begin to sow the seeds of a com-  
munity, forging lasting bonds and mutual understanding.  
Now envision telling it to a thousand people. What will  
they do with the story? Who will they tell it to? Imagine the  
ripple effect.  
Pamela Yates told a Moth story about the making of her doc-  
umentary about the civil war in Guatemala, When the Mountains  
Tremble. As she filmed, she was struck by the bravery she wit-  
nessed. At the end of her story, she says, “I always remember what  
the Guatemalan Mayans said to me. When I asked them why they  
risked their lives for a just society, they'd answered, ‘Quiero poner  
mi granito de arena.’ I just want to add my tiny grain of sand.”  
By finding the courage to tell your own story, you're adding  
your own grain of sand to the world. Sometimes that grain of sand  
can start a movement. a.

# LISTENING  
Our philosophy at The Moth is that communities can be made better if we  
listen.  
—JAY ALLISON, PRODUCER, THE MOTH RADIO HOUR  
On a hot morning in Naivasha, Kenya, twelve people pulled up  
to a hotel ina bus. It was the day before a Moth Global Community  
workshop was to begin, and these twelve strangers \(many of  
whom had just flown in from different countries\) were about to  
spend the next three days telling personal stories together. The  
Moth workshop was for religious leaders who wanted to use  
storytelling for advocacy in their communities—and from that  
bus stepped twelve people wearing hyabs and habits, cassocks and  
other vestments. It sounds like a setup for a joke\: “A nun, an  
imam, anda rabbi walked into a Moth workshop . . .” They were  
ready to craft and refine their own stories but also to listen to fellow  
leaders from different faiths tell theirs. There is no punchline, but  
these very different religious leaders found lots of common  
ground \(and laughter!\) through their personal stories of family,  
friendship, and love.  
Our opinions, reactions, upbringing, and culture might be 282 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
different, but we all know what it feels like to be filled with  
excitement or leveled by disappointment, to have dreams for our  
future and regrets from our past. As we listen to the stories of  
others, we may wish for the opportunity to do better, to be better.  
What will you discover when you take the time to listen?  
Almost everyone who is great at anything learned from folks  
before them. Great musicians have listened to thousands of hours  
of music; great novelists have read great books.  
You learn by listening. As you work on your story, immerse  
yourselfin the stories of others. \(For starters, The Moth has thou-  
sands on our website!\) Note what you love. Note what works.  
Note what isn’t for you at all. Some of the stories you love might  
stray from the suggestions we make. Some may follow them  
exactly but still not land right for your ears.  
Great storytellers notice the turn of phrase, the beautiful  
wrap-up, the blistering detail that draws the picture. Follow the  
path of the stories that have moved you.  
STORIES AS ANTIDOTE  
There are multiple ways listening to stories can help others. You  
can “prescribe” stories to friends and family, depending on what  
they’re going through. If someone is struggling with self-doubt,  
what if they listen to stories of Nobel laureates and athletes who  
also worried that they’d never succeed? Is your sister convinced  
she won’t find love again after fifty? What if she listened to the  
stories where people find true love later in life?  
There are stories for hope. Stories to bring us out of sadness.  
Stories to expand our idea of what is possible and to help us feel  
we are not alone. They can make us sit still and take it in.  
JENIFER\: One evening, our neighbor Patty told me that she was  
upset. Her twenty-year-old daughter had recently shared that she  
was gay and then added that she wanted to bring her girlfriend to LISTENING 283  
their family Thanksgiving. Patty said, “I had absolutely no idea.  
And I’m not ready. I know I have to get there, that I can’t change  
things, but I’m finding it very hard. I don’t want the girl to come  
to our Thanksgiving. I’m a terrible person.” I had so many ques-  
tions, but I tamped down what would have been an unsolicited  
fire hose of advice and quietly listened. I acknowledged that, yes,  
“you might need a little time to process.” I highlighted that it was  
good that her daughter was finally sharing this very vital part of  
herself and left it there. After she left, I remembered two Moth  
SLAM stories about people who came out to family members  
who were not exactly supportive or accepting at first \(Catherine  
Smyka’s “My Grandmother's Nerve” and Tara Clancy’s “Cops  
and Cuckoo Clocks”\). I forwarded the links and casually sug-  
gested she listen. In effect, I prescribed these two stories, both of  
which have a lot of heart and happen to be funny.  
Two days later, Patty said she loved the stories and that she had  
thought about it, and, although she still wasn’t 100 percent com-  
fortable, she told her daughter she could extend the Thanksgiving  
invitation to her girlfriend. Did those two stories change every-  
thing? Definitely not—there were still many hurdles. But that  
Thanksgiving, the gravy was passed, the pumpkin pie was  
devoured, and brand-new stories were born.  
We’ve received many emails from people asking us to thank a  
storyteller—and they usually include wording like “I never  
understood” or “I never knew.” Hearing someone’s experience  
opened a window for them and allowed them to empathize and  
see something from a new perspective.  
Danusia Trevino shared a story about a trial in New York City  
and the quick assumptions she made about her fellow jurors’  
capacity for compassion. Ultimately their kindness toward her  
helped her make the right decision in the case. The story “Guilty”  
aired on The Moth Radio Hour, and she’s received many fan letters.  
Here’s one\: 284 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
I work at an automotive parts store here and deliver car parts to  
local auto shops. Today while I was driving a route, I was flipping  
through the radio stations because the music started to become  
monotone and bland due to the overpowering depression.  
Anyways, I came across your lovely voice and decided to stop  
browsing as I heard laughter from an audience. As I listened to  
your jury duty story, I became so drawn to the story that I wanted  
to pull my truck off to the side of the road and just listen. Your  
story touched my heart on many different levels and I felt joy and  
hope. I have never been one to show emotion and I’m supposed  
to be a “tough guy” Marine, but I was on the verge of tears. Your  
story has also inspired me to have an open mind as well as an open  
heart. I am again, just so grateful that your story reached me out  
here in the middle of nowhere to lift my spirit.  
STORIES EVOKE REFLECTION  
The smallest details in a story can conjure specific memories, shift  
your perspective entirely, or help you see another person’s life in  
a revolutionary new light. Cheech Marin told a story about mov-  
ing to Canada to avoid being drafted into the Vietnam War.  
When describing the final scene, the moment he saw his father  
for the first time after the war, a high-pitched sound escaped from  
his throat. After the show, an audience member told us that he  
burst into tears upon hearing this sound. He said the sound comes  
out when you tighten your larynx so you won't cry. He said that  
crying wasn’t accepted in his household—and he makes the same  
sound. He had tears in his eyes, because Cheech was audibly  
reflecting his same emotional experience growing up. One sound  
summed up a specific and shared childhood.  
In “Making Moves,” chess grandmaster Maurice Ashley tells  
a story about growing up in Jamaica and his expectations of what  
America was going to be like when he finally arrived. LISTENING 285  
I could see my friends were green with envy, because America was the land  
of promise. And the only thing we knew about America was what we saw  
on television, so it was The Partridge Family. I was going to go to  
America and be like Danny Partridge, or Arnold and Willis on Diff rent  
Strokes, and we were going to live in.a penthouse with a pool on the roof.  
We got in the plane, and we finally were over the lights of New York City,  
' Got in the car, and something was different about this version of America.  
We thought the streets would be paved with gold.  
Marina Klutse, The Moth’s director of finance and adminis-  
tration, interviewed Maurice for The Moth podcast. In the  
episode, she said\:  
Listening to Maurice’s story made me feel so seen. When I was two, my  
older siblings and I were sent to live with our grandparents in Ghana,  
while our dad stayed behind in the U.S. Before the start of the school year,  
we would happily open boxes from our father that had fancy American  
sneakers that lit up, bedazzled clothes \(before “bedazzle” was a thing\),  
notebooks, stickers, and other accessories. Things that would pretty much  
read “I have family in America.” Yup, that was us, the American kids in  
Ghana. Just like Maurice, these boxes filled us with joy and fostered an  
idealized image of America. My dreams of living in America didn’t  
include a penthouse with a pool on the roof. But they did include a purple  
TV, my own room with purple decor in a big fancy house. Everything  
would sparkle, glimmer, and we would live happily ever after. A few  
months shy of my ninth birthday, I was told that we were returning to the  
U.S. When the day came, I remember getting on the plane with my father  
and three siblings. I beamed like I knew something sunnier was on the  
other side for us. My mind was racing with visions of the American  
Dream. But, when I did get here, life was not as expected, Maurice and  
I connected over our stories, but we were also able to recognize some of our  
differences. Which reminded me that no two journeys are alike, that our  
stories are unique, complex, and nuanced, but we can often find pieces of  
ourselves in the reflection of others. 286 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
These connections are powerful for the listener but also for the  
teller, who, prior to sharing their story, might have thought their  
experience was inconsequential, only to find a community of  
people who may have experienced or felt something similar.  
Suddenly they feel validated and not so alone in the world. They  
feel stronger as a result.  
Your audience wonders\: How is my life similar to or different  
from the experience of this person? What else have I misunder-  
stood about the world? How did I never consider this before?  
Samuel James told his story “Jenny” to a sold-out audience at  
the State Theatre in Portland, Maine. In his story, he described  
growing up in social services—living with a series of foster parents  
and in shelters until a friend’s parents opened their home to him.  
After he told his story that evening, the cast was sitting around  
the table at the post-show dinner, reeling from the adrenaline of  
a successful night. Samuel looked at his phone and suddenly his  
expression changed. A woman who had been in the audience  
found him on the internet and emailed to say thank you. She said  
she had learned earlier that evening that her son’s fifteen-year-old  
friend was being placed in the foster system. Her first instinct was  
that her family could take him in, but then immediately she  
started to question herself\: her ability as a parent, whether they  
had the resources to care for him properly. But after hearing  
Samuel’s story she decided that she would put herself forward for  
this kid. Because Samuel was brave, they felt they could be brave  
too. The magnitude of knowing that his story might change the  
course of a boy’s life left everyone at the table speechless.  
Being courageous enough to share a story is powerful only if  
there is someone brave enough to listen with an open heart and  
mind. The simple act of listening forges unlikely bonds. It’s been  
our honor to witness people who should be in deep, irrevocable  
conflict come together once they understand each other’s stories.  
In Hector Black’s “Forgiveness,” he comes to make peace with  
the man who murdered his daughter once he hears the story of  
the man’s childhood. LISTENING 287  
I wanted to know who he was. I wanted to know what had happened to  
him that made it possible for him to do such a deed. My first reaction was  
that he was a monster, he was no human being, he deserved no compassion  
from me. But little by little, I learned a bit about his life. That he was born  
in a mental hospital. When he was eleven years old, his mother took him  
and his younger brother and little sister to a swimming pool, saying God  
\~ was asking her to drown them as enemies of God. He and his little brother  
got away, and stood there while she drowned his little sister in front of  
them. I couldn’t help thinking that here we are, the richest country the  
world has ever known, the most powerful, and there was no one for this  
little boy. What would I be like if the woman who brought me into the  
world had tried to destroy my life? It wasn’t that I was trying to excuse  
what he had done, but I felt for him as another human being, suffering.  
This man, Ivan Simpson, is eventually tried and found guilty,  
and Hector meets him in court.  
I turned around and faced him. I said, “I wish all of us who had been so  
wounded by this crime might find God’s peace. And I wish this for you  
also, Ivan Simpson,” and our eyes met for the first time. The tears were  
streaming down his cheeks. I’ll never forget the look. It was like a soul in  
hell. They were going to lead him away, knowing he’d die in jail. He  
asked to come to the microphone, and twice, with the tears streaming down  
his cheeks, he said, “I’m so sorry for the pain I have caused, I’m so sorry  
for the pain I’ve caused.” That night I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about  
this. He had nothing, and he'd given me the only thing he had. He  
could’ve said, “To hell with all of you, my life is over,” but he didn’t. I  
knew then that I had forgiven him. I felt a peace that I hadn’t had in a  
long time. And L felt a great burden lifted from me.  
At the core, stories remind us that there is always the potential  
for people to care and for people to change. 288 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
The Moth was conceived from one person’s idea—but it was  
birthed and cared for and struggled with and cried over and loved  
and grown by many people’s sweat, determination, and care. It  
went through growing pains and growth spurts, aced tests, and  
had its heart broken \(more than once\). It started with one story,  
but it is now an international community where more than fifty  
thousand storytellers have shared their stories.  
It is no exaggeration to say that The Moth exists and thrives  
thanks to the contributions of millions—and many of those mil-  
lions are listeners. The act of sharing a story is courageous, but the  
act of listening to personal stories is just as important. It is an act  
of generosity—a gift you give not just to the storyteller but also  
to your entire community.  
In honor and celebration of The Moth’s many decades of life,  
our hope is that you will take these skills and use stories to find  
common ground, create a dialogue, and encourage others to  
share their stories as well.  
You are a multitude of stories, and those stories are part of our  
shared world.  
Your stories matter. Tell them. We're listening. AFTERWORD  
The world today can sometimes seem as strange as Alice’s  
Wonderland—where we debate even the most fundamental  
questions of what is fake and what is real. But in all of this confu-  
sion, there is one thing we can count on for certain, and that is the  
truth of our own stories and the validity of our own experiences.  
They are ours to know and feel and share.  
Now it’s your turn to share yours! This is an invitation to step  
into the limelight. You’ve got this. We know your inner story-  
teller is just waiting to be unleashed.  
By crafting your story and examining the threads of your life  
through your own lens, with your full heart, you will connect  
more deeply to the moments and events that make you who you  
are today. The process will help you see how the joys, heartaches,  
and struggles fit into the larger arc of your life. Most ofall, telling  
your story allows you to own it. It gives you permission to aban-  
don the narratives others may have ascribed to you, cast off the  
harmful ones you may be telling yourself, and define your own.  
This is your story; only you can tell it.  
Trust me! I’ve witnessed the magic of our artistic and work-  
shop teams leading people through the vulnerable and delicate  
process of discovering and shaping their stories. I’ve seen time and  
\~ again how people emerge from this experience feeling a renewed 290 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
sense of self and reconnecting with their purpose and value. It is  
transformative. Now you have the wisdom of this team literally  
at your fingertips. I believe you will be transformed too.  
So go forth and tell your story. Be courageous. Feel your  
worth. Share it wherever you can, whether it’s on a road trip, in  
line at the post office, or on a Moth stage. The important thing is  
to let others see you—the real you. And once you do, we're cer-  
tain your act of bravery will spark others to share their real selves.  
When they do, return the favor. Make space for them and truly  
listen. Watch them light up and inspire someone else to tell their  
story. It creates an avalanche of connection and human under-  
standing. This is the magic dust of empathy, and it all starts with  
you and your story.

We hope by this point you are considering putting all your new-  
found storytelling knowledge into action. Maybe telling better  
stories to your friends or at work is your sole aspiration, but maybe  
you're wondering if you have what it takes to tell it on stage.  
Back in 2009, we established the Moth Pitchline at the sug-  
gestion of radio producer Jay Allison. We wanted to meet people  
who had stories they were itching to tell. Since then, thousands  
upon thousands of people, from all around the world, have called  
and left a two-minute pitch of a story they would like us to con-  
sider developing for our Mainstage. And we listen to them all!  
We've met some amazing storytellers through the Pitchline\:  
aluchador wrestler, a contestant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,  
a catwalking fashion model, an ER doctor who fled Vietnam as  
a child. We’ve heard tales of generous neighbors, awkward  
encounters with former U.S. presidents, terrifying home inva-  
sions, and epic mysteries solved by an unwitting sleuth. They all  
started with a two-minute pitch that caught our ear!  
A good pitch uses all the elements of a good story. You need  
stakes, emotions, and an arc. It has to explore something deeper  
than just this thing that happened. For a pitch to work, you have to  
summarize your story in a way that illustrates that all those ele-  
ments are in there waiting to be developed. 300 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
ADVICE FOR PITCHING FROM DIRECTOR CHLOE SALMON\: A good  
pitch is deceptively difficult to pull off. Many people’ first instinct  
is to tell us about the story they want to tell, to keep it vague and  
talk around it. For example\:  
“The story I want to tell you is about a time I laughed the  
hardest I’ve ever laughed. I won’t go into it now, but it was a really  
funny event that I still think about to this day, and I'd love to tell  
a story about it. Call me back!”  
What happens in this story? Couldn’t tell you. How did the  
events of the story change this person? I don’t know!  
The best pitches are a two-minute version of the story you  
want to tell. Packing your whole story into two minutes is no easy  
feat. Here are some tricks\:  
\* Know your arc! Beyond the events of the story, what was it  
really about for you? How were you changed? Challenge  
yourself to say it in one sentence. Otice you have that sen-  
tence, use it as a lens through which you edit your pitch.  
¢ Find your angle! Why is this a story only you can tell?  
Identify your personal stakes and make us see why this story  
matters to you. That’s all we need to be on board.  
\* Finish the story! No cliffhangers, please. It might seem like  
a good way to entice us to give you a call, but the opposite is  
true.  
\* Be yourself! Moth stories are told without notes—bring that  
spirit to your pitch. Imagine you're telling it to us over a cup  
of coffee.  
To pitch your two-minute story\: Call, or visit themoth.org and  
pitch right on our website. Pitch away! We can’t wait to meet  
you. STORY PROMPTS  
Need some more help finding your story? Here are some themes  
and prompts to get you started. Choose one prompt and see where  
it takes you. There are no wrong answers! The stories are yours!  
FIRSTS  
Tell us about a breakthrough moment.  
Tell us about a first time that you regretted.  
Tell us about a first time that changed your life.  
NINE TO FIVE  
Tell us about a time you worked hard and played hard.  
Tell us about a time you were working for the weekend.  
Tell us about a time you didn’t see eye-to-eye with management.

LOVE HURTS  
Tell us about a time it was too little, too late.  
Tell us about a time you had to follow your heart.  
Tell us about a time you loved and lost.  
CAUGHT  
Tell us about a time you were busted. 302 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
Tell us about a time you wove a tangled web.  
Tell us about a time your hand was in the cookie jar.  
LOST AND FOUND  
Tell us about a time you couldn’t see what was right in front  
of you.  
Tell us about a time you couldn't find a way out.  
Tell us about a time you were reunited with something you  
treasure. NOTES ON PROGRAMS  
THE MOTH MAINSTAGE\: Born in 1997, the Moth Mainstage is a live  
two-act show, featuring five tellers and a notable host sharing true  
personal stories without notes. Each unique night is curated and  
directed by The Moth’s creative team. Moth Mainstages have  
been produced in nearly all fifty U.S. states and on five continents.  
\(We're coming for you, South America and Antarctica!\) There  
are more than forty Mainstages presented around the world every  
year. Many of the stories excerpted in this book were originally  
told on the Moth Mainstage, which features storytellers we have  
met through all of our Moth programs.  
THE MOTH STORYSLAMS\: The early success of our curated Moth  
Mainstage series inspired many people to contact the Moth office  
with pitches. We were flooded with calls\: “I have a story!” But  
the tiny staff \(just two full-time employees back then\) wasn’t able  
to screen and cultivate all the potential tellers. It was a beautiful  
problem\: too many stories! So in 2000, we decided to experiment  
with opening the stage to anyone interested in sharing a story.  
The Moth StorySLAMs were born. The show was a competition,  
but moreover, a community where anyone could share a five-  
minute story. We provided a host, the stage, a theme, the guiding  
principles, and picked judges from the audience to help choose a 304 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
winner. Any and all were invited to sign up for the chance to tell  
a story, but just ten audience members were picked at random to  
get time on stage. Winners of each StorySLAM are invited to  
compete in the GrandSLAM, the ultimate storytelling competi-  
tion. Based on the wild popularity of the show in NYC, we  
decided to branch out in 2006 and now present monthly  
StorySLAMs in cities across the United States and worldwide,  
providing thousands of opportunities for would-be storytellers  
each year.  
THE MOTH COMMUNITY PROGRAM\: From the very beginning, we  
recognized that stories have the potential to change lives and the  
power to build communities. Starting in 1999, The Moth’s  
Community Program has developed partnerships with nonprofit  
organizations and cultural institutions to create workshops that  
empower participants to craft and share their stories. Some orga-  
nizations came to us; others we sought out, hitting the pavement  
and knocking on doors. Not every door opened! But we were  
able to convince some veterans’ organizations, hospitals, support  
groups, and community centers to let us in. After the workshops,  
we all felt the power of story and the shared experience—and  
vowed to continue.  
Since then, we've had the honor of facilitating storytelling  
workshops with hundreds of organizations such as the Innocence  
Network, the Wounded Warrior Project, RESULTS, the Islamic  
Center at NYU, SAGE, Her Justice, the Museum of Jewish  
Heritage, and the Jed Foundation, among others.  
The Community Program’s goal is to connect across cultures  
and generations. We believe that people should take the lead in  
sharing their own stories. We aim to uplift the broadest array of  
voices possible, especially those voices that too often struggle to  
be heard. Through our workshops and live events, participants  
shape their life experiences into stories to share with members of  
their communities and beyond. NOTES ON PROGRAMS 305  
MOTHWORKS\: In 2002, The Moth gota call from an agency asking  
us to lead a storytelling workshop. We said, “But we don’t do  
corporate training,’ and they said, “But we don’t want corpo-  
rate training, we want great storytelling training.” We were  
skeptical. We weren't sure that what we were doing in down-  
town theaters would translate to the corporate world. But their  
enthusiasm won us over and ultimately we agreed.  
In those first workshops, we talked about storytelling and  
gave feedback in the same way we gave it to storytellers. To our  
delight, we found that our storytelling geekery fit right in.  
Word spread quickly and soon a dedicated team from The  
Moth was traveling the world to lead workshops and host pri-  
vate events across industries, with the people at Nike, Google,  
the International Women’s Forum, the U.S. State Department,  
Spotify, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, Genentech, American  
Express, Lululemon, NBCUniversal, A&E Networks, LEGO,  
\(RED\), Cole Haan, Ogilvy & Mather, Wrigley, and more. We  
uncovered stories from marketers, creatives, medical profes-  
sionals, financial experts, and great tech minds. Our work has  
been profiled in publications like The Wall Street Journal, Fortune,  
Forbes, Crain’s, and Inc. magazine.  
In our early days we were acutely aware that our goals as a  
creative organization might be at odds with our profit-driven  
clients. But as we developed our programming we realized that  
most of the time what we were teaching our clients practically  
had a larger impact culturally. We were helping them to become  
better communicators, to understand key principles of story-  
telling, while also connecting them as humans. Over and over,  
we heard one workshop participant tell another\: “I’ve worked  
with you for years, but I’ve never known you until today.”  
Over the past twenty years, we’ve seen changes in the workplace  
that reflect social and cultural shifts. Sharing stories can be a way for  
employees on all levels to feel seen and heard at work and to move  
toward flatter hierarchies. Storytelling can be the social and emo-  
tional glue holding together morale and sense of purpose. 306 HOW TO TELLA STORY  
It’s been proven to us time and again that storytelling belongs  
at work. We’re glad we took the call.

the Perth International Arts Festival, Moth host and storyteller Dan  
Kennedy told former executive and creative director Lea Thau he  
would be interviewed by Apple about his newest book. He said,  
“Why don’t you join me in conversation on stage and also . . . The  
Moth should announce that it’s starting a podcast!” We had no  
plans for a podcast. The interview was in two weeks. But Dan’s  
challenge inspired us! After fast strategic meetings, and with ner-  
vous excitement—we went for it. The podcast premiered in the  
spring of 2008 and was edited in the free software GarageBand by  
anintern. The Moth podcast now features original episodes as well  
as full episodes of The Moth Radio Hour, including stories from all  
of our programs. It is now downloaded more than ninety million  
times a year \(per Podtrack, January 2021\) and is regularly ranked in  
the top podcasts on iTunes. The podcast is nimble, allowing us to  
speak directly to our audience and reflect the world we're living in.  
THE PEABODY AWARDWINNING THE MOTH RADIO HOUR\: When we first  
dreamed of The Moth on the radio, we were told again and again,  
“Ten-minute stories will never work on air!”—but after extensive  
meetings, we were championed by our now longtime producer  
Jay Allison and our friends and partners at the Public Radio  
Exchange \(PRX\). In 2009, we launched the show with five epi-  
sodes and by 2013 listenership had swelled, and we nervously  
made the leap to weekly. The Moth Radio Houris hosted by rotat-  
ing members of The Moth staff and community, and features  
stories chosen from The Moth’s live shows. The Moth Radio Hour  
is now heard on more than 570 public radio stations in the United  
States, as well as the BBC and outlets in Australia, Germany, and  
France, among other countries. It is produced by The Moth, Jay  
Allison, Viki Merrick, and Atlantic Public Media and is presented  
by PRX. NOTES ON PROGRAMS 307  
THE MOTH EDUCATION PROGRAM\: W hen we first thought about teach-  
ing storytelling to teens, we wondered if young people had  
enough perspective to reflect upon their experiences through  
story. After our first few high school workshops, we discovered  
just how rich student stories could be. In 2012, we formalized  
The Moth Education Program in order to provide students and  
teachers with a forum to share personal stories with one another  
and then with the world.  
Through afterschool and weekend workshops, students brain-  
storm ideas, learn storycraft, and have the opportunity to take the  
stage and share their stories with friends and family. The results  
are profound. Students connect with their own personal experi-  
ences, develop their voices, and through listening, get to know  
their peers in ways that they hadn’t imagined before.  
Sharing stories breaks down barriers. When young people  
listen to one another, they better understand each other’s  
challenges, missteps, joys, and triumphs. What is meaningful to  
one becomes meaningful to many. Storytelling builds empathy  
for others, but also for ourselves \(the young people we are or  
once were\).  
To reach as many students as possible, The Moth Education  
Program also works with teachers, providing the tools to bring  
storytelling directly into their classrooms. The Moth’s high  
school curriculum—which helps teachers help students with  
brainstorming and storycrafting— is available free online, for  
educators around the world. We also conduct workshops for fifth-  
to-twelfth-grade educators from across the United States, where  
they experience the vulnerability of developing and sharing a  
story in community with their fellow teachers. Often, they’ll tell  
stories from when they were young; it’s a chance to remember  
what it’s like to be in the shoes of their students.  
Having worked with thousands of young people, we've seen  
how storytelling workshops give youth the skills to articulate  
their experience, empathize with others, and strengthen their  
confidence. 308 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
THE MOTH’S GLOBAL COMMUNITY PROGRAM started in 2014 thanks to  
a call from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation inviting us to  
work with health experts from the global south—the recipients  
of the Aspen Institute New Voices Fellowship. “We want to help  
the fellows with their advocacy work. Maybe you can adapt your  
Community Program model? Design workshops to strengthen  
the fellows’ personal storytelling skills?” Brilliant! We said yes.  
Since that first workshop outside of Nairobi, Kenya, we’ve  
adapted our curriculum again \(and again!\) to create intensive  
cross-cultural workshops that are taught with a core of instructors  
who hail from Kenya, India, and Uganda, among other countries.  
Instructors are graduates of Moth workshops and are ambassadors  
of the program, modeling ways in which stories can move the  
needle, or start a movement.  
Over the years we’ve been honored to continue our partner-  
ship with the Aspen Institute and the Bill & Melinda Gates  
Foundation and to collaborate with the Ford Foundation and UN  
Women, among other organizations. The Moth’s Global  
Community Program now has more than 500 graduates from  
over fifty countries, who use their personal stories to drive social  
change on a global scale. Graduates of the Global Community  
Program have told their stories on the floor of the United Nations,  
at the EU Summit in Brussels, started podcasts and grassroots  
movements, and used personal stories to reform laws.  
Through the Global Community Program, we continue to  
develop and elevate true personal stories from extraordinary  
individuals in the global south. These stories spark conversations  
on world health issues including\: agriculture and ending hunger,  
infectious disease prevention and education—and there is a strong  
overall focus on stories of women and girls. By honoring a broad  
range of individual experiences, we believe we can challenge  
dominant narratives, deepen connection, and create a more pro-  
ductive dialogue around the world. INDEX

MEG BOWLES is a senior director and a host of the Peabody  
Awardwinning The Moth Radio Hour. Signing on as a volunteer  
in 1997, she had no idea where The Moth would take her. Over  
the decades, she has directed Mainstage shows everywhere, from  
Anchorage to London. Although her background in television  
and film has served to sharpen her editorial sense and eye for 322 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
detail, she is recognized for her ability to spot stories in the wild  
and to home in on what transforms a seemingly small story into  
something universal. For her part, Meg loves working with peo-  
ple one-on-one, witnessing and supporting their progress. She is  
especially excited to see people who never imagined themselves  
as having a story go on to proudly claim the moniker of  
storyteller.  
CATHERINE BURNS is The Moth’s longtime artistic director and a  
host of the Peabody Awardwinning The Moth Radio Hour. As one  
of the lead directors on The Moth’s Mainstage since 2003, she has  
helped many hundreds of people craft their stories, including a  
New York City sanitation worker, a Nobel Laureate, the Tower  
of London’s Ravenmaster, a jaguar tracker, and an exonerated  
prisoner. She is the editor of the bestselling and critically  
acclaimed books The Moth\: 50 True Stories, All These Wonders, and  
Occasional Magic. She is the director of the solo shows The Gates  
\(written and performed by Adam Gopnik\) and Helen & Edgar  
\(written and performed by Edgar Oliver\), which was called  
“utterly absorbing and unexpectedly moving” by Ben Brantley  
of The New York Times, and the feature film A Pound of Flesh. Prior  
to The Moth, she produced television and independent films,  
interviewing such talent as George Clinton, Chuck D, Ozzy  
Osbourne, Martha Stewart, and Howard Stern. She attended her  
first Moth back in 2000, fell in love with the show, and was, in  
turn, a GrandSLAM contestant and volunteer in the Moth  
Community Program before joining the staff full-time. Born and  
raised in Alabama, she now lives in Brooklyn with her husband  
and son.

SARAH HABERMAN \(AFTERWORD\) has been the executive director of  
The Moth since 2013, providing oversight of the organization’s  
business and strategic development. She also supervises The  
Moth’s Education, Community, and MothWorks programs, and ABOUT THE AUTHORS 323  
launched The Moth’s Global Community program in 2014 in  
partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. She has  
held senior management and development roles at the world’s  
leading arts nonprofit and academic institutions including the  
New York Public Library, the Whitney Museum of American  
Art, Columbia Business School, and Jazz at Lincoln Center. Prior  
to moving to New York, she was an acquiring editor in Paris for  
Editions Robert Laffont, a major French publishing house. She is  
also a member of the board of directors for the Richard and Ethel  
Herzfeld Foundation in Milwaukee.  
JENIFER HIXSON is a senior director and one of the hosts of the  
Peabody Awardwinning The Moth Radio Hour. Each year she asks  
hundreds of people to identify the significant turning points of  
their lives—fumbles and triumphs, leaps of faith, darkest hours—  
and then helps them shape those experiences into story form for  
the stage. She falls a little bit in love with each storyteller, and  
hopes you will too. In 2000, she launched The Moth StorySLAM,  
which now has a full-time presence in twenty-five cities in the  
United States, the UK, and Australia and provides more than four  
thousand individual storytelling opportunities for storytelling  
daredevils and loquacious wallflowers alike. Jenifer’s story  
“Where There’s Smoke” has been featured on The Moth Radio  
Hour and This American Life and was a part of The Moth’s first  
book\: The Moth\: 50 True Stories.  
SARAH AUSTIN JENNESS has a loud and distinct laugh that will make  
you smile. She joined the staff at The Moth in 2005, and as the  
executive producer she has had the honor of working with many  
hundreds of people to craft and hone their unique personal sto-  
ries. She is a Peabody Awardwinning director, is one of the  
longstanding hosts of The Moth Radio Hour, oversees The Moth  
podcast, and launched The Moth’s Global Community Program,  
designing and coaching storytelling workshops for participants  
in the United States, South Asia, and Africa to elevate 324 HOW TO TELL A STORY  
conversation around gender equality and human rights. Moth  
stories Sarah has directed in the past fifteen-plus years have been  
told on the floor of the United Nations, at the Sundance Film  
Festival, on rickshaws and buses, and as far afield as the Kenya  
National Theatre. Elliot, Amelia, Evie, and Opal, her nephew  
and nieces, have given her the Best Aunt in the World Award.  
Sarah believes in challenging dominant narratives—and that  
stories change the world by creating connection.
