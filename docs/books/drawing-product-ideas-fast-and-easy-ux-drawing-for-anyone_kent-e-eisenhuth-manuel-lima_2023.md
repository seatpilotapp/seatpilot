BY MANUEL LIMA  
The ability to draw is embedded in all of us from a very early age.  
Before we can articulate a single sentence, we are compelled to sketch—random  
lines and scribbles at first, patterns and geometric shapes as we get  
older. This early exploration is a foundational step in developing a language  
of thought while also improving important motor skills. Even if most of us  
get progressively better during childhood, as we get older, we tend to lose  
our innate connection to drawing. We consider it too childish or lacking  
intrinsic value. Or worse, we become self-­ conscious and start believing  
we are not good at it. And in the process, we forget how deeply gratifying  
it can be.  
While we spend years in school mastering all possible rules and  
combinations on how to apply the 26 symbols that make up the alphabet,  
somehow we assume drawing skills and visual literacy should come  
naturally to us, without any specific training or focused practice. It is  
therefore not surprising that most of us eventually distance ourselves from  
our innate ability to draw with our hands. Such detachment appears more  
acute within the tech industry, where every so often a new digital tool comes  
around to fulfill our desire for visual depiction in unpredictable ways. Packed  
with extravagant pen styles, fanciful shapes, outlines, and transitions,  
modern-­ day digital tools make hand drawing seem like a thing of the past.  
Repeatedly, I see designers jumping straight to the latest digital tool,  
enamored by its shiny new features, without thinking deeply about what they  
are creating in the first place and considering the various interdependent  
parts that make up their grand idea. This can lead to a lot of wasted time.  
Using pen and paper is not just important to think through scenarios  
before committing to a solution, it is often the most liberating step in your  
iteration process. If you don’t allow yourself this key step, your idea becomes  
immediately conditioned by the tool’s capabilities. I’m often asked what tool  
I recommend for design and data visualization. The answer is always  
obvious\: pen and paper.  
ix x FOREWORD  
Kent’s book is a fabulous guide in this context. It teaches us how to bring  
the pen and paper back into the lives of user experience designers and  
digital product creators. Whether you are developing a new user interface  
for a website, mobile application, service, TV system, or game console, this  
book will be instrumental for you to structure and articulate your ideas while  
building your own combinatorial visual language. In the process, not only will  
you save countless hours redoing wireframes and final interface mocks, but  
you will also discover the true power of an unconstrained creative mind. PREFACE  
I spent most of my childhood drawing and painting. As I was growing up,  
I aspired to be an architect. I was obsessed with buildings. Figure 1  
depicts a random architectural doodle I created back then. After completing  
an independent study with a local architect and mentor, I quickly learned  
how to refine my drawing skills and create a visual style that enabled me to  
pitch new and exciting ideas.  
FIGURE 1  
For various reasons, I never achieved my goal of becoming an architect.  
However, I found my way into User Experience \(UX\) design. Throughout my  
career, I’ve carried a lot of the ideas, principles, and techniques I learned  
from childhood, and I’ve spent a lot of time refining them. My drawing style  
is a combination of techniques I applied in watercolor painting, drafting, and  
digital design. The drawing in Figure 2 is a fine example of how I combined  
these various techniques. As a result of blending these skills and techniques,  
I’ve experienced a lot of success sharing ideas early and often.  
xi xii Preface  
Drawing has improved the quality of ideas explored by the teams on  
which I’ve worked. I’ve been able to successfully apply drawing in a way that  
enabled me to challenge the status quo, explore new ideas, and share the  
breadth of my thinking. I’ve used drawing to enable my teams to align on  
ideas that we co-­ created.  
FIGURE 2  
For example, I used hand-­ drawn sketches to design one of the first  
mobile and web apps for controlling lights and shades in homes. I also used  
drawing and sketching to convince a customer to drastically change the  
way in which scientists interact with an atomic force microscope. One of my  
early atomic force microscope concept drawings is displayed in Figure 3.  
FIGURE 3  
Later in my career, I used hand-­ drawn sketches to help pitch Rivet, an AI-powered  
reading skills practice app offered by Google. I also used drawings  
to enable the team, a group of non-­ designers, to explore some early  
minimum viable product, or MVP, designs for the app. Preface xiii  
Finally, I successfully created a hand-­ drawn presentation to convince a  
Google Cloud team to shift from a text-­ driven interface to a visual interface  
that used visualizations to highlight insights within the data.  
I want to share my success with you, and I truly believe that my style and  
technique doesn’t require artistic talent to master. I’m confident that with a  
few quick and easy adjustments to your drawing technique, you will be able  
to draw digital product designs, like the one in Figure 4, with finesse, polish,  
and confidence. Most importantly, you can start creating more impactful  
designs with your team.  
FIGURE 4 INTRODUCTION  
Do you find drawing unapproachable or intimidating? A lot of people  
do, and for good reason. Drawing gets a bad rap. Most people think  
you have to be an artist or seasoned designer to be able to do it well. They  
believe that it requires formal training. This is definitely not true.  
If you create digital products and you’re not a designer, you have a  
reason to read this book. By sharing everything I’ve learned throughout the  
years, I’m hoping to empower you to channel your artistic skills and include  
drawing and sketching in your everyday process. It’s a fact that the human  
brain processes images more quickly than it processes words. Images are  
the essential language we use when sharing and collaborating on new ideas.  
As people who design and build digital products, we will continue to rely on  
this as the design problems we tackle become more complex and as design  
thinking continues to gain popularity.  
Do you work on digital products? Do you consider yourself a designer?  
If not, do you want to contribute to the creative process? It turns out that  
you can and should. In fact, you can be good at it, too. As design problems  
become more complex, designers are relying on teammates like you to help  
co-­ design solutions. I truly believe that everyone is a designer and the best  
ideas are built in a group. The success of your team’s product might depend  
on your input, and drawing can be your ticket to success.  
Are you already a seasoned designer? Is drawing a key part of your  
process? If so, this book will enable you to build confidence in your drawing  
ability. It will provide methods for getting your colleagues on board with your  
process so you can all become better collaborators.  
If you’re not a designer, you have even better reasons to read this book.  
Are you a subject matter expert? If so, you can use drawing to ensure  
your team’s designers are seeing and understanding your domain-­ specific  
point of view. For them, it’s important that your expertise shines through in  
the end product.  
Are you a researcher? If so, you can use drawing to ensure your user  
experience \(UX\) research and requirements are well represented in your  
xv xvi Introduction  
team’s final product. If you work in a siloed organization, drawing will help  
you blur the lines between you and your design counterparts.  
Are you going to build the product? Are you an engineer or developer? If  
so, you may use drawing to co-­ design an end solution that is useful, exciting,  
and fits within identified technical requirements and constraints.If you can  
draw boxes and arrows similar to the ones displayed here, you have what it  
takes to draw a design—­ and a good one for that matter. Remember, in order  
to draw with your team, you don’t have to be a critically acclaimed artist, nor  
do you have to be a designer.  
FIGURE 5  
So what do you think? Are you ready to get started? If so, let’s jump in. C H A P T E R O N E  
# WHY DRAW?  
Great digital products start with great design. A great design isn’t created  
in a vacuum. It takes time, research, and the unique perspective of  
many contributors along the way. I’ve always viewed the design process as a  
form of problem solving, and as technology advances, the problems become  
more complex. As a result, our teammates from all functional areas are  
participating in this process, whether they realize it or not.  
Throughout this process, drawing is the key method for developing,  
testing, and collaborating on new ideas, and there are several benefits to  
including drawing in your product development process, as illustrated in the  
mind map in Figure 1.1.  
FIGURE 1.1  
1 2 CHAPTER ONE Why Draw?  
Drawings attract people to an idea. It’s true that a picture is worth a  
thousand words, and drawing has withstood the test of time, having been  
used as an effective communications tool for tens of thousands of years.  
This isn’t an exaggeration. Figure 1.2 is a recreation of a drawing from the  
rock shelters of Bhimbetka. Some of the drawings in these shelters are  
considered to be 30,000 years old. In today’s digital age, drawing is not only  
still relevant but needed more than ever.  
FIGURE 1.2  
Source\: Based on Bhimbetka drawings \(Kent Eisenhuth\)  
Drawing is a quick and easy way to start putting form to an early idea.  
Let’s go back to our original mind map of the benefits of drawing and further  
examine the three main types of benefits that come from including drawing  
in your product development process.  
EXPLORE AN IDEA  
Drawing is a low-­ risk exercise that allows you to rapidly work through many  
concepts. Early in the process, I usually start with some quick doodles. The  
focus on quantity over quality helps me clear out initial biases, and it forces  
me to think of alternate solutions. It brings me closer to the problem at hand,  
because thinking about alternative ideas causes the creative juices to flow. Explore an Idea 3  
Usually my first few ideas are bad before they’re even penned. It’s  
usually my fourth, fifth, and sixth doodles that represent ideas that begin to  
hold water.  
I’m not alone in this line of thinking. As my former professor David Bullock  
used to say, there’s nothing quite like developing an idea through mind, hand,  
and paper. Putting a multitude of ideas down on paper instead of focusing  
on the first thing that comes to mind leads to a better solution. Breadth  
in thinking enables you to discover connections between two seemingly  
disconnected ideas, which can lead you to focusing on the right answer.  
In doing this, I found that it’s important to get the bad ideas down  
on paper first so I can open up the headspace to focus on other, more  
thoughtful ideas. Most of my doodles have a long-­ standing date with the  
trash can, and they never see the light of day. They’re merely chicken scratch  
and that’s okay. I’m the only one who has to understand them at this point in  
the process. Once seeing the idea on paper, I can better understand why it  
might not work, learn from it, and move on to a better idea. I learn a lot from  
these quick doodles. In Figure 1.3 you can see some quick doodles I created  
to help me explore some ideas for visualizing an organizational structure  
within a company.  
FIGURE 1.3  
At one point, I was working on a website that would shed light on the  
digital divide in America. Our goal was to highlight segments in the American  
population that live in urban and rural areas alike. We wanted to spotlight  
critical issues affecting these areas that were caused by a lack of high-­ speed  
Internet access.  
The first goal was to compare the two categories. To do this, the first  
and most obvious way was to show two tables side by side as drawn in 4 CHAPTER ONE Why Draw?  
Figure 1.4. One table would list all the urban counties, their populations, and  
the number of people without Internet access. The second would focus on  
the rural counties and do the same. During this process, I knew I wanted to  
get the obvious ideas down on paper first.  
FIGURE 1.4  
Once I was able to get the obvious down on paper, I was able to think  
more clearly about the information we wanted to share and how it would  
support the underlying story. As a result, I started to think about how  
different charts and graphs might be used to display the information in a  
more insightful way.  
For example, I explored how a graph might help us compare access rates  
across the two categories. Additionally, I wanted to explore where the most  
affected people are located. Finally, I wanted to see how resulting issues  
affected the populations in each category. My later explorations, as depicted  
in Figure 1.5, represent concepts that uncover more of these insights. I was  
even able to explore a few experimental ideas just so that I could start the  
right conversations with my teammates and project stakeholders.  
Drawing enables you to quickly explore alternate, possibly better ways to  
solve the problem at hand. It can help you understand when and why you  
should break the rules of your company’s underlying design guidelines and  
not just use an out-­ of-­ the-­ box component available to you.  
Drawing can help you intimately connect with the problem you’re trying  
to solve and explore a range of solutions that provide a range of benefits to Gain a Shared Understanding 5  
your product’s users. Too many times this part of the process is overlooked,  
and it shows in the end result. Product teams should never be happy  
with the status quo. We need to push the boundaries of our work. Let me  
ask you this, Do you want to create a product that meets expectations or  
exceeds them?  
FIGURE 1.5  
GAIN A SHARED UNDERSTANDING  
Drawing is essential to comprehension. A picture will resonate with your  
audience more than a long explanation. Remember, the earliest forms  
of communication were drawings. Early written languages often used  
pictograms to capture history, ideas, and concepts. With the growing use  
of emojis and pictures in our text communications, it almost feels like we’re  
getting back to that.  
Recently I had a chance to catch up with Professor Dan Boyarski, a  
professor emeritus at Carnegie Mellon University. During our chat, he was  
describing a guest lecture he gave to a class at CMU’s business school.  
Before he started his lecture, he tried to engage the business students by  
asking them to discuss a project they were working on. For this project, both  
individuals and teams were working on solving complex business problems.  
Professor Boyarski asked if anyone wanted to describe their problem. 6 CHAPTER ONE Why Draw?  
FIGURE 1.6  
FIGURE 1.7  
FIGURE 1.8  
FIGURE 1.9  
An individual stood up by his seat and spent about two to three minutes  
explaining his project. At the end of it, Professor Boyarski asked the class if  
they all understood the problem and if it was clear. He explained that most of  
the students were quiet and didn’t really respond.  
Another volunteer stood up and asked if he could use his chair as a  
visual aid. He moved to the center aisle in the lecture hall and explained the  
problem his team was trying to solve. He went on to explain that a lot of  
people drive to work. Once they’re at the office, their car sits for hours in a  
lot. His team was wondering how people without cars could use the idle cars  
to drive to meetings and other events out of the office. Each time he referred  
to the parked car, he pointed to the chair. At the end of his explanation,  
Professor Boyarski asked the business students if they understood the  
problem. This time several students nodded, and when asked why, the  
students answered, “Because he used his chair.”  
As the story goes, Professor Boyarski asked a third group to explain the  
problem they were solving, but this time use the available whiteboards in the  
room to explain it. A volunteer from this group described her group’s project.  
She explained how they were looking at the barges going up and down the  
three rivers surrounding Pittsburgh. As she began to speak, she drew lines  
representing the three rivers as depicted in Figure 1.6.  
Then she described how there are locks located on each river. As she was  
talking, she drew locks across each of the three rivers. She described how  
barges traveling in each direction have to travel through these locks. She  
drew boxes representing the barges at each lock station as highlighted in  
Figure 1.7.  
She went on to describe how each lock includes a little building, so she  
drew huts to represent the buildings. In each building there are a few people  
that manage traffic through the lock. This is necessary since you can only let  
one barge pass through the lock at a time. She drew people next to each of  
the huts as depicted in Figure 1.8.  
She said, “Our project is to look at an efficient and cost-­ effective way for  
these people to talk to each other as they control barge traffic on the rivers.”  
She drew lines connecting all the people across the different locks, shown in  
Figure 1.9.  
Once she put down her marker, the audience applauded. When Professor  
Boyarski asked the business students why they applauded, they described  
how the student told a story through building a drawing in a way that they  
could all quickly understand the problem at hand. Instead of talking about  
the problem, she showed it.  
This student used drawing to help her colleagues understand the problem  
and opened up the door for ideas and collaboration. Anyone Can Draw 7  
IMPROVE COLLABORATION  
In addition to using it as a tool to aid comprehension, we use drawing to  
build on each other’s ideas. As design thinking becomes a mainstream  
practice, we find ourselves making key product decisions at the whiteboard.  
At some companies, design thinking is the centerpiece of the product  
development process. At Google, we use design sprints to create solutions  
for complex design problems. Our cross-­ functional teammates spend a lot  
of time drawing and ideating with us designers. Key product decisions are  
made during these sessions, and drawing is the main collaboration tool used  
to ideate and build consensus across our teams. It’s a low-­ risk activity that  
drives alignment on an idea before a lot of time, resources, and work are  
invested in it. I’ll share more on this later on.  
ANYONE CAN DRAW  
Drawing is a means to an end. Your goal is not to create the best drawing, it’s  
to contribute to the best possible outcome for your team’s product. But even  
with this in mind, why is drawing so intimidating?  
According to Joseph Biondo, FAIA, professor of architecture at Lafayette  
University and author of House Equanimity, we stop drawing at an early age.  
As Professor Biondo explains, when we were children, our peers, parents,  
and teachers started providing feedback on our early and primitive drawings.  
Because of this, we limited our skills and crushed our creative spirit, and in  
most cases, we gave up. This is why the majority of us have the drawing  
skills of a young child. As far as this book is concerned, our drawings  
only have to be good enough to hang up on our kitchen refrigerator, or  
“refrigerator museum” as he puts it.  
# JOSEPH BIONDO, FAIA, ON THE VALUE OF DRAWING  
Early in my career, I had the privilege of working  
with Joseph Biondo, professor of architecture  
at Lafayette College, author of House  
Equanimity \(Oscar Riera Ojeda Publisher, 2018\) and  
AIA Fellow. Here’s what he had to say on the value of  
drawing, overcoming the fear of jumping into it, and  
its role as a communications tool in the process.  
He encourages everyone to draw immediately  
and stresses the need to go back to the renais-  
sance time, when things were built with higher  
purpose. People used hands and minimal drawings  
to convey what needed to be done. “Everyone was  
an artist.” Since then, the process of making has  
become much too complex. He advocates keeping  
it primal and simple. He explained the minimalism  
in construction drawings. People would just draw  
on the wall of the house to work through the  
problem with the contractor. When these people  
drew, it ensured the process was totally integrated  
and everyone was working together. 8 CHAPTER ONE Why Draw?  
Drawings are especially valuable in the early  
stages of design. Drawing with a pencil enables  
greater control of the line. The illustration above  
provides a good example of this claim. The texture  
of the paper is important because it affects the line.  
The ambiguity created by lines on the paper is  
important and leaves room for more conversation  
and dialog with peers. If you show a high-­ fidelity,  
finite drawing, you’re missing out on an opportunity  
for this type of discussion. He refers to this overly  
worked drawing as choreographed collaboration.  
According to Joe, most students are intimidated  
when staring at the blank canvas, sketchbook, or  
whiteboard. He asks them to draw a deliberate line.  
This is a metaphor to the mark you leave in life. Are  
you going to be timid about it? You have to  
approach it with curiosity and zeal. It’s important to  
practice drawing and do it often.  
By not focusing on creating the perfect drawing, you’ll free up the  
headspace to focus more on the idea you’re trying to communicate, and  
you’ll automatically become better at drawing. Would you like to see this in  
practice? Let’s try something out. Grab a sheet of paper and a pen.  
Draw a few quick scribbles. You don’t have to think about it. Just do it.  
Figure 1.10 provides a few example squiggles to get you started.  
Next, can you draw a wedge and a dot as depicted in Figure 1.11?  
Try it out.  
Add a dot and a wedge shape to each of your scribbles and voilà! You just  
drew a flock of birds! Figure 1.12 provides a few examples. Anyone Can Draw 9

FIGURE 1.12  
Not sure how to turn your scribble into a bird drawing? You might have  
to be creative in how you add your wedges. Check out Figure 1.13 for some  
inspiration. Sometimes a picture frame helps too!  
FIGURE 1.13  
So what do you think? Did it work for you? This exercise is called Squiggle  
Birds, and it is an example of a warm-­ up exercise I’ve used during cross-functional  
design workshops to get everyone in the right mood to start  
drawing and exploring new product ideas. Not only is this a great warm-­ up  
exercise, it’s a good method for proving that anyone can draw. Thank you to  
my friend, mentor, and fellow Googler Vaishali Jain, who introduced me to  
this activity years ago. 10 CHAPTER ONE Why Draw?  
If you’re on a plane heading across the United States to your next  
meeting, you should be able to vastly improve your drawing skills before  
you land. You can even start practicing the ideas and concepts described  
in this book and draw along with me. By doing this, you’ll supercharge the  
collaboration skills you’ll be using in your upcoming meeting.  
RIGHT TIME AND PLACE  
Before we go any further, let’s take a minute to acknowledge something.  
Drawing has its time and place. Doodling and drawing are fine tools to  
employ at any point in your design process. That said, there are times where  
it works better than others. Here are a few instances when drawing can lead  
to a great outcome.  
In the Beginning  
I rely on drawing very early in the design process. It works really well when  
we’re just starting to give form to solutions to a large, ambiguous problem.  
I’ll draw a mind map or a diagram that helps me organize my thoughts  
and understand the problem space. I’ll draw a process diagram to help me  
understand the journey of a user and to better empathize with them.  
Once I have a few ideas in mind, I’ll use drawing to explore a range of  
ways in which a product can solve the problem at hand. Usually this is a  
visualization concept or a flow of screen proposals. I’ll explore conservative  
and edgier ideas alike. It’s typical for a designers to develop 30 or more  
drawings per day during this phase of the process \(Buxton 2007, 160\). At  
this point in the process, it’s all about exploring as many ideas as possible.  
It’s a low-­ risk activity after all.  
Once I have some of these big ideas down on paper, I usually include  
another designer and researcher in my process. I like to sketch with them  
so we can build on each other’s ideas. It’s also a good early sanity check for  
me. My sketches are typically gestural and leave a lot to the imagination, and  
that’s by design. I’m trying to invite others to build on my ideas. I’ve found  
some of my best design work has started in sketching sessions with one or  
two other colleagues.  
During Workshops  
As previously mentioned, drawing is an essential collaboration tool.  
Sometimes collaboration takes place in the form of design sprints and  
workshops. Carolyn Knight and Steve Hassard are two design sprint  
leaders at Google. If you’re not familiar with design sprints, it’s essentially a Right Time and Place 11  
version of an extended design workshop. Carolyn and Steve have sprinted  
with countless teams inside and outside of the company. One thing they  
confirmed is that drawing is essential to the sprint process. In fact, it fits  
into most stages of the sprint process. You may already know this if you’re  
familiar with the Google Ventures design sprint process and the book Sprint,  
How to Solve Big Problems and Test Ideas in Just Five Days by Jake Knapp,  
John Zeratsky, and Braden Kowitz \(Simon & Schuster, 2016\).  
According to Carolyn and Steve, drawing is key to many aspects of the  
design sprint, starting with the day one icebreaker activity. Icebreakers are  
a good way to break down the barriers to drawing. As the sprint progresses,  
they are invaluable to get engineers into drawing. For the people who aren’t  
designers in the room, an activity like this pushes them to where they  
need to be.  
As the workshop continues, the drawings help people understand which  
seemingly disparate ideas can neatly fit together. I’ve also been involved  
in countless sprints and workshops. During these activities, it’s really  
interesting to see the cross-­ pollination of ideas and the consensus forming  
around one or two big ideas.  
According to Carolyn and Steve, some form of drawing is used in nearly  
every sprint, and seeing these drawings enables people to better understand  
how the pieces of an idea best fit together. In this case, drawing is a magical  
tool that enables this to happen. It’s amazing to see great ideas unfold in  
these sessions, and it has been a go-­ to method for my own design process.  
To Facilitate Conversations  
Drawing can also enable you to facilitate a conversation on a complex topic  
as discussed in the earlier story of Professor Boyarski’s lecture \(Figures 1.6  
through 1.9\). It’s a way of informally showing and not telling. When I worked  
in consulting, I applied design to many complex business problems.  
I remember working with a large logistics and truck rental company.  
We were helping them rethink the driver experience. During a few informal  
discussions with key executives, we were sharing our research and findings.  
The conversation was becoming very complex, and I found the group was  
getting lost in thought. People’s eyes were glazing over and others were just  
blindly arguing their points.  
As a result, I started a mind map of our ideas. Keep in mind,  
whiteboarding was not part of the culture of this particular client. At the  
time, I thought I wasn’t adding any value to the conversation at hand, and I  
was just doodling some nonsense on a whiteboard. During the conversation,  
the executive team started pointing to my sketch and referencing it in their  
conversation. At one point, the president of the client’s logistics division got  
out of his seat and redrew most of my drawings. At the time, I was mad at  
myself for not understanding the problem space. 12 CHAPTER ONE Why Draw?  
During a quick break in the conversation, my mentor, Matthew  
Bartholomew, who had witnessed the scene, explained that I shouldn’t be  
mad at myself and that it was a big deal for these people to start drawing on  
top of my mind map. Apparently this was something he had never witnessed  
in a meeting before.  
When the conversation continued, other executives followed suit. It  
was amazing to see how the other people started adding to my drawing  
and using it as a communications tool for facilitating and organizing their  
thoughts. What I originally thought was nonsense turned out to add a  
lot of value.  
This experience helped me realize that drawing is such a versatile  
tool. I also realized that I needed to brush up on my showmanship at the  
whiteboard, because I planned on doing this more often—­ especially for  
those that don’t consider themselves “whiteboarding types.”  
Unbuttoning the Process  
Digital designers and producers, really anyone working in User Experience  
\(UX\), love a good process. Sometimes these processes become too  
buttoned up. It’s important to have fun, and drawing is a way to do so.  
Sometimes a few quirky doodles give your work the personality it needs.  
Who knows? Maybe that squiggly bird you drew earlier will find its way into  
your next design presentation.  
Having fun with drawing is a great way to unbutton the process and  
enable your colleagues, partners, and stakeholders to loosen up and join in  
on the creative process. When we’re all having fun, we do our best work.  
Eliciting the Right Kind of Feedback  
If the process is done right, you’ll receive a lot of constructive feedback  
from your team. The low fidelity of a drawing implies that your idea isn’t  
fully baked and that you’re looking for feedback. When designers show  
high-­ fidelity computer-­ generated mockups, the rest of the team is more  
likely to focus on the finer details, and they don’t provide feedback on the  
foundational idea you’re trying to build upon.  
A few years ago, I was working on redesigning a very prominent cloud  
product. We were rebuilding the experience from the ground up. Early on, we  
used drawing to explore many new ideas, capture the product’s information  
architecture, and explore some new patterns for navigating the product. As  
I was presenting the drawings to the stakeholder team, a very prominent  
engineering director interrupted me just to thank me for showing drawings  
and nothing more. After this, I noticed members of his team perking up  
and actively providing feedback and building on our ideas. It was a great Right Time and Place 13  
moment, although I was surprised that the team hadn’t been sharing  
preliminary drawings or process work in the past.  
# CAROLYN KNIGHT & STEVE HASSARD\: GOOGLE  
# SPRINT LEADERS  
During my time with them, the Google sprint  
leaders shared several anecdotes and  
stories. It became clear that drawing is an  
essential part of sprint culture. Here’s more on what  
they had to say during our conversation.  
Tell us about the role of drawing in the design  
sprint process.  
It starts with the icebreaker. In one case, sprint  
participants were asked to draw a portrait of the  
person next to them. Initially, this request really  
freaked people out. There was that moment where  
everyone was looking at each other like “can we not  
do this?” Once people pushed through the exercise,  
then saw the other person’s reaction to it, the  
energy fundamentally changed in the room. For a  
cross-­ functional group, this activity pushed them to  
where they needed to be and opened the door for  
enriched collaboration later in the sprint.  
When people are comfortable drawing, it’s a sign  
that people can be more open and creative. It’s good  
to get people out of their element and push them a  
little. If they’re not doing drawings, the design turns  
into a requirements list or bill of materials, which  
don’t help anyone. The pictures are worth a thou-  
sand words, which is better for moving quickly,  
especially when people from different functional  
areas such as engineering and product manage-  
ment are working alongside the design team.  
Tell us about a time when drawing helped a  
diverse group gain a shared understanding of a  
difficult problem.  
During the Hacking Health conference, we  
organized a sprint to design an app for case  
workers. We brought in other general stakehold-  
ers. Some worked in education, some were  
caseworkers, and so on. Drawing facilitated a  
shared understanding of the problem space  
across an array of people and backgrounds  
including doctors, nurses, caseworkers, people  
working in education, and general stakeholders.  
The team drew a map of the problem space. The  
visual of this map was important because  
without it, the conversation was all over  
the place.  
Tell us about a time when drawing enabled  
people to collectively add to a new idea.  
We ran a sprint with the City of San Jose to improve  
the 311 and 911 call center experience. In this case,  
it took some time for the participants to get into the  
groove of ideating without getting bogged down by  
potential bureaucratic constraints imposed by the  
city government.  
By drawing, the participants were able to  
have their own heads-­ down time, no matter how  
“impossible” their ideas would be. Once these  
ideas were shared, it enabled the collective  
group to start riffing on the ideas and get into  
the right brainstorming mode. This wouldn’t  
have happened if it wasn’t for the individual  
drawing time because people would have had  
an opportunity to interrupt and shoot down an  
idea prematurely. 14 CHAPTER ONE Why Draw?  
Challenging the Status Quo  
For this last point, I’m going to get on my soapbox for a minute. If you’re a  
designer, please make note of this. Drawing unlocks a part of the process  
that has been getting lost in recent years. Yes, this is true, and please hear  
me out on this one.  
More often than not, the design of most digital products is based on  
some sort of component library. It’s very tempting to jump right into using  
your library’s predefined patterns, components, and sticker sheets. It’s easy  
for designers to fall into the rut of jumping into creating high-­ fidelity designs  
by using canned templates, patterns, and designs already provided. Some  
designers thrive on this, and they insist this is the way to go. While that  
might work for very minor additions to mature products, it doesn’t work  
when starting a new challenge. In my opinion, opportunities are missed  
when this happens. C H A P T E R T W O  
# REFRAMING  
# OUR THINKING  
Historically, drawing has been perceived as an inherited talent. We grew  
up under the impression that in order to draw, we must be able to  
create an accurate representation of the objects in the environment around  
us. Being able to take a blank canvas or sheet of paper and draw an accurate  
representation of a complex image takes a tremendous amount of talent,  
and those who have figured out how to do it well are true artists. That said,  
this perception of drawing has hindered our ability as adults to try it for  
ourselves.  
One of the best ways to get started with drawing is to jump in and  
start. Let’s first create a few drawings. Bear with me through this, because  
it will take a few minutes to get through. Incidentally, this is an exercise  
introduced by Manuel Lima, which we like to share with attendees of our  
data visualization workshops, and it is based on the work of Santiago Ortiz  
and his article “45 Ways To Represent Two Quantities.” Please locate and  
grab the nearest pen and paper. I want you to think about two numbers in  
Figure 2.1.  
How many ways can you represent these values? Take a few minutes to  
think about it and jot down a few ideas in your sketchpad. There’s no wrong  
answer to this question. This exercise is meant to inspire divergent thinking.  
Just as in digital product design and UX, we often explore many concepts  
and ideas for solving the same problem. We’re going to apply that same  
thinking in this exercise and come up with many ways to visualize these  
two values.  
Try to come up with a new drawing every minute. There’s no wrong  
answer to this. If you think your idea will work, try it. You’ll be surprised at  
what you come up with toward the end of the exercise. Jot down a few  
ideas, then turn the page.  
FIGURE 2.1  
15 16 CHAPTER TWO Reframing Our Thinking  
FIGURE 2.2  
There are endless ways to represent these values. Here are a few of  
my own explorations. I started by representing 7 and 14 using alternate  
characters, such as the Roman numerals displayed in Figure 2.2.  
Another familiar way to represent these values is to use a series of ticks  
and slashes. Each slash represents a multiple of 5 as depicted by Figure 2.3.  
If you enjoy board games as much as I do, you’ll recognize that this is a  
common way to keep score in some games.  
In Figure 2.4, I turned the lines into something more abstract, like points. I  
used basic Gestalt principles to create a visual grouping of the dots. The first  
cluster has seven points. The second cluster has 14.  
So what do you think? Here’s another example—instead of using points, l  
used basic shapes, like the interlocking triangles displayed in Figure 2.5.  
FIGURE 2.3  
FIGURE 2.4  
FIGURE 2.5  
FIGURE 2.6  
FIGURE 2.7  
Now, let’s think about the relationship between the two numbers. I  
considered using basic elements, such as lines of varying lengths. One  
line might be half the length of the other, since half of 14 is 7, as depicted  
by Figure 2.6. I even combined them into one shape that is split in half as  
shown in Figure 2.7.  
I thought about representing these values as time. I depicted 700 and  
1400 hours by drawing a clock as you see in Figure 2.8. This might seem a  
bit edgier and abstract, but it still works. What do you think?  
Looking at these examples, we can probably agree that they’re all unique.  
That said, these divergent concepts all have more in common than you  
might think. I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that all of your drawings  
can be distilled down to the same basic shapes and marks. These basic Breaking It Down 17  
shapes and marks are part of a primitive visual vocabulary we developed  
for describing the two values. In this chapter, we will take a closer look and  
break down each example from the exercise.  
FIGURE 2.8  
BREAKING IT DOWN  
I’ve distilled all of my representations of 7 and 14 down to the collage of  
shapes pictured in Figure 2.9. Take a look at the elements within the collage.  
Can you find them in the exercise examples? Let’s take a closer look.  
FIGURE 2.9  
The Roman numerals were made up of connected lines. The arrows in  
Figure 2.10 point to the basic shapes and marks in the collage that I used to  
draw the Roman numeral.  
FIGURE 2.10 18 CHAPTER TWO Reframing Our Thinking  
I drew clusters of points, one consisting of seven points and the other  
consisting of 14. The arrows in Figure 2.11 highlight the elements used  
in this representation of the two values. In this case, a point was reused  
multiple times.  
FIGURE 2.11  
In one case, I drew a primitive set of shapes. I used a set of 7 and  
14 interlocking triangles to represent the two values, as depicted in  
Figure 2.12.  
FIGURE 2.12  
When visualizing the relationship between 7 and 14, I drew two boxes, as  
shown in Figure 2.13. The second is half the length of the first, representing  
the two values. I added some shading to my boxes to give the drawing some  
energy and flair; however, that wasn’t necessary.  
FIGURE 2.13 Introducing the System 19  
I think you get the idea. Can you find the shapes used in the clock drawing  
in Figure 2.14. These basic lines, points, and shapes are part of a basic  
vocabulary of a primitive visual language I developed to represent the values  
of 7 and 14.  
FIGURE 2.14  
I’d like to encourage you to think about how you might combine the  
shapes in Figure 2.15 in other ways to represent the values of 7 and 14. If  
you put your mind to it, you’ll find that the possibilities are endless.  
FIGURE 2.15  
INTRODUCING THE SYSTEM  
When it comes to drawing digital experiences, drawing is a means to an  
end. It serves its purpose in the product development process. You can  
use it to bring clarity to your own ideas, and you can use it as a tool for  
development, alignment, collaboration, and sharing. It’s a valuable tool that  
supports the ultimate outcomes we’re striving to achieve. It doesn’t take  
talent to draw well enough to accomplish these things within your team, and  
as demonstrated by the Squiggle Birds exercise in Chapter 1, “Why Draw?,”  
anyone can draw.  
During the first 15 years of my professional career, I started to realize that  
I was reusing the same basic symbols to draw my digital product ideas. You  
may have realized the same when analyzing your drawings of the quantities  
7 and 14. While I thought my drawings were utter trash \(I was professionally 20 CHAPTER TWO Reframing Our Thinking  
trained as an artist\), I noticed I received a lot of compliments from my  
design colleagues on how well my drawings were crafted and how well they  
communicated my ideas.  
It became apparent that my system for drawing was effective. Later in my  
career, I started researching this idea of drawing as a system. As I started  
researching the topic, I realized several authors and scholars have billed  
drawing as a visual language. Languages are examples of systems, and I  
realized my hypotheses and assumptions of my own work were leading me  
somewhere.  
As I continued looking into this, I came across the research and writings  
of Dr. Neil Cohn, founder of Visual Language Lab and author of The Visual  
Language of Comics \(Bloomsbury Academic, 2014\). Dr. Cohn validated a lot  
of my own thoughts in how I approached drawing in my day-­ to-­ day work.  
He proposes that drawings are made up of visual vocabulary that possess  
a regularized and/or iconic meaning among a group of people. In our case,  
we’re working with people who design and build digital products.  
# DR. NEIL COHN\: DRAWING AS A VISUAL LANGUAGE  
Dr. Cohn explains drawing as a visual  
language. Incidentally, a language is a great  
example of a system. Languages are made  
up of several words that can be combined and  
structured to convey meaning. There are endless  
ways to combine words. Over the years, several  
scholars have viewed drawing as a visual language.  
Drawings are made up of a series of basic shapes  
that possess a regularized and/or iconic meaning  
among a group of people. Additionally, you can  
apply structure and a basic visual grammar to the  
images for conveying information and storytelling.  
Dr. Cohn teaches a drawing course at Tilburg  
University in the Netherlands. Over the years, he has  
fine‑tuned the way in which he introduces drawing  
to his students. First he’ll ask the students this\:  
“Can you speak?” The response from the class is an  
overwhelming yes. Next, he’ll ask what they speak  
in. This question is met with a range of answers,  
usually types of languages, including English,  
Spanish, German, and so on. So the next question  
becomes this\: “Can you draw? What do you draw  
in?” The answers to these two questions are usually  
all over the place. First of all, not everyone believes  
they can draw. According to Dr. Cohn, we don’t have  
a parallel set of answers to these two sets of  
questions and the answers to these questions are  
asymmetrical.  
When speaking a particular language like French,  
English, or Spanish, we pull words from our vocabu-  
lary that enable us to speak. If we think of drawing  
as a language, then there’s an underlying vocabu-  
lary that comes with it. The languages also have a  
particular structure and grammar that come  
with them.  
So how might this apply to digital products?  
For those of us working in this space, we speak  
in “digital products.” Our visual vocabulary is  
made up of symbols and shapes that we’re  
already familiar with, such as UI components,  
screens, and people—­ graphical units that we’re  
already working with on a regular basis. If we can  
become comfortable with drawing these basic  
units, we are on our way to building our own  
visual vocabulary within the digital product  
visual language. Introducing the System 21  
Assuming our visual language is UX or digital product design, our  
drawings will be made up of shapes that resemble the elements we interact  
with in most apps. As depicted by Figure 2.16, some of these elements  
might be screen-based, including form fields, buttons, check boxes, mouse  
cursors, lists, tables, and charts.  
FIGURE 2.16  
In other cases, as also depicted in Figure 2.17, we’ll need to draw non-screen-­  
based elements to tell a story about our idea. This might include  
basic people figures, devices, and an assortment of diagrams that will  
enable us to organize our thoughts and research. This is the start of our  
drawing system. Now, let’s compare drawing to another system, one that I  
think is more fun.  
FIGURE 2.17 22 CHAPTER TWO Reframing Our Thinking  
I like to compare drawing to a popular construction toy. Legos were a  
huge part of my childhood. In fact, I had 56 Lego sets fully constructed in my  
parents’ basement. The space was a maker’s dream. In fact, in the 1980s,  
did you know that Lego actually called itself Lego System? That is because  
they are indeed a system. Did you know that you can combine 6 standard  
4x2 Lego bricks \(Figure 2.18\) in over 915 million combinations \(Eilers, 2005\)?  
FIGURE 2.18  
Lego offers several standard brick types in varying configurations.  
Each brick has its own purpose. There are 1x1, 2x1, 2x2, 3x2, and 4x2  
configurations. Brick shapes may include cylinders, squares, rectangles, and  
triangles. These pieces can be combined in infinite ways to build any sort  
of model we can dream up. When we see the end result, we experience the  
model as a whole—­ the sum of the parts, as shown in Figure 2.19.  
FIGURE 2.19  
A great product drawing should enable us to focus on the solution as a  
whole—­ the sum of the parts. Now, let’s think about the very primitive icons,  
shapes, and symbols that we might use to represent the basic UI elements  
found in our digital products. If we think about these elements as our Lego  
bricks, as suggested in Figure 2.20, we can combine them in infinite ways  
to share and collaborate on any digital product idea, just as we can combine  
Lego bricks in infinite ways to make any model we wish. Common Drawings 23  
FIGURE 2.20  
I think we can all get behind these metaphors and consider drawing a  
system. If I asked you to think about how to break a product drawing into  
some basic, reusable, Lego brick‑like parts, you might have difficulty in doing  
so. You might have the same feeling people get when sitting in front of a  
blank canvas attempting to draw a real-­ world object. Once you know what to  
look for, it becomes easy.  
COMMON DRAWINGS  
I’m going to share a few common UX drawings in a style that has worked  
for me, and I’ll break them down into their metaphorical Lego bricks. If you  
create and build digital experiences, then you’ll likely use these drawings  
in your day-­ to-­ day work with your product team. Here are a few types of  
drawings nearly every digital product design process includes. In fact, if you  
work in the field, you’ve probably already seen them. Let’s take a look at what  
they’re used for and then how they can be deconstructed.  
Site Maps  
Site maps are similar to mind maps. Their top-­ down hierarchical layout  
helps us understand proposed navigation schemes and the organization 24 CHAPTER TWO Reframing Our Thinking  
of content. In Figure 2.21 we see a mapping of the screens that make up a  
mobile health tracking app.  
FIGURE 2.21  
This diagram is made up of boxes and lines. In this case, I used a texture  
made up of vertical lines to highlight screens with read-­ only content. The  
squares without fill textures represent pages that require user input. We’ll  
discuss shading and textures later in Chapter 6, “Illustrating Light, Motion, and  
Other Concepts.” I used an inverted triangle to represent the starting point  
of the diagram. If you can draw the elements in Figure 2.22, you can draw  
a site map.  
FIGURE 2.22  
Journey Maps, Flow Charts, and Sequential Diagrams  
Sequential diagrams can be used to map processes, journeys, and systems.  
In design, we use them to visualize journeys and tasks that are completed  
by users. Any journey, sequence, or process can be visualized using a  
sequential diagram.  
We can use sequential diagrams to capture any process, even simple  
everyday processes. Let’s start with a simple one. The photos in the next  
three figures loosely depict the process for preparing sweet potatoes. We  
usually start by rinsing the potatoes, as shown in Figure 2.23. We peel and  
chop the potatoes as suggested in Figure 2.24. Finally we coat in olive oil,  
season, and place them in the oven in Figure 2.25. Common Drawings 25  
FIGURE 2.23  
FIGURE 2.24  
A process diagram as depicted in Figure 2.26 can be used to depict all the  
steps in this same process as depicted in Figures 2.23, 2.24, and 2.25. 26 CHAPTER TWO Reframing Our Thinking  
FIGURE 2.25  
FIGURE 2.26  
When we’re redesigning a digital product, we usually start by mapping  
the current journeys in completing a task or achieving a goal within the app.  
The maps are then used to identify pain points in that journey. They highlight  
opportunities for removing or combining steps and eliminating people’s pain  
points within the process. This map provides a guide for creating a new and  
improved journey that will provide direction for our product’s redesign.  
Going back to the fitness app we looked at a moment ago in Figure 2.21,  
let’s map how an athlete might look up and modify details on a recent run  
automatically tracked by the fitness app. It might look something like the  
process diagram we see in Figure 2.27. Common Drawings 27  
FIGURE 2.27  
These diagrams are made up of boxes, arrows, repeating lines, and  
sometimes icons. A shape or symbol should be included to provide a clear  
starting point in this picture. The elements we used for this diagram are  
displayed in Figure 2.28. 28 CHAPTER TWO Reframing Our Thinking  
FIGURE 2.28  
Mind Maps  
Mind maps are a great way to organize information. Product design  
teams typically use them to organize ideas, thoughts, and research. These  
maps especially work well when organizing the information hierarchically  
because they resemble a tree-­ like structure. Figure 2.29 depicts an alternate  
representation of the mind map I created for Chapter 1. It maps and  
categorizes the benefits of drawing.  
FIGURE 2.29  
If you look at the mind map in Figure 2.30, you’ll see that it is simply a  
cluster of points connected by lines. If you’re not comfortable with drawing,  
points and lines are some of the easiest things to draw. Common Drawings 29  
FIGURE 2.30  
Digital Products, Screens, Interfaces, and Components  
We often draw interfaces and screens that will be available in our new  
product. In Figure 2.31 you can see a few sample interface drawings. The  
drawing on the left likely represents a screen that’s part of a mobile app. The  
drawing on the right represents a screen that is part of a desktop dashboard.  
At first glance, these drawings may seem complex. Can you break them  
down into their fundamental elements?  
FIGURE 2.31 30 CHAPTER TWO Reframing Our Thinking  
The basic shape containing the drawing mirrors the shape of the device’s  
screen that will display our app. As highlighted in Figure 2.32, we typically  
use boxes to represent rectangular devices, and we use circles to represent  
other devices like watches.  
FIGURE 2.32  
Interface elements within the screen layout are made up of basic shapes,  
points, and lines. Let’s take a look at the examples in Figure 2.33. We can use  
thick lines to represent headlines. Blocks of thinner lines might represent text  
as depicted in the left and center drawings in Figure 2.33. Boxes with an X  
can be used to represent an image or icon as illustrated in the center drawing  
in Figure 2.33. Combinations of boxes are used to represent form inputs and  
buttons as depicted by the drawing on the right in Figure 2.33. We will cover  
more specifics in later chapters.  
FIGURE 2.33 Common Drawings 31  
The collection of diagrams and drawings displayed in Figure 2.34  
represent the majority of drawings you’ll need to create with your team.  
FIGURE 2.34  
If we were to take inventory of all the shapes and elements we used  
in these drawings, you’ll notice they have a lot in common. They can all 32 CHAPTER TWO Reframing Our Thinking  
be distilled down into the same set of basic shapes and lines displayed  
in Figure 2.35. Even with shading, some of the shapes in the figure are  
essentially a variation on a theme. These are the building blocks of your  
visual library.  
FIGURE 2.35  
When you can distill a drawing down into these basic forms, you’ll find  
that drawing is much more approachable, and you’ll pick it up more quickly.  
You’ll spend less time thinking about how to draw the picture and more  
about the idea it represents.  
Next, let’s take a closer look at the marks we make on the paper in order  
to draw these common elements. C H A P T E R T H R E E  
# LINES AND  
# POINTS  
Now that we’ve reviewed some common drawings and broken them  
apart into their basic shape elements, or building blocks, we’re going to  
go a level deeper as metephorically illustrated in Figure 3.1.  
Let’s examine the lines and points we use to draw these shapes, be  
mindful of how these marks are constructed can make or break a drawing.  
Believe it or not, the very essence of your ideas and how they’re perceived by  
your colleagues can be held within these marks.  
FIGURE 3.1  
33 34 CHAPTER THREE Lines and Points  
TELLING STORIES WITH LINES  
Simple lines can be used to tell a rich story, and the way in which they’re  
drawn can communicate a lot of information. Let’s take a look at the drawing  
by Vincent Van Gogh in Figure 3.2.  
FIGURE 3.2  
Source\: Die Brücke von Arles, Vincent Willem Van Gogh  
When we first look at this image, we can see that he obviously used lines  
to draw the structural elements in the composition. This includes outlines  
of the stones and the wooden beams that make up the drawbridge. For this,  
he used straight lines. It’s when we take a closer look at this drawing that we  
notice the more interesting applications of lines.  
Notice how Van Gogh uses lines to represent the grass on the right  
river bank \(Figure 3.3\). The direction of the line implies the growth of the  
grass. The exaggerated nature of each line gives the grass an organic and  
overgrown feel.  
Growing up, I spent a lot of time painting landscapes and scenes from  
nature. I always found water to be one of the most difficult materials to  
represent in a drawing or painting. Van Gogh’s use of lines to represent water  
is just brilliant \(Figure 3.4\). The direction of the repeating lines implies a  
stillness in the water. His use of stacked lines also implies a reflection and a  
light source in the scene. Telling Stories with Lines 35  
FIGURE 3.3  
FIGURE 3.4  
Finally, he used different line weights to represent light and shadows.  
Notice the diagonal cross braces that make up the underside of the  
drawbridge frame \(Figure 3.5\). The beams are represented with thicker lines,  
which implies that this portion of the bridge lies within a shadow.  
FIGURE 3.5  
As you can see from this example, the possibilities are endless. The  
direction, speed, and pressure applied when we draw our lines can tell a lot  
about the ideas we’re trying to develop and share. Let’s take a look at a few  
ways in which you can draw different types of lines in your UX drawings. 36 CHAPTER THREE Lines and Points  
Straight Lines  
Like the stones and wooden beams in the aforementioned Van Gogh drawing,  
our screen-­ based interface drawings will feature a lot of structured, geometric  
elements as highlighted in Figure 3.6. When you’re drawing these elements,  
line quality can make the difference between a bad drawing, a good drawing,  
and a great drawing.  
Using clean lines will enable viewers of the drawing to focus on the idea  
it represents rather than how it was drawn. Lines should be drawn with a  
single quick stroke of the pen.  
FIGURE 3.6  
Because of this, there is no shame in using the proper tools, such as  
the straight edge pictured in Figure 3.7. If you don’t have access to a ruler,  
triangle, or straight edge, you can even use the side of your smartphone.  
I’ve resorted to this while on the train, during my daily commute to  
New York City. Telling Stories with Lines 37  
FIGURE 3.7  
Remember, these are UX drawings. We’re not trying to ace architecture  
school. It’s okay to use tools. Poorly drawn shapes place extra cognitive  
load on a viewer. To prove this, let’s do an A/B test with the sample sales  
dashboard drawing in Figure 3.8.  
FIGURE 3.8  
I drew the image on the left without a straightedge. I used a straightedge  
to draw the image on the right. I think we can all agree that the right image  
is much easier to read. It also has a more polished and professional look,  
which can inspire confidence in the author. 38 CHAPTER THREE Lines and Points  
Circular Lines  
Circles are one of the most difficult shapes to draw. There are several  
tools that will make your life easy here. For curved lines that will represent  
important structures and shapes, it doesn’t hurt to use a protractor, compass,  
or circle template.  
FIGURE 3.9  
Take a look at the drawing of the watch face in Figure 3.10. The drawing  
on the left was drawn without a circle template. I used a circle template to  
draw the one on the right. Which is a clearer representation of a circular  
watch face?  
I’m fairly certain that if you’re designing an experience on a circular  
watch face, most of the UI elements will also be circular. All of the  
underlying lines used to create the drawing in Figure 3.11 were drawn with  
a circle template. Because of this, the visualization becomes the focal point  
of the drawing. Telling Stories with Lines 39  
FIGURE 3.10  
FIGURE 3.11  
Gestural Lines  
Just like Vincent Van Gogh, we can use lines to suggest direction. It’s  
important to keep this in mind as you’re drawing. When drawing a line, always  
think about where the line would logically originate and start there. End the line  
somewhere in the desired direction you want to go. Your line will most likely be  
thicker at its origin than at its end. This will give your line a gestural quality that  
implies direction and motion. It’s a small detail that goes a long way in making  
a drawing look polished. 40 CHAPTER THREE Lines and Points  
To bring this to life, let’s take a look at the example coming up in  
Figure 3.12. If you’re drawing grass growing out of the ground, you can use  
lines to represent blades of grass. Since grass grows from the ground up,  
start your lines at the ground level and work upward. We can add a nice  
curvy, gestural quality to each line to give the grass a lively, organic feel.  
FIGURE 3.12  
If you’re drawing an arrow as depicted in Figure 3.13, start with the head  
end of the arrow. The arrowhead will be placed at the end of your line. The  
tail of the arrow will appear to trail off, giving it a nice gestural quality.  
FIGURE 3.13  
Here are a few other examples to consider\: If you’re drawing a tree  
diagram, the lines should start at each branch’s origin and move outward.  
And if you’re using lines to represent light, the radiating lines should start at  
the light’s source and move outward, away from the source.  
Line Weight  
Just as Van Gogh used line weights to draw focus, you can do the same in  
your UX drawings. Thicker lines command more attention. You might use  
line thickness as a way to direct focus as suggested in Figure 3.14.  
Let’s take a look at an example in practice. In Figure 3.15, thick lines are  
used to create a focal point in the photos grid. This represents a photo that  
is selected for sharing. Telling Stories with Lines 41  
FIGURE 3.14  
FIGURE 3.15  
Finally, just like in the earlier Van Gogh example, lines can be used to  
represent concepts like light and shadow within a drawing, as shown in  
Figure 3.16. We’ll cover more on shading techniques later on in Chapter 6,  
“Illustrating Light, Motion, and Other Concepts.”  
As you can see, lines play an essential role in describing the objects in  
our visual library. They can elevate the polish and quality of your drawing.  
Well-­ drawn lines can enable your colleagues to focus on the content of 42 CHAPTER THREE Lines and Points  
your drawings. These marks possess a lot of magical qualities, and the  
possibilities are exciting. When creating your next drawing, think about each  
line and what it represents.  
FIGURE 3.17  
FIGURE 3.16  
MAKING MEANING WITH POINTS  
Points are the most basic marks we use in our drawings. They are a tiny part  
of a much larger image that carries meaning. In his book Visual Grammar  
\(Princeton Architectural Press, 2006\), Christian Leborg describes the point  
as something you cannot see or feel. It is a place without area and its  
position is defined by its x-­ , y-­ , and z-­ coordinates. When we’re drawing, we  
use a basic dot to represent a point. We often get this when we first touch  
the pen to a drawing surface \(Figure 3.17\).  
Simple points can carry a lot of meaning in our digital product drawings.  
To start, let’s take a look at some of the drawings we already discussed in  
Chapter 2, “Reframing Our Thinking.” To refresh your memory, take a look at  
the images in Figure 3.18 and Figure 3.19. These were some ways in which  
we represented the two values through an arrangement of points.  
FIGURE 3.18 Making Meaning with Points 43  
FIGURE 3.19  
Points can be used to delineate marks in our interface drawings. In  
Figure 3.20, points were used to symbolize unread messages in the email  
inbox sketch.  
FIGURE 3.20 44 CHAPTER THREE Lines and Points  
In Figure 3.21, the navigational element used in the image carousel was  
created by drawing a set of points.  
FIGURE 3.21  
Just as we did with lines, we can use larger points to draw focus. Notice  
how the larger point in Figure 3.21 creates a focal point. In this case, the  
larger point, marked by the focal point label, indicates which photo we’re  
looking at within the lineup of photos featured in the carousel.  
Remember the mind map we reviewed in Chapter 2? Here’s yet another  
version drawn with points \(Figure 3.22\). In this example, each point acts as  
a node and the diagram shows the relationships and connections between  
each node.  
Figure 3.23 depicts how points can be used to represent the concept of  
light and shadows. I’ll cover more on that later in Chapter 6. Tools and Materials 45  
FIGURE 3.22  
FIGURE 3.23  
These are just a few examples of how points can be used in your product  
drawings. Just like lines, points are another versatile mark in our collection.  
Being mindful of how and when we use points in our drawings can really  
enhance the way in which we communicate our ideas.  
TOOLS AND MATERIALS  
Tools and materials also make a difference in the quality of our drawings. In  
addition to the aforementioned circle templates and straightedges, a good  
set of pens and pencils and the right paper are equally important. 46 CHAPTER THREE Lines and Points  
For pens, I prefer Sakura’s Pigma Micron pens. These are often sold in a set  
that includes multiple pens that can produce line weights of varying widths.  
The widths are measured in millimeters. This enables you to create thick  
lines for focal points and thinner lines for less important features. Medium  
pens can be used to create finer annotations and labels for your drawing.  
Some of the thin pens come in handy when creating shading and textures.  
Applying lines of varying thickness to your drawing will enable you to create  
drawings that look more polished and focused.  
I also have a set of Faber-­ Castell graphite sketch pencils. I break them out  
when I’m creating higher quality drawings that I’ll share with my colleagues.  
The degrees of softness of the graphite varies across the set. The harder  
pencils are nice for writing labels, annotations, and structural lines in the  
drawing. The softer pencils are nice for shading, creating focal points, and  
more gestural organic lines. The graphite also smudges nicely.  
Finally, paper matters. Paper with more surface texture will enable you  
to create rougher, sketchier, and more ambiguous pencil lines. There are  
times when line ambiguity is key to communicating a feeling or the essence  
of your idea, as you learned from Professor Joe Biondo in Chapter 1, “Why  
Draw?” I’d suggest experimenting with pens, pencils, and various paper  
types to explore different styles. Then, find the right combination of tools  
and materials that works for you. It may take some time to do this, but it will  
make a difference, and it dramatically impacts the ways in which you make  
marks on the paper.  
The way in which you draw your lines and points will affect people’s focus,  
comprehension, and engagement with your drawing. Considerations like  
thickness, size, weight, and direction will enable you to start drawing with the  
finesse of a designer while enabling your shapes to carry rich meaning and  
allowing your greater drawing to convey a robust story about your idea.  
Now, let’s start using this knowledge to draw something. Let’s start drawing  
some of the shapes, symbols, and elements that we’ll reuse across all of our  
drawings. These are the elements of our visual library. We’ll start building  
drawings out of rectangles, then we’ll move on to other shapes like circles and  
triangles. We will also review some more complex symbols such as cursor  
hands and people. C H A P T E R F O U R  
# BUILDING FROM  
# RECTANGLES  
I claimed earlier that if you can draw boxes and arrows, you have what  
it takes to create a UX drawing—­ and a good one for that matter.  
Remember, in order to draw with your team, you don’t have to be a  
critically acclaimed artist, nor do you have to be a designer. Let’s start  
putting this claim to the test.  
Think about what we covered in the previous chapter and find your  
straightedge. While you’re at it, grab a pen or pencil and some paper. We’re  
going to take an in-­ depth look at all of the most common elements you’ll  
be using in your future product drawings. Let’s start by drawing some lines  
to form a basic box \(Figure 4.1\). Your lines don’t have to be perfectly level  
or parallel.  
FIGURE 4.1  
Next, let’s draw an arrow. Just as we discussed in Chapter 3, “Lines and  
Points,” think about the direction of the arrow and where to start and end  
your line \(Figure 4.2\).  
47 48 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
FIGURE 4.2  
Fill up your paper with boxes and arrows so you become comfortable with  
this process. I included my own practice sheet in Figure 4.3. Now, let’s see  
how we can use these shapes to create the basic building blocks of your  
visual language.  
FIGURE 4.3  
CREATING DIAGRAMS  
As previously mentioned in Chapter 1, “Why Draw?,” drawing can play an  
important role in helping you and your team synthesize the research by  
visualizing it. It can also help you plan the rest of your design process. It  
can enable you to align on requirements and a plan for execution. Let’s  
take a look at how boxes can be used to create a few key diagrams that will  
supercharge your team’s design process.  
Process Diagrams  
Boxes and arrows can be used to represent steps in a process diagram  
\(Figure 4.4\). They can be arranged in a stack or in a horizontal line. You can  
draw arrows to connect the boxes. Creating Diagrams 49  
FIGURE 4.4  
To make this diagram work, you can add labels that describe each step.  
I added a few very generic labels in Figure 4.5. You can also note information  
about the people and technology involved along the way. The entire diagram  
may represent a task or journey.  
FIGURE 4.5  
Remember the diagram that described the process for preparing and  
roasting a sweet potato in Chapter 2, “Reframing Our Thinking”? Figure 4.6  
is an example of a more stylized version of a process diagram. It was drawn  
using the same shapes listed earlier. It just includes some extra symbols and  
shading to add visual interest. It’s worth noting that these extra accents and  
details are not essential in creating this diagram.  
FIGURE 4.6  
Now, let’s try a version where we rotate one of the boxes 45  
degrees to form a diamond \(Figure 4.7\). This typically represents  
a conditional, dependency, or decision point in a process  
diagram. You can even add a question mark for effect. Most  
process diagrams include conditions and dependencies.  
FIGURE 4.7 50 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
Figure 4.8 depicts how a conditional looks when added into a workflow  
diagram. Different combinations of boxes and arrows are used to create  
parallel paths that describe each outcome that occurs as a result of the  
options presented by the condition.  
FIGURE 4.8 Creating Diagrams 51  
Tree Diagrams  
Next, let’s draw a cluster of boxes as illustrated in Figure 4.9. Start with a  
central box and work outward.  
FIGURE 4.9  
We can connect these boxes using arrows to create a tree diagram  
\(Figure 4.10\). Tree diagrams help us visualize hierarchical relationships. For  
example, they can be used to create a mind map to visualize organizational  
charts and nomenclatures.  
FIGURE 4.10 52 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
The mind map we discussed in Chapter 2 is a great example of a tree  
diagram as pictured in Figure 4.11. I used it to organize my thoughts on the  
benefits of drawing. In this case, I added some shading for effect, but you  
can see that boxes and connection lines are the primary two elements that  
make this diagram work.  
FIGURE 4.11  
Let’s try another arrangement of boxes. This time, let’s arrange them in a  
pyramid form as drawn in Figure 4.12.  
FIGURE 4.12 Creating Diagrams 53  
Next, let’s connect them using dotted lines. The dotted lines will describe  
the hierarchical connections between the top row and the second row of  
boxes as illustrated in Figure 4.13  
FIGURE 4.13  
This is a good example of the structure used to create a site map or  
product map that details the information architecture of your website,  
products, or mobile app \(Figure 4.14\). Using these basic shapes, arranged in  
this structure, we can create something akin to the site map we reviewed in  
Chapter 2.  
FIGURE 4.14  
Network Visualizations  
Finally, just to demonstrate the versatility of boxes, and to highlight the  
power of showing connections, let’s revisit the radial arrangement of boxes  
used for our earlier tree diagram, as depicted in Figure 4.15. 54 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
FIGURE 4.15  
Now, to make a network visualization, let’s reimagine the diagram’s  
arrows. This same arrangement of boxes can be used to represent  
a network, as highlighted in Figure 4.16. Notice how the hierarchical  
relationships are removed yet we’re still able to see the connections among  
the “networked” boxes. These types of diagrams can be used to show  
the relationships between people, processes, and technology within an  
organization.  
FIGURE 4.16 Content Elements 55  
CONTENT ELEMENTS  
At the time this book was written, user interfaces and digital content usually  
appeared on rectangular screens. As a result, a lot of the elements in our  
screen designs are based on monolithic, rectangular shapes. We can use  
boxes to represent a plethora of items.  
Headline and Subheader Text  
Let’s start by reviewing ways to represent content. As drawn in Figure 4.17, a  
long, thin, filled box can represent a title, headline, subheader, or new chunk  
of content within your screen drawing. Using lines to represent text early  
on in the process will enable people to focus on your overarching idea, its  
architecture, and its value proposition. It’ll enable them to focus less on the  
granular details like font choices.  
FIGURE 4.17  
Content Blocks  
By adding a few thinner parallel lines, as suggested in Figure 4.18, we can  
turn this into an iconic representation of a text block that includes a headline  
and a paragraph of body copy.  
FIGURE 4.18  
Image Placeholders  
Let’s draw an image placeholder like the one displayed in Figure 4.19.  
We’ll start by drawing a box. Next, we’ll place an X inside of it. Early on in  
the design process, it’s okay if we’re not sure what exactly the image will  
look like. This comes in handy when we’re drawing content-­ heavy editorial  
website layouts.  
FIGURE 4.19  
Lists  
Let’s combine the first three elements to represent a lockup with  
a thumbnail image and some supporting text as depicted in  
Figure 4.20. We can start with the image box. Then draw a thick  
line followed by a parallel thin line. This might represent an image  
thumbnail accompanied by text. UI elements like this are used in  
content recommendation panels, related content panels, and so on.  
We can then stack this lockup layout to represent a list of content,  
articles, and pages to navigate to, as drawn in Figure 4.21  
FIGURE 4.20 56 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
FIGURE 4.21  
Content Layouts  
The headline box, text lines, image box, and list can be combined in infinite  
ways to describe any number of page layouts. Let’s try it out. We’ll start by  
combining some of these elements to create a layout for a news website.  
We’ll use a modified version of the text blocks from Figure 4.18, the image  
block from 4.19, and the lockup from Figure 4.20 to build a layout as  
illustrated in Figure 4.22.  
FIGURE 4.22 Content Elements 57  
Since our elements are iconic in nature, we can add labels to our sketch  
to add more detail as highlighted in Figure 4.23. This is especially helpful  
for our teammates who are new to this process and aren’t familiar with the  
visual language we’re using to represent screen elements. I’ll cover more on  
labels and annotations later in Chapter 8, “Using Flows to Tell Stories.”  
FIGURE 4.23  
Figure 4.24 shows a side-­ by-­ side view of our drawing and the actual web  
page it’s based on. Notice how the shapes in the drawing mimic the look  
of the key elements on the web page? The visual hierarchy is consistent.  
Prominent items such as the headline and image are the focal point of the  
drawing. I also used my set of Pigma Micron pens to draw this image. I used  
thicker points to draw the more important lines of each element, such as the  
headlines, the photo’s bounding box, and so on. I used thin lines to draw the  
less important details within each element. This consideration for line weight  
and quality ensures that attention is drawn to the right areas of the sketch.  
It also gives it a more polished appearance. If you squint at the photo on the  
left in Figure 4.24, its elements start to look more like the elements of the  
sketch on the right. 58 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
FIGURE 4.24  
NAVIGATION ELEMENTS  
Let’s draw some screen navigation elements. Most of these items are built  
from boxes. We will review some common forms of navigation.  
Lists  
Let’s start with a list screen. List screens are commonly found on most  
mobile apps, and their sole purpose is for navigation. Let’s start by drawing a  
box with proportions similar to the box displayed in Figure 4.25  
FIGURE 4.25  
Now, let’s stack a few of these boxes as suggested by Figure 4.26. It’s  
okay if your lines aren’t completely parallel and your angles aren’t perfect. It  
adds to the character of the drawing and suggests the unfinished nature of  
the design. Worrying about geometric precisions will drastically slow down  
your process. Navigation Elements 59  
FIGURE 4.26  
Inside each box, we can add a few elements. Let’s reuse the photo and  
text lockup from Figure 4.20. List items in these layouts usually feature a  
thumbnail, icon, or symbol that describes the content within the list item.  
The result should look like Figure 4.27.  
FIGURE 4.27  
Finally, we’ll add these details to the full stack of boxes as drawn in  
Figure 4.28. As this drawing takes shape, you might notice that it starts to  
look like a representation of a list screen.  
This layout may seem familiar, as it is used by most popular email apps,  
including content recommendation engines, and music playlist screens.  
Figure 4.29 displays a side-­ by-­ side view of our list drawing and a Spotify  
playlist screen on a mobile device. While the Spotify screen has other UI  
elements, the list is the most prominent feature. 60 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
FIGURE 4.28  
FIGURE 4.29 Navigation Elements 61  
Tabs  
Tabs are another common navigation element, especially on mobile devices.  
Let’s try drawing some navigation tabs. Let’s start with a long and narrow  
box as illustrated in Figure 4.30. This box will represent text. It’s the same  
element as covered in Figure 4.17.  
Now, let’s draw a few more of these filled boxes. They should share a  
common baseline and appear on the same level, as depicted in Figure 4.31.  
FIGURE 4.30  
FIGURE 4.31  
Next, place a box around the first filled box to show that the first tab  
is active, as highlighted by Figure 4.32. This is one way to represent  
navigation tabs.  
FIGURE 4.32  
Navigational tabs are frequently used in mobile apps and appear toward  
the bottom of the screen. That is because they are reachable by thumb  
and can be operated by the same hand that is used to hold the device.  
Figure 4.33 depicts the location of tabs within most mobile apps.  
FIGURE 4.33 62 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
Figure 4.34 highlights a real-­ world example of tabs in a mobile app. While  
it’s common for tabs to appear at the bottom of the screen, they can appear  
anywhere. The example in Figure 4.34 consists of multiple tab sets. Tabs  
are a common UI element found on desktop and tablet apps as well. They’re  
also a popular navigational element used in a lot of websites.  
FIGURE 4.35  
FIGURE 4.34  
Breadcrumbs  
This is one of the most useful navigation patterns, especially for websites  
with multiple levels of content. Next, let’s try drawing a breadcrumb. Let’s  
start by drawing a long box similar to the one in Figure 4.35.  
Let’s draw a few more similar boxes in a series. We will fill in the last box  
as depicted in Figure 4.36. The filled box represents the last page listed in  
the breadcrumb, which is the active page.  
FIGURE 4.36 Navigation Elements 63  
Finally, we’ll add arrows between the boxes. This suggests the hierarchical  
relationships between the pages or levels symbolized by the boxes, as drawn  
in Figure 4.37.  
FIGURE 4.37  
You might also consider using a label instead of the filled box to indicate  
the active page, as written in Figure 4.38. This will provide an extra level of  
detail and context for your sketch, especially if it falls within a flow or series  
of sketches. Labeling is an important part of a sketch, and we’ll cover more  
on labeling and annotations later in Chapter 8.  
FIGURE 4.38  
Breadcrumbs usually highlight the path we took to drill down through a  
set of web pages. Have you ever purchased a product from an online store?  
E-­ commerce sites usually provide breadcrumbs to help you navigate the  
taxonomy of products offered. Usually you select a product category, then  
a specific make and model based on a few key features you’re interested in.  
Figure 4.39 shows where a breadcrumb usually fits into a web page’s layout.  
FIGURE 4.39  
Grids  
Finally, let’s try one more. Most photo apps enable you to navigate  
collections of photos. To draw an interface like this, we’ll start out by  
creating an image box \(Figure 4.40\) FIGURE 4.40 64 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
Next, let’s combine a few of these boxes. We can start to build a  
grid. Figure 4.41 depicts an example of four photo boxes combined into  
a 2×2 grid.  
FIGURE 4.41  
Finally, let’s determine how many rows and columns we want to include  
in our photo grid. I chose a three-­ column layout \(Figure 4.42\). We can also  
create a focal point by drawing a thicker border around one of the photos to  
indicate that it has been selected.  
FIGURE 4.42 Forms 65  
In this case, I used two different pens to draw the grid. Since the vertical  
and horizontal nature of the grid’s structure is more important than the  
diagonal accent lines, I used a thicker Pigma Micron pen to draw the vertical  
and horizontal lines. As a result, more emphasis is placed on the strong  
verticals and horizontal lines that make up this grid. In Figure 4.43, we see  
an example of an actual photos app. Our drawing provides a nice iconic  
representation of the elements in this screen.  
FIGURE 4.43  
FORMS  
Web form inputs and controls are fairly universal. They’re an integral part  
of most screen-­ based products and an essential part of any UX designer’s  
toolkit. The majority of these elements can be built from rectangles. Let’s  
take a look. 66 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
Text Fields  
Let’s draw a text input field. To do this, we will start by drawing a horizontal  
box as drawn in Figure 4.44.  
FIGURE 4.44  
Next we’ll add a small vertical line just inside the box’s left edge as  
depicted in Figure 4.45. For effect, you can turn that line into an I-beam.  
FIGURE 4.45  
Finally, we’ll draw a long and narrow filled box above the text field box to  
represent the field’s label, as illustrated in Figure 4.46.  
FIGURE 4.46  
Sometimes it’s important to write out the actual text field’s label. To do  
this, instead of placing a filled box above the text field, you can write in a  
label as depicted in Figure 4.47. Be sure to take your time and use clear  
handwriting to do this. We’ll cover more techniques for adding labels in  
Chapter 8.  
FIGURE 4.47  
Text Areas  
If we can draw text input fields, we can also draw text areas. This time we’ll  
draw a larger, taller box, as shown in Figure 4.48. Forms 67  
FIGURE 4.48  
Just as with the previous text field, we can add either a line or a  
handwritten label above the text area, the latter of which is highlighted in  
Figure 4.49.  
FIGURE 4.49  
Checklists  
Let’s try a check box and checklist. For this, we will start with a square.  
Next, we’ll draw a horizontal line to the right of our square as illustrated in  
Figure 4.50.  
FIGURE 4.50 68 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
Finally, we’ll place a check mark inside the box as displayed in Figure 4.51.  
FIGURE 4.51  
We can stack versions of this drawings to create a checklist. To make the  
checklist realistic, consider leaving some of the boxes unchecked, as illustrated  
in Figure 4.52.  
FIGURE 4.53  
FIGURE 4.54  
FIGURE 4.52  
Buttons and Actions  
Most forms end with a button. To create this, we’ll start by drawing a box.  
In this case, since we’re creating a submit button, we’ll write in the word  
Submit. Figure 4.53 depicts our hand-­ drawn box with the label inside it.  
The drawing in its current state could easily be mistaken for a content  
card, text field, or another UI element. To mitigate this potential issue,  
we’ll draw an affordance to indicate that this is an interactive button, as  
highlighted in Figure 4.54. To do this, we’ll draw an inner border around  
the button’s label.  
In some cases, multiple buttons may appear in groups. In some forms,  
toast messages, alert bars, and dialogs, we may find a primary and  
secondary action. It’s important to bring more focus to the primary action.  
To do this, you can use any number of techniques, such as using extra bold  
lines, or using hatching, fills, and shading as suggested in Figure 4.55.  
FIGURE 4.55  
Form Layout  
Let’s combine a few of our recent drawings to create a basic feedback form  
as drawn in Figure 4.56. The form will consist of a few text fields, one to Forms 69  
capture the customer’s name and another to capture the customer’s email  
address. A large text area will provide a method for capturing the customer’s  
detailed product review. Of course, we’ll have to add a check box for  
accepting the terms of service. Finally, we’ll add a prominent submit button  
at the bottom of the form. To provide additional detail, we will write out each  
form label instead of using a filled box.  
FIGURE 4.56  
At this point, we’re only scratching the surface. There are plenty of other  
form elements to consider. This initial set covers most form elements that  
can be drawn with boxes only. We will cover more options such as drop-down  
menus and radio groups later in the next chapter.  
Charts and Graphs  
Charts, graphs, and visualizations are included in nearly every app. Whether  
it’s visualizations in a dashboard or a simple progress bar on a loading screen,  
there are several visualization elements that can be drawn with rectangles.  
Let’s take a look. 70 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
FIGURE 4.57  
FIGURE 4.58  
FIGURE 4.59  
Progress Bars  
Progress bars are used to show the progress of something. They can be  
used to show the load progress of an app, feature, or web page. They can be  
used to represent user ratings of a product, service, or experience. Progress  
indicators can show time remaining on a timed function and even your  
progress in completing a specific task like a workout. They can be drawn  
using two simple boxes. Let’s start by drawing on a long and narrow box as  
depicted in Figure 4.57.  
Next, we can draw a vertical line that cuts the box into two segments\: one  
that’s two-­ thirds of the box and one that’s one-­ third, depicted in Figure 4.58.  
Finally, let’s fill in the first segment on the bar as illustrated in Figure 4.59.  
You might consider using a pencil for lighter shading, or you can use a  
hatching pattern with your pen. This will invoke the feeling that we’re filling  
the box based on some sort of measurement.  
FIGURE 4.60  
Bar Charts and Histograms  
Bar charts and histograms are useful visualizations that appear in  
most dashboard layouts. Bar charts are used for comparing categorical  
information based on a specified metric. Histograms are useful when  
showing changes over time. To draw a bar chart, let’s start with the basic  
rectangle drawn in Figure 4.60. It should be tall and narrow. This will  
represent the first vertical bar on our chart.  
Next, let’s draw a set of vertical rectangles that run parallel to this  
first one, as depicted in Figure 4.61. The heights of these bars can vary;  
however, they should share a common baseline. I usually increase the  
height sequentially for effect—­ I’ll explain why later on in Chapter 9, “Telling  
Engaging Stories.” I think we can agree that this is starting to look more  
like a chart.  
FIGURE 4.61  
To take it a step further, we can draw a vertical line representing a  
y-­ axis to the left or right of the chart as displayed in Figure 4.62. It’s up  
to you. The goal here is to symbolize that we’re using the height bars to  
measure something. FIGURE 4.62  
Finally, we can add small filled boxes that represent text labels beneath  
each bar, as depicted in Figure 4.63. If you’d like to provide additional context  
and detail, you can write in these labels. That’s it! We have ourselves a chart.  
FIGURE 4.63  
To draw a horizontal bar chart, we will do the same thing but with a  
different orientation. Instead of drawing vertically oriented bars, let’s draw  
horizontally oriented bars. We will start with a single horizontal bar as  
depicted in Figure 4.64.  
Next, we will add more horizontal bars, an x-­ axis line, and our labels, as  
illustrated in Figure 4.65. We’ll follow the same basic steps we followed  
to draw the vertical bar chart, just in a different orientation. Horizontal bar  
charts are great where time is not a dimension.  
FIGURE 4.65  
Forms 71  
FIGURE 4.64 72 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
Let’s revisit the vertical bar chart we already drew in Figure 4.63. We can  
divide the bars into segments to create a stacked bar chart as depicted in  
Figure 4.66. Stacked bar charts highlight differences in multiple categories.  
FIGURE 4.66  
For effect, we can add shading for each of the segments, as depicted in  
Figure 4.67. For the bottom segment on each bar, let’s add some hatching  
to create a sense of shading. We can use less dense hatching on the middle  
segments to represent a slightly lighter shade as shown in Figure 4.67.  
FIGURE 4.67  
We can easily create a grouped bar chart by modifying the position of  
each bar along its x-­ axis as depicted in Figure 4.68. Grouped bar charts can  
be used to show comparisons over time. For example, in the figure, we can  
visualize revenue generated by a set of products for this past month as  
indicated by the darker bars. We can compare that to revenue generated by  
the same set of products for the previous year as indicated by the light bars.  
Each bar grouping represents a product in this case. FIGURE 4.68  
Line Charts and Area Charts  
Line charts are an essential part of any dashboard. They enable us to  
visualize changes over time. They also enable us to compare many  
categories of continuous trends and patterns. It’s one of the most common  
charts used in everyday dashboards. To draw a line chart, we’ll start with a  
basic box as drawn in Figure 4.69.  
We’ll add a zigzag line inside the box to represent the chart type. For  
effect, I prefer to start my zigzag line in the bottom-­ left corner of the chart  
and end it in the upper-­ right corner as depicted in Figure 4.70. I usually do  
this unless I’m certain the data is supposed to trend in a different direction.  
Again, I’ll explain more on my rationale in Chapter 9.  
You can add points to the elbows of the zigzag for effect. These might  
suggest points where you can interact with the line to find out more  
information about the represented values, as highlighted in Figure 4.71.  
You can take any line chart and add shading to convert it to an area chart.  
Figure 4.72 depicts a drawing of an area chart \(left\) and a stacked area chart  
\(right\) that were created using this technique.  
FIGURE 4.72  
Forms 73  
FIGURE 4.69  
FIGURE 4.70  
FIGURE 4.71 74 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
Dashboards  
Next, let’s arrange some of these chart drawings in order to create a simple  
dashboard. Your drawing might look like the sketch in Figure 4.73. Notice  
how I also integrated some navigation elements like tabs and written labels  
to provide more details about this dashboard’s content.  
FIGURE 4.73  
This is actually a sketch based on the YouTube Analytics dashboard,  
shown in Figure 4.74. You can see how the chart in the sketch does a nice  
job of symbolizing the chart in the actual dashboard. Again, all of these  
elements are iconic in their nature, and that’s okay.  
There are plenty of chart types that I didn’t cover. There are several other  
charts that are built from boxes. Some examples include boxplots, waterfall  
charts, and treemaps. You’ll use very similar methods for drawing each  
of them. In any case, it’s important to start with the box shapes found in  
each chart, then layer in the supporting elements as you go. When it comes  
to charts, this is just the beginning. There are also plenty of other charts  
that are built from other shapes, which we’ll explore in other sections of  
this book. Forms 75  
FIGURE 4.74  
Interface Elements  
In the spirit of providing a near-­ exhaustive list of elements, let’s take a look at  
a few interface elements. Scroll bars, dialogs, and cards are commonly used  
in screen layouts. Let’s jump in and take a closer look.  
Scroll Bars  
Scroll bars are a surprisingly important element in most sketches. They can  
be used to represent content-­ heavy modules, screens, and overlays where  
the content extends beyond the element’s viewable area. This is a strong  
tool when explaining how your UI design might scale to accommodate more  
content. The scroll bar is a tall rectangle with one extra-­ long vertical line  
as depicted in Figure 4.75. For effect I added some shading to the scroll  
bar’s handle.  
FIGURE 4.75  
Dialogs and Modals  
Dialogs are popular UI elements used in a lot of screen-­ based products. They  
are used to provide contextual information and serve as a prompt to take  
action. They are usually smaller boxes that pop up over your screen. To draw  
one of these UI elements, you can start by drawing a box, then another box  
around it as depicted in Figure 4.76. 76 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
FIGURE 4.76  
For added effect, we can add shading between the two boxes as  
illustrated in Figure 4.77. This places emphasis on the dialog itself. Let’s add  
a primary and secondary button to the dialog.  
FIGURE 4.77  
Cards and Stacks  
Are you feeling adventurous? Would you like to try something more  
advanced? In this book’s preface, I shared a concept for an atomic force  
microscope UI \(Figure 4.78\). The design was based on a pile of stacked  
cards that represented an underlying workflow. Let’s take a look at how we  
might draw the stack of cards.  
Let’s start by drawing a box with proportions like the box shown in  
Figure 4.79. Forms 77  
FIGURE 4.78  
FIGURE 4.79  
Next, we’ll draw an L that runs along the left edge and bottom of the box.  
Offset the position to give the illusion of perspective, as drawn in Figure 4.80.  
FIGURE 4.80 78 CHAPTER FOUR Building from Rectangles  
We will continue to repeat this step until we have a stack of cards as  
shown in Figure 4.81. The number of lines does not have to match the  
number of actual cards you’ll anticipate featuring in your final design.  
FIGURE 4.81  
The position of our L-­ shaped lines should be offset as depicted in  
Figure 4.82.  
FIGURE 4.82  
You can modify the position of the extra lines to give the illusion of  
different perspectives and views as highlighted in Figure 4.83. The existing  
perspective provides a worm’s-­ eye view of the card set. We can move the  
lines to the top and left side for a bird’s-­ eye view, as depicted in Figure 4.83. Forms 79  
FIGURE 4.83  
And there you have it. While this isn’t an exhaustive list of elements drawn  
from boxes, it’s a good start, and you’ll likely use them in the vast majority  
of digital product drawings you create with your team. Now, in the next  
chapter, let’s take a look at some other common elements built from other  
basic shapes. C H A P T E R F I V E  
# BUILDING  
# FROM CIRCLES,  
# TRIANGLES,  
# AND MORE  
While combining lines, boxes, and arrows goes a long way, you’ll need  
to be able to draw elements based on other shapes, like circles and  
triangles. Once you master that, we’ll explore some more complex forms like  
simple representations of people and cursor hands. Let’s jump in.  
CIRCULAR ELEMENTS  
Let’s start with a basic circle and a few elements we can build out of  
circles. Get your circle template or compass ready. Let’s try drawing a  
bunch of circles similar to Figure 5.1. Feel free to use different sizes and  
fill up your paper.  
Forms\: Radio Groups  
We’ll start with the most utilitarian yet essential uses of the circle, and that’s  
in forms. Circles are what separate a checklist from a radio group. Radio  
groups allow people to make only one selection within the group.  
81 82 CHAPTER FIVE Building From Circles, Triangles, and More  
FIGURE 5.2  
FIGURE 5.1  
Remember how we drew the checklist? Instead of using squares and  
checks, let’s use circles and points. Let’s start with a basic circle as drawn  
in Figure 5.2. Let’s draw a small circle that’s approximately a quarter inch  
in diameter.  
Next, just as we did with the check box, let’s add a thick text line to the  
right of the radio button as depicted in Figure 5.3.  
FIGURE 5.3  
Radio buttons only make sense when they appear in a group, so let’s draw  
a few more of these lockups in a stack as illustrated in Figure 5.4.  
To finish off our radio group, we’ll add a label and a preselected option by  
filling in one of the dots as depicted in Figure 5.5. A radio group enables you  
to select one item within the group. A good example of this is when you’re  
ordering a product online and choosing a shipping option. You can select only  
one shipping method. Circular Elements 83  
FIGURE 5.4  
FIGURE 5.5  
The Circle as a Symbol  
Circles are an important element in human culture and have been a metaphor  
embraced by virtually every civilization that has ever existed \(Lima, 2017\).  
Important in nature and city layouts and a metaphor for a community, it’s not  
going away anytime soon. Given its importance as a symbol, you can bet that it  
still remains as a key visual in today’s technologically advanced society. Now,  
without further ado, let’s jump in and explore the powerful symbolism that  
comes with a circle.  
Status Icons  
You can place any number of symbols inside a circle to create an icon. Let’s  
start with the circle itself, as drawn in Figure 5.6. FIGURE 5.6 84 CHAPTER FIVE Building From Circles, Triangles, and More  
You can add any type of character in the middle of the circle to create  
an icon, as depicted in Figure 5.7. An exclamation point might represent a  
warning or an alert. An X can represent a failure or error. Check marks might  
represent a positive or completed status. Flip the exclamation point upside  
down to create a lowercase I and we have ourselves an information icon.  
The possibilities are endless. Since the majority of drawings consist of many  
boxes and angular forms, the curved nature of the circle will draw attention,  
which is why this is a good form to combine with a status icon.  
FIGURE 5.8  
FIGURE 5.7  
Time Icon  
Let’s use a circle to represent time. For this, we’ll draw a classic  
representation of an analog clock with two hands. This symbol has carried  
its meaning for hundreds of years. Let’s start by drawing a circle as sketched  
in Figure 5.8.  
In order to draw a clock, start with the origin or center point of the circle.  
Draw two hands, one longer than the other as drawn in Figure 5.9. You can  
draw them in any direction you prefer to represent a desired time.  
FIGURE 5.9  
FIGURE 5.10  
Emojis  
At the end of the day, other people are going to use the products we’re  
designing. In some cases, it’s important to be able to express their emotion,  
whether it’s when mapping the ways in which they use an existing product or  
mapping an emotional curve in a research presentation. Circles are a great  
starting point for creating emojis, as drawn in Figure 5.10. Let’s start with a  
basic circle. For this exercise, it helps to keep the circle small.  
By adding two points and a few curved lines, we can express a range of  
emotions through drawing. This enables us to bring a human element into our  
drawing. Check out the collection of emojis in Figure 5.11. This covers a range of emotions. I even threw in a few extras for fun. Try drawing a few of these  
expressions yourself.  
FIGURE 5.11  
Profile Icons  
Let’s draw another commonly used icon. This can be used to represent  
avatars and profile images. You can even use it to represent people in a  
process diagram or org chart. Once again, we’ll start with a simple circle as  
depicted in Figure 5.12.  
Next, we’ll add another circle inside the first circle. It should be centered  
horizontally, but it can appear in a slightly offset location as depicted in  
Figure 5.13.  
We can draw two lines to form the shoulder lines that will connect the  
inner circle to the outer circle, as illustrated in Figure 5.14.  
Finally, we’ll bring this all together by filling in lines as depicted in  
Figure 5.15.  
We can use multiples of the drawing in Figure 5.15 to represent  
a community as depicted in Figure 5.16. We can use this metaphor  
to represent user groups, online communities, and teams within an  
organization.  
Charts  
You can also include various types of charts to convey information. The  
following sections describe some of the options.  
Pie Charts  
Let’s try drawing a pie chart. Pie charts are great for showing part-­ to-­ whole  
relationships. They enable us to visualize how the parts of something make  
up its whole. Invented in the beginning of the nineteenth century, this chart  
still remains a staple in most modern dashboards. Love it or hate it, it’s here  
to stay. Let’s build a pie chart out of a circle. We’ll begin by drawing another  
circle, as illustrated in Figure 5.17.  
Circular Elements 85  
FIGURE 5.12  
FIGURE 5.13  
FIGURE 5.14  
FIGURE 5.15  
FIGURE 5.16 86 CHAPTER FIVE Building From Circles, Triangles, and More  
FIGURE 5.17  
Inside your circle, mark a point at the circle’s origin as highlighted in  
Figure 5.18. It’s best to use a pencil for this since the pencil mark can  
be erased.  
Next, we’ll draw lines that extend from the circle’s origin to its border as  
depicted in Figure 5.19. Moving in a clockwise direction, I start with my largest  
slice and work down from there. The result is an iconic and more readable pie  
chart drawing. Of course in real life, this might not be the case. We’ll discuss  
how to adapt your drawings to account for real-­ world scenarios, constraints,  
and data in Chapter 9, “Telling Engaging Stories.”  
Finally, for effect we can use shading to fill in a specific slice of the  
pie as depicted in Figure 5.20. This is optional, and we’ll discuss shading  
techniques later in Chapter 6, “Illustrating Light, Motion, and Other  
Concepts.” In case you’re interested, I used both pencil and pen to create this  
textured fill.  
FIGURE 5.18  
FIGURE 5.19  
Donut Charts  
One of my favorite versions of variations of the pie chart is the donut chart.  
You can use the space in the empty, inner circle of the donut to highlight key  
metrics. Let’s revisit the circle from Figure 5.17. Then, let’s draw an inner  
circle. You can use the guides on your circle template to properly line up the  
inner circle. The goal is to create two concentric circles on your paper as  
drawn in Figure 5.21.  
Next, we can draw dividing lines to form two segments. We can fill in one  
of the segments as depicted in Figure 5.22.  
Finally, let’s leverage our reason for using a donut chart by using the  
empty space in the middle of the donut. In this drawing, let’s highlight the  
metric displayed in the chart as depicted in Figure 5.23.  
FIGURE 5.20  
FIGURE 5.21  
FIGURE 5.23  
Scatterplots  
Now we will create a basic scatterplot chart. Scatterplots  
help us visualize a comparison between two variables.  
Once again, let’s start by drawing a small circle about a  
quarter inch in diameter as depicted in Figure 5.24.  
FIGURE 5.24  
FIGURE 5.22 Circular Elements 87  
We can draw a few other circles in a cluster. For this drawing, my cluster  
of circles will run from left to right and from bottom to top as depicted in  
Figure 5.25.  
FIGURE 5.25  
Next, let’s draw an x-­ and y-­ axis using a straightedge, as drawn in  
Figure 5.26.  
FIGURE 5.26  
Finally, we can fill in the dots for effect as depicted in Figure 5.27. There  
we have it. A scatterplot!  
Bubble Charts  
Let’s take the scatterplot a step further. Bubble charts enable us to compare  
three variables. Each plot’s size can be based on the value of the third metric.  
The plots begin to look like bubbles, hence the name bubble chart. 88 CHAPTER FIVE Building From Circles, Triangles, and More  
FIGURE 5.27  
Hans Rosling created a famous bubble chart that shows the correlation  
between a country’s income per person and life expectancy. These two  
variables are measured on the x-­ and y-­ axis, respectively. In this chart, Hans  
introduced a third variable, which is each country’s population. He used the  
size of each country’s bubble to represent its population. At the time this  
book was written, you could view this visualization at gapminder.org.  
If you end up drawing one of these, be prepared to describe what the size  
of the bubble represents. To draw the bubble chart, we’ll follow the same  
steps we followed to draw the scatterplot; however, we’ll use different size  
circles as shown in Figure 5.28.  
FIGURE 5.28  
These are just a few elements that can be built from circles. These  
elements are yet another set of building blocks to add to your kit. Triangular Elements 89  
It’s important to keep in mind that not all screens are rectangular. Take  
a look at the Nest Learning Thermostat in Figure 5.29. Notice how the  
visualizations and user interface are all based on circles.  
FIGURE 5.29  
The interface on the thermostat is based on circles. The process for  
drawing this would be nearly identical to the one we used to draw the  
donut chart in Figures 5.21, 5.22, and 5.23. Why not try it out? Grab your  
pen and paper and try to draw the elements on the thermostat’s display.  
As mentioned in Chapter 2, “Reframing Our Thinking,” some wearables like  
watches have circular screens. It’s important to keep in mind that several  
watch screen elements can be built from circles, like the graphs depicted  
in the concept sketch in Figure 5.30. There are plenty of other screens that  
are circular in shape, and as we move into the future, circular screens will  
become more and more commonplace in our lives.  
TRIANGULAR ELEMENTS  
The triangle is one of my all-­ time favorite shapes. It is a symbol of strength  
and resilience. It’s also used in many structures because it is revered as the  
strongest shape in nature.  
Let’s see how triangles can be used in our digital product drawings—starting  
with Figure 5.31. 90 CHAPTER FIVE Building From Circles, Triangles, and More  
FIGURE 5.30  
FIGURE 5.31  
Navigation Controls  
In the following sections, we will look at the options for including  
navigation controls.  
Expand/Collapse Controls  
To draw an expand/collapse control, draw a small triangle that points up.  
Draw another one that points down. Now we have ourselves an expand/  
collapse control as drawn in Figure 5.32 Triangular Elements 91  
FIGURE 5.32  
As we did with some of our earlier drawings, we might consider filling in  
the arrow, because it could be an indicator of something we can interact with  
on the screen \(Figure 5.33\).  
FIGURE 5.33  
Forward/Backward Arrows  
To create a navigational arrow, we can turn our triangles on their sides and  
point them to the right or left as depicted in Figure 5.34.  
FIGURE 5.34  
Icons\: Alerts, Warnings, and Anomalies  
Here, we will look at various icons you can create. To create an alert icon,  
we’ll draw a slightly larger triangle, as shown in Figure 5.35.  
Next, we’ll place an exclamation point in the middle of it, as drawn in  
Figure 5.36.  
Just for fun, let’s add a few small accent lines outside of the triangle to  
symbolize the urgency of the alert, as drawn in Figure 5.37.  
FIGURE 5.35  
FIGURE 5.36 92 CHAPTER FIVE Building From Circles, Triangles, and More  
FIGURE 5.37  
Forms\: Drop-­ Down Menus  
Finally, let’s draw a drop-­ down menu. To do this, we can draw an inverted  
triangle and a baseline that represents the field. The triangle should appear  
at the right end of the baseline as illustrated in Figure 5.38.  
FIGURE 5.38  
An alternate way to represent a drop-­ down is by placing the arrow inside a  
box as drawn in Figure 5.39.  
FIGURE 5.39  
I think it’s safe to say that we’re building out a robust library of common  
elements. So far we covered various screen elements built from circles and  
triangles. Next, feel free to look at some of your favorite apps and devices.  
Look at their screens. See if you can distill their elements down into some of  
these basic shapes and draw them. You can use the symbols and drawings  
we’ve already covered in this chapter.  
ADVANCED ICONS AND SYMBOLS  
It’s time to start drawing some complex shapes and forms that you’ll  
commonly use in your digital product drawings. This section is all about  
icons like the ones depicted in Figure 5.40. Some of these forms will help  
you describe ways in which people will interact with your product, others  
will focus on people themselves, the centerpiece of all of our product design Advanced Icons and Symbols 93  
work. Others will be used to enhance existing charts, graphs, maps, and  
visualizations we previously covered. Let’s jump in!  
FIGURE 5.40  
Octagons and Stop Signs  
Let’s grab a pencil and draw a square as depicted in Figure 5.41. Be sure to  
draw lightly as we’ll eventually erase these pencil lines.  
FIGURE 5.41  
Now, draw diagonal lines cutting off each of the corners of the square as  
illustrated in Figure 5.42.  
Next, trace the resulting shape with a pen, then erase the pencil lines as  
depicted in Figure 5.43. You should be left with an octagon. It’s okay if the  
shape isn’t perfect. As long as it reads as an octagon, it’s a success. 94 CHAPTER FIVE Building From Circles, Triangles, and More  
FIGURE 5.42  
FIGURE 5.43  
Now you have an octagon. You can add any number of icons and accents  
to this shape. For example, this can be used to represent the end of a  
process diagram. It can also be used to represent an alert. In Figure 5.44, I  
turned the octagon into a stop sign.  
FIGURE 5.44  
Location Markers  
If you’re not good at drawing maps, that’s okay. We can use a placeholder  
icon to represent the concept of a location. To do this, we might simply draw Advanced Icons and Symbols 95  
an upside-­ down teardrop. Let’s grab a circle template and get started. First,  
we’ll draw the upper 60 percent of the circle, as depicted in Figure 5.45.  
Next, we’ll connect the open-­ ended portion of the circle by adding two  
straight lines that point downward, connecting to form a V shape as drawn  
in Figure 5.46.  
FIGURE 5.45  
FIGURE 5.46  
Finally, we can add other accents, such as an inner circle for effect as  
illustrated in Figure 5.47. This isn’t required, but it may fortify the meaning of  
the symbol.  
FIGURE 5.47  
People  
People can be one of the most intimidating things to draw. When we’re  
creating a new product, however, people are what matter most, especially  
if you work on a user experience team. Arguably, this is one of the most  
important elements in your visual language. There are several ways in which  
we can represent people without having to draw a perfect anatomically  
correct human body. Let’s take a look. 96 CHAPTER FIVE Building From Circles, Triangles, and More  
FIGURE 5.48  
One abstract yet elegant way to represent a person is as follows. Let’s  
start by drawing a hump or upside down letter U as depicted in Figure 5.48.  
Next, we’ll connect the bottom of the hump with a slightly curved  
horizontal line as drawn in Figure 5.49.  
After that, we’ll add a circle above the existing drawing as displayed in  
Figure 5.50.  
FIGURE 5.49  
FIGURE 5.50  
Finally, we can add some shading to draw attention to our icon. I chose a  
simple hatching pattern as depicted in Figure 5.51. I’ll share more on shading  
later in Chapter 6.  
FIGURE 5.51  
The resulting drawing may look more like a board game piece than a  
human but it’s enough to get the point across. In fact, a lot of the people  
icons found in our favorite mobile apps look like this. The example in  
Figure 5.52 depicts how people might be represented in a workflow diagram.  
FIGURE 5.52 Advanced Icons and Symbols 97  
In this scenario, the people icons used in the fourth step of this workflow  
diagram represent a process step that is completed in person and not within  
an app screen like the other steps.  
Another way to draw people is by drawing a partial star shape. Make sure  
the top point of the star does not cross the horizontal connector line of the next  
highest two points. Use Figure 5.53 as a reference when creating the semi-star  
shape.  
FIGURE 5.53  
Next, let’s add a circle in place of the missing point, as drawn in  
Figure 5.54.  
FIGURE 5.54  
We can fill in the shape for effect \(Figure 5.55\). This drawing will look like  
a stylized stick figure.  
FIGURE 5.55  
Finally, Figure 5.56 depicts how this version of the icon might look in  
a process diagram. In this case we’re using the icons to show people  
completing the fourth step, which takes place offline. 98 CHAPTER FIVE Building From Circles, Triangles, and More  
FIGURE 5.56  
REPRESENTING INTERACTIONS  
In nearly all cases, it’s important to represent a method for interaction and  
input. This is especially true when drawing a flow of screens that represents  
the steps a person takes to complete a task or to achieve a goal when using  
your product. Let’s start with the most difficult drawing. Then we’ll fall back on  
a few easier alternatives.  
FIGURE 5.57  
FIGURE 5.58  
Pointer Hands and Cursors  
Hands are arguably the most difficult thing to draw. I’ve been drawing and  
painting since I was five years old, and I still struggle with drawing hands. To  
this day I don’t know how I made it through my life drawing class in design  
school. Anyway, hands can be used to represent gestures and touch events  
on a mobile device. They can also be used to represent the click state of a  
mouse cursor. Let’s take a look at how to represent a basic hand. Hands are  
simply a series of connected humps. Assuming we’re drawing a right hand,  
the thumb should point in a northwest direction as drawn in Figure 5.57.  
Now, let’s draw the pointer finger. The pointer finger should be the longest  
finger and should point to the north, as depicted in Figure 5.58.  
Next, add three small humps representing the remaining fingers. They  
should point in the same direction as the pointer finger, and they should be  
considerably shorter as drawn in Figure 5.59.  
Finally, add a line that runs down to the wrist, representing the right side  
of the hand. You can even extend the line beneath the thumb downward if  
you wish, as illustrated in Figure 5.60  
FIGURE 5.59  
FIGURE 5.60 Representing Interactions 99  
Now let’s have some fun. Note the extra details added to the drawing in  
Figure 5.61. Let’s add two accent lines to make them look like Mickey Mouse  
hands. This is something I always do for fun, and you’d be surprised at how  
many people picked up on this in the past and commented on it.  
FIGURE 5.61  
Click Interactions  
Starting with our previous drawing, we can add other accents that further  
describe the interaction. We can add three radiating accent lines to  
represent a click or selection state, as drawn in Figure 5.62. For effect, I  
also added a drop-­ shadow to this hand, since it will appear to float over  
all of the screen elements.  
FIGURE 5.62  
Gestural Interactions  
Let’s revisit the hand drawing from Figure 5.61. Aside from adding a few  
embellishments like a drop shadow, we can add an arrow to suggest a swipe  
gesture, as displayed in Figure 5.63. The possibilities are endless. 100 CHAPTER FIVE Building From Circles, Triangles, and More  
FIGURE 5.63  
Describing interactions is an essential part of any digital product drawing.  
It helps your colleagues understand how people will interact with your  
product. Let’s revisit the telemedicine app concept I shared earlier in this  
book \(Figure 5.64\). Notice how the hand icon explains the video player’s  
behavior when the screen is scrolling.  
FIGURE 5.64  
Alternatives for Drawing Gestures  
So how did your hand drawings turn out? It’ll probably take some practice  
to master. Here’s a backup option for drawing gestures and mouse Representing Interactions 101  
interactions. We can replace the hand with a filled dot as depicted in  
Figure 5.65. The same radiating accent lines and arrows will suggest the  
same click and swipe interactions as in our previous hand drawing.  
FIGURE 5.65 C H A P T E R S I X  
# ILLUSTRATING  
# LIGHT, MOTION,  
# AND OTHER  
# CONCEPTS  
Sometimes it takes more than the basic icons and symbols covered in the  
last two chapters to communicate the essence of an idea. Illustrating  
concepts like light, depth, form, material, motion, and texture can further  
explain your idea \(see Figure 6.1\).  
There are a few simple ways to convey these concepts in your product  
drawings without having to have the skill or training of an accomplished  
artist. Let’s take a closer look.  
SHADING TECHNIQUES  
Before we dive into the actual concepts, let’s talk about shading. You can  
use different shading techniques to communicate many of the concepts  
explained in this chapter. Take a look at the drawing in Figure 6.2. In it,  
we can see how Leonardo da Vinci created a sense of light through the  
use of shading to help his viewers understand the complexities of this  
polyhedron form.  
The drawing’s light source originates from the top-­ left corner of the  
drawing. He used darker shading to represent surfaces that face farther  
away from the light source. Da Vinci’s use of shading also gives us an  
increased sense of the polyhedron’s material, shape, and texture.  
103 104 CHAPTER SIX Illustrating Light, Motion, and Other Concepts  
FIGURE 6.1  
FIGURE 6.2  
Source\: Polyhedra by Leonardo da Vinci, from Luca Pacioli’s “De divina proportione,”  
1509 edition  
Now let’s do a deep dive into shading. We will examine how shading  
can be used to suggest concepts like light, elevation, depth, texture, focus,  
and more. There are many different techniques that can be used to create  
shading in a drawing. Figure 6.3 highlights a few popular ones. Pointillism,  
hatching, crosshatching, contour shading, and scribbling are all popular  
techniques. We can differentiate these techniques by looking at the marks  
we make on the paper to create them. Looking at Lighting 105  
FIGURE 6.3  
Most of these techniques consist of lines, points, or both. Pointillism  
relies on a collection of points to create a shade, while the remaining  
techniques rely on lines to create the shade. The density of these marks  
determine how light or dark the shade appears. We will take a look at each  
of these techniques in more detail as we introduce and explore the concept  
of lighting later in this chapter.  
USING ACCENT MARKS  
Let’s revisit our knowledge of basic marks like the points and lines  
discussed in Chapter 3, “Lines and Points.” We can add some stylized  
versions of these marks to our product drawings to convey concepts like  
elevation, sound, motion, luminance, and texture. Figure 6.4 highlights a few  
examples of this.  
FIGURE 6.4  
Now, let’s take a look at how shading techniques and accent marks can  
be used to communicate several common yet abstract concepts.  
LOOKING AT LIGHTING  
This is one of my favorite concepts, and understanding the basics of lighting  
will help you better communicate the related concepts we’ll review later in  
this chapter. To create a light source in our drawings, we can use the various  
aforementioned shading techniques to illustrate the shadows. 106 CHAPTER SIX Illustrating Light, Motion, and Other Concepts  
Pointillism  
Many classic paintings were created using pointillism, a technique in which  
painted dots in distinct patterns were used to create the larger picture. Paul  
Signac’s painting depicted in Figure 6.5 is a textbook example of pointillism.  
FIGURE 6.5  
Source\: The Port of Saint-Tropez, Paul Signac 1901, oil on canvas, National Museum of  
Western Art, Tokyo  
In this example, he uses a set of points in lieu of lines to create every  
element in the scene, including the boats and buildings. He also used it  
to describe the water, light, and the various textures within the painting.  
Pointillism, while somewhat tedious, is an effective way to create shadows  
that suggest a light source.  
As you can see from Signac’s painting, when there is a higher  
concentration of dots, the shadow appears darker. Notice the cube drawing  
in Figure 6.6. If our light source appears to the top right of the cube, the sides  
that face away appear darker.  
Side 1 is the lightest. Side 2 is slightly darker since it doesn’t directly  
face the light source. Side 3 is completely opposite of the light source and  
faces away from it. This is the darkest side, therefore it contains the highest  
concentration of points. Looking at Lighting 107  
FIGURE 6.6  
To make this more realistic, we can use a few points to suggest a cast  
shadow coming off of the darkest side of the cube, as depicted in Figure 6.7.  
This will give the object some visual weight and grounding, thus making the  
light source appear a bit more believable.  
FIGURE 6.7 108 CHAPTER SIX Illustrating Light, Motion, and Other Concepts  
FIGURE 6.8  
In Figure 6.8, we’re applying pointillism to a sphere. Notice how the shading  
follows the curvature of the spherical form. We can create a gradient effect  
by slowly increasing the amount of points and their proximity to each other  
as we move away from the light source toward the lower left of the sphere, as  
depicted in Figure 6.8.  
Go ahead and give it a try. Draw a few cubes and spheres. You can even  
trace the sample cube in this book and then shade it. Once you’ve practiced  
this technique a few times, we’ll move on to some other shading techniques.  
Hatching  
Hatching is the use of lines to create shading. As with pointillism, the higher  
the concentration of lines, the darker the shading appears. Let’s revisit our  
cube example in Figure 6.9. Again, notice how the hatching becomes denser  
on the sides of the cube that face farther away from the light source.  
FIGURE 6.9  
Now, let’s look at an example of how the density of hatching lines can  
gradually increase to shade a spherical surface \(Figure 6.10\).  
FIGURE 6.10 Looking at Lighting 109  
Crosshatching  
Crosshatching is similar to hatching. It works the same way. The only  
difference is that the hatching lines intersect to form the shading. Again, the  
density of crosshatching determines the darkness of the shade. Figure 6.11  
depicts an example of crosshatching.  
FIGURE 6.11  
Contour Shading  
The lines used to create hatching can also follow the contour of the  
underlying form. Notice how curved hatching lines follow the outline of the  
sphere in Figure 6.12.  
Now, let’s have some fun. I included a more complex form, as you’ll see in  
Figure 6.13. Notice how the hatching lines follow the contour of the ribbon.  
FIGURE 6.12  
Scribbled Shading  
One last technique is to use basic scribbles. This works nicely if you’re  
working with graphite and pencils. Softer pencils can be used to create  
darker scribbles. Just as with the aforementioned techniques, the higher the  
density of scribbles, the darker the shadow will appear. Figure 6.14 depicts  
how scribbles can be used to add shading to a ribbon form. 110 CHAPTER SIX Illustrating Light, Motion, and Other Concepts  
FIGURE 6.13  
FIGURE 6.14  
You can even use your finger to smudge or blend the shading for a  
smoother gradient. Personally, I’m a fan of texture, so I left behind visible  
pencil strokes in my shading. Just for good measure, I even threw in some  
shading around the object to describe the surface it’s resting on.  
USING ELEVATION  
In the UX world, elevation is a concept used to improve the usability of a  
UI. It can be used to describe an element’s hierarchical importance. This  
powerful concept is even highlighted in popular design systems like Google’s Using Elevation 111  
Material Design. We can add elevation to any element by providing a sense  
of light and shading. If you think about it, most elements on a screen are  
layered on top of each other as depicted by the cross section concept  
drawing in Figure 6.15. Elevation can be considered an affordance within  
a UI that improves the overall usability. It can shed light on areas that have  
scrolling content. Let’s take a look at how it can be applied to a few basic  
UI elements.  
FIGURE 6.15  
Modals and Dialogs  
Modals and dialogs are common elements found in most desktop user  
interfaces. These elements are panels that pop up when you click or tap  
an option on the screen. They usually contain additional information and  
contextual actions. Modals and dialogs usually appear to be elevated off of  
the rest of the screen. To draw one of these elements, let’s start by drawing a  
box inside of a box as illustrated in Figure 6.16. 112 CHAPTER SIX Illustrating Light, Motion, and Other Concepts  
FIGURE 6.16  
Next, let’s add shading along the left and bottom outer edges of the inner  
box as drawn in Figure 6.17. Feel free to use the shading method of your  
choice. The inner panel should now appear elevated.  
FIGURE 6.17  
In this example I used hatching to create the drop shadow. Assuming  
the light source is located to the upper right of the image in Figure 6.17, the  
shadow would be cast to the lower‑left of the inner box. I was mindful of the  
direction of the hatching lines I used to create my shading. This accentuates  
the direction of the cast shadow and makes it more believable to the viewer.  
How about we bring this panel to life and make it look like a dialog? To  
do this, let’s add a title at the top of the inner box and some buttons in the  
lower-­ right corner of the inner box, as depicted in Figure 6.18. I’m going to fill  
in the right button to suggest that it’s a primary action.  
FIGURE 6.18 Using Elevation 113  
Some modals and dialogs use shading to draw more attention to  
themselves. In Figure 6.19, I’m using hatching to fill in the space between the  
inner and outer boxes.  
FIGURE 6.19  
In this case, I leveraged the range of tools mentioned in Chapter 3. I  
started with a heavy weight 0.5 mm Pigma Micron pen. I used the same  
pen to create the initial drop shadow. I used a pen with a thinner 0.35 mm  
point to add the additional shadow hatching texture that appears between  
the inner dialog box and the outer screen border. This difference in line  
weight adds an extra sense of polish to the drawing. It also helps the viewer  
understand the difference between the shadow and the shades used in  
this drawing.  
Fixed Position Elements  
Accent lines can be used to represent stationary or “sticky” elements in the  
UI. By running a parallel accent line beneath the header of an app bar, we can  
imply that its position is fixed, as depicted in Figure 6.20.  
FIGURE 6.20  
We can also add a scroll bar drawing \(Chapter 4, “Building from  
Rectangles”\) and a few list items as illustrated in Figure 6.21. When we do  
this, the drawing infers the app bar is always visible and the list content  
scrolls beneath it. 114 CHAPTER SIX Illustrating Light, Motion, and Other Concepts  
FIGURE 6.21  
Alternatively, instead of using an accent line beneath the app bar, we can  
use our favorite shading technique to create a drop shadow, as depicted in  
Figure 6.22.  
FIGURE 6.22 Using Elevation 115  
Cards  
Remember the card stack example from Chapter 4? It’s depicted in  
Figure 6.23. Let’s add some additional touches to show that the cards  
are elevated.  
FIGURE 6.23  
We can add some hatching coming off of the left and bottom sides of the  
cards in the stack to give it a sense of depth, as drawn in Figure 6.24.  
FIGURE 6.24  
Interaction Hands and Cursors  
We can introduce the concept of elevation when drawing cursor hands to  
represent mouse interactions \(Figure 6.25\).  
After all, the mouse cursor floats above the UI, so we should represent  
it that way. We can apply a drop shadow using the hatching technique as  
depicted in Figure 6.26.  
We can also use the same technique when suggesting gestural  
interactions within our digital product drawings. We can see an illustrated  
example of this applied to a mobile app layout as drawn in Figure 6.27.  
FIGURE 6.25 116 CHAPTER SIX Illustrating Light, Motion, and Other Concepts  
In this case, the purpose of the sketch was to propose a novel scrolling  
interaction, so I exaggerated the shadows used on our gestural interaction.  
The arrow shows the direction of the gesture that causes the scrolling and  
the popping out of the video player window.  
FIGURE 6.26  
FIGURE 6.27  
Other UI Elements  
Other UI elements that are typically elevated include action buttons, alerts,  
onboarding information, and status indicators. Using the aforementioned  
techniques, we can give these elements a sense of elevation as highlighted  
in Figure 6.28.  
These techniques can be used on any UI element you want to appear  
elevated or on its own vertical plane. Go ahead, give it a try!  
USING TEXTURE  
Believe it or not, there are a few cases in which texture can be used to help  
your colleagues understand your UX drawings. For example, textures can  
be applied to interactive elements like buttons and actions, giving them a  
tactile look and feel in your drawing. Figure 6.29 depicts a UI with textured Using Texture 117  
avatar images that double as selection controls. To show that the icons are  
interactive, I used a texture.  
FIGURE 6.28  
FIGURE 6.29  
Adding these textures can help others further understand which elements  
in the proposed product drawing are touchable or interactive.  
Textures can be used for conveying semantic meaning. If you’re  
drawing a product with charts, graphs, and visualizations, textures can  
help your colleagues understand how they might visualize the different  
categories of data within your product. This can be especially useful when 118 CHAPTER SIX Illustrating Light, Motion, and Other Concepts  
drawing charts that will show categories of information, such as stacked  
bar charts, stacked area charts, pie charts, and donut charts; Figure 6.30  
shows a stacked bar chart.  
FIGURE 6.30  
Textures can be used to represent physical materials. Let’s draw another  
box. By placing a few diagonal lines near the top-­ left and lower-­ right corners  
of the box, as you’ll see in Figure 6.31, we can imply that the rectangle is  
made of glass or some sort of glossy material. The lines can vary in length  
for added effect. This is a highly stylized solution that works in a pinch.  
FIGURE 6.31  
There are plenty of other ways to include texture in your drawings. These  
are just a few useful suggestions to get you started. After more practice  
and experience, you’ll be able to come up with plenty of other ways to use  
textures to convey a new idea. Capturing Motion 119  
CAPTURING MOTION  
This is one of the most fun concepts to capture. In a digital product drawing,  
we can describe transitional states between screens. Motion allows us  
to suggest how animated transitions may work, look, and feel. Let’s try  
representing the concept of motion in a drawing. We’ll start by drawing  
a railroad boxcar. To do this, we will draw a rectangle. Then, just for fun,  
we’ll add a few small lines and circles representing wheels, as depicted in  
Figure 6.32.  
FIGURE 6.32  
Now, let’s add motion lines behind the boxcar to imply its forward motion.  
To do this properly, it’s important to start the lines near the object, then  
draw away from it as illustrated in Figure 6.33. The direction of the lines  
implies motion.  
FIGURE 6.33  
In addition to adding motion lines, you can imply motion by distorting the  
shape itself. In the example in Figure 6.34, I distorted my box, offsetting the  
top horizontal line of the box to imply forward motion and speed.  
FIGURE 6.34 120 CHAPTER SIX Illustrating Light, Motion, and Other Concepts  
Figure 6.34 is an example of a motion line in a UX drawing. Some UIs  
feature spinning panels. Figure 6.35 highlights an example of the transition  
from one panel to another using a spin transition, and we can see that  
curved motion lines were added to further describe the transition.  
FIGURE 6.36  
FIGURE 6.35  
CONVEYING LUMINANCE  
Let’s take a look at how we can convey a sense of brightness within  
a product drawing. We can do this by applying a few minimal lines. In  
addition to providing a light source, the concept of luminance can help us  
understand the importance of an element in our proposed digital product.  
For example, luminance may be applied to an icon that may light up in order  
to grab someone’s attention when there is an active alert. It can even be  
applied to physical products that have LEDs that light up in order to provide  
visual feedback.  
Let’s jump in. If we draw accent lines radiating off of a shape such as the  
circle in Figure 6.36, it implies that the circle is illuminated.  
Longer lines placed farther away from the light source infer a higher level  
of brightness \(Figure 6.37\). This is a great way to communicate the concept  
of light without adding any shading to your drawing.  
We can do the same with an alert icon, as depicted in Figure 6.38. Communicating Sound 121  
FIGURE 6.37  
FIGURE 6.38  
COMMUNICATING SOUND  
We can use similar techniques to communicate sound by borrowing from  
the methods used to communicate the idea of luminance. When applied to  
alert notifications, we can use the same drawing we used for luminance to  
describe that the notification plays sound when it is displayed \(Figure 6.39\).  
FIGURE 6.39 122 CHAPTER SIX Illustrating Light, Motion, and Other Concepts  
We can use different line styles to symbolize audio feedback as well. Take  
a look at an alternative method displayed in Figure 6.40.  
FIGURE 6.40  
These are just a few ways to represent concepts in your drawings.  
Shading is the technique used to bring most of these concepts to life. Using  
accent lines to represent luminance, motion, and sound can help you provide  
additional details in your drawing.  
Just as artists use these same techniques to enable people to engage  
with their artwork, we can use them to enable our colleagues to connect with  
our ideas on a much deeper level.  
I had the chance to connect with a longtime friend and colleague, Borbay,  
Time Out’s most creative New Yorker of 2009, successful painter, NFT  
artist, and gallery owner. He leverages many of these concepts in his own  
paintings. According to Borbay, when you correctly deliver light, you deliver  
something more than a painting. You capture emotion, and these visuals  
become living breathing experiences for the viewer. Borbay’s painting in  
Figure 6.41 provides a great example of this. In product drawing, this can be  
helpful when using drawings to sell your next great idea.  
Borbay also uses texture to create a sense of depth and light in his works,  
which also invoke certain feelings in the viewer. Through the use of creative  
license and exaggerating concepts like light and texture, Borbay explains  
that you can create a painting of a field that will make the viewer cry, while  
depicting a lighting storm in a way that brings joy to the viewer. All of this  
takes practice, of course, but it’s a skill that you can build as you become  
more comfortable over time with drawing in your day-­ to-­ day work. Communicating Sound 123

# CONVERSATION WITH JASON BORBAY  
Jason Borbay is an artist, author, and entrepre-  
neur. In the following interview, he shares his  
ideas about techniques he uses in his paint-  
ings, including lighting and texturing, and how these  
can be applied in product and UX drawings.  
How might some of the techniques used in your  
paintings be leveraged in product and UX drawings  
to help people understand the essence of an idea?  
My work is process-driven. If you go to borbay.  
com and click on a painting, you will discover a  
step-by-step visual overview of its creation. The  
image is broken down into essential shapes and  
laid out with a warm under-painting. Next, each  
element is carefully drawn, and the shadows are  
blocked out. From there, every element is devel-  
oped in concert with the entire canvas to deliver a  
cohesive vision. This applies to anything. If you  
want to create a website, you begin with a pencil  
sketch of the idea, followed by a screen layout,  
which is then blue-boxed into a functional model to  
explore the flow. Concurrently, the look and feel is  
developed and eventually applied to the functional  
model to deliver the final experience. By dissecting  
something complex into its most basic elements,  
your vision will grow. And, as we all know, it’s far  
more cost effective to modify a UX design than it is  
to change a fully designed product after the fact.  
Lighting seems to be a dominant element in all  
of your artwork. Can you tell me how light plays a  
role in describing the forms depicted in your  
compositions? Speak to if/how you use lighting as  
a method for storytelling or invoking a specific  
feeling in the viewers?  
Without light there is darkness. Black is the  
absence of light, but it can be experienced in light.  
Light is complex. When a child draws a face, they 124 CHAPTER SIX Illustrating Light, Motion, and Other Concepts  
put the eyes at the top of the head, draw lips and  
hair are also disconnected. It doesn’t feel right.  
When you study light, whether you are creating a  
face or a neon sign, it’s all about shapes. The  
more severe the light, the more dramatic the  
shapes. When you correctly deliver light, you  
create something more than a painting—you  
capture emotion. Successful visuals across all  
disciplines make you feel. They emote. They are  
living, breathing experiences for the viewer, even  
when they are static  
Can you tell me more about how you might  
exaggerate elements in your paintings for effect?  
Why do you do this?  
We have a little thing called the “creative license,”  
and I’m going to push the boundaries until it is  
revoked. This could include omitting elements of  
the composition while exaggerating others. This is  
where fine art can transcend photography and  
digital work. A painting of a field can make  
someone cry, a terrible lightning storm can bring  
joy; It’s all about the execution, and the finest work  
is the result of painstaking analysis and scores of  
hours toiling to master your craft.  
How do texture and brush strokes play a role in  
your painting? I noticed some of your paintings,  
like the Biltmore Putting Green at Twilight \(see the  
figure\), are rich in texture, while others, like the  
Radio City painting are not.  
There is an Italian term, impasto, that essentially  
means creating depth through texture. In my  
gestural works, the mood changes dramatically, as  
a simple brush stroke can introduce an element of  
depth, light, and shadow within the picture plane. In  
other works, I’m intentionally deliberate with my  
brush strokes, allowing the light, space, and  
composition to breathe without variation on the  
surface. It’s akin to being a pitcher in baseball… if  
you have a pitcher who throws some serious heat,  
but the other team’s big slugger can’t hit a curve-  
ball, it’s on you to curate the correct pitches that  
will result in an out.

Can you tell me about how your painting style  
has developed over time? How have painting and  
drawing techniques and style matured and evolved  
throughout the years?  
Sometimes, I feel like I haven’t evolved at all; that  
is, until I go back in time and re-read my painting  
recap posts. My process continues to evolve and  
become more sophisticated\: the amoeba becomes a  
fish, which journeys out of the water as a lizard,  
begins to walk upright and, well, you know the rest.  
This is particularly evident in Borbay Studios &  
Gallery. when I look at a work from even 2020 next to  
what I’ve created since, the advancement is notice-  
able. That’s the beauty of life; if you continue to learn  
you will grow—and excellence will find you. I can’t  
wait to see what I’m capable of in 2030 and beyond.  
Further thinking about how to illustrate these concepts can help you start  
a deeper conversation with your colleagues about how your product will  
look, work, and respond to its users. You can even suggest how one might  
feel while using your product.  
Applying these concepts may feel intimidating at first, and yes, it will  
take some practice. You can develop these skills over time. It’s important  
to remember that we can all draw, and as Borbay suggests, we probably  
had our artistic development unintentionally stunted by an early-­ age, throw-away  
comment, like, “That’s not the best.” Or, perhaps we experienced an  
overwhelming feeling of inadequacy compared to our peers’ ability. If our  
artistic ability is frozen in time, we can unfreeze it by proceeding with an open  
mind and giving it another go. C H A P T E R S E V E N  
# THE SYSTEM  
L et’s pause for a moment and take stock of everything we’ve covered  
up until now. So far in this book, we took an in-­ depth look at a  
comprehensive set of reusable elements, or building blocks, that can be  
used in all of our digital product drawings. We also reviewed several ways to  
describe concepts like light, sound, texture, and motion.  
You are now armed with the right toolkit for creating a full product  
drawing. Let’s think of your visual library as a system as illustrated in  
Figure 7.1. Just like the components in a design system, they can be  
combined in different ways to develop, share, and collaborate on an infinite  
amount of ideas. That’s the focus of this chapter.  
FIGURE 7.1  
127 128 CHAPTER SEVEN The System  
FIGURE 7.2  
PUTTING IT TOGETHER  
Not sold on this? Let’s create a fairly detailed UX drawing. Moving forward,  
we are going to leverage our drawing system to create multiple drawings to  
convey an idea. Now, most UX drawings represent some sort of user journey,  
task, or flow. We will discuss this more in the next chapter. For this example,  
let’s pretend we’re designing a new email app for mobile devices.  
Before we jump in, let’s define the task we’re going to illustrate. In this  
case, we’ll show how someone can locate, read, and reply to an email  
in a hypothetical new email experience. To do this, let’s first brainstorm  
the process for responding to an email. Then we will map it in a process  
diagram. Remember, if you can draw boxes and arrows, you can draw a  
process diagram.  
Think about the last time you checked your email. Once you opened  
your email app, I’m going to guess that you looked at your inbox first and  
scanned all the unread messages. This will be the first step in our diagram,  
as illustrated in Figure 7.2.  
Next, I’m going to guess that you found a message that captured your  
attention. Maybe it was something urgent; you tapped on it and read it. That  
will be the next step illustrated in our diagram, as shown in Figure 7.3.  
FIGURE 7.3  
Finally, I’m going to go ahead and guess you replied to the message. That  
will be our third and final step in the process diagram. Let’s number the  
steps in our diagram as illustrated in Figure 7.4. If you need a refresher on  
process diagrams, please refer back to Chapter 2, “Reframing Our Thinking.”  
FIGURE 7.4  
Now, let’s draw some screens that correspond with each step in our  
process diagram. First, to draw the inbox screen, we’ll use an app bar, list  
view, and floating button. Since the app bar and button appear to float above  
the rest of the scrolling content, we’ll draw them first, as you will see in  
Figure 7.5. Putting It Together 129  
FIGURE 7.5  
In doing this, these objects will appear in front of the other elements.  
I even added some accent lines beneath the app bar and some hatching to  
the lower left of the floating button to show that they’re elevated.  
Next, we’ll add some list items and a scroll bar, as drawn in Figure 7.6.  
Since the list scrolls behind the floating button, none of the elements within  
the list item should be drawn on top of the floating button. To make life  
easier, consider creating the drawing with a pencil so you can erase any  
mistakes. You can always go over your pencil lines with ink later on.  
Since the list of messages in the inbox screen scrolls, we’ll add our  
symbol for a scroll bar, and we’ll use some hatching to show that the app bar  
remains in a fixed position and the content scrolls beneath it, as highlighted  
in Figure 7.6.  
Finally, we can add a cursor hand to show which list item was tapped to  
get to the next screen, as you will see in Figure 7.7.  
I chose to add it over the second list item. Don’t forget, we can use  
hatching to apply a drop shadow coming off the lower-­ left side of the  
cursor hand. This implies that the cursor hand is not part of the actual  
screen layout. 130 CHAPTER SEVEN The System  
FIGURE 7.6  
FIGURE 7.7 Putting It Together 131  
Now, let’s move to step 2 and represent the next screen in the flow. To  
represent the actual message, we’ll do a few things. First, we’ll draw a new  
screen. Instead of using a standard menu icon, or hamburger, in the app bar,  
we’ll draw a backward arrow. Also, be sure to add a label here as you see in  
Figure 7.8. That way we can show that we’re now on a new screen and that  
there’s a way for users to get back to the previous screen.  
FIGURE 7.8  
To start filling in content, let’s draw a message header area. This will  
appear just beneath the app bar and above the actual message. This  
would include the avatar image of the message’s sender, the subject line,  
time stamps, and so on. We’ll use the same elements from our list item on  
the previous screen to represent this. The message info area is labeled in  
Figure 7.9.  
Next, let’s fill in some message content. To do this, we’ll draw a series of  
lines to represent the message’s content. All lines should be left aligned but  
may vary in length, as you see labeled in Figure 7.9.  
Finally, we’ll add some buttons beneath the text block to suggest actions  
that can be taken. Be sure to draw a cursor hand pointing to the reply button.  
You may even consider using shading and writing out the word reply within  
the button, as drawn in Figure 7.10. 132 CHAPTER SEVEN The System  
FIGURE 7.9  
FIGURE 7.10 Putting It Together 133  
Finally, let’s draw the third and last step. To do this, we’ll draw a new  
screen, and we’ll arrange a few symbols representing form controls. Let’s  
start by drawing another app bar. We’ll use an arrow and add a Reply label as  
highlighted in Figure 7.11.  
FIGURE 7.11  
Next, we’ll add some of the form controls covered previously in Chapter 4,  
“Building from Rectangles.” We’ll add two text fields that represent the  
recipient’s line and subject line, as pictured in Figure 7.11. Next, we’ll add a  
text area. This represents the area where the reply will be crafted. Instead of  
using lines to represent form labels, I chose to write them out. This further  
describes the purpose of each field to the viewer.  
Finally, as pictured in Figure 7.11, we’ll add a send button beneath the  
text area. I even added a cursor hand pointing to the Send button so that we  
know how the illustrated task is completed.  
Now, let’s put it all together. If you didn’t already, let’s arrange the process  
diagram and corresponding screen designs into an organized flow as  
depicted in Figure 7.12. 134 CHAPTER SEVEN The System  
FIGURE 7.12  
If you used separate papers to create your process diagrams and screen  
drawings, go ahead and cut them out. You can start with the process  
diagram and then paste each screen cutout beneath the corresponding step.  
Be sure to number the screens so they correspond with the steps in the  
process diagram as depicted in Figure 7.12. Instead of cutting and pasting,  
you can also redraw the diagram and screens arranged on the same paper. If  
you have a dedicated workspace or studio with a bare wall, you can hang all  
of your drawings up on the wall and take a photo.  
That’s it! We just created our first flow of screens. This is a rich UX  
drawing that describes the steps taken to reply to an urgent message  
within our pretend email app design. In this drawing, we get a sense of  
the overarching process as well as how each screen looks and behaves.  
We even highlighted key interaction points that moved us forward in the  
illustrated process. By showing the elevation of elements like the app  
bar on certain screens, we also provide additional details on how each  
screen behaves.  
CREATING SOMETHING NEW  
As you can see, the system of concepts and elements in your visual library  
is very versatile. It especially works well when drawing screens and UX  
elements that were popular at the time in which this book was written. As  
time goes on, and technology evolves, you’re going to encounter situations  
where you may have to create a new symbol, element, or icon on your own. Creating Something New 135  
To do this, think about the basic shapes you can combine to draw new  
elements. Nearly everything you draw can be distilled down to a few basic  
shapes and marks. Think about how you can leverage the basic concepts  
covered in this book.  
Recently, I was thinking of ways to visualize the effects of precipitation  
on a network of high altitude flight vehicles and satellites. I knew I’d want to  
create some sort of 3D weather visualization that highlighted the vehicles  
and their locations and ability to communicate with each other. I also knew I  
wanted to overlay weather information on the same visualization. This  
would include wind and precipitation information; I wasn’t sure how  
I wanted to do it.  
I turned to drawing to help me think through a few ideas. While  
brainstorming methods for visualizing weather systems and satellite  
networks, I turned to nature to provide inspiration for my end solution.  
The murmuration of starlings in Figure 7.13 gave me the idea to represent  
precipitation and cloud moisture using a particle system. As far as I could  
think, this seemed like a promising start, but I needed to see it on paper. Now,  
looking at the image in Figure 7.13, you might recognize that the starlings  
look like dots. Some areas of the murmuration have higher concentrations of  
birds than others. This seemed to translate well into a weather visualization,  
where particles could be used to represent a storm system. The denser the  
particles, the higher the cloud moisture, precipitation rate, and so on. This  
could also work well in 3D.  
FIGURE 7.13 136 CHAPTER SEVEN The System  
Now for the drawing part, let’s imagine each starling as a point in a  
drawing, as highlighted in Figure 7.14. Does this remind you of a shading  
technique we discussed in the previous chapter?  
FIGURE 7.14  
For my actual product drawing, which is featured in Figure 7.15,  
you can now see how I used pointillism to demonstrate my idea. The  
points represent the particle system, and you can see how it fits into the  
visualization of my satellite network. In this drawing, the storm is impacting  
a satellite’s ability to communicate with a ground station.  
FIGURE 7.15  
This is a fine example of a time when I was working with a team on a  
completely new product with cutting-­ edge technology. One of my colleagues Creating Something New 137  
even referred to it as science fiction. When brainstorming solutions during this  
project, I turned to drawing to help me develop my ideas. I leveraged the basic  
shapes and marks covered earlier in this book to represent a new idea. While  
I didn’t have a preset icon or symbol in mind for representing weather in a  
visualization, I turned to the basic marks I used to draw common shapes, and  
I applied them in a new way.  
As time goes on, and you become more comfortable with drawing, think  
about how you can leverage marks, concepts, and the basic shapes and  
elements previously covered to create something completely new. Of course,  
if it works for you, this new drawing might become a core part of your library  
moving forward. In the next chapters, we’re going to look at even more ways  
to apply your visual library in a systematic way to tell compelling stories. C H A P T E R E I G H T  
# USING FLOWS  
# TO TELL STORIES  
Now that we covered the “how to draw” content, let’s have some fun.  
We now have a working visual library of elements, and we reviewed  
ways to combine them and create an array of screens and detailed UX  
drawings. Let’s take a look at how we can use this knowledge to start  
telling stories.  
In the last chapter, we created a basic flow. We started with a process  
diagram and then drew screens based on each step in the illustrated  
process. Most digital experiences are designed based on the key needs of  
the people using our proposed product, website, or experience. The solutions  
we create should help these people accomplish their high-­ priority goals  
and tasks.  
Our designs should be built around these goals and tasks. Because of this,  
we usually present our designs as a flow of screens, or steps, in a process that  
represent our proposed method for completing a task or accomplishing a goal  
in our proposed product. For example, let’s revisit our inbox app flow from the  
last chapter \(Figure 8.1\). This design was optimized for someone who wanted  
to complete the task of finding an important email and replying to it.  
To bring this flow to life, you first need to understand the syntax of a great  
screen flow, and then we’ll review some additional elements that increased  
the impact of this drawing.  
STARTING WITH THE SYNTAX  
Just as there are different written languages, such as English, Spanish,  
French, and German, there are different visual languages. This book refers  
to the visual language of digital products and UX design. Let’s think about  
the building blocks of our visual library. We can consider these items the  
“words” of our visual language. If we refer back to our inbox flow, shown  
139 140 CHAPTER EIGHT Using Flows to Tell Stories  
in Figure 8.2, the interface elements, such as the email list, the message,  
and form controls, are the nouns. Concepts like light, motion, elevation,  
and texture describe these nouns. These are the adjectives of our visual  
language. Finally, the actions we take to move us forward in the flow, like  
tapping buttons, gestural interactions, scrolling, and typing our reply, are the  
verbs in our visual language.  
FIGURE 8.1  
FIGURE 8.2  
A good flow starts with syntax. Just as the right syntax of nouns, verbs,  
and adjectives enables us to craft a coherent sentence, the right syntax  
of visual elements enables us to craft a coherent flow that describes the  
completion of a task or goal in our digital product. If we were to omit a word  
from a sentence, the sentence might lose its meaning. The same is true Starting with the Syntax 141  
for our flows. If we omit a step from our flow, it will also lose some of its  
meaning. Let’s take a look.  
Using our inbox example, if we were to omit step 2 from the original inbox  
example in Figure 8.2, the flow becomes much more difficult to understand,  
as you can see in Figure 8.3. When looking at this, you might wonder how we  
got from the inbox screen on the left directly to the reply screen on the right.  
There’s no visible option to directly reply to a message available on the inbox  
screen drawing.  
FIGURE 8.3  
It’s not only a matter of missing screens, there are key elements in each  
screen that help us understand the syntax of this flow. For example, if  
we were to remove the app bars atop each of the drawings as shown in  
Figure 8.4, we lose our sense of orientation within the flow. Wayfinding in  
this flow is much more difficult.  
FIGURE 8.4 142 CHAPTER EIGHT Using Flows to Tell Stories  
Remember, when you’re sharing a new idea, your teammates cannot read  
your mind. They’re seeing a representation of your idea for the very first time.  
It’s important to make sure all the necessary elements are in each screen  
and each step is represented.  
In the tech industry, the lingo we use to describe our work is constantly  
evolving. Not everyone will be up to speed on that lingo. Your drawings can  
further define the lingo you’re using. At the time in which this book was  
written, the metaverse and Web3 were all the rage. Not everyone knew  
what that referred to at first. Drawing can be used to better articulate ideas  
created for evolving tech platforms and new surfaces and spaces. To do this  
right, the bottom line is this\: our teammates need to see all the screens and  
understand all the steps taken to complete the goal or task at hand in our  
proposed product, even if some of the steps seem redundant.  
SHOWING INTERACTIONS  
Interactions are the glue that holds our flows and storyboards together.  
These are the aforementioned verbs in our visual language. They are a  
crucial part of any UX drawing because they are a representation of how  
people will interact with our products. They also show how someone will  
move forward to the next step in order to accomplish their goal. Helping your  
teammates understand how someone will arrive on a screen and how they  
will get to the next screen will help them better understand your ideas.  
To represent interactions, we will use drawings of different cursor types  
and gestures as depicted in Figure 8.5 to represent different types of  
interaction in our flows. Drawing these individual items was covered in more  
detail in Chapter 5, “Building from Circles, Triangles, and More.”  
FIGURE 8.5  
In our inbox example, you’ll notice we showed a small touch interaction  
on each screen. We can assume that this is the interaction that moves us  
to the next step. In Figure 8.6, I enlarged the interactions to place more  
focus on them. Showing Interactions 143  
FIGURE 8.6  
Another way we can place focus on the sequence is to connect each  
screen by drawing arrows directly from the interaction to the next screen,  
as depicted in Figure 8.7. It’s up to you to determine how much focus is  
appropriate to place on the interactions depicted in your flow. This does  
take some focus off of some of the interface details in each screen, but it’s  
effective in showing the ease of interaction within the flow.  
FIGURE 8.7 144 CHAPTER EIGHT Using Flows to Tell Stories  
Let’s imagine we’re creating a flow that represents the key screens of  
a new photos app. The flow we will see in Figure 8.8 demonstrates how  
someone would find the perfect photo from last month’s trip to share with  
family and friends. Since the app will run on a mobile device, the design will  
rely on gestures like swiping and scrolling to find the photo. Notice how they  
are represented in Figure 8.8.  
FIGURE 8.8  
JUST ENOUGH INFORMATION  
If you look at steps 4 and 5 in Figure 8.8, you’ll notice they look very similar.  
It’s difficult to discern how the steps differ from each other. The gesture  
depicted in step 4 and the numbers 02 and 03 in the bottom-­ right corner  
of the images in steps 4 and 5 are our only indications that something has  
changed. Sometimes, in a case like this, we need to make it more obvious  
that something has changed as a result of the swipe interaction between  
steps 4 and 5. In this particular flow, the user can swipe to access the next Depicting Transitions 145  
image. To make this more obvious, I’m going to use some basic marks  
and shading to suggest the content in each of the photos as depicted in  
Figure 8.9.  
FIGURE 8.9  
The key is that the two images look drastically different from one another.  
That way, people looking at this image can understand that the swipe  
gesture led us to an entirely new image. For the first image in step 4, let’s  
suggest some mountains. In the image in step 5, let’s suggest some trees.  
You can rough in different shapes or whatever you wish to suggest the  
change in images.  
DEPICTING TRANSITIONS  
In some cases, animation is used to help strengthen people’s mental  
model of an interface, and if done well, it can be used to help teach people  
how it works. Because of this, there are times when we should consider 146 CHAPTER EIGHT Using Flows to Tell Stories  
representing animation in our drawings, especially when it’s a crucial part of  
our proposed design. We can use arrows and motion lines \(Figure 8.10\) to  
demonstrate how animated transitions might work.  
FIGURE 8.10  
FIGURE 8.11 Labels and Annotations 147  
Now, let’s revisit our photos app flow. While the gestures do a fine job  
connecting the screens in our flow, there’s still some missing information  
that will better describe the specifics of this flow. Let’s add a few key  
transitional screens into our flow as you see in Figure 8.11. This will  
enable us to further describe the relationship between the interactions,  
the subsequent animations, and the transitions from the photo grid to  
individual photos.  
In this example, we added two transitional screens. The first is depicted  
in step 4 of Figure 8.11. It shows the photo that was tapped in step 3. The  
photo morphs into a card. It’s moving forward and taking over the screen.  
This helps us better understand how we transitioned from step 3 to step 5.  
In this transition frame, additional details of the photo card are coming into  
view. The arrows show the direction in which the photo card grows.  
In Step 6, we see another transition screen. This time, we are seeing a  
depiction of the photos animating as a result of the swipe interaction in  
the previous step. This highlights how someone might swipe forward to  
navigate to the next photo in the card view. I also threw in the impression  
of the mountains and the trees to make the transition more believable. This  
also helps us understand that there’s a difference between steps 5 and 7.  
LABELS AND ANNOTATIONS  
Since our visual library mostly consists of shapes and icons that carry  
symbolic meaning, we often need to add text and notes to further describe  
our ideas.  
First and foremost, we can use labels in lieu of lines to represent screen  
titles and sections of content. Let’s revisit our telemedicine app example.  
I isolated a key part of this drawing in Figure 8.12. Notice how I used  
handwritten labels to further describe the content sections like the video  
feed, summary, photos, and other details. These labels appear right in the  
drawing. I also used labels to show an outline of the content that will appear  
in this screen. This provides more detail on the hierarchy of information  
that would appear on this screen. This reference appears to the right of the  
drawing in Figure 8.12.  
In addition to labels, annotations can be used to further highlight the  
thought process behind our drawings, the organization of our layouts, and  
their connection to real-­ world constraints and scenarios.  
Figure 8.13, another isolated view of the full app drawing, points to the  
additional notes and doodles that begin to describe how the layout may  
work in landscape mode. These notes appear to the right of the consultation  
screen layout drawing. While the full landscape mode wasn’t yet designed,  
these notes were used as a conversation starter to help my teammates and  
project stakeholders begin to brainstorm how a landscape view might work. 148 CHAPTER EIGHT Using Flows to Tell Stories  
FIGURE 8.12  
FIGURE 8.13 Labels and Annotations 149  
Let’s go back to the full drawing as you will see it \(Figure 8.14\).  
Annotations help us understand that we’re looking at two different versions  
of the same screen. The first drawing on the left is the default state of  
the screen. The second is a scrolling view that demonstrates how the  
video player remains fixed throughout a consultation as the rest of the  
screen scrolls. The labels above each screen and a few other noted details  
highlighted in Figure 8.14 help us understand this.  
When you have the luxury of presenting your own drawings to your team,  
your annotations may be somewhat minimal. If your drawings are going to  
FIGURE 8.14  
be part of a presentation that’s left behind to be read later, your annotations  
might be much heavier because the people who will see it later may not have  
the context. In this case, the drawings are integrated into a slide deck that  
are part of a larger design presentation with plenty of complementary text.  
While we’re on the subject of text and annotations, I want to point out that  
handwriting matters. It’s important that your notes and labels can be read by  
others, especially in your absence. While my handwriting is terrible at best,  
I always try to pull it together for my product drawings.  
Here’s something that helped me\: I always admired the works of famous  
architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, who introduced several revolutionary  
new construction techniques. His ideas were clearly articulated through  
beautifully labeled drawings. Just as Wright was introducing a lot of new  
ideas in the architecture community, we are introducing a lot of new ideas in  
the tech industry. 150 CHAPTER EIGHT Using Flows to Tell Stories  
At an early age I adopted a similar writing style. After all, most blueprints  
are labeled with all uppercase handwriting. The style invokes a serious and  
technical feel, something that I want to carry into my own work.  
Label positioning and leveling is also important. It’s okay to use a  
straightedge and a pencil to draw construction lines first, as suggested  
in Figure 8.15. Construction lines will provide a clean baseline for your  
handwritten label. We can use construction to align the height of the small  
and large capital letters in each label.  
FIGURE 8.15  
Finally, letter quality is important. We should always use clean lines to  
draw each letter form. It’s okay if it takes longer to write each letter. Take  
your time! Clearly written labels will enable your teammates to do less work  
interpreting your drawing. Give it a try. You’ll be surprised at how quickly you  
can elevate the quality of your existing drawings.  
If you’re still not feeling good about your handwriting or ability to add  
labels and annotations to your sketches, you might consider adding them  
digitally once your drawings are scanned and embedded in your design  
presentation.  
BEING CONSCIOUS OF COMPOSITION  
As you might imagine, our UX drawings can become quite detailed and  
complex. Illustrating a task, even with the most elegant of interface designs,  
may still require several drawings. It’s important to think about where  
the sketches will live and what purpose they will serve. This will help you  
determine how to best arrange your flows.  
For example, the composition we used earlier \(Figure 8.16\), where we  
show everything at once, including the workflow diagram and corresponding  
screens, works well if you have a dedicated UX space and you’re going to  
hang up your drawings on a large wall. That method also works well if you’re  
using a whiteboard. Being Conscious of Composition 151  
FIGURE 8.16  
If you’re going to be dropping your sketches into a digital slide deck, or if  
you’re creating a multipage presentation doc, your flow might span several  
pages or slides. In this case, you might consider showing one screen per  
page as suggested in Figure 8.17. Notice how we’re using the process  
diagram on each page for additional context and wayfinding purposes. The  
corresponding step is highlighted in the diagram at all times.  
Minimaps can be a crucial way­ finding mechanism, especially in a long  
flow with many screens and steps. If your product’s information architecture  
is more important to your team, you can show context and location by  
drawing on each page a mini–information architecture \(IA\) map instead of  
the process diagram. You can map the screen to its place in the IA for each  
process step illustrated, as suggested in Figure 8.18.  
These are just a few examples of how you can create a flow. If the flow is  
going to break onto multiple pages, it’s important to consider what element  
will provide the greater context on each page of the flow, whether it’s a  
process diagram, IA map, or some other drawing. The possibilities here  
are endless, and I can’t wait to see what you come up with as you start to  
include drawing in your product design process. I will provide more details  
on how you can combine different types of drawings with your flows to tell  
an engaging story in the next chapter. 152 CHAPTER EIGHT Using Flows to Tell Stories  
FIGURE 8.17  
FIGURE 8.18 Being Conscious of Composition 153  
No matter what composition you use for your flow, there’s a few tactical  
things you must consider in order to improve readability. Drawings can be  
quite complex, so it’s important to provide a starting point in every flow.  
Think about the reading direction of your culture. Western cultures read  
from left to right and top to bottom. With this in mind, the first screen should  
appear at the left or top of your flow depending on its orientation, as you will  
see highlighted in Figure 8.19. I highly recommend numbering the steps to  
further establish the starting screen in the flow.  
FIGURE 8.19  
Highlighting the sequence and direction of the flow is also important.  
Numbering is a nice way to do this with linear flows. Some screen flows may  
include decision points and dependencies and highlight multiple outcomes.  
For these, I highly suggest using arrows to connect each of the screens, as  
highlighted in Figure 8.20.  
Finally, readability can be improved through well-­ aligned drawings.  
Screens in a horizontal flow should be vertically aligned with each other.  
Screens on a vertical flow should be horizontally aligned with each other.  
Additionally, I suggest making sure some of the key elements in the screen 154 CHAPTER EIGHT Using Flows to Tell Stories  
are also aligned. That way your flow is optimized for readability. You’ll want  
your teammates to focus on the content of the drawing rather than how it  
was drawn.  
FIGURE 8.20  
When I start a new drawing, especially for a design presentation, I use  
construction lines drawn with pencil to make sure my screens and their  
elements are properly aligned. Take a look at Figure 8.21. This example  
shows the construction lines I used to draw the flow depicted earlier in  
Figure 8.19. Once you apply ink to your drawing, these lines can be erased  
and no one will ever know they existed.  
I can’t stress enough the importance of this, especially if you’re wondering  
how to draw with the elegance and polish of a seasoned UX designer. Clean  
alignments of screens and their key elements will enable people to focus  
more on the content of your flows and less on how they were drawn.  
Using a flow is the best way to develop and share new designs for screen-based  
products. It helps you and your team focus on designing the best  
possible methods for your product’s users to accomplish an important task  
or achieve their goals using your product.  
Thinking about the syntax of your flow will help your teammates and  
stakeholders better understand your ideas. Annotations will help you further  
describe the steps and key details in your design. Considering where your  
drawings will live and how they will be consumed by your peers will enable Being Conscious of Composition 155  
you to make better decisions as to how to structure your flows and optimize  
their layouts for readability.  
FIGURE 8.21  
These considerations will enable you to elicit the right feedback from your  
team, and it will enable them to focus on what matters. Now that we covered  
the basics of a flow, let’s talk about how to use what we already know in  
order to tell a rich story that will contribute to a better outcome. C H A P T E R N I N E  
# TELLING

Now that we’re assembling our drawings into flows, let’s have some  
fun and take things a step further. Let’s focus on the art of sharing  
drawings with colleagues and enabling them to connect with your ideas.  
One of my favorite paintings is the Great Wave Off Kanagawa, as illustrated in  
Figure 9.1. Do you know what this painting is about? Take a guess. At first glance  
you might suspect that it is a depiction of a tidal wave, or a ship that’s about to  
capsize. After all, these elements are prominently featured in the composition.  
FIGURE 9.1

157 158 CHAPTER NINE Telling Engaging Stories  
It turns out that this is a depiction of Mount Fuji, which is pictured in the  
background. In fact, The Great Wave Off Kanagawa is one painting in a larger  
series, Thirty-­ Six Views of Mount Fuji. Figure 9.2, Figure 9.3, and Figure 9.4  
highlight a few pieces from this series. You’ll notice that each painting in

FIGURE 9.4  
Source\: Honjo Tatekawa, the timberyard at Honjo, by Katsushika Hokusai  
the series features a unique composition that provides a view of Mount Fuji.  
The volcano is more prominently featured in some of the works and less in  
others. It typically appears as a background element.  
Manuel Lima, who is well known for his work in data visualization and  
the author of the foreword to this book, also published a wonderful article  
comparing Mount Fuji to a data set. In the article, Manuel explained how  
there are infinite ways to view the data set, just as Hokusai, the artist,  
created different ways to view Mount Fuji in his series.  
It turns out, just as Manuel thinks of a data set as Mount Fuji, we can  
think of our ideas as Mount Fuji. There are endless ways to view them. Our  
drawings may provide one or many views of an idea. We curate and arrange  
several of the elements in our visual library into a composition to create  
that unique point of view. This point of view is ultimately passed on to our  
colleagues that we’re sharing the drawing with. What do we want them to  
see? What do we want them to take away from our ideas? How do we want  
them to feel about them? What is important for them to focus on? These are  
just a few of the considerations we will take into account when drawing our  
view of an idea.  
The results of the compositional decisions set the purpose and meaning  
of the visual statement and carry strong implications for what the viewer  
receives. \(Dondis 1973, 20\) In order for our drawing to resonate with  
colleagues, it’s important to give them a view of our idea that is realistic,  
engaging, and grounded in reality. Let’s take a look at a few ways to do this.  
This is going to be helpful when you’re creating drawings to share with  
colleagues. It will help your teammates connect with your ideas on a deeper 160 CHAPTER NINE Telling Engaging Stories  
level, and it will enable them to provide more thoughtful feedback and give  
you the ability to build on your ideas more effectively, thus moving the design  
thinking process forward. After all, design happens best in a group. Let’s  
jump in and explore techniques for making our drawings more effective  
through storytelling.  
REAL-­ WORLD CONSTRAINTS  
First and foremost, as we’re creating our UX drawings, we always need  
to keep in mind real-­ world scenarios and constraints that will affect our  
decision‑making throughout our product design process. Drawings that  
are not connected to reality will rarely lead to a successful outcome. Even  
when I’m facilitating a design workshop, I notice the drawings that lack  
consideration for real-­ world constraints are usually quickly discarded by the  
team. With that all being said, it’s not difficult to connect your ideas to reality.  
Let’s take a look at a few things to consider when grounding ideas in reality.  
Start with Content—­ Everything Else Follows  
Years ago, when I was just entering the professional world as a young  
designer, I cared a lot about visual design, maybe even too much for my own  
good. In fact, I was formally trained as a visual designer, and my degree is in  
fine arts. Shortly after graduating, I landed my first job at a small mom-and-­  
pop shop advertising agency in a small Pennsylvania college town.  
I designed several microsites and online promotions for Scripps Networks,  
Lutron, and Yahoo!  
During this time, I was encouraged to sketch my early ideas, just as we  
did in design school. I would review the copy deck created by the copywriter;  
then I’d start sketching different layout options and considerations for big  
ideas and visual design themes that would bring the copy to life. Sadly, in  
doing this, I wasn’t as focused on the content itself as much as I was the  
overall design direction.  
When I moved from concept sketches to creating computer-­ generated  
designs, I started working with actual content. During this time, I realized  
my early drawings were useless and got me nowhere in the process. They  
were just crude marks on a piece of paper and nothing more. They meant  
absolutely nothing because they were content-­ agnostic layouts. They didn’t  
account for the amount of content, whether or not it was user‑generated  
or editable or had the potential to scale up. At the time, I wondered why  
drawing was even supposed to be helpful. This was an honest rookie Real-­ World Constraints 161  
mistake; however, it made me skip the drawing part of the process for a  
good five years, which showed in my design work.  
It wasn’t until slightly later in my career, when I was working at  
Electronic Ink, a well-­ respected UX consultancy in Philadelphia, with a more  
experienced team with seasoned leadership did I understand the value  
drawing could provide. After watching my colleagues and observing their  
process, I wised up and realized that content comes first and everything  
else follows.  
Once I started analyzing the text, its main points, and the underlying story  
it supported, I began to think about properly developing my ideas through  
drawings. I started thinking about how to better integrate the content with a  
visual experience in a proper flow and tone. I started thinking about how to  
incorporate large and small chunks of content into different sections of the  
website layout, thus creating a much better web page design.  
Information Sources  
This story from my early career focuses on websites; content is still king  
when it comes to a digital product’s interface. When thinking about the  
components and screen-­ based elements in your UX drawing, think about the  
information that will be populated in these elements.  
If you’re not working with static content, then a lot of questions will arise.  
Where will it come from? Is it available today? How often will it be updated?  
Is it necessary to show when it was last updated? What is the plan for  
maintaining the content moving forward?  
If content is going to be user‑generated, then there are different scenarios  
we will have to account for. When sharing our drawings with our colleagues,  
we must speak to these scenarios. Let’s imagine we’re creating an e-commerce  
site for selling digital cameras and we’re planning on featuring a  
customer reviews widget at the bottom of each product page, as drawn in  
the example in Figure 9.5.  
Since customer reviews are user‑generated, it’s likely that some products  
may have a lot of reviews. Some may not have any at all. What does that  
empty state look like when there aren’t any reviews? We should consider  
these situations, as depicted in Figure 9.6.  
These are just some examples of the questions and scenarios that may  
be raised by your colleagues, especially when it comes to content and its  
source. Early on in the process, you don’t have to flesh out all the fine details,  
but it is important to start considering them, as these considerations will  
help your teammates get on board with your ideas much more quickly. Let’s  
look at a few more ways to ground your ideas in reality. 162 CHAPTER NINE Telling Engaging Stories  
FIGURE 9.5  
FIGURE 9.6 Real-­ World Constraints 163  
Interface Patterns and Widgets  
Let’s continue to expand on this content-­ centric approach to design. It’s  
necessary to consider the volume of content and text you may be displaying  
in your digital product, app, or website. Let’s revisit the previous product  
reviews widget example. In this case, since content will be user‑generated,  
and the lengths of the reviews will vary greatly, it will be important to  
consider scale.  
Each review can be lengthy, especially ones posted by people who are  
dissatisfied with the product. It’s important to account for this in the drawing  
and consider how long reviews might be handled. A simple scroll bar may  
work, or applying a Show More label or an expand control within each review  
may be helpful \(Figure 9.7\). Even if you don’t want to decide on a solution  
in the drawing, it’s worth annotating. It’s essential to show that you’ve  
considered these scenarios when sharing with your colleagues.  
FIGURE 9.7  
Also consider the volume of reviews. In this case, I’d anticipate a lot. Will  
the reviews fall on multiple pages, or will they load progressively? Alluding  
to how the widget handles high volumes of information, as depicted in  
Figure 9.8, will be helpful. 164 CHAPTER NINE Telling Engaging Stories  
FIGURE 9.8  
Reviewing Data  
Considering scale is especially important when designing dashboards and  
visualizations. Let’s imagine we’re going to use a visualization to provide a  
key insight or answer an important question a user is asking of the data.  
First, understanding the size of the data set is important. Reviewing real  
data sets up front will influence the decision making here. Will there be an  
order of one, tens, hundreds, thousands, or millions of data points in the  
visualization?  
Let’s imagine we’re creating a visualization that shows event occurrences  
over time. If we’re dealing with a limited set of events, let’s say on the order  
of tens of events, and the duration of each event is important to the user,  
we might represent blocks drawn on a swimlane. Each block represents an  
event occurrence and its length represents its duration, as you will see in  
Figure 9.9. We can even get an impression of cases when events overlap.  
This, of course, only will work when dealing with a very limited set of events.  
FIGURE 9.9 Real-­ World Constraints 165  
If we’re going to show millions of event occurrences, and it’s more  
important for someone to see unexpected spikes and dips in those  
occurrences, the aforementioned swimlane likely won’t work. Showing  
thousands of events on a single swimlane would likely not be readable.  
Instead, histograms, like the one illustrated in Figure 9.10, are a more  
scalable solution and can be used to render an infinite amount of events.  
They also do a better job of highlighting unexpected trends, spikes, and dips  
in event occurrences.  
FIGURE 9.10  
If we’re going to show trends over time and we know there’s a lot of data  
and we have limited space to show the graph, perhaps we should include an  
area chart \(Figure 9.11\) in our drawing instead of a histogram or bar chart.  
Line charts are more readable as sparklines than histograms.  
FIGURE 9.11  
Knowing the data set and considering how it will scale up or down in your  
chart will enable you to make more realistic design decisions, even early  
on in your process when you’re just sketching out your initial ideas. These  
considerations will make your drawing that much more realistic, and they’ll  
make your ideas more concrete when it comes time to share with the rest of  
your team. 166 CHAPTER NINE Telling Engaging Stories  
Show Something New—­ Start the Conversation  
While you should always be ready to discuss how your hand-­ drawn  
proposal considers real-­ world constraints, it’s sometimes nice to throw a  
few blue sky ideas into your presentations that demonstrate a breadth of  
thinking or provide a fresh perspective. You can sprinkle these big ideas  
into your presentation as you deem necessary. Who knows? Maybe it will  
lead to a meaningful change to your product’s road map. The nice thing  
about a drawing is that it doesn’t require a lot of investment. I typically use  
drawings as a conversation starter. If you decide to do this, just be ready to  
explain the constraint that needs to be removed in order to get to this state.  
For example, “if we had access to X we can now do Y as depicted in this  
concept sketch.”  
As you continue to include drawing in your process, you’ll start to gain  
an understanding of the people you’re working with and how much detail  
you’ll need to provide. If your teammates are more visionary in nature, then  
you may not need to provide as many explanations. If they’re people who  
aren’t used to working with drawings, then it will be important to make the  
drawings as concrete as possible by clearly describing how the proposed  
drawing respects real-­ world constraints and scenarios. These people may  
rely on more detailed drawings and annotations to understand your big idea.  
FIGURE 9.12  
INVOKING EMOTION  
There will be times, perhaps in a stakeholder meeting, when you’re using  
drawings to sell your ideas. When doing this, it’s important to pull out all the  
stops and consider some ways in which your audience will subconsciously  
connect with your drawings. Let’s take a look at a few hacks that can  
accomplish this.  
First and foremost, I always try to invoke a feeling of positivity in my  
teammates. I’ve always had an appreciation for wristwatches. Have you ever  
noticed that on watch websites and advertisements, the watch always reads  
10\:10, as drawn in Figure 9.12?  
The visual shape of the hands projects a feeling of positivity. We can use  
similar tricks in our digital product drawings. If we look back at some of the  
elements in our visual language, we can draw them in a very specific way to  
do this. Let’s look at the charts in Figure 9.13. Notice how the bars and lines  
increase in height toward the right of the chart. Invoking Emotion 167  
FIGURE 9.13  
This can invoke a feeling of positivity through implicit forward progress  
and upward movement. We can apply these same techniques to texture  
and shading. For example, let’s look at the inbox drawing in Figure 9.14.  
Notice how the shading used in the circular profile avatar images moves in  
an upward direction from left to right? This tiny detail is easily overlooked  
but contributes to that positive vibe the viewer may experience when  
looking at it.  
FIGURE 9.14  
Finally, let’s look at the same inbox example, but this time, let’s focus on  
the elevated floating action button as highlighted by the arrow in Figure 9.15. 168 CHAPTER NINE Telling Engaging Stories  
FIGURE 9.15  
Notice the direction of the hatching lines I used to show elevation? They’re  
also moving an upward direction, again invoking that same positive feeling.  
Next, as humans, our need for balance is the most important  
psychological and psychical influence on us. In her book A Primer in Visual  
Literacy, Donis A. Dondis \(1973, 22\) describes the importance of balance in  
great detail. Equilibrium becomes our firmest and strongest visual reference,  
both our conscious and unconscious bias for making visual judgements.  
Items that appear to be unstable create visual stress. As humans, we  
subconsciously evaluate the stability of forms by imposing a vertical and  
horizontal axis on the forms we see, as depicted in Figure 9.16. The slightest  
angle of rotation will even throw off this sense of imposed balance, causing  
this stress. Notice how the drawing on the right, which isn’t level, gives off a  
more stressful vibe than the left image, which is level in nature?  
Unless implying animation, or drawing a very important screen element,  
it’s important to ensure that all items in our product drawings appear  
structurally sound, as depicted in Figure 9.17. In this scenario, the image on  
the left appears structurally sound. The circular profile images in the list view  
are aligned and stacked on top of each other. Compare that to the image  
on the right, which appears unstable. The lack of alignment in the circular  
profile images makes the list appear top heavy. This will also cause visual Invoking Emotion 169  
stress. Caring for alignments and small structural details like this will enable  
you to instill a sense of relaxation in your teammates when they’re looking at  
your drawing.  
FIGURE 9.16  
FIGURE 9.17  
All of these techniques are very subtle, yet they can play a powerful role  
in establishing a positive first impression in a viewer. First impressions are  
important. They are formed within milliseconds of first seeing a drawing.  
They can last for months \(Gunaydin, Selcuk, and Zayas 2017\) and affect  
personal judgments even in the presence of contradictory evidence about 170 CHAPTER NINE Telling Engaging Stories  
the individual \(Rydell and McConnell 2006\). This is why it’s important to  
consider these fine, seemingly trivial details when creating a digital product  
drawing to share with colleagues, especially influential stakeholders.  
ADAPTING THE VISUAL LANGUAGE  
Speaking of knowing your audience, there are some cases where you may  
have to adapt your visual language to something that’s familiar to them.  
Let’s go back to an exercise we reviewed in Chapter 2, “Reframing Our  
Thinking,” where we explored ways to represent the values of 7 and 14. In  
one of the examples, we represented the values of 7 and 14 using a clock  
display as depicted in Figure 9.18.  
FIGURE 9.18  
When you first saw the clock drawings, was it obvious that they  
represented the values of 7 and 14? It’s likely that this drawing won’t make  
sense for most people living in America that are not in the military or working  
in healthcare. This drawing will read as 2 instead of 14. There are better,  
more reliable ways to represent the values of 7 and 14 to these people, as  
depicted in Figure 9.19.  
FIGURE 9.19 Adapting the Visual Language 171  
Let’s review an actual example of a time when I had to adapt the visual  
language of my drawing. In 2012, I spent a lot of time working with a popular  
investment banking firm in New York City. As a result of the Dodd-­ Frank Act  
and the great recession of 2008, the US Securities Exchange Commission  
\(SEC\) mandated changes in how banks develop and launch new financial  
products. The current process was tedious, and bloated, and no one knew  
exactly how to complete it.  
This was an intense project to say the least. The stakeholder team spent  
several weeks trying to describe the problem to us. It was so complex,  
we kept getting hung up on various points in their process. The team was  
currently using traditional workflow diagrams to communicate the steps in  
their product review process. Figure 9.20 shows a very high-­ level example of  
a workflow diagram.  
FIGURE 9.20 172 CHAPTER NINE Telling Engaging Stories  
These diagrams were so complex, and no one in the stakeholder group  
understood the underlying visual language. Opportunities for collaboration  
and gathering feedback were missed simply because people couldn’t  
understand it.  
I quickly realized that we needed a new way to express the same idea.  
At one point, I started to think about how visual language might be applied  
in a way that can get everyone on the same page. After several design  
workshops, we mapped out a new, ideal process.  
FIGURE 9.21 Adapting the Visual Language 173  
To communicate the new workflow, I tried taking cues from the visual  
language of subway maps. After all, most of the stakeholders lived in  
London, New York, or Tokyo, all cities with prominent subway systems. By  
using this familiar visual metaphor, the team would better understand our  
proposal for the redesign of this complex process.  
By adopting a station stop and train line metaphor, we were able to  
illustrate how a new product approval process could be designed to adapt  
to each user. The resulting map depicts the data collected by a product  
proposer. Figure 9.21 depicts part of this subway map. The map represents  
possible tracks through a long proposal form. The map also highlights the  
most influential steps in the review process.  
We used the metaphor to highlight special requirements necessary for  
each step. Since we were building a giant submission form based on this  
process, we could also start to illustrate ways in which the data would  
be entered and captured in the product. We took cues from how subway  
diagrams highlight special features like elevators, transfer walkways, and  
pay phones \(back when that was a thing\). Express tracks and local routes  
with more stops \(Figure 9.22\) illustrated areas where additional information  
would need to be captured based on previous input.  
FIGURE 9.22  
We used colors and shading \(Figure 9.23\) to represent different train  
lines and transfer points so the team could follow the main possible routes  
through the process.  
Unlike with the traditional workflow diagram, using this familiar visual  
language to express both requirements and workflows meant diverse  
users could interpret our design even when we were not there to present it  
ourselves. Expressed in a familiar idiom that transcended text, it was much  
easier for our audience to offer feedback and ultimately buy in. Not only did 174 CHAPTER NINE Telling Engaging Stories  
this visual language augment the collaboration between research, design,  
content strategy, and development, it earned the appreciation of the client’s  
IT team. As a result, the map became the IT department’s requirements  
document of record.  
FIGURE 9.23  
This is just one example of how changing the symbols, icons, and visual  
language used in a diagram drastically changed my team’s perception of  
the same idea. There will be times when you’ll have to consider this. As you  
become more comfortable with drawing, and as you continue to develop  
your visual library, you’ll be able to come up with more ways to modify it  
based on your audience and their perspective.  
WAYFINDING AND LANDMARKS  
Since we’re using drawing to develop and share new ideas with our  
colleagues, it’s important to help them maintain a sense of orientation within  
the flow or storyboard. After all, this is the first time they’re seeing your  
new idea. Just as in a well-­ designed mobile app or visualization, it’s  
necessary to enable someone to understand where they came from, how  
they got here, and where they can go. In Chapter 8, “Using Flows to Tell  
Stories,” we covered techniques used to do this. Showing mini maps and  
numerical labels next to screen-­ based drawings will start to give your  
colleagues a sense of location within your drawings. This is a good start.  
Landmarks are another orientation mechanism, and they’re used in  
several modern-­ day experiences. Disney Imagineers placed a large castle Wayfinding and Landmarks 175  
landmark \(Figure 9.24\) at the central hub of their parks. It’s the tallest  
structure in the park, and visible from nearly everywhere.  
FIGURE 9.24  
Upon entering the park, guests experience a carefully engineered sight  
line to this castle, as depicted in Figure 9.25. From this perspective, the  
castle draws guests down the main corridor and into the other areas of the  
park. No matter where you are in the park, you can always enjoy a line of  
sight to the castle.  
Once guests find their way to the other sections of the park, behind this  
landmark, they always have a sight line back to it, thus having a way to get  
back to the entrance corridor. This sight line, or view of the castle, is a crucial  
mechanism for wayfinding throughout the park. It gives guests a sense of  
location and orientation. Because of this, Disney was able to minimize the use  
of signage in these parks.  
We can use these same wayfinding techniques in our digital product  
drawings. When creating drawings to share with your teammates, you  
should consider how you may use visual landmarks within your drawings to  
enable your colleagues to remain oriented within your ideas. This can reduce  
the need to add extraneous text to your drawings. Your result will have less  
clutter and make it easier to convey the essence of your idea. 176 CHAPTER NINE Telling Engaging Stories  
FIGURE 9.25  
Let’s look at the example coming up in Figure 9.26. This flow depicts a  
single screen with a rich set of features. Notice how at the bottom of each  
drawing, we can see navigation tabs. The selected tab always remains in the  
same position throughout the experience. We can consider these tabs as a  
key landmark. They’re going to remain stationary, and like the Disney castle,  
and no matter what screen drawing we’re focusing on, we will always be able  
to see them and know where we are.  
FIGURE 9.26 Wayfinding and Landmarks 177  
Once the tabs are established as a landmark, I’ll start removing some  
of the details within that landmark in later screens. This is because  
focus typically shifts from the global navigation to details and features  
of the specific screen we’re on. Doing this enables us to focus on the  
more important details of each specific screen drawing without adding  
unnecessary noise. In the example, you’ll notice that I included all of the  
labels for the tab navigation up front. In the following screens I remove the  
labels for unselected tabs but make sure the selected tab is always in the  
same location. This removes noise from the drawing and brings focus to the  
interaction at hand.  
Just as in Disney parks, as we move past the castle and deeper into the  
park, we start focusing on the details and attractions in our local area of the  
park. We don’t need to see all the details of the castle. We just know it’s there  
and that’s good enough.  
Another example of providing great wayfinding is to reuse key visual  
elements in our transition from one screen to another. Let’s go back to our  
inbox example, shown in Figure 9.27.  
FIGURE 9.27  
For this example, we’re going to focus on the first two screens. Let’s take  
a look at the objects highlighted by the arrows in Figure 9.27. Notice how  
the elements in the list item including the circular profile icon, list item title,  
and subtitle text on the left are reused in the image on the right. These same  
items appear in the same arrangement and form header on the message  
screen on the right. Notice how they’re drawn the same way across  
drawings. For instance, the same shading technique was used for the avatar  
image. The title and subtitle lines are similar in length relative to each other.  
Considering details like this will help someone better understand your idea. 178 CHAPTER NINE Telling Engaging Stories  
Now, taking a step back for a minute, let’s not forget that reusing screen  
elements isn’t only good for your drawing process, it has much greater  
benefits to the outcome we’re striving for. Reusing screen elements across  
an interaction like this will ultimately improve usability of the app you’re  
developing.  
FIGURE 9.28  
FIGURE 9.29  
CHOREOGRAPHY AND TIMING  
In some cases, the order in which elements of the drawing are introduced  
can help our teammates better understand the problem space, our ideas,  
and the ultimate solution. New items can be introduced as we turn pages  
in a printed presentation. They can be introduced over the course of several  
slides in a digital presentation deck, or they can be drawn in a specific order  
on a whiteboard in front of a crowd. Let’s go back to the anecdote shared  
by professor emeritus Dan Boyarski from Carnegie Mellon University. If you  
recall from Chapter 1, ”Why Draw?” we recounted a time when Professor  
Boyarski invited students to describe a problem using the whiteboard. One  
student explained how her group was trying to find an effective way for  
these people to talk to each other as they control barge traffic on the rivers,  
as illustrated by the drawing in Figure 9.28.  
Boyarski describes the drawing being a useful element in describing the  
problem. He also went on to explain that what was even more valuable was  
the way the story and drawing unfolded together. This really enabled the rest  
of the class to understand the problem.  
For example, the presenter started off by establishing that her group was  
evaluating barges traveling up and down the three rivers by drawing these  
elements first. This worked like an establishing shot in a movie or an orienter  
panel in a comic. It helped the class all agree on the setting and context. It  
helped the students gain a shared understanding of the problem space. They  
could see that they were discussing the efficiency of ship traffic on three  
intersecting rivers, as illustrated in Figure 9.29.  
The student gradually introduced additional constraints and complexities  
into the problem by drawing the locks. Representing the locks as lines  
barricading the boats from proceeding \(Figure 9.30\), while telling the  
class that only one boat can pass through at a time brought up a critical  
bottleneck in the flow of ships up and down the three rivers. Showing the  
barges and locks initiated the tension of the underlying narrative.  
FIGURE 9.30 Choreography and Timing 179  
Finally, adding the control stations and people brought a human element  
to the story, as drawn in Figure 9.31. It was also drawn when the presenter  
got to the climax, or peak, of the story.  
The final addition to the drawing outlined the opportunity that would solve  
the aforementioned pain point, which was enabling the people controlling  
the locks to better communicate and plan the flow of traffic, as depicted in  
Figure 9.32.  
If we were to see the full drawing up front, we would’ve missed some of  
these key details that set up the story and clearly defined the opportunity to  
improve communication.  
The sequence of elements added to the drawing can follow the arc of  
the underlying story you’re telling through drawing. In his book The Visual  
Language of Comics, Dr. Cohn lays out several types of images that support  
this arc. In this sequence, the first elements of the drawing were our orienter  
\(Figure 9.29\). Next, we saw the barges locks drawn, which established the  
tension in our story \(Figure 9.30\). The peak, or climax, of the story occurred  
when people were added to the drawing \(Figure 9.31\) and we realized they  
cannot communicate with each other. Finally, when the final elements  
were added to the drawing, we see the story’s release \(Figure 9.32\). In this  
final state, we see the aftermath of the story, or the opportunity to improve  
communications between the river traffic controllers, which was represented  
by the arrows.  
When you’re using drawings to tell a story about your product or service,  
think about how the elements of your drawing should be unveiled to support  
the different phases of the story arc. What should be used to establish  
context? What elements can be used to build tension in your story? What  
elements support the aftermath of the story? Thinking about this will enable  
you to unfold an image along with a proper narrative that will resonate with  
your teammates.  
Because of the approach we take in this book, we can actually think about  
the timing and order in which we introduce elements into our drawing at  
the whiteboard. With some practice, you will no longer have to think about  
how to draw all the elements in your visual library. Instead, you’ll be thinking  
more about how to compose them into a meaningful drawing. You’ll even be  
able to draw them while talking to your colleagues at the same time. When  
you get to this level of comfort, you can begin to think about the overarching  
story and which items you want to introduce, just as the students did with  
the ship traffic scenario.  
FIGURE 9.31  
FIGURE 9.32 180 CHAPTER NINE Telling Engaging Stories  
If the situation permits, and you want to share your great idea at the  
whiteboard, do a practice drawing on a notepad or sketchbook as your team  
is discussing possible solutions. That way, you can sort out which elements  
you want to draw and their importance and order to tell the best possible  
story. Once you take the whiteboard marker, you hold nearly all of the power  
in the meeting, so you’ll want to make the best use of it.  
PACKAGING YOUR DRAWINGS  
My wife always says that it’s all in the packaging. That’s true for sketches,  
and considering where and how they live plays a major role in how people  
engage with them. I try to hang up my drawings, especially early ones, in my  
work space. That way I have a chance to live with them and subconsciously  
reflect on their content. As time passes and you become familiar with the  
work, you’ll either gain additional insight into your ideas, or maybe contempt.  
Posting other material may aid the discovery of new explorations to consider  
\(Buxton 2007, 154\). This helps me develop better, more thoughtful ideas  
early on. If you have a dedicated UX space in your home or office, I’d suggest  
doing the same. If you hang your drawings in a public area, oftentimes  
you’ll notice your colleagues coming by and looking at them, which usually  
leads to some fun impromptu conversations about the work. These casual  
interactions can lead to a great idea, and they can also help you become  
used to discussing your work in a casual setting. This can especially become  
useful when it’s time to present your work to stakeholders in a more formal  
setting. I usually add sticky notes next to each drawing or group of drawings  
for displaying additional notes.  
There are many ways to present your drawings. In some cases, the  
drawings can be dropped into a digital slide deck or multipage PDF. You can  
add additional notes in the actual slide, which can be nice if your handwriting  
isn’t the prettiest. You can use some of the techniques mentioned in  
Chapter 8 for combining mini maps, process diagrams, and screens to tell  
the story of your idea.  
If you’re working on a formal design presentation, and you have access to  
a scanner, it’s a good idea to use scanned drawings rather than photos taken  
with a phone camera. This will give your drawings a sense of visual polish  
and refinement. Doing this also ensures that there aren’t any focus issues  
with your drawing and that all the proper details are clearly presented.  
Just as we discussed in the previous section on timing and choreography,  
you can also introduce new elements on each slide to help people better  
understand the problem space and your solutions. You may consider  
recording your presentation in your favorite virtual meetings app so that you  
can provide a voice-­ over narration and change the slides accordingly. This Packaging Your Drawings 181  
works especially well if you’re an effective public speaker and storyteller. It’s  
especially valuable in those situations where you cannot be present to share  
your own work.  
These are just some of the things you may consider when creating a UX  
drawing. This chapter focused on techniques that will enable you to create  
more engaging presentations that elicit the best possible feedback from your  
colleagues. Showing consideration for real-­ world scenarios and constraints  
within the drawings will help you build credibility among your colleagues,  
especially the engineers who will be building out the idea. Modifying your  
drawing’s visual language and providing proper landmarks within each  
drawing will help your team better comprehend your idea. If you’re selling  
an idea, think about how to subtly invoke a certain emotion from your  
teammates. Finally, modifying the visual language and considering the  
use of key landmarks and the timing in which you reveal elements in the  
drawing can help your colleagues better understand and even engage with  
your ideas. C H A P T E R T E N  
# MOVING  
# FORWARD  
While the technology, platforms, and services we create will change in  
the coming years, drawing will always play a role in developing new  
ideas. The systematic approach covered in this book will give you everything  
you need to continue drawing, sharing, and evolving your great ideas.  
Throughout the course of time, you will have to make frequent updates to  
your visual library as people, processes, and technology continue to evolve  
and mature. Mostly any form or element you’ll draw can be broken down into  
a few basic shapes. Think about which marks you can make on the paper  
to best represent these shapes. You can add techniques like shading to  
represent concepts like light, elevation, and texture to further describe these  
new elements in your visual library.  
The underlying process will always be the same. From there, you can  
think about how to compose a story around your drawing and how to unveil  
it to your teammates. We covered several ways to create engaging stories  
through drawing.  
The systematic approach to drawing can be applied to other areas  
and larger challenges beyond product design. Drawing can be used to  
help a patient understand an experimental cancer treatment. Teachers  
can use these techniques to help students better understand how major  
historical events unfolded. They can use it to help students comprehend  
difficult abstract problems presented in advanced mathematics and  
science courses.  
Drawing can be used in the process of solving large-­ scale, complex  
problems like removing trash from the oceans, fighting climate change,  
and combating social inequality. While this might sound lofty, the  
possibilities really are endless here.  
183 184 CHAPTER TEN Moving Forward  
Reflecting on writing this book, I used over 500 sheets of paper and  
created over 300 drawings. Some of these drawings were practice drawings,  
and others were just bad ideas. If you’re an environmentally conscious  
person, you may feel this is wasteful. With that in mind, let’s not forget  
to recycle. If you have a yard, consider planting a tree. I did just that after  
writing this book, as depicted in Figure 10.1. I’d encourage you to do the  
same as you start creating more drawings.  
FIGURE 10.1  
There’s something magical about a drawing. Sometimes drawings are the  
first time we’re seeing form applied to a nascent idea. They can bring people  
together and start a meaningful conversation. They can inspire bigger ideas  
in a low-­ risk setting.  
Now that I’ve hopefully made drawing more approachable for you, I  
hope you’ll consider making it a lasting part of your process, and always  
remember that the drawing itself isn’t what matters in the end; it’s the  
outcome it leads to. WORKS CITED
