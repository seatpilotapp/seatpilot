recommended\)  
# Chapters and Key Points\:  
# 1\. Health and Safety legislation  
• Health and safety law places duties on businesses involved in events to  
ensure the health and safety of their employees and the public  
• Further legislation relating to entertainment licensing, fire safety and safety  
at sports grounds applies to events and is signposted in The Purple Guide  
• Events run by volunteers \(where no one is employed\) are generally not  
covered by health and safety law, unless someone is in control of  
premises see www.gov.uk/government/news/can-do-guidance-will-make-  
organising-volunteer-events-simpler  
• Enforcement of health and safety law at events is shared between the  
Health and Safety Executive \(HSE\) and local authorities.  
• The maximum penalty for breach of Health and Safety Legislation is up to  
2 years in prison and an unlimited fine.  
• Enforcement of fire safety legislation generally rests with individual fire and  
rescue authorities. There are exceptions such as Sports Grounds, please  
ensure you liaise with your Fire Service who will be able identify this for  
you.  
# 2\. Planning, management and risk assessments  
• Effective planning is central to putting on a safe event  
• Prepare an event safety plan  
• Have appropriate management arrangements in place to ensure the health  
and safety of employees and others, including volunteers and the public,  
during all stages of the event  
• Carry out a systematic assessment of the risks to employees, volunteers  
and the public  
• Implement risk control measures identified by the risk assessment • Put appropriate arrangements in place to monitor health and safety  
compliance  
• Provide competent health and safety advice  
• Liaise with other interested parties, including local authorities, stadium  
management, arena operators, safety advisory groups and the emergency  
services, early in the planning process  
• Thorough investigation of the site to be used  
# 3\. Venue and site design  
• Carry out a site-suitability assessment early in the planning process  
• In that assessment, include the nature of the event, audience numbers  
and the infrastructure required  
• Design the site layout to minimise risk, for example to segregate  
pedestrians and vehicles  
• Prepare a site and area location plan  
• Establish emergency routes  
• Liaise with key stakeholders, such as landowners, the local authority, local  
emergency services, neighbouring businesses and local residents  
# 4\. Contingency and emergency planning  
• To emphasize the importance of having plans in place to effectively  
respond to disruptive influences, health and safety incidents and  
emergencies which might occur at, or impact upon an event  
• To recognize that with all but the smallest, low risk, events organisers will  
need to liaise with the emergency services, and other relevant agencies, to  
prepare appropriate emergency plans  
• To ensure that robust management arrangements are in place to  
implement these plans  
• To recognize that all involved with the management of events \(including  
employees and volunteers\) need to be trained in emergency procedures,  
be assigned to, and understand, their specific roles, should an incident or  
emergency occur • To be aware that the initial response to an emergency may be the  
responsibility of the event safety management  
• To recognize the importance of testing these plans in the most practicable  
way  
# 5\. Medical  
• Ensuring that there is an appropriate level of medical, first aid and  
ambulance provision at an event that will minimise the impact on local  
NHS services  
• Undertake a medical, ambulance and first-aid resource assessment  
• A medical staffing plan should be made prior to the event to ensure that  
staff are deployed appropriately  
• Medical provision should be provided for the full duration of the event,  
including build up and break down  
# 6\. Communication  
• Supply employees and others who might be affected by work activities  
with information on the risks to their health and safety  
• Provide staff and visitors information about what to do in an emergency  
• Ensure proper co-operation and co-ordination of all those working onsite.  
Effective communication will help achieve these goals  
• Assess the communication requirements of all the organisations involved  
in the event, including handling routine health, safety and welfare  
information and communicating effectively in the event of an emergency  
# 7\. Transport  
• Site vehicles and traffic are a major cause of serious and fatal accidents  
• Assess the risks from vehicle movement onsite at the planning stage of  
the event and identify what measures are needed to control these risks  
• Prepare a traffic management plan for internal and, where necessary,  
external traffic control • Where reasonably practicable, segregate pedestrians and vehicles during  
all phases of the event  
• Have a traffic management system in place, incorporating one-way  
systems where possible  
• Ensure all drivers are authorised and trained to use relevant vehicles  
• Ensure all drivers are inducted to site-driving protocols  
• Minimise the need for reversing  
• Ensure drivers of work vehicles, banksmen/signallers and traffic marshals  
are trained and competent  
# 8\. Working at height  
• Falls from height are one of the main causes of workplace death and injury  
• Working at height means an work in any place where if there were no  
precautions in place, a person could fall a distance liable to cause  
personal injury  
• Employers should ensure all work at height that they control is properly  
planned and organised  
• Work at height should take into account weather conditions that could  
endanger health and safety  
• Risk-assess work at height and take steps to avoid, prevent or reduce  
risks of falls, liable to cause personal injury  
• Select the right access equipment for the job  
• Workers should be competent in the work to be done and in the use of the  
equipment provided  
• Ensure risks from fragile surfaces and falling objects are controlled  
• Have an emergency rescue procedure in place to recover anyone who  
may have fallen and is suspended, e.g. from a lanyard and harness  
system  
# 9\. Temporary demountable structures  
• The failure of any temporary demountable structure \(TDS\), no matter how  
small, could have devastating effects. The design, safe erection, use and  
deconstruction are important parts of event planning • Ensure the design meets the requirements of the structural concept, and  
the location onsite is appropriate, with a plan of how it will be built \(and  
dismantled\) safely  
• Seek guidance from people who are competent in these structures at an  
early stage in the planning process  
• Ensure the structure is built to the agreed design  
• Safety-critical checkpoints should be identified in the build, and ensure  
checks are made by a competent person before work progresses to the  
next checkpoint  
• Undertake the work safely by having competent staff and a suitable onsite  
operational management system in place  
• Make sure there is an independent design check and management system  
for the control of changes to a TDS, e.g. clients attaching advertising  
material that affects wind loadings  
• Ensure there is a suitable maintenance and inspection regime for the  
completed structure, which will also require monitoring for the effects of  
wind and weather  
• Allocate adequate time and resources for each of the above stages  
# 10\. Fire Safety  
• Fire legislation requires a risk-management process that focuses on  
places and buildings  
• Carry out a fire-safety risk assessment, or engage the services of a  
competent person to do so  
• Consult and liaise with the local fire and rescue authority at the planning  
stage, and thereafter as required  
• Draw up a fire-management plan  
• Identify potential ignition and fuel sources  
• Establish the control measures  
• Have an evacuation plan in place  
• Implement and enforce appropriate process and general fire precautions  
at all stages of the event • Provide adequate means for raising the alarm, and suitable and sufficient  
escape routes  
• Provide suitable and sufficient fire-fighting equipment  
# 11\. Electrical and wiring  
• The advice given in this chapter is intended as an overview. Electrical  
contractors must consult the documents listed for specific guidance  
• The event risk assessment and the major incident plans should cover all  
possible hazards associated with the electrical and lighting installations  
• Equipment should be weatherproofed and isolated from the public  
• Cabling must be routed in a manner that will minimise tripping hazards and  
mechanical damage throughout the site  
• Consider the location of generators to enable refuelling and prevent  
excessive noise nuisance  
# 12\. Barriers and fencing  
• Choosing the correct barrier system or fencing is vital to ensure crowd  
safety. Understand the different types, their strengths and appropriate  
uses  
• Select a suitable supplier, who will be able to provide all the necessary  
drawings, plans and risk assessment  
• A barrier system must be built in the correct way to ensure it does not  
pose any risks to the general public  
# 13\. Crowd management  
• Choosing the correct barrier system or fencing is vital to ensure crowd  
safety. Understand the different types, their strengths and appropriate  
uses  
• Select a suitable supplier, who will be able to provide all the necessary  
drawings, plans and risk assessment  
• A barrier system must be built in the correct way to ensure it does not  
pose any risks to the general public **14\. Special effects**  
• The use of special and visual effects at an event must be properly  
planned.  
• Risks associated with special effects should be assessed by a competent  
person and effective risk control measure implemented.  
• Those involved in the planning, assembly and execution of special effects  
must be suitably trained and competent.  
• Adequate time and resources must be provided to prepare and rehearse.  
• Secure facilities must be made available for the assembly, fusing etc. of  
explosive effects before their use.  
• Arrangements must be made in case of an emergency.  
# 15\. Amusements  
• During the planning stage, consider the type of amusements and  
attractions that will be present at the event  
• Amusements and attractions may include fairgrounds, individual fairground  
rides, inflatable devices \(e.g. bouncy castles\), bungee jumping, fire-eaters,  
etc.  
• Carefully choose the location of attractions to ensure the ground is suitable  
\(probably best left to the controller/lessee, along with the layout plan, if  
there are multiple devices\) but communication between the two parties  
would be advised.  
• Check there is proper access for emergency vehicles  
• Ensure the layout of attractions allows safe circulation of crowds  
• Clearly define responsibilities for managing health and safety  
• Event organisers should ensure that ride controllers inspect and maintain  
their equipment and comply with their duties as operators so that their  
rides can be run safely  
# 16\. Waste management  
• Failure to effectively manage waste at events presents direct and indirect  
risks to the health and safety of employees and those attending • Event organisers should continuously monitor the build-up of any waste  
\(especially combustible materials\) during the event and take necessary  
measures to remove it  
• Plan for the storage, handling and transport of general waste and sewage  
• Event organisers should assess the risks associated with generation,  
storage, handling and transport of waste, and take appropriate precautions  
• Ensure that contractors appointed to handle, remove and dispose of waste  
are competent  
• Contractors should assess and manage the risks associated with their  
activities  
• Event organisers and contractors may have duties under environmental  
protection legislation enforced by the Environment Agency and Scottish  
Environment Protection Agency  
# 17\. Noise  
• The Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005 apply to exposure of all  
employees and contractors to loud music at events.  
• Although volunteers are not covered by the Noise at Work Regulations, s3  
Health & Safety at Work Act does apply to them.  
• The Health & Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 also applies to the exposure of  
the audience to loud music.  
• The risks to employees and others at work from exposure to noise should  
be assessed.  
• Exposure of employees and others to harmful noise levels should be  
reduced so far as is reasonably practical.  
• All those with duties to control exposure to noise should communicate and  
co-operate with each other to manage the risk. Everyone working at  
events needs to take personal responsibility for their own noise exposure  
and to take reasonable care not to damage their own hearing or that of  
other people.  
• There is a legal responsibility for personal hearing protection to be used in  
some areas if noise levels cannot be controlled at a safe level. • Many noise control measures are simple and cost-effective.  
• The audience can still enjoy the performance with these controls in place.  
# 18\. Sanitation  
• Event organisers must provide suitable and sufficient sanitary and welfare  
facilities for workers at an event  
• Responsible organisers will provide appropriate sanitary and welfare  
facilities for the audience  
• Provision of welfare facilities for the audience has positive benefits in  
controlling health risks and contributing to audience wellbeing and  
behaviour  
• Licensing legislation enforced by Local Authorities may require provision of  
sanitary and welfare facilities for those attending  
# 19\. Campsites  
• Ensure an adequate provision of services for the entire duration of the  
camping event  
• Separation of the site into smaller areas will make it more manageable  
• Audience profile will help determine site density  
• Contingency plans should include providing shelter for campers whose  
tents are unusable due to adverse conditions or events  
• All aspects of fire safety and public health issues, as identified by the risk  
assessment, should be carefully considered  
# 20\. Information and welfare  
• Offering welfare services will help the event to run smoothly  
• Ensuring the audience is well informed will aid crowd management  
• Information can be provided via the event website, social media, leaflets,  
event ticket, a telephone hotline, information points, informed stewards,  
site maps, event programme, etc **21\. Food, drink and water provision**  
• Check local food and drink legislation, as there may be regional variations  
• Ensure provision of a wholesome water supply in sufficient quantities.  
Failure to do so may have significant consequences  
• Levels of hygiene and cleanliness should conform to guidelines and  
current legislation  
• Consider Public Liability and Product Liability Insurance in addition to  
Employers Liability Compulsory Insurance  
# 22\. Safeguarding children and young people  
• The key aim is to ensure that children attending an event are kept safe  
and free from harm  
• Event organisers should ensure they are familiar with local and national  
legislation and requirements  
• Prepare a missing and found child policy, arrange lost and found children's  
points, and consider providing a meeting point where teens can be  
collected by parents at the end of the event  
# 23\. Animal Welfare  
• Ensure best welfare practices are observed by considering the attendance  
of a veterinary surgeon at an agricultural show. The vets role would be to  
focus on the prevention of infections diseases, and to provide treatment in  
the event of accidents  
• A welfare plan should be drawn up to cover perceived risks that could  
occur  
• Include a map of the show site to aid staff, the vet, competitors, trade  
exhibitors and members of the public
