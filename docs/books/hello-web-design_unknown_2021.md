This book has been a few years in the making. Thank you to  
everyone who has listened to my presentations, given me  
feedback, supported my ideas, and helped me make this book  
a reality.  
In particular, thank you to everyone who took a monetary risk  
with me and backed the Hello Web Design Kickstarter cam-  
paign. With over 700 backers, this was my biggest campaign  
yet, and it means so much to me that folks are willing to  
support me with their dollars and cheer me on throughout  
the whole book production process.  
Thank you as well to No Starch Press for taking a risk on me  
and adding this book to their collection. Hello Web Design  
will have more reach than I originally ever thought possible  
through their support, not to mention the countless hours  
they worked with me to improve the book and its content.  
I’m truly grateful for their partnership.F O R E W O R D  
Whenever I dipped my toe in the waters of the semantic web,  
I noticed there were two fundamentally different approaches.  
One approach was driven by the philosophy that absolutely  
everything in the universe should be theoretically describable.  
The other approach was far more lax, concentrating only on  
the popular use cases —people, places, events—and that was  
pretty much it. These few common items, so the theory went,  
accounted for about 80 percent of actual usage in the real  
world. Trying to codify the remaining 20 percent would result  
in a disproportionate amount of effort.  
I always liked that approach. I think it applies to a lot of en-  
deavours. Coding, sketching, cooking—you can get up to speed  
on the bare essentials pretty quickly and then spend a lifetime  
attaining mastery. But we don’t need to achieve mastery at ev-  
ery single thing we do. I’m quite happy to be just good enough  
at plenty of skills so that I can prioritize the things I really  
want to spend my time doing.  
Perhaps web design isn’t a priority for you. Perhaps you’ve  
decided to double-down on programming. That doesn’t mean  
forgoing design completely. You can still design something  
pretty good . . . thanks to this book.  
Tracy understands the fundamentals of web design so you  
don’t have to. She spent years learning, absorbing, and design-  
ing, and now she has very kindly distilled down the 80 percent  
of that knowledge that’s going to be the most useful to you.  
Think of Hello Web Design as a book of cheat codes. It’s short,  
to the point, and tells you everything you need to know to be a  
perfectly competent web designer.  
Say hello to your little friend.

This is not your typical beginner design book.  
Beginner books tend to assume you eventually want to become  
an expert. Programming books assume you want to get a job in  
programming or computer engineering; design books assume  
you want to become a full-fledged designer.  
But what if you wanted to learn just enough design to enhance  
your existing career?  
I believe in the power of improving your skill set beyond your  
current focus. My personal experiences don’t fit into any  
single category  
—  
I have a degree in Art & Design, I develop  
websites and apps using Python, and I have founded and man-  
aged a start-up. Knowing just enough in many areas has been  
crucial for my career.  
Just as designers benefit from learning a little bit about  
programming, programmers \(and marketers, and product  
managers, salesfolk, and so on\) can benefit from learning a  
little bit about design. Even if you don’t specialize in design,  
you will need to design at some point  
—  
whether it’s working  
on slide decks, creating interfaces for programs and projects,  
or building a personal website. If you work with designers, a  
bit of design experience will give you a better foundation for  
communicating with them and understanding their work.  
The purpose of Hello Web Design isn’t to make you a  
designer  
—  
it’s here to make you feel more comfortable  
doing design.  
This book focuses solely on the visual stuff\: you’ll find no  
HTML, CSS, or frontend development and code within. We’re going to work on making your designs feel more beautiful and,  
almost more important, how to make them work better.  
Design is about problem solving. Even in places where you  
feel like you’re just making things “prettier” \(like working on  
a slide deck\), you’re really working to make the information in  
your slide deck easier and more pleasurable to read and com-  
prehend. In our web interfaces, we really want to make things  
feel more natural and easier to use  
—  
good design is crucial to  
capturing and keeping new users and improving how success-  
ful our designs are.  
Throughout this book, we’ll explore not only theory \(and the  
reasons behind some of those principles\) but also shortcuts  
and quick solutions to some common design problems. For  
example, I’ll share a bit about color theory but also some  
resources that will help you choose great-looking color pal-  
ettes without starting from scratch. That pattern will repeat  
throughout the book  
—  
lots of shortcuts and some insight into  
why the shortcuts work.  
My hope is that you’ll feel more confident in doing design  
by the end of the book and then jump into more traditional  
beginner books covering design theory and practices more  
thoroughly if you want to become a traditional designer. Or,  
you can just use this book to benefit your current career. In  
either case, you’ll be a much stronger designer by the end of  
this little book.  
Let’s get started!  
—Tracy  
xviii I N T R O D U C T I O N 1  
C H A P T E R 1  
# IF YOU READ ONLY ONE CHAPTER,  
# MAKE IT THIS ONE  
I F YOU C A M E AC R O S S T H I S B O O K and had time to read only one  
chapter, this would be the one for you. Why? Because it shows  
you the fastest way for you to improve your designs.  
# How it works is more important than how it looks  
I know you probably came to this book looking for help with  
how to improve the look of your designs, but stick with me for  
a moment\: the way your design works is more important than  
how it looks.  
Take Craigslist, for example. The website largely hasn’t  
changed over the years, and the design appears very dated  
\(Figure 1-1\).  
If how it looked were most important, Craigslist would have  
lost out years ago to any of the other shiny new classified ad  
websites that have popped up.  
Craigslist has continued to be the top destination for classified  
ads simply because it’s so simple and straightforward to use.  
1 Figure 1-1\: Craigslist is still the top of its class without a modern-looking  
website design.  
With no flashy effects or distracting banners, Craigslist makes  
it super simple to post ads and search existing ads.  
If you’re fretting that your website is too simple and doesn’t look  
“modern”  
—  
that is, doesn’t adhere to all the latest trends, which  
don’t necessarily dictate “good” website design  
—  
I’m here to  
reassure you that looks matter far less than whether your design  
succeeds in what you and your users want it to achieve.  
There are two important steps for ensuring that your design  
results in a good user experience\: knowing what you want  
your design to accomplish and getting feedback from others.  
# Determine what success looks like  
You can’t track how well your design is doing its job until you  
know your design’s goal. Different kinds of designs have differ-  
ent goals. For example, you might want visitors to\:  
•  
Fill out a form.  
•  
Spend an average of at least 30 seconds viewing a page.  
2  
c ha p T E R 1 •  
Subscribe to a newsletter.  
•  
Leave a comment.  
You might have heard the term conversion rates in user experi-  
ence books, which is a fancy way of asking, “What percentage  
of people are doing what I want them to do?” Once you’ve de-  
fined what “success” looks like for your website, you can make  
better decisions about your design, measure how well your  
current design works, and improve your conversion rate.  
# Ask other people to view and review your designs  
If you’re feeling bashful about your newfound design skills,  
you might not want to show your designs to anyone else. What  
if they don’t like them? What if they say something negative?  
Getting over these feelings of insecurity and getting your de-  
signs in front of people who aren’t you will lead to the biggest  
improvements in your designs. As a designer, you cannot  
objectively evaluate how well your designs work. You become  
blind to potential problems.  
By showing your designs to others, you’ll be able to see whether  
people successfully achieve what you want them to, and whether  
anything about the site is confusing. And you may get some high  
fives as well.  
Feedback is useful, but don’t feel you need to follow every sug-  
gestion or address every comment you receive. File them away  
in your mind, or keep a list, and then take care of all of those  
changes once you’ve heard from several people. Sometimes  
you’ll get contradictory feedback from two different people, and  
that’s fine \(if one of them more closely fits the profile of your  
target user, that person’s feedback is more important!\). Maybe  
there’s a third approach that could make everyone happy, or  
maybe it’s not worth worrying about that piece yet.

“But Tracy,” you might be saying, “I really want to make my  
design look better too, not just work better.”  
I hear you! The way your design looks also affects user experi-  
ence, and you can improve your design by keeping one key con-  
cept \(which applies to many things\) in mind\: cut down on clutter.  
# Cut down on clutter for better looking designs  
Clutter  
—  
such as you see in busy, disorganized, and chaotic  
designs  
—  
is the bane of good user experience, and cleaning  
up your clutter creates websites that both look better and  
work better.  
Expanding on this concept, here are some short, easy-to-  
understand principles that we’ll cover in more depth later\:  
U S E A G R I D  
Most designs cut down on clutter by using a grid, which cre-  
ates a skeleton for your design to anchor objects and create an  
unconscious feeling of order. Small pixel differences can make  
a design feel sloppy and unprofessional.  
We’ll cover this topic in more depth in Chapter 2, Section 2.1.  
C H O OS E J U ST A F E W CO LO R S  
Designs that are chock-full of different colors \(24 shades of  
blue, 5 shades of red, and so on\) look busy. Set a specific color  
palette and use only those colors in your design to create a  
much more cohesive look.  
We’ll cover this topic in more depth in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.  
4  
c ha p T E R 1 L I M I T YO U R S E L F TO T WO D I F F E R E N T T Y P E FAC E S  
While you can use one typeface for your navigation, another  
for your text, another for your buttons, and another for your  
headlines  
—  
this will make your designs feel chaotic. Restrict  
the number of typefaces you use, and use bolding, italics,  
all caps, and other transforms to create variety and indicate  
emphasis.  
We’ll cover this topic in more depth in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.  
S I M P L I F Y YO U R T E X T  
Large blocks of text come across as clutter. Simplify your sen-  
tences and limit paragraphs to two to three sentences. You can  
also break text up by adding bullets and headlines. Readers on  
the web tend to skim text, and shorter paragraphs keep more  
readers reading.  
We’ll cover this topic in more depth in Chapter 2, Section 2.6.  
A D D W H I T E S PAC E  
White space is the ultimate clutter reducer. One of the biggest  
mistakes new designers make is pushing items much too close  
to each other. Adding space between elements \(content, wid-  
gets, forms, buttons, images, text, and so on\) makes designs  
easier to read and more modern, airy, and inviting.  
We’ll cover this topic in more depth in Chapter 2, Section 2.4.  
All of the above can be distilled into one sentence\:  
Make sure your design works well,  
and reduce as much clutter as possible.  
This advice puts you on the right path to creating better  
designs, and the upcoming chapters explore all of these guide-  
lines in more detail.

# THEORY AND DESIGN PRINCIPLES  
L E T ’ S D I V E I N TO T H I S I N F O R M AT I O N I N M O R E D E P T H , shall we?  
Each section in this chapter is going to balance theory \(so you  
understand the background and the why of things\), real-life  
examples \(so you can see these principles being applied\), and  
shortcuts \(so you can apply some of these principles quickly  
without starting from scratch\).  
I’ll give you a few rules and suggestions to remember. Of  
course, there are exceptions to every rule, and every rule can  
be broken. Because these sections are aimed at beginners,  
we’ll be sticking to these principles, but as you grow as a de-  
signer you’ll learn when you can break some of the rules.  
As we go through each section in depth, we’ll apply these prin-  
ciples to the little widget \(shown in Figure 2-1\).  
7 Figure 2-1\: A \(rather ugly\) widget. Let’s improve how it looks, shall we?  
It’s not much to look at right now, but it will gradually look  
better as we apply what we learn.

# GRID  
OU R F I R S T P R I N C I P L E I S A N E A SY O N E \: line things up!  
You may have heard this common designer complaint\:  
A designer builds a pixel-perfect mock-up and passes it along  
to the developer to build. The developer builds the design,  
but the built design differs from the mock-up by something  
arbitrary like two pixels!  
“Silly designer,” says the developer. “Why does something so  
small matter? It’s basically the same.”  
Here’s the thing  
—  
small pixel differences really do matter,  
especially when it comes to elements on a page. If one element  
is close to but not completely lined up with another element, it  
can create a tiny bit of unevenness, and that little bit of chaos  
leads to a feeling of unease and clutter \(Figure 2-2\).  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 9 Figure 2-2\: The two screenshots are basically the same, but the one on the left, where  
everything is slightly out of line, looks less cohesive and professional.  
The easiest way to make sure that elements line up with one  
another is to add a grid to our design. A grid adds an invisible  
skeleton to our app, a scaffolding that we can use to set up  
and arrange our elements so the overall layout looks tidy and  
ordered. Aligning elements to an underlying grid will help you  
achieve alignment and consistency throughout your design.  
The New York Times website \(figure 2-3\) uses five main col-  
umns to organize a large amount of information. The spaces  
between the columns highlighted in red are gutters. Objects in  
your grid can span multiple columns, and some objects might  
break out of the grid, but everything more or less adheres to  
the grid.  
You can use any number of columns in your design \(figure 2-4\),  
but a 12-column grid \(figure 2-5\) is the most often used for  
versatility.  
A grid also helps you create a plan for your website’s layout  
because it constrains you to place elements within certain  
areas rather than having the entire page to choose from. Win  
win win.  
In essence\: Got a bunch of elements? Line them up \(horizon-  
tally, vertically, or both\) to create a feeling of cohesiveness.  
10  
c ha p T E R 2 Figure 2-3\: The New York Times website uses a grid to effectively organize a large number  
of elements and showcase items on its home page.  
Figure 2-4\: The Gridset website demos a compound 4+6 grid with and without  
guidelines.

T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 11Shortcuts  
The theory here is simple  
—  
just line things up  
—  
but there are  
many tools that make it easy to ensure we’re using the grid.  
# Grids in mock-up programs  
If you’re working on something that you won’t be building in  
CSS, you’ll need to add guides to your design.  
All mock-up programs  
—  
Photoshop, Sketch, or GIMP  
—  
allow you to set guides to float over your design, which makes  
it easy to align elements to the guide.  
If you’re working on a website mock-up in something like  
Photoshop, you can use grid templates to lay out your website  
using the same columns you’d use in your website framework  
system \(Figure 2-6\).  
Figure 2-6\: Guides can be set by dragging from the rulers at the left and top  
of the screen in Photoshop.  
12  
c ha p T E R 2 Guides are also accessible in most slide programs and other  
simple layouts, such as Keynote \(figure 2-7\).  
Figure 2-7\: Keynote also lets you pull out guides from the rulers on the screens.  
Many other programs have similar options.  
For slides, you don’t need to add a whole 12-column grid to  
your system  
—  
the slides in figure 2-7 have only a few guides,  
just enough to keep elements on separate pages along the  
same lines.  
However, if you’re designing something a bit more complex,  
you can download quite a few templates with multiple columns  
already set up, such as the 960.gs \(*hellobks.com/hwd/4*\) system.  
# Grids for web design  
I highly recommend using a CSS framework with a grid  
included, such as Bootstrap \(*hellobks.com/hwd/5*\), Foundation  
\(*hellobks.com/hwd/6*\), Skeleton \(*hellobks.com/hwd/7*\), mini.css  
\(*hellobks.com/hwd/8*\), or PureCSS \(*hellobks.com/hwd/9*\)  
\(figure 2-8\).  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 13 Figure 2-8\: The grid system included in the Bootstrap CSS framework.  
By using the HTML classes that constrain your design to the  
underlying CSS Grid, your elements will naturally align with  
other elements on the page \(figure 2-9\). Just keep in mind that  
additional margins or padding that might be added in CSS may  
bump elements out of alignment.  
Figure 2-9\: Some of the CSS classes included in Bootstrap to align and set your objects  
in the underlying grid.  
CSS is getting a new element called CSS Grid \(how convenient!\)  
that makes it super simple to align elements to a grid without  
using a CSS framework. At the time of this book’s writing, CSS  
Grid is on the verge of being released and covered by most  
browsers. While this book doesn’t cover CSS, using CSS Grid will  
make it easier to implement grid-based designs \(figure 2-10\).

# Real-life examples  
Remember the little widget we introduced at the beginning of  
this chapter? Let’s update the design by lining up the elements  
\(figure 2-11\).  
Figure 2-11\: On the left, the original widget. On the right, we’ve lined up the edges of the  
elements in the box, making it feel a bit cleaner and less chaotic.  
While the widget still has issues \(after all, we’re just getting  
started\), you can see that this little change has made a small  
but significant positive difference. All of the interior elements  
are now lined up\: headline, content, input, button. The input’s  
placeholder text is bumped out a bit because of the padding  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 15 in the form, but its containing element aligns to the grid. The  
overall feeling is just a bit more cohesive, a little less chaotic.  
Again, in a nutshell\: just line things up. Add guides to align  
your elements to an invisible grid, and pay attention to the  
little pixel differences and misalignments that can make a  
design feel more chaotic. Feel free to break the rules occasion-  
ally and go off the grid \(ha\), but using a grid for most of your  
elements will create a cleaner, more organized design.  
Next up, we’re going to talk color!

# COLOR  
CO LO R I S S O I M P O RTA N T TO D E S I G N , but it’s a topic that can  
be overwhelming. With all of the rainbow at our fingertips,  
how do we choose the right colors? There’s a reason why color  
theory is a semester-long course for design students.  
In my own color theory course, I had to create a perfect gradi-  
ent in 20 swatches from black to white in paint. The best way  
to accomplish that was to paint 200+ swatches\: taking black  
paint, add a drop of white, paint a swatch . . . add another drop  
of white paint, paint another swatch . . . and then narrow down  
those hundreds of swatches into 20 perfect, even steps from  
white to black.  
Don’t worry, I’m not going to put you through that. Look how  
much time and effort you’re saving by reading this book!  
Color theory courses cover a lot of terms that we’re going to  
skip here  
—  
CMYK vs. RGB colors, color harmony theory and  
color wheels, triadic and analogous colors  
—  
it can get really  
overwhelming really fast. I’m going to cover a very broad over-  
view of color theory aimed at getting you more comfortable as  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 17 Red\: aggressive, important, passionate  
Yellow\: friendly, happy, attentive  
Blue\: trustworthy, comforting, relaxed

Green\: growing, natural, successful

Brown\: stable, rustic, earthy Black\: powerful, sophisticated, edgy  
White\: virtuous, sterile, healthy  
Gray\: formal, neutral, professional  
Ivory\: quiet, calm, elegant  
fast as possible; at the end of the chapter I’ll give you resources  
that you can use to learn more about everything we cover.  
First up is color psychology, a color “hack” that you can use  
to invoke various feelings in your work. Color can affect how  
your design is felt and perceived. In a very general sense, these  
are the emotions evoked by certain colors\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Red\: aggression, importance, passion  
Orange\: energy, playfulness, affordability  
Yellow\: friendliness, happiness, attention  
Green\: growth, nature, success  
Blue\: trust, comfort, relaxation  
Purple\: luxury, romance, mystery  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 19 •  
Pink\: playfulness, innocence, youth  
•  
Brown\: stability, rusticity, earthiness  
•  
Black\: power, sophistication, edginess  
•  
White\: virtue, sterility, health  
•  
Gray\: formality, neutrality, professionalism  
•  
Ivory\: quiet, calm, elegance  
When you want your design to evoke a feeling of success and  
stability, green and blue are great colors to use. A website for  
a sleek modern hotel might use black and purple. In general,  
warmer colors \(reds, yellows\) are more energetic and exciting,  
whereas cooler colors \(blues, purples\) are more stable and  
calming.  
It’s worth noting that these are Western associations  
—  
if you’re  
designing for another culture, it would be worth researching  
any color connotations that specific culture may have. For ex-  
ample, white is a mourning color in China, compared to black  
in Western cultures.  
You can also play with vibrancy. Less vibrant hues, like those  
on the “Keep Portland Weird” page on the Keep Earthquakes  
Weird website by Oblio, are calmer and more subtle than  
bright and vibrant hues, like those used on the Citysets web-  
site. In color psychology, blues are relaxing, but the bright,  
eye-popping blue feels more energetic \(Figure 2-12\).  
These are not hard-and-fast rules. You can certainly create  
a calm and elegant website using red  
—  
however, these color  
psychology shortcuts give you a jumping off point so you’re  
not overwhelmed with color options at the start.

c ha p T E R 2 Figure 2-12\: Less vibrant hues are calmer and less energetic than bright,  
eye-popping versions.  
# Shortcuts  
Now that we know some fundamentals, let’s check out a few  
shortcuts we can use to save ourselves time.  
# Limit your color scheme  
Avoid picking colors at random for your design. Choosing two  
to four colors for your site and limiting all of your elements  
to the colors on your palette will help your site feel less busy  
\(Figure 2-13\).  
# Use color to make your design “pop”  
When building a color palette, avoid the temptation to go for  
all bright colors. Using mostly grayer or more neutral colors  
with one “pop” color makes it easier to highlight important  
elements without creating a chaotic design \(Figure 2-14\).  
# Pay attention to contrast  
Light gray text on a white background looks pretty but is a  
nightmare to read, especially for readers who may have a visual  
impairment \(Figure 2-15\). Colored text on a colored background  
can also get you in trouble if there isn’t enough contrast.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 21 Figure 2-13\: The Siminki website has a limited color scheme that helps it feel  
more unified.  
Figure 2-14\: The Habita website has a strong pop of color.  
22  
c ha p T E R 2 Figure 2-15\: Light gray text on a white background has low contrast and can be  
hard to read.  
When in doubt, use a color contrast checker such as WebAIM  
\(*hellobks.com/hwd/25*\) to make sure your text is readable.  
# Use a color palette website  
Building a color palette from scratch can take a long time and  
a lot of thought. Thankfully, a ton of websites are dedicated to  
helping you choose a color palette to use in your designs.  
Adobe Color CC \(*hellobks.com/hwd/28*\) builds a palette of  
colors around your choice of a base color and various color  
schemes  
—  
I recommend “complementary” \(Figure 2-16\).  
The Material Design Palette website \(*hellobks.com/hwd/29*\) au-  
tomatically displays colors in a sample design, which is super  
helpful when you’re struggling to visualize how two colors  
could work together \(Figure 2-17\).  
A new option is Colormind \(*hellobks.com/hwd/30*\), which uses  
deep learning to generate color palettes. You can loop through  
palettes as well as generate palettes after setting one or more  
specific colors \(Figure 2-18\).

Keep in mind that you can alter the colors in a preset palette  
slightly if you wish  
—  
they aren’t set in stone. I often find that  
I need to lighten or darken a shade in order to get good  
contrast in my design.  
# Real-life examples  
Don’t get too married to a particular color palette  
—  
once you  
implement the colors into your design, you might find that  
your original favorite doesn’t work as well as you had hoped.  
I usually go through at least a few palettes until I find one that  
feels best.  
Let’s run our little widget through some different color  
palette options \(Figure 2-19\).  
That last option gives our text good contrast, a nice color “pop”  
color for our button, and a soothing green background  
—  
look-  
ing pretty good, and certainly better than the original version  
with no color at all!

theory for web\: *hellobks.com/hwd/31.*  
With millions of colors, it can feel really hard to narrow your  
options down to a nice palette for your website. Make it easier  
for yourself by using a color palette generated by the options  
we mentioned, which will guarantee you a harmonious color  
palette to use in your designs.

typography and text!

# T YPOGRAPHY  
I F YOU R D E S I G N I N C LU D E S A N Y K I N D O F T E XT , you’re dealing  
with typography. According to Wikipedia, “Typography is the  
art and technique of arranging type to make written language  
legible, readable, and appealing when displayed.” Simply put,  
make your words easy and enjoyable to read.  
Type can be beautiful but hard to read \(websites with trendy  
thin, pale gray fonts\) but also easy to read and less pleasing to  
look at \(pretty much any website using default system fonts\).  
Succeeding in both areas can seem complicated, but there are  
a lot of great shortcuts that make it easier.  
We could spend another whole university semester covering  
typography theory in full, the history of typefaces, and more.  
Instead, I’m going to pack a lot of this information into one  
quick section.  
You might be wondering about the difference between a font  
and a typeface. To be completely correct, a typeface is a “family,”  
or collection of fonts. Arial is a typeface, and Arial Bold is a font.  
That said, the two terms are frequently used interchangeably  
\(unless you’re a typographer\), and we’ll be doing so here.  
28  
c ha p T E R 2Typography fundamentals  
Let’s start by covering some important terms and concepts  
about typography.  
# Typeface categories  
The main difference between fonts is whether or not they in-  
clude serifs, which are the little decorative bits at the end of let-  
ters. This book’s content text uses a serif font \(Tisa Pro\), while  
the headlines use a sans-serif font \(literally without serif  
—  
and  
Tisa Sans Pro is the headline font here\) \(Figure 2-20\).  
# Ab Ab  
serif  
Figure 2-20\: Sans-serif versus serif typefaces. Tisa Sans Pro on the left, Tisa Pro  
on the right.  
In general, serif fonts are easier to read in printed text, and  
sans-serif fonts are easier to read on a screen. The serifs in  
printed text help the eye quickly read the letters, whereas  
on screen it’s harder to render the tiny serifs, which end up  
hindering readability \(though, with the advent of newer and  
crisper screens, this distinction is going away\).  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 29 Fonts can be further broken down into several categories  
\(Figure 2-21\)\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Slab serif\: Serifs are “slab”-like  
—  
more square and angu-  
lar than typical serifs.  
Monospace\: Every letter takes up the same amount of  
space. In other typefaces, thin letters such as “i” take up  
less space than wide letters such as “m.”  
Display\: Fancy, often swooshy fonts, not particularly  
readable but nice when used sparingly to create emphasis  
in headlines or large text.  
Handwriting\: Fonts that look like someone’s handwrit-  
ing. These are often lumped together with display fonts.  
# Ab Ab  
Figure 2-21\: Slab serif \(Chaparral Pro\), monospace \(Courier New\), display \(Buttermilk\),  
and handwriting \(HanziPen TC\) typefaces.  
# Leading and line height  
Make sure your lines of text aren’t too close together, which  
creates a feeling of clutter. The space between lines of text in a  
paragraph is known in typography-land as “leading” \(from the  
strips of lead that typographers added between the lines of text  
when they hand-set type into the printing press\). In CSS the  
same concept is referred to as “line height” \(Figure 2-22\).  
Aim for a Goldilocks amount of spacing  
—  
a paragraph is hard  
to read if the lines of text are too close or too far apart. Give  
lines of text a little space to improve readability and reduce the  
feeling of clutter, but not so much that they become hard to  
read. 1.6 is a good starting ratio \(e.g., 12px font size with 19.2px  
line height, 14px font size with 22.4px line height\). Feel free to

Figure 2-22\: Text can be too close or too far apart, hindering readability. The center  
example is the most readable.  
play around with your spacing to find what feels right for your  
specific situation.  
# Kerning and letterspacing  
Kerning is the process of changing the spacing between  
individual letters, and letterspacing is the spacing between  
all letters \(changing it affects every letter, whereas kerning  
affects only a pair of letters\). As with leading, we don’t want  
too much or too little. Thankfully, the defaults set for us when  
text is displayed in browsers are fairly ideal, but CSS allows  
you to adjust the amount of spacing between letters using the  
letterspacing property. Graphics programs also allow you to  
tinker with kerning. Large headlines sometimes look nicer  
with some space removed, whereas small text can benefit from  
adding some space \(Figure 2-23\).  
K erning is the process of changing the  
spacing between individual letters,  
and letter-spacing is the spacing  
between all letters \( changing it affects  
every lett er , whereas k erning affects  
only a pair of letters\).  
Kerning is the process of  
changing the spacing between  
individual letters, and letter-  
spacing is the spacing between  
all letters \(changing it affects  
every letter, whereas kerning

to read.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 31Typography principles  
Now, let’s cover some important principles to keep in mind as  
you work on typography.  
# Limit designs to two typefaces  
Using lots of typefaces can lend to chaos and clutter. Simplify  
by choosing one typeface for headlines and a second for con-  
tent; this will make your design look much cleaner. You can  
use bolding, italics, uppercase, and other stylistic treatments  
to create more styles in your text \(Figure 2-24\).  
Figure 2-24\: Lots of typefaces make a design feel chaotic \(left\). Fewer typefaces are  
easier to wrangle and look more professional.  
# Avoid justifying or centering text  
Justified text is text that fits entirely in a column; both margins  
are justified rather than just one. Based on Section 2.1, where we  
discussed lining things up, you might be tempted to use justified  
text to create an even line on the right of the text \(Figure 2-25\).  
However, justified text creates some serious issues\:  
•  
Spacing words out to fit a column can add large, unsightly  
spaces between words.  
32  
c ha p T E R 2 •  
Large spaces between words can line up across multiple  
lines of text, creating an unsightly visual “river” of white  
space \(Figure 2-26\).  
Figure 2-25\: “Ragged-right” text \(right\), is easier to read than justified text \(left\).  
It was the White Rabbit, trotting  
slowly back again, and looking  
anxiously about as it went, as if it had

Unless you have a lot of time for tweaking, justified text is not  
worth it. Use left-aligned \(otherwise known as ragged-right\)  
text to ensure easy readability.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 33Centered text can be challenging  
Centered text can work for headlines, but when in doubt,  
left align your text against an underlying grid so it all lines  
up for easier readability. Paragraphs of text are especially  
hard to read when centered because the starting point for  
each line changes \(Figure 2-27\).  
Centered text can work for  
headlines, but when in doubt, left  
align your text against an  
underlying grid so it all lines up for  
easier readability.  
Figure 2-27\: The uneven left edge of centered content makes it harder to read.  
# Line length  
A paragraph becomes significantly harder to read if there are  
more than 75 or fewer than 45 characters per sentence. Make  
sure your paragraphs have an appropriate width \(or font size\)  
so that the lines are just long enough for maximum readability  
\(Figure 2-28\).

Now that you’ve absorbed this new information, let’s cover  
some shortcuts that’ll make designing your typography much  
faster.  
# Free font resources  
The most beautiful fonts usually cost a lot of money  
—  
worth it  
to professional designers but perhaps not to hobbyist design-  
ers like ourselves.  
Thankfully, sites such as Google Fonts \(*hellobks.com/hwd/32*\)  
\(Figure 2-29\) and Adobe Fonts \(*hellobks.com/hwd/33*\) \(Fig-  
ure 2-30\) offer us beautiful font options that we can use in  
both online and print designs. Google Fonts allows you to  
download the fonts, and Adobe’s Creative Cloud feature makes  
Adobe Fonts’ web fonts available in design and slide programs.  
Figure 2-29\: Google Fonts \(hellobks.com/hwd/32\)

Other free font websites exist, but these two consistently  
have the largest collection of fonts that look great and are  
easy to use.  
# Curated font websites  
Thousands of fonts and typefaces exist in Google Fonts and  
Adobe Fonts alone  
—  
how do you choose the best options  
for your design?  
Rather than scrolling through hundreds of options and  
reading the same default sentence over and over \(guaranteed  
to make anyone’s eyes cross\), check out sites where designers  
have curated great-looking free fonts to narrow your choices.  
36  
c ha p T E R 2 These websites make it easier to choose typefaces that work  
for your design and help you choose fonts that are beautiful  
and professionally designed \(Figure 2-31\).

the widget used before.  
Like color, typography is a huge, fascinating subject. Hopefully  
this brief section has given you a good overview that gets you  
started and gives you a good platform for learning more.  
By narrowing down your font choices to those that have al-  
ready been vetted by others and reducing the number of fonts  
in your design, you’ll be well on your way to a design with  
beautiful typography.  
Next up, we’re going to cover white space and giving your  
design room to breathe.

# WHITE SPACE  
I F YOU U S E O N LY O N E TO O L TO I M P R OV E YOU R D E S I G N , I guar-  
antee that white space would make the biggest difference.  
White space is the ultimate clutter reducer.  
Also known as negative space, white space is empty space \(not  
necessarily white\). Essentially, white space is the space in your  
page left blank as well as the space between your elements  
\(Figures 2-33, 2-34, and 2-35\).  
When you’re designing, you might feel tempted to fill up your  
design with information, links, and other useful elements.  
After all, empty space can feel like wasted space, a place where  
you could add more content to convince your readers to stay  
longer, use your website, or buy your product. Why not fill up  
that space?  
However, a cluttered, crowded website  
—  
even one with more  
information  
—  
will perform worse than a website that makes  
up in simplicity and breathing room what it loses in informa-  
tion. White space is crucial to improving how your design is  
perceived and how well it works.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 39 Figure 2-33\: Let’s inspect the white space on the Squarespace website.  
Figure 2-34\: White space, highlighted in red, is the space on the page withut content.  
Background images and textures generally count as white space.  
Figure 2-35\: White space also refers to space between elements and lines of text.  
40  
c ha p T E R 2White space fundamentals  
Here are a few more reasons why white space is important.  
# White space improves comprehension  
Cluttered websites and designs are harder to follow and  
overload the user with too much information. Simpler web-  
sites make it easier for users to digest the content you have  
displayed without being overwhelmed by extra, unnecessary  
detail \(Figure 2-36\).  
Figure 2-36\: The Foursquare website has plenty of white space, letting the user know  
what to read and what to do next. Simplicity makes designs less confusing.  
# White space improves legibility  
We’re going to repeat a bit of information we covered in the  
last section just to make sure it sticks.  
Remember when we covered leading \(the space between lines\)  
in the typography section? White space in the form of leading  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 41 improves readability. Too little mushes sentences together, but  
too much leading can also worsen readability  
—  
this is defi-  
nitely a case where you should shoot for the Goldilocks zone.  
Adding space between lines of text and elements will help  
users read what you’re trying to say \(Figure 2-37\).  
Too little space between  
lines in a paragraph \(leading\) makes the  
paragraph hard to read  
quickly.  
Give your lines a bit  
of breathing room  
\(as mentioned in the  
typography section\)  
for better readability!  
Figure 2-37\: Paragraphs with too little space between lines are hard to read.  
Similarly, the space between letters \(kerning\) also matters.  
Making sure your letters aren’t too squished together and have  
enough space between them will make your text easier to read  
\(Figure 2-38\).  
Not enough space between letters also  
hinders readability .  
Make sure you keep the natural  
spacing between letters!  
Figure 2-38\: Letters that are too close together also are hard to read. Add some space to  
improve readability.  
# White space improves calls to action  
More items crowding a space make it a harder for someone to  
identify your call to action \(also known as your CTA\). Whatever  
element you want your reader to use, they’ll be more likely to  
see and use if it stands out with a lot of white space  
—  
drawing  
attention to the CTA while reducing distractions from other  
elements \(Figure 2-39\).  
42  
c ha p T E R 2 Figure 2-39\: The introduction text and button stand out with copious amounts of white  
space in the T4S website.  
# White space helps set a tone  
Open, blank space is associated with luxury and quality,  
whereas designs with less space and elements pushed up  
against each other is associated with a more thrifty, chaotic  
tone  
—  
like a busy flea market versus a luxury brand storefront.  
If you want your design to give the impression of luxury, profes-  
sionalism, elegance, or superiority, you can bolster that impres-  
sion by using white space liberally \(Figures 2-40 and 2-41\).  
Figure 2-40\: Cluttered websites lacking  
whitespace feel cheap.  
Figure 2-41\: The Helm website for  
yachting has tons of open space and  
feels luxurious.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 43Quick theory  
As a new designer, your instinct is going to push you toward  
less space, not more. Let’s look at where you can add white  
space in your designs.  
# Space between lines of text  
White space starts at the content level. Your text needs space  
to breathe. Make sure you give the lines of text enough room  
to improve readability \(Figure 2-42\).  
Figure 2-42\: White space in the form of space between lines of text.  
# Space between elements  
Now that we have our text figured out, let’s focus on the spac-  
ing in between elements. This means the space between your  
content and paragraphs and other paragraphs, or paragraphs  
and their headline  
—  
any element near another element  
\(Figure 2-43\).  
Spacing between individual elements helps set the elements  
apart from each other, so the eye can more effectively pick  
out the separate groups. In Figure 2-43 the space between the  
44  
c ha p T E R 2 Figure 2-43\: White space in the form of space between elements.  
newsletter signup \(to the right of the article title\) and the title  
ensures that the two elements remain distinct objects.  
# Space between groups of elements  
Taking the macro view, we also want to make sure groups of el-  
ements have enough space around them. This means creating  
space between columns of elements and other columns, rows  
and other rows, and your entire page of elements within its  
container \(such as the browser window\) \(Figure 2-44\).  
Figure 2-44\: White space in the form of space between groups of elements.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 45Shortcuts  
Here are a couple of easy tips to help you use white space more  
effectively in your designs.  
# Double white space between elements  
Use more white space than you think you need! Yes, there can  
be such thing as too much, but using more than you think is  
a good rule of thumb when you’re starting out. Try to double  
what your initial instinct tells you is appropriate. Go farther  
than you’re comfortable, take a break, and then re-evaluate.  
What might have felt too airy at first may now feel natural  
and balanced.  
# Make sure you have enough leading in  
# your paragraphs  
Repeating our typography section again for emphasis! Re-  
member to keep enough leading \(vertical white space between  
lines in a paragraph\) so your paragraph is easy to read.  
# Real-life examples  
Removing white space from my personal website illustrates  
the how drastically white space can alter a design. Without  
white space, the site looks cluttered and amateur. Adding  
white space, especially in the very airy middle, makes the de-  
sign look more professional and deliberate \(Figure 2-45\).  
Let’s add more white space to our widget\: between individual  
lines of text and between individual elements within the wid-  
get \(Figure 2-46\).  
Doesn’t that feel a lot cleaner? I also evened out the spacing  
between elements \(the same amount of space around the  
elements within the container, as well as the same amount of  
46  
c ha p T E R 2 Figure 2-45\: Before and after adding white space to my personal website.  
An airy design feels less chaotic.  
Figure 2-46\: Adding whitespace between lines of text, between elements, and around  
elements helps our widget feel more professional.  
space between the headline and the content, and the content  
and the form\). This even amount of spacing also reduces the  
clutter and chaos.  
Type, color, and lining things up can do a lot, but adding  
breathing room is the biggest tool in your decluttering basket  
to build a better-looking design.  
Next up, we’re going to tackle layout as a whole  
—  
moving from  
these micro issues and starting to take a macro view of our  
design!

# LAYOUT AND HIERARCHY  
THE LAST FEW SECTIONS DEALT WITH CONCRETE CONCEPTS\: color,  
type, and white space. Now we’re going to consider more ab-  
stract concepts\: layout and hierarchy.  
Layout refers to the way that information is arranged and  
prioritized; the choices that you make about layout affect how  
well your message is read and understood. We already covered  
the grid\: lining up elements to reduce the little pixel differ-  
ences that can make a design feel cluttered. Positioning and  
hierarchy of elements are other important aspects of layout.  
Elements could go literally anywhere  
—  
how do you identify  
their proper places?  
As English readers, we read left to right, meaning that our eyes  
naturally start at the top left of a page. Studies have shown that  
website users look at websites in an “F” pattern \(figures 2-47  
and 2-48\).  
Take advantage of this discovery and build layouts that start  
at the top left of the page and continue to the right and down  
48  
c ha p T E R 2 Figure 2-47\: The Google Ventures website is a good example of the “F” pattern.

Figure 2-48\: Eye-tracking heatmaps show how readers scan websites in an “F” pattern.  
from there. This is why most websites place their logo in the  
top left rather than at the bottom.  
On to hierarchy! When you’re designing, some elements are  
more important than others. Your job is to establish a visual  
hierarchy so your readers and users can see which items are  
important. Essentially, visual hierarchy guides your audience  
and helps them decide what to look at first \(figure 2-49\).  
Portions of this page are reproduced from work created and shared by Google and used  
according to terms described in the Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 49 Figure 2-49\: The left block has no hierarchy. On the right, the increased size of one  
element makes it stand out first.  
A page without hierarchy appears flat and boring. There are sev-  
eral options for indicating importance and increasing visibility\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Size\: Larger items are more important and eye catching.  
Color\: More saturated colors are more visible than  
low-contrast colors. Warmer colors \(reds, oranges, yel-  
lows\) are more visible than cooler colors \(blues, purples,  
greens\).  
Positioning\: Items placed in the upper left corner have  
more importance.  
Contrast\: Items with more contrast will be more eye  
catching than items with low contrast.  
White space\: Items with more white space around them  
appear more important.  
Typography\: Typeface selection can be another indicator  
of hierarchy. Using one font for your header and another  
for your content can create visual hierarchy.  
50  
c ha p T E R 2 Typography is particularly important for web work. The  
following paragraph has no visual hierarchy, giving every item  
the same importance\:  
We’re having a party! You’re invited to the annual cele-  
bration of the Zuni Cafe. Celebrations will be held at Zuni  
Cafe, New York, at 6 pm. Formal dress required; please  
RSVP.  
We can increase hierarchy by adding some white space\:  
We’re having a party!  
You’re invited to the annual celebration of the Zuni Cafe.  
Celebrations will be held at Zuni Cafe, New York, at 6 pm.  
Formal dress required; please RSVP.  
Once we start playing with typography and color, hierarchy  
becomes much more evident\:  
# We’re having a party!  
You’re invited to the annual celebration of the Zuni Cafe.  
Celebrations will be held at Zuni Cafe, New York, at 6 pm.  
F O R M A L D R E S S R E Q U I R E D; P L E AS E R SV P.  
All three are readable, but the last example is the most  
visually interesting and makes the hierarchy of information  
immediately clear.  
How can you tell whether you’ve properly added hierarchy to  
your design? Try the squint test. Squint at your design until  
the design blurs.  
When the content disappears and you can only see the layout  
and elements abstractly, it’s a lot easier to see what pops out  
first. On New York Times website \(figure 2-50\), the logo and  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 51 Figure 2-50\: A blurred version of the New York Times home page. When you can’t read  
the text, content hierarchy becomes more clear.  
images pop first \(especially the orange button on the ad, which  
might not be ideal because it distracts from the website itself\).  
In the content, the centered image and leftmost article with  
the largest headline text also stand out.  
When you’re working on a design, write a list down of all your  
elements and rank them in order of importance. Then look at  
your design and rank the elements based on how they look in  
the design. Do the two lists match up?  
When we fail to establish visual hierarchy, the reader or  
user won’t know where to start or end on your design; this  
confusion could reduce user engagement and conversions.  
The design won’t work as well.  
If something needs to look more important and higher in the  
visual hierarchy, play with the design and make some changes  
based on the ideas mentioned above  
—  
change the color or  
positioning, add spacing, improve the typography  
—  
until the  
item is more visually different.  
52  
c ha p T E R 2 If you’d like to break the “F” pattern in your design, you can do  
that by establishing proper hierarchy using the visual tools we  
listed above. For example, draw attention to an element at the  
top right of the page by making it larger or more colorful. The  
“F” pattern is a great starting point with natural hierarchy due  
to a typical placement of elements, and hierarchy is in our tool-  
box to break that pattern while still achieving a natural-feeling  
website.  
# Real-life examples  
Let’s analyze our widget to determine some of the ways that  
we’re establishing visual hierarchy \(figure 2-51\).  
Figure 2-51\: A brighter color for our download button raises its visual hierarchy. We  
don’t want to accidentally hide this important button!  
The first two important things we see are the headline and  
the login button. The headline is both a different color from the  
content and has a larger font size. The login button is a contrast-  
ing, warmer color than the rest of the widget. You’d probably see  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 53 the headline or button first and then move through the rest of  
the widget  
—  
so we already established proper hierarchy when  
we updated the color and type in the earlier sections. Go us!  
We went over a lot of these principles  
—  
color, typography,  
and white space  
—  
in earlier sections. Layout is where these  
concepts really start working together. Now we’re going to  
move from visual design on its own to thinking more about  
user experience.  
More about content and hierarchy in the following section,  
where we’ll talk content principles!

# CONTENT  
AT F I R S T G L A N C E , A D I S C U S S I O N A B OU T CO N T E N T might seem  
out of place in a book about design, but making good choices  
about words and content plays a huge part in ending clutter.  
This section covers content principles and strategy to help you  
create content that users will read and enjoy and that improves  
how well your design works.  
Dense paragraphs of content contribute to the feeling of clut-  
ter, especially when content is viewed on a screen \(rather than  
in print\). Studies have shown that online readers are more  
likely to skim content than read in full. Big chunks of text are  
more likely to be skipped than read \(figure 2-52\).  
People rarely read Web pages word by word;  
instead, they scan the page, picking out individual  
words and sentences.  
How Users Read on the Web, Nielsen Norman Group  
\(hellobks.com/hwd/45\)  
First off, when it comes to content, less is generally more.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 55 Figure 2-52\: Users read web content fully only if their interest has already been  
piqued—otherwise, they skim content quickly as they look for something that grabs  
their attention.  
It’s tempting when writing web content to cover every possible  
detail and use big, professional words. Instead, it’s preferable  
to write less and use smaller, clearer words that help folks  
understand what you’re trying to say using the fewest number  
of words. Big paragraphs of text are an indicator of clutter  
—  
a good rule of thumb is no more than two to three sentences  
per paragraph.  
When faced with a giant paragraph of information, try to short-  
en and simplify it. Let’s look at a great example from Simple  
and Usable Web, Mobile, and Interaction Design by Giles Colborne  
\(*hellobks.com/hwd/46*\).  
56  
c ha p T E R 2 Please note that although Chrome is supported for both  
Mac and Windows operating systems, it is recommended  
that all users of this site switch to the most up-to-date  
version of the Firefox web browser for the best possible  
results.  
While the above is technically correct and covers all the bases,  
it’s rather long and wordy. We can shorten\:  
For best results, use the latest version of Firefox. Chrome  
for Mac and Windows is also supported.  
Still correct, it covers everything we want to cover, but is much  
shorter and easier to understand at a glance.  
It can be hard to limit yourself when it comes to content. I get  
it  
—  
you have so much important stuff to say! But remember\:  
no matter how much you write, the reader will still only read  
80, 100, maybe 200 words if you’re really lucky.  
Provide more content than the reader is willing to read, and  
they’re likely to skim or abandon ship altogether.  
If you write comprehensive paragraphs that bury the most  
important pieces of information deep inside, you’re taking a  
big risk that the reader will waste their 80 words to read less  
important information.  
The more content you present, the less control you have about  
what the reader actually consumes.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 57 If you can’t shorten something by using fewer words, you can  
also try breaking a paragraph into bullet points. Take this para-  
graph for example\:  
We made a bunch of changes\: The registration chapter  
has been split in two, between adding registration and  
then associating users with objects. The chapter was giant  
before, so this makes it more manageable. Screenshots of  
the admin have been updated to reflect the new Django  
1.9 styles. The few minor typos have been fixed. Updated  
the version of django-registration-redux that we use to 1.3.  
Last but not least, the Introduction has been updated.  
This paragraph would be better suited to bullet points\:  
We made a bunch of changes\:  
•

to 1.3.  
•  
The Introduction has been updated.  
Bullets and other visual aids help the reader pick out pieces  
of information from a block of content, making it more likely  
that the content will be read.  
I also encourage strategic bolding. Especially in technical doc-  
uments, it helps draw attention to the most important part of a  
sentence, further making your content easier to skim.  
58  
c ha p T E R 2 For example\:  
We made a bunch of changes\:

makes it more manageable.

The Introduction has been updated.  
The most important parts have been bolded, so it’s easy for  
readers to skim the content, find the parts that are most inter-  
esting to them, and read further if they like.  
Note we also changed the formatting of the headline! Let’s take  
a look at headlines in general.  
One of the best ways to organize your content is by using  
headlines. These are parts of the text that are presented in a  
larger and more prominent style to introduce the content that  
follows, making the text easier to skim and read.  
Headlines can suffer from wordiness  
—  
you also want these  
parts of your text to be as short and clear as possible to aid  
understanding and keep up excitement. For a better user  
experience, shorten and clarify your headlines, and also make  
sure that they’re exciting and talk benefits for your reader.  
For example, look at two versions of my website advertising  
my other books, the Hello Web App series. In Figure 2-53, the  
headline is wordy and boring. In Figure 2-54, the headline has  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 59 Figure 2-53\: The Hello Web App website with a very wordy headline. Technically correct,  
but not very interesting.  
Figure 2-54\: This headline is still correct, but it’s more exciting and shorter, Most im-  
portant, it does a better job of drawing attention to the benefit of the reader.  
been rewritten to be short and clear, talking about what the  
book does for the visitor of the website, making it more likely  
that the visitor will want to explore my website further.  
If you’re writing headlines that introduce a product or are  
designed to draw attention, make sure you write them in a way  
that showcases the benefits of the product rather than just  
describing what the product does.  
Changes like this can drastically affect your bottom line. In  
a study by webprofits \(*hellobks.com/hwd/47*\) \(figure 2-55\),  
60  
c ha p T E R 2 changing the headline to talk about benefits rather than de-  
tails increased the conversion rate \(the number of people who  
bought the product\) by 52.8 percent.  
Figure 2-55\: Changing a headline to talk benefits, not details, led to a conversion  
increase of 52.8% in this example by webprofits \(hellobks.com/hwd/47\).  
# Real-life examples  
Back to our little widget! After learning about these content  
principles, we can update the content significantly \(figure 2-56\).  
Figure 2-56\: We’ve updated the content in our widget to make it shorter, clearer, more  
exciting, and easier to understand.  
We’ve shortened the content and made everything more excit-  
ing and personable. The form itself has been updated to a more  
friendly, human-sounding sentence, and the button has been  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 61 updated from a simple “Login” to a more actionable-sounding  
“Log into your account”. All in all, these updates should make  
the widget easier to read, understand, and use at a glance.  
Content might not initially feel like a part of design, but  
it really, really is huge. Content, writing, and words define  
how your design \(especially web-focused design\) will be con-  
sumed, so make sure that you spend some of your design time  
working on improving your content and writing.  
In short, cut down and clarify your content as much as possi-  
ble. Keep your paragraphs to two to three sentences.  
Make sure your content work extends to your headlines as  
well. If your headlines introduce a page or product, make sure  
the headline talks about how the page or product affects the  
reader rather than what it does.  
Next up, we’re going to talk user experience!

# USER E XPERIENCE  
T H I S I S T H E S E C T I O N T H AT T I E S EV E RY T H I N G TO G E T H E R . All  
your work to make your designs enjoyable and easy to look  
at, your content short and easy to parse, your layouts easy to  
understand  
—  
all these concepts tie into your user experience.  
User experience \(UX\) is the overall experience a user has when  
using your website  
—  
the most important part of design.  
Let’s break down the parts of user experience.  
# Before designing  
Before you can even begin design work, you should be able to  
answer a few primary questions\: Who is your ideal user? What  
is their personal goal? What are your business goals? User  
experience research can help answer these questions.  
For example, someone visiting your personal website could be  
looking for more information about your work and what you  
do \(their personal goal\); your business goal could be to sign  
them up for your personal newsletter.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 63 Or, for a web page for a new iPhone app, your user would be  
looking for information about your app and how to down-  
load it; your business goal would be to get as many downloads  
as possible.  
We’re looking at two things\: whether the customer is achiev-  
ing what they want to achieve and whether you’re achieving  
your business goals . Hopefully your design achieves both.  
You may not need to do user experience research for a small  
personal project, but there are some things you can do in the  
predesign phase of big, important projects to help figure out  
your users and their goals.  
# Competitive analysis  
In a nutshell, look at your competitors and analyze what they  
do well and not so well.  
Chapter 3, Section 3.1\: Finding Inspiration goes over how to  
look at websites and pick out ideas and things you can imple-  
ment in your own design. Looking at competitors is a crucial  
part of creating your site’s user experience  
—  
it gives you a  
standard for comparison and helps you create a user experi-  
ence superior to that of your competitors in order to lure their  
customers away.  
# Surveys and interviews  
How will you learn what your customers want and need if  
you don’t ask them? A lot of web designers fall into the trap  
of designing for folks they don’t understand  
—  
for example,  
designing a wedding planning app if you haven’t planned a  
wedding yourself. You might have some thoughts and ideas  
about what a person planning their wedding needs, but you  
may make some incorrect assumptions unless you actually  
talk to someone planning their wedding.  
64  
c ha p T E R 2 You want to have a good feel for what your ideal user wants  
and needs from your design. Having this knowledge will  
help you design better so the customer can achieve what  
they want, which should in turn allow you to achieve more  
of what you want.  
# During the design process  
You don’t want to spend the time implementing a design in  
code and then find out that folks are confused by a specific pro-  
cess or flow on your website \(for example, the steps someone  
might take to buy an item\). To avoid these missteps, you can do  
a “test run” of your design by using wireframes, prototypes, and  
usability testing.  
# Wireframes, prototypes, and usability testing  
Wireframes and prototypes are fast, low-fidelity mock-ups of  
your design. Usability testing allows you to get feedback on  
layouts and interactions before you move forward with build-  
ing the design in full. We’ll examine these concepts in more  
detail in Chapter 3, Section 3.3\: Prototypes.  
Wireframes and prototypes allow you to build quick-and-dirty  
mock-ups of your design and take them to others to get their  
feedback, learning whether your layout and flow make sense.  
Research shows that you can find and address big usability  
issues with a low-fidelity paper prototype just as easily as you  
can with a high-fidelity screen prototype. Save yourself valu-  
able time by testing your layouts and flows early on.  
# After launching your design  
Once you’ve launched your design, you need to track whether  
you’re actually meeting your goals. How is your conversion  
rate? Do you have a low enough bounce rate, the percentage of  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 65 people who immediately leave a website after loading? Are you  
getting good customer feedback? To help answer these ques-  
tions, you can conduct a variety of tests to measure this data.  
# More usability testing  
A crucial part of user experience is making sure you use appro-  
priate analytics packages \(such as Google Analytics\: *hellobks*  
*.com/hwd/48*\) to collect data on how well your website is work-  
ing after launch.  
A/B testing is the process of testing a design change against  
your current website  
—  
such as testing two different versions of  
a headline and seeing which version better achieves your goal,  
such as increasing the number of purchases visitors make.  
These tests can be run after launch to continuously improve  
how well your designs are working.  
Usability testing is the process of showing your designs to  
others to solicit feedback and ensure your website is usable  
by folks other than yourself, and we’ll cover that in Chapter 3,  
Section 3.4\: Getting Feedback.  
# Shortcuts  
Now for my favorite part\: the most important things to remem-  
ber when thinking about user experience.  
# Make desired actions easy to find and use  
Whatever you want your user to do, make sure the steps to  
complete that action are easy to find and straightforward  
to use.  
It makes no sense for your submit button to be plain and hard  
to see  
—  
a bright button stands out and makes forms easier to  
submit \(figure 2-57\).  
66  
c ha p T E R 2 submit me submit me  
Figure 2-57\: Submit buttons for forms are important \(as we talked about in the last  
section!\) On the left, the button might be a bit too hard to find. The right button is  
easier to find and use.  
Newsletter signup links shouldn’t be hidden in the content  
\(remember what we said about skimmers\). Display them on  
their own line to make them easier to see \(figure 2-58\).  
I believe folks who know a bit  
about design will be more  
likely to hire a professional  
designer when the time is  
right. I’m a designer, and  
even I hire designers for  
things bigger than me. And if  
you agree, you should join

your content. Push it out and make it visible.  
# Pay attention to website size  
Slow downloading will prompt people to leave a website with-  
out seeing it. Pay attention to image size; with large screens and  
fast downloads the norm at home, it’s easy to forget that a lot of  
folks still browse websites on cell phones with poor reception  
or coffee shops with overloaded Wi-Fi. Also consider JavaScript;  
downloading lots of scripts will slow a website down, as will  
slow-performing scripts.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 67 Check your website in multiple browsers using multiple sizes  
and multiple download speeds to make sure it loads quickly.  
# Run usability tests  
We’ll cover usability testing in more depth in Chapter 3,  
Section 3.4\: Getting Feedback. Essentially, show your designs  
to others and get their feedback, as hard as that might feel. As  
designers, we’re naturally blind to problems in our design, so  
it’s crucial to get more eyes on it to find those issues.  
# Include analytics  
Make sure to include analytics-tracking software in your  
designs so you can see how your design is performing after  
launch. At the very least, consider Google Analytics \(*hellobks*  
*.com/hwd/48*\) or a customer data platform such as Segment  
\(*hellobks.com/hwd/49*\) that you can tie in with Google Analytics  
and other analytics platforms.  
# Real-life examples  
Going back to our widget \(figure 2-59\), we can see that our  
login button is a bright, easy-to-see color. Users aren’t going  
to be confused about how to submit!  
User experience is one of those things that’s hard to show in a  
book. Remember that you should do your best to try to under-  
stand your audience, pay attention to your pages and how a  
person moves between them \(and make sure that’s easy to do\),  
get feedback from your designs from outside sources, and pay  
attention to how well your design is doing after launch.  
Congrats on finishing this section!  
68  
c ha p T E R 2 Figure 2-59\: User experience goes hand in hand with hierarchy. Our form is more usable  
because our submit button is in a bright, contrasting color.

# IMAGES AND IMAGERY  
S O FA R W E ’ V E B E E N WO R K I N G S O L E LY W I T H L I N E S , boxes, and  
text for your designs, but images \(and imagery such as icons  
and graphics\) can play a huge part. In this section we’ll address  
where you can find images to use for your project and how to  
use them effectively.  
First off, let’s cover royalties and licensing. As easy as it is to  
right-click and “save as” almost any image you find on the  
internet, you can’t use just anything you find. Images have  
copyright protections, and reusing an image created by some-  
one else without permission is illegal.  
An overview of terms you should keep an eye out for\:  
•  
Rights-managed images\: Should include additional  
terms indicating allowable uses for the image.  
•  
Royalty-free images\: Generally you can use the image  
as long as you correspond to the terms of the image. For  
example, a lot of royalty-free images can be used only in  
not-for-profit contexts, meaning you cannot use them  
for any application in which you could potentially make  
money.  
70  
c ha p T E R 2 •  
Creative commons\: A system created for content cre-  
ators to allow their work to be used without requiring  
express permission. Creative commons images can be li-  
censed in many different ways, from requiring attribution,  
denying derivatives \(you can’t alter the image yourself\),  
prohibiting commercial use, or allowing any use.  
If an image doesn’t specify that you can use it, then you are  
not allowed to use it for your project. The vast majority of the  
world has adopted the Berne Convention, which states that  
copyrights are granted to the author by default  
—  
even if not  
specified. You don’t actually need to put little copyright notice  
footers on your website!  
# Fundamentals  
Let’s cover some quick fundamentals to remember when  
you’re adding imagery to your designs.  
# Don’t feel like you’re required to use  
# photos or icons  
Don’t fret that you need to use photos of people in your de-  
signs. Type and screenshots of your product can go a long way  
\(figure 2-60\).  
By playing with typography  
—  
using different fonts and  
styles  
—  
you can create a beautiful and clean website without  
needing to fuss with images.  
If you’re building a product for the web, the website for that  
product doesn’t need much more than screenshots \(figure 2-61\).  
You can always add images and imagery later  
—  
starting out  
with a clean, text-based website could help you launch faster  
without nitpicking over these details.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 71 Figure 2-60\: John Gruber’s Daring Fireball website is a beautiful, successful design using  
all text \(other than the icon in the logo\).  
Figure 2-61\: The T4S website is clean, featuring screenshots of their product.  
72  
c ha p T E R 2Faces are powerful  
Happy faces provoke happy emotions; angry faces provoke an-  
gry emotions. You can use a face in your design to emphasize  
the emotion you want and draw the eye to the most important  
part of the page \(figure 2-62\). This is a powerful tool in your  
design toolbox.  
Figure 2-62\: Dan Mall’s personal website. Dan’s photo draws the eye, and his gaze leads  
us to the introduction text.  
# Pay attention to file size  
Images can easily bloat a website’s size very quickly, leading  
to slower download times and frustrated users who don’t  
stick around. Additionally, more screens are going retina with  
higher resolutions, with smaller pixels leading to crisper more  
crisp displays  
—  
making photos and images at the old resolu-  
tion look blurry.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 73 Some principles to keep in mind\:  
•  
•  
Make sure your images are the maximum  
necessary size. No sense in putting a 2000px image  
into a 1200px box.  
Provide retina and non-retina images. Set up your  
HTML and CSS so folks using a retina screen can download  
the more detailed, higher-resolution images, and those  
on a traditional screen will get the smaller images with no  
wasted pixels. This is a great guide on doing so\:  
*hellobks.com/hwd/54*.  
# Beware of stock photos that look like stock photos  
Searching for “stock photos” on Google will get you to multiple  
websites that purport to offer a lot of great options you can  
use \(paid and free\), but there are a whole lot of low-quality  
images. Take a look at some of the giant websites like iStock  
\(figure 2-63\), but try to find images that feel more natural than  
the example image \(digital construction in the future!\).  
Figure 2-63\: iStock \(hellobks.com/hwd/53\) has a lot of stock images to go through, but  
beware of images that feel overly posed and unnatural.  
74  
c ha p T E R 2Icons  
While images are great for backgrounds and big elements,  
icons are more like supporting characters  
—  
little graphics that  
support your content and design. You don’t need icons, but  
they can make your design feel unique.  
Icons support information absorption by creating a graphical  
representation of content. The Kite website uses icons effec-  
tively to draw the eye to the three columns of features using  
abstract representations of the content \(figure 2-64\).  
Figure 2-64\: Kite’s website icons are simple but effective.  
Of course, this is also a place you need to pay attention  
to licensing. Just like photos, icons are copyrighted.  
# Shortcuts  
# Stock photo websites  
My favorite resource for natural-looking stock photos is  
Unsplash \(*hellobks.com/hwd/56*\) \(figure 2-65\), which features  
free Creative Commons images.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 75 Other stock photo websites include IM Free \(*hellobks.com*  
*/hwd/60*\), picjumbo \(*hellobks.com/hwd/61*\), iStock \(*hellobks.com*  
*/hwd/62*\), Gratisography \(*hellobks.com/hwd/63*\), and  
PhotoPin \(*hellobks.com/hwd/57*\) \(figure 2-66\).  
# Imagery \(icons, graphics, and illustrations\)  
To add that little special touch to your designs using icons,  
try either websites with predesigned icons, such as The Noun  
Project \(*hellobks.com/hwd/58*\) \(figure 2-67\), or get them custom  
designed for you through websites such as Fiverr \(*hellobks.com*  
*/hwd/59*\) \(figure 2-68\) and Upwork \(*hellobks.com/hwd/64*\).  
Figure 2-65\: Unsplash \(hellobks.com  
/hwd/56\) is a great source for natural-  
looking images.  
Figure 2-66\: PhotoPin \(hellobks.com  
/hwd/57\) searches Flickr for Creative  
Commons images.

Creative Commons icons you can use in  
your projects.

Our widget was already readable, well spaced, and usable—but  
by adding some polish through a background pattern, a subtle  
drop-shadow, and a fun icon, we can really elevate its appear-  
ance \(Figure 2-69\). We can often get away without these little  
details \(and I often personally skip this effort on some of my  
own quick design work\), but as you can see, it can be time well  
spent on important design work.  
Figure 2-69\: Our widget was fairly good already, but adding a background pattern, a light  
drop-shadow, and a fun icon takes it to another level.  
Next up, we’re going to cover some random and fun design  
tidbits that didn’t fit into these earlier sections.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 77 S E C T I O N 2 . 9  
# E XTRA TIDBITS  
L E T ’ S W R A P U P T H I S C H A P T E R by going over some fun design  
tidbits. This section is a catchall for some things we covered a  
bit of in earlier sections and some that didn’t fit perfectly in  
one category; all should be interesting and will add a bit of  
spice into your design work.  
# Start simple  
When you’re starting out, deliberately choosing simple inter-  
faces and designs will make your life easier. Simple layouts,  
simple user interface \(UI\), and simple UX might make you feel  
boring \(you’re not!\), but they are effective and easier for new-  
bies to wrangle \(figure 2-70\).  
Don’t be ashamed to start out small  
—  
after all, you can always  
add more elements or redesign after your first iteration.  
# Consider the “rule of thirds”  
The “rule of thirds” is a concept usually applied in pho-  
tography. Centering an object in a photograph makes the  
78  
c ha p T E R 2 Figure 2-70\: Appcanary’s website is simple and very effective.  
photograph feel boring. Instead, divide the image horizontally  
and vertically into thirds; the intersections of these lines are  
great guidelines for placing points of interest, creating photos  
that are visually more interesting \(figure 2-71\).  
This also can apply to web design  
—  
one of the reasons why  
a three-column website design is visually appealing. You can  
also place your background images and important features  
\(such as faces\) along these lines \(figure 2-72\).  
Again, this is another rule that can \(and often should be\) bro-  
ken, but it’s a good concept to keep in mind.  
# Avoid pure black  
Pure black  
—  
which doesn’t occur in nature  
—  
can make your  
design feel stark and unnatural. Instead, use color that is  
not quite black; in hexadecimal, something like \#222222 is  
great for headlines and \#444444 for text, rather than \#000000.  
You can also use the specific CSS property RGBA \( color\:  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 79 Figure 2-71\: The rule of thirds. Points of interest aren’t centered  
—  
rather, points of inter-  
est are placed along the “thirds” intersections for more compelling layouts.  
Figure 2-72\: Comovee’s website background basically aligns with the page in thirds.  
80  
c ha p T E R 2 rgba\(0,0,0,0.2\);\) so your text darkens the background color  
rather than using pure gray \(Figures 2-73 and 2-74\).  
White is less likely to invoke this feeling of starkness, but it  
still could be worthwhile to play with using almost-white  
in your designs.  
# Lighting should come from above  
If you’re adding shadows or gradients to your design elements,  
set it up so that it looks like it’s been lit head-on or from above  
\(Figure 2-75\). Objects lit from below look unnatural, as we’re  
used to light normally coming from above \(the sun, overhead  
lights, and so on\) \(figure 2-76\).  
Figure 2-73\: Black is readable but stark  
and a bit hard on the eyes.  
Figure 2-74\: Dark gray is still readable  
but a lot easier to look at on a computer  
screen.  
Figure 2-75\: Lit from above, the button  
feels like it’s popping out naturally from  
the page.  
Figure 2-76\: The button looks unnatural  
when lit from below.  
T h E O R y A N D D E S I gn p R I N C I p L E S 81Contrast highlights what’s important  
In your designs, widgets, and forms, you can play with  
contrast to make something stand out \(or stand back\). This  
works particularly well with form elements, when you want to  
visually indicate what is editable versus what is just help text  
\(figure 2-77\).  
# Colors look different depending on the environment  
The lovely peach in your color palette might suddenly look  
brown when placed on a bright orange background \(figure 2-78\).  
It’s not your palette, it’s our eyes  
—  
our perception of color  
changes depending on the environment. Feel free to alter the  
colors on your palette a bit so they visually match their source,  
even in a new environment. Your color palette doesn’t have to  
be set in stone!  
Figure 2-77\: The form’s help is lighter compared to the main text,  
indicating that it’s less important.  
82  
c ha p T E R 2 Figure 2-78\: The inner square is the same color in both images, but looks significantly  
darker and browner in the example on the right.  
# Be careful about overlaying text on images  
We went over typography, readability, and images in separate  
sections. Combining images and text can be hard to do because  
the image itself can hinder readability \(and ergo, how well your  
design works for the user\) \(figure 2-79\). Try overlaying trans-  
parent color on top of an image \(black is typically used, but you  
could also try white or colors\) \(figure 2-80\), adding a solid block  
of color behind the text, or blurring the image behind the text if  
readability seems like it’ll be a problem.  
Figure 2-79\: Text can become unreadable  
Figure 2-80\: Darkening the background  
depending on the background.  
ensures that text will always be readable.

This book mostly focuses on designing web pages that try  
to convert a first-time visitor into a certain action, which  
means we’re trying to avoid designs that require any kind  
of learning curve.  
However, internal tools that will be used many times every day  
allow us to make a tradeoff between requiring some upfront  
learning and making our users’ workflow more efficient.  
Examples include creating keyboard shortcuts or allowing  
more clutter in order to make vital information available in  
one place. The Bloomberg Terminal  
—  
borderline terrifying for  
novices but irreplaceable for professionals  
—  
is one example of  
purposeful clutter in expert interfaces \(figure 2-81\).  
Figure 2-81\: The Bloomberg Terminal design is cluttered and chaotic, but with purpose.  
In an ideal scenario, we could create the best of both worlds\:  
a design both intuitive and beautiful that lets users perform  
any task as fast as possible. But reality dictates that we usually  
need to compromise on either simplicity or function. The deci-  
sion about which to favor must be made consciously.  
84  
c ha p T E R 2 And that’s the end of the chapter on theory and shortcuts!  
Over the last few sections, our widget has slowly improved.  
Here’s how we’ve transformed it \(figure 2-82\).

# THE PROCESS AND TRAINING YOUR  
# DESIGN EYE  
N OW T H AT W E ’ V E C H AT T E D A B OU T D E S I G N P R I N C I P L E S and the  
pieces of design, let’s work on the process of design. While the  
last few sections have thrown a lot of theory at you, these next  
sections are geared toward adding real-world context to what  
you have learned and helping you do design work.  
The following sections will walk you through the parts of de-  
sign from start to finish  
—  
finding inspiration, sketching your  
project, getting feedback, and building. We will talk about  
these steps in abstract but also apply them to a sample project  
so you can see how everything comes together.  
For our sample project, we’re going to build on a theoretical  
home page for an open source project  
—  
a place where visitors  
can learn about and use the project, with links to documenta-  
tion and information on how to contribute to the project.  
Let’s get started!  
87 S E C T I O N 3 . 1  
# FINDING INSPIRATION  
W H AT ’ S T H E F I R S T T H I N G YOU S H OU L D D O when starting  
a design project?  
If you think that you should sit down and start working on  
ideas, sketching layouts, planning your content  
—  
you’re close,  
but not quite ready to go there yet.  
Sitting down and immediately working on a design problem  
without first doing research and looking for inspiration is like  
trying to code without access to the internet to look up ques-  
tions and errors  
—  
doable, but slower and more frustrating.  
Think of inspiration as visual debugging. Looking at great de-  
sign and inspiration will help you figure out solutions to prob-  
lems that you may run into when creating your own designs.  
Where to find inspiration? For web design, there are tons of  
websites that collect and share good designs \(figure 3-1\).  
Of course, do not rip off designs. If you find something you  
like, you can do something similar, but ripping off something  
verbatim is a very big no-no. But you can be inspired by layout,

Figure 3-1\: Some of the many options you can use to find web design inspiration.  
the treatment of color, the tone, the imagery, and the typogra-  
phy and implement the things you like into your own project.  
Try to focus on a specific aspect of a design that you like, rather  
than the entire thing, and apply it to your project.  
Your job as designer isn’t to reinvent the wheel. Noting estab-  
lished conventions and things that “work” will help you imple-  
ment familiar flows and layouts in your own designs  
—  
making  
it more intuitive for your users to navigate your product.  
My Hello Web App books were inspired by the wonderful A  
Book Apart books \(figure 3-2\).  
I’m particularly proud of my design for Hello Web App, but  
I sincerely don’t think they would have turned as they did  
without being heavily inspired by A Book Apart. Seeing those  
books helped me determine what I liked in terms of size and

Apart series on the right.  
thickness, and the flat, bright colors inspired my own graphic  
treatment of the Hello Web App cover.  
Pablo Picasso famously said, “Good artists copy, great artists  
steal.” When you find something you love, something that  
you’d like to do yourself  
—  
whether it’s layout, color, font  
choice, and so on  
—  
use that as inspiration to build something  
similar but not exactly the same.  
One of the most useful things you can do to make yourself  
better at design is to look at other designs and think critically  
about what they do well and what they do poorly. This is a  
great process to practice while you’re looking for inspiration!  
The more you do this \(with good designs as well as bad\), the  
more you’ll train your “design eye” and design intuition, mak-  
ing it easier for you to create good designs from scratch.  
Let’s use the GitHub home page design as an example  
\(figure 3-3\).  
90  
C ha p T E R 3 Figure 3-3\: GitHub has consistently great-looking home page designs, great for practic-  
ing picking out good design decisions.  
Using the principles we went over in Chapter 2, Theory and De-  
sign Principles, what would you say they’re doing well? Some  
of the details I’ve picked out\:  
•  
•  
•  
Lots of white space. The headline, content, and form  
have plenty of white space around the top and bottom,  
drawing the eye and emphasizing the content. Just  
enough white space  
—  
not too much and not too little.  
Sign-up form is front and center. No need to jump  
through hoops  
—  
GitHub makes it super simple to sign  
up for an account right from the front page. Note that the  
“Username” field has focus by default so the user can start  
typing immediately.  
Important words are bolded and linked in the  
content. Both “open source” and “business” are linked,  
bolded, and in a brighter color. At a glance you can see the  
two areas that GitHub focuses on.  
T he p R O C E S S A N D T R A I N I N g y O U R D E S I gn e ye 91 •  
Subtle background pattern helps the white space feel  
less empty. Imagine the background in a flat gray  
—  
the  
design would still look good but would feel less polished.  
The subtle pattern fills the white space while letting the  
content shine.  
•  
Main button is a bright, stand-out color. The majority  
of the design is dark and gray, making the bright green  
form submit button stand out.  
What other good design decisions can you see?  
Start browsing the web more mindfully, and think critically  
about what designs are doing well and poorly. Over time, your  
design intuition will improve. Making this a practice will make  
it easier for you to create better designs naturally.  
This is especially important when you’re actively working on a  
new design. Start out by looking for inspiration in examples of  
good design in your field and by looking at your competitors.  
Pick out what they’re doing well, and implement those ideas  
in your own design. Pick out what you think isn’t working well  
\(especially in your competitor’s designs\), and make sure you  
avoid those things in your own design.  
Our sample project for Chapter 2 was our widget. For this chapter  
we’re going to be building a home page for an open source proj-  
ect. Let’s start by finding some really clean and visually interest-  
ing home pages for other open source projects \(figure 3-4\).  
There are a number of trends that will be nice to implement in  
our own design\:  
•  
Lots of white space

open source project home pages  
are fairly simple \(compared to, say, a newspaper home  
page\) and an airy, designer-y feel is a nice contrast to  
something aimed at developers.

# PLANNING  
YOU CO U L D J U M P S T R A I G H T I N TO CO D I N G and start creating  
your site using your inspiration, but the middle process of  
design  
—  
creating a plan, sketching ideas and layouts, and  
making a mock-up  
—  
will help you try more ideas and create  
a better design in overall less time. It’s a bit of effort up front  
that’ll save a lot of time down the line.  
Your life will be so much easier if you do some basic planning  
before moving ahead with trying to sketch and develop your  
design. How many pages do you need? What kind of content  
do those pages need? What kind of forms do you need, and  
how many fields?  
We’re going to build our open source project home page sam-  
ple project as a single page with links out to external docu-  
mentation  
—  
making our plan rather simple. Just one page!  
On this one page, let’s list the elements we’ll need\:  
•  
Logo/name of project.  
•  
Headline explaining the project.  
94  
C ha p T E R 3 •  
Menu with links to external documentation on Read the  
Docs, GitHub page, author’s Twitter.  
•  
Block showing code \(to show how easy it is to install\).  
•  
Three blocks with benefits and features in more depth.  
•  
Positive quote from contributor.  
•  
Repeated menu in the footer.  
Most websites won’t be this simple. Let’s think about another  
scenario, such as a personal portfolio website for a designer  
named Jane, which would require more pages.  
First, let’s determine what pages we need for a personal  
website for Jane\:  
•  
Home page\: The first page someone sees when they hit  
the website.  
•  
About page\: A deeper dive into Jane’s background  
and experience.  
•  
Portfolio page\: An overview of Jane’s projects.  
— Individual project pages\: These pages will probably  
—  
use the same layout, so we can group them under one  
category.  
•  
Contact page\: A page with Jane’s location and informa-  
tion about how to contact her.  
Right away, we can see that we have five basic types of pages  
that we will need to design layouts for. Now that we have the  
basic pages, what do we want each page to have on it?  
•  
Every page\:  
— Personal logo or name.  
—  
T he p R O C E S S A N D T R A I N I N g y O U R D E S I gn e ye 95 •  
•

•  
— Top menu listing all top-level pages in the website  
—  
\(that is, we’re only going to list the four main bullets  
above, not each individual portfolio page\).  
— Footer menu after content.  
—  
Home page\:  
— Short, exciting description of Jane.  
—  
— Photo of Jane.  
—  
About page\:  
— Longer descriptive paragraph.  
—  
— Different image of Jane.  
—  
Portfolio page\:  
— Blocks for each of Jane’s projects with a photo/screen-  
—  
shot of each, project title, and links to individual  
project pages.  
Individual project pages\:  
— Image representing project.  
—  
— Long description of project.  
—  
— Links to external resources \(code on GitHub,  
—  
launched website, and so on\).  
Contact page\:  
— Short introduction paragraph.  
—  
— Email address and location.  
—  
— Form for contact with fields for name, email, short  
—  
content section, and a submit button.  
96  
C ha p T E R 3 Making a plan and listing of all these pages, features, widgets,  
and blocks will help you organize your design process and en-  
sure that you don’t miss an important element when sketching  
and building your design.  
At this point, you could jump over to coding your site, but I  
highly recommend taking some time to build some proto-  
types. We’ll cover this in the next section!  
T he p R O C E S S A N D T R A I N I N g y O U R D E S I gn e ye 97 S E C T I O N 3 . 3  
# PROTOT YPES  
T H E P R O C E S S O F S K E TC H I N G YOU R I D E A S and making proto-  
types will help you play with solutions and try out different  
ideas faster than if you moved straight to coding. This usually  
happens in tandem with the inspiration process. As you go  
through and find ideas you like, you should make note of these  
ideas you’d like to implement and sketch out how they could  
fit into your own design.  
Sketching can seem more intimidating than it is. Perhaps  
you’ve seen sketches of websites that look like figure 3-5.  
You can sketch something like the one in Figure 3-5 if you like,  
but that really isn’t how initial sketches are made. Sketching is  
more abstract, uses minimal detail, and works with your imag-  
ination to make everything come together. All you really need  
are boxes and lines to start jotting down some ideas for layouts  
and how your design should look \(figure 3-6\).  
This creates a quick and easy shorthand to start sketching  
out your design ideas. Here are some more examples from  
when I was redesigning the Hello Web Books website from my  
own sketchbook \(figure 3-7\).  
98  
C ha p T E R 3 Figure 3-5\: Sketches don’t need to have this much detail.  
Figure 3-6\: Low-information sketches. Squiggles represent headlines or larger text,  
lines represent content, boxes indicate buttons, and x-ed out boxes represent images.

100  
C ha p T E R 3 Again, these sketches aren’t pixel perfect\: they’re meant to  
provide quick layout ideas to help you start building your  
design. Quick, messy, easy, and definitely not perfect.  
You can upgrade your sketches by adding shading or different  
shades of gray, but try to keep your sketches as unstyled as pos-  
sible in this initial round. No fancy fonts, no colors, no exact  
dimensions. Keep this round as easy as possible on yourself  
so you can quickly create as many different ideas as possible  
\(figure 3-8\).  
Figure 3-8\: Paper sketches showing basic lines, boxes, image locations, and content  
placement. Sketches don’t need to be too complicated.  
Let’s return to our sample project and sketch out a few  
quick ideas for home page layouts for our open source  
project \(figure 3-9\).  
Here are quick sketches of two different home page layout  
ideas, but I recommend that you do more when you’re sketching

your ideas. The more layouts you do, the more ideas you’ll go  
through, which will help you gain confidence in the sketch \(or  
sketches\) you choose to build wireframes from.  
If don’t have a particular project in mind, sketching the layouts  
of your favorite websites is great practice.  
102  
C ha p T E R 3Wireframing  
Next, we make our quick sketches more concrete. Wirefram-  
ing helps us build in extra detail from our sketches, working  
with real sizes for placement and helping us figure out spacing  
in a more refined representation of our design.  
There are a lot of different software solutions available to help  
you with this stage \(figure 3-10\).

Wireframes come between the sketch and mock-up stages. At  
this stage we are not choosing colors or finding fonts  
—  
we’re  
just continuing to think about layout and flow.  
Going back to our open source project home page,  
we’re going to take my favorite sketch and use it to create a  
wireframe \(figure 3-11\).  
We’re using a three-column layout, starting to plan our con-  
tent \(making sure it’s short, easy to understand, and exciting\)  
and figuring out spacing and layout. Once we have these ele-  
ments in place, we can start testing our design \(see Section 3.4\:  
Getting Feedback\) and trying out ideas until we have some-  
thing we want to move forward with.  
We’re still missing major design decisions such as fonts, color,  
and graphics, but this bare-bones wireframe gives us a great  
place to start when getting feedback from others and coding  
the site.  
104  
C ha p T E R 3 Figure 3-11\: A quick wireframe based on one of our sketches. No major design  
choices  
—  
just layout and spacing.  
It’s important to use real content  
—  
avoid fake content such as  
lorem ipsum \(dummy text used by the design industry\)  
—  
as  
much as possible. With real content, you’ll know the length of  
text you need, which is crucial when making your layout, rather  
than using fake text that may end up being longer or shorter  
than the text you eventually use.  
Pay attention to the content principles we’ve gone over,  
making sure your content is short, easy to read, and exciting.  
As you go through the sketching, wireframing, and mocking  
T he p R O C E S S A N D T R A I N I N g y O U R D E S I gn e ye 105 up stages  
—  
revising and testing different versions of your  
designs  
—  
you should be revising and improving your content  
as well.  
Let’s look at an unrelated idea so we can get another example  
of what wireframes would look like \(figure 3-12\).  
Figure 3-12\: Another wireframe example.  
Again, no fonts or colors, but this quick wireframe shows  
planned layout \(mainly one narrow column with menu  
options around the logo\), and some design decisions, such as  
using a bulleted list for content and a form that’s high enough  
on the page to be seen without scrolling.  
Wireframing should help you make simple layout decisions so  
you can try ideas quickly and test them without spending time  
on small design details or changing large chunks of code.  
106  
C ha p T E R 3 Depending on what you’re doing, you could move straight to  
code after creating your wireframes, or you could create a  
mock-up to explore final colors, fonts, and images.  
# Mocking up your design  
Wireframes are pretty low-fidelity  
—  
we can also create high-  
fidelity mock-ups in our design programs before we move to  
code so we can get every design detail planned \(fonts, colors,  
backgrounds, and so on\) before moving onto code.  
This part of the design process is a bit tougher if you haven’t used  
a design program before. In Chapter 5, Additional Resources, I  
cover tutorials and videos on basic design skills for major design  
programs.  
Some pros and cons to spending the extra time mocking up  
your design\:  
Pros  
•  
•  
You’ll see exactly what your design will \(hopefully\) look  
like when you move into building it in HTML and CSS.  
Objects can be easily moved and transformed, so you can  
change your mind more quickly than if the design were  
already coded.  
Cons  
•  
•  
Adds an extra step that could take more time.  
As you’re designing for the web, your eventual website  
needs to be responsive \(the design adapts so it looks as good  
in smaller screens as it does in larger\). Responsive designs  
are harder to mock up, as most design solutions are static.  
You’d need to create mock-ups that show the design adapt-  
ing to different sizes \(mobile, computer, and so on\).  
T he p R O C E S S A N D T R A I N I N g y O U R D E S I gn e ye 107 •  
If you’re not comfortable with design programs \(or you’re  
more comfortable with code\), mocking up may take more  
time than coding in HTML and CSS.  
Your mock-ups should include all of the decisions you made  
before about content and layout from your wireframes with  
the additional bonus of planning for graphics, colors, fonts,  
and extra-beautiful design tweaks \(figure 3-13\).  
Figure 3-13\: Mock-up showing color, font, and imagery decisions using the design  
program Sketch.  
Let’s take the wireframes for our sample home page and start  
adding some color, fonts, and imagery. Focus on making this  
first draft just good enough to launch and show others, as you  
can continue iterating and improving the design over time  
\(figure 3-14\).  
108  
C ha p T E R 3 Figure 3-14\: Back to our sample project. Go from wireframe to mock-up by adding color,  
imagery, fonts, and other style decisions. This example is still very simple, but it works  
as a first version. You could launch this and then iterate on the design and make  
improvements over time.  
T he p R O C E S S A N D T R A I N I N g y O U R D E S I gn e ye 109 Once you have a mock-up you like, it’s time for another round  
of testing and sharing the design with friends and family \(cov-  
ered in depth in the next section\) to ensure you’re not missing  
anything crucial before spending time coding the site.  
At this point, you can copy your home page design and build  
mock-ups for the other pages \(such as an About page\), as well  
as mock up what your website will look like on smaller screens  
\(figure 3-15\).  
Figure 3-15\: The mock-up we created,  
altered to show how the design  
would look like on a smaller screen.  
Remember that it’s important that your  
websites be usable and readable on  
smaller screens.  
In the next section we’re going to cover a very important part  
of the design process \(hinted at throughout this section\)  
—  
getting feedback!  
110  
C ha p T E R 3 S E C T I O N 3 . 4  
# GE T TING FEEDBACK  
O N E O F T H E H A R D E S T BU T M O S T C RU C I A L PA RT S of the design  
process is getting feedback on what you’ve designed.  
Unlike programming, there no simple “working” or “not  
working” answer to what you’ve designing. You can’t tell at  
a glance whether your design is successful without getting  
feedback from outside sources. This simple step can be the  
toughest, because we’re all naturally afraid of negative feed-  
back. What if the person hates what we’ve designed? What  
if they find problems?  
A design might feel right to you, but you’re the designer  
—  
you  
know all the ins and outs of the design, how it works, and how  
it should be used because you’re the designer. You’ll only know  
whether those paths and objectives are obvious after showing  
your design to someone else. Your design might be beautiful,  
but you don’t know whether it’ll be appreciated and used until  
you show it to others.  
It’s natural to feel bad if someone discovers something that  
isn’t working. When this happens, look at it as a learning expe-  
rience and try to remember that these pieces of feedback will  
T he p R O C E S S A N D T R A I N I N g y O U R D E S I gn e ye 111 improve your design and teach you something new. Accept  
bad feedback with grace  
—  
there is no need to feel embarrassed  
or insulted. Better to hear bad news early on rather than after  
you launch.  
It’s totally normal to not want negative feedback, but finding  
out where your design can be improved will make your design  
stronger and your experience better in the long run. Detach  
your feelings, steel your will, and find the problems early.  
# Seeing your design with fresh eyes  
Before you take your design to others, give yourself a chance  
to critique your own design. Simply taking a break from your  
design \(a few hours or overnight\) can help you figure out  
potential design issues and problems. This is the easiest way  
of getting feedback, because you’re working with someone  
naturally agreeable  
—  
yourself!  
When you come back to your design, try to distance yourself  
from your designer-self and to embody the potential user. Is  
your design usable? Easy to read and understandable? Is the  
design easy to use and natural feeling? Go through the user  
experience and imagine how the website will be used  
—  
find  
all the “easy” issues as early as possible before you share your  
design with others.  
Another trick for getting a quick fresh look at your design is  
to take a screenshot and flip it horizontally. It’s still the same  
layout, but your brain will lose some of the familiarity with  
the design so it will be easier to be more objective and pick  
out problems.  
112  
C ha p T E R 3Some advice on showing your design to others  
You could take your design to someone else, get a “looks  
great!” in response, pat yourself on the back, and move on with  
your day. But was that really valuable feedback?  
Make sure that you’re clear about what kind of feedback you’re  
looking for. Maybe you’d like help finding problems with  
your design and you’re open to general feedback \(positive or  
negative\) and criticisms, or perhaps you need help choosing  
between two options. Alternatively, you might be 90 percent  
done and only looking for minor tweaks before you publish.  
Give your reviewers careful instructions about what you need  
and plenty of time to look at your work. A quick glance at your  
design isn’t enough, so don’t surprise the reviewer between  
other tasks. Let them have time to really think critically about  
what you have done. Quick responses are more likely to only  
cover superficial issues or be hollow praise.  
If you receive only positive responses, try asking specifically  
for what the reviewer didn’t like. This could prompt a more  
thorough response and also indicates that you’re looking for  
\(rather than avoiding\) negative feedback.  
Keep in mind that when you ask for feedback, you also need  
to judge the feedback that comes in. Talk to more than one  
person, as a problem that comes up only once might not be an  
actual problem. If an issue surfaces over and over, then you’ve  
found something that needs to be fixed.  
Not all feedback has to be implemented. It’s up to you, the  
designer, to figure out the true issues versus the things the  
reviewer mentioned because they wanted to be helpful.  
T he p R O C E S S A N D T R A I N I N g y O U R D E S I gn e ye 113Showing your design to friends and family  
Your friends and family are the friendliest folks you can go  
to for design feedback, for better or for worse. Those that are  
closest to you are the most likely to want to please you and  
may want to give only positive feedback. Here is where it’s  
especially important to make it clear you’re looking for all  
feedback \(positive and negative\).  
It’s great if you can show your designs to folks who match your  
ideal user \(if you’re building a tool for developers, another  
developer friend would be a great tester\), but don’t feel limited  
to that rule  
—  
UX issues could be found by anyone.  
# Showing your design to strangers  
Although significantly harder, showing your design to strangers  
can yield more valuable feedback because they aren’t affected  
by their personal relationships with you.  
Where can you find strangers who might be willing to  
give feedback?  
•  
Hackathons, sprints, and other community events.  
Events and gatherings of like-minded peers are great  
places to get feedback on design work. Ask someone  
politely if they’d be willing to spend 5 to 10 minutes  
reviewing your design.  
•  
Online communities. Forums and communities such as  
Reddit’s design\_critiques subreddit \(*hellobks.com/hwd/85*\)  
and Bootstrapped.fm \(*hellobks.com/hwd/86*\) can help re-  
view mock-ups and early versions of your design. Internet  
anonymity creates a tendency for strangers to be negative,  
so here especially you need to sort the useful feedback  
from the bad. A thick skin is essential.  
114  
C ha p T E R 3 •  
Online review services. There are quite a few online  
services that allow you to upload a screenshot of your  
design to get feedback. One example is Five Second Test  
\(*hellobks.com/hwd/87*\).  
•  
Folks at coffee shops and the like. No hackathons near  
you? You can also try the classic usability test trick  
—  
buy  
a couple of \$5 gift cards to a coffee shop of your choice,  
approach friendly looking strangers, and ask them for  
five minutes of feedback in exchange for the gift card \(or a  
coffee, or something similar\). Approaching a stranger in a  
public place can be scary, but getting a stranger’s feedback  
on your design is so valuable that it’s worth it.  
This step is so easy to skip, especially when you’re adhering  
to the MVP \(minimum viable product\) advice of launching as  
fast as possible, but getting feedback can vastly improve the  
design and usability of your project. You might find an issue  
that could make or break your project launch.  
If getting feedback from others sounds scary, I assure you  
—  
the  
more you do it, the easier it’ll be. Go forth and get feedback on  
what you designed!

# CODING YOUR DESIGN  
I F T H I S B O O K I N C LU D E D CO D E , it would balloon to three times  
the size! But I did want to talk a bit about some coding philoso-  
phy while I have your attention.  
# Don’t worry about being original  
A lot of designers complain that too many websites look  
the same \(figure 3-16\).  
As a beginner designer, don’t worry about being 100 percent orig-  
inal. Use what works! Sometimes the comforting familiarity  
could be an advantage, too.  
When you grow as a designer, you’ll get better at creating  
new and original details. But when you’re starting out, don’t  
fret if your design looks similar to another, like the beautiful  
\(but similar layout\) example sites above. No one gets hurt if  
your design looks similar to something else \(unless you’ve  
used a design verbatim; don’t do that!\). Remember, how your  
design works is more important than how it looks.  
Learn the rules and trends before you break them.  
116  
C ha p T E R 3 Figure 3-16\: Bootstrap is a popular design framework, meaning that a lot of websites  
will have similar-looking layouts. This website makes fun of the trend.  
# Use a CSS framework  
Professional designers and frontend developers often scoff at  
frameworks  
—  
most notably Bootstrap \(*hellobks.com/hwd/5*\),  
but also Skeleton \(*hellobks.com/hwd/7*\), Foundation \(*hellobks*  
*.com/hwd/6*\), or PureCSS \(*hellobks.com/hwd/9*\)  
—  
because they  
constrain your design to fit their plan, often have designs built  
in \(so you’re not creating something unique; same complaint  
as above\), and can bloat your code with unnecessary CSS and  
JavaScript.  
But beginner designers benefit from using a framework. It will  
save you time futzing with CSS, layouts, and best practices. The  
designed pieces that come with a lot of frameworks \(such as  
Bootstrap\) give you a good a place to start from so you don’t  
need to spend a ton of time designing every individual element.  
T he p R O C E S S A N D T R A I N I N g y O U R D E S I gn e ye 117 It’s more important in the beginning to get a design up and  
launched as fast as possible. You can always reduce the size of  
your design code and redesign elements after launch.  
# Remember responsiveness  
We mentioned responsiveness a few times in earlier sections,  
and it comes into play most when it comes time to code up  
your site.  
Nowadays, with all sorts of devices with all sizes of screens  
—  
from  
tiny phone screens to giant monitors  
—  
it’s important for your  
design to work in multiple formats.  
Look into media queries \(*hellobks.com/hwd/89*\) so you can spec-  
ify CSS rules that only apply to one screen size.  
Frameworks usually come with responsive utilities, which  
is another reason why I recommend them. Pay attention to  
what features you can use that’ll help your design, such as  
Bootstrap’s visible/hidden CSS classes so you can show/hide  
elements depending on screen size.  
Before you launch your site, look at your design in a variety of  
formats and make sure the flows that you designed work on  
every size  
—  
your design should work regardless of the medium  
\(figure 3-17\). Coding responsiveness takes a lot of time, but it’s  
important to how well your design works. Don’t forget it!  
# Pay attention to site size  
Beautiful images \(normal and retina\), JavaScript, framework  
code  
—  
before you know it, your website can be slow to down-  
load. Look at where you can trim fat by reducing the size of  
your CSS, images, and JavaScript\: slow downloading will cause  
you to lose visitors \(figure 3-18\).  
118  
C ha p T E R 3 Figure 3-17\: Chrome DevTools \(hellobks.com/hwd/90\) allows you to view your design in  
different sizes in your browser  
—  
no need to have the actual device to view compatibility.  
Figure 3-18\: Chrome DevTools also shows you loading times for your website, so you can  
see what has the potential to slow down the loading of your site.  
T he p R O C E S S A N D T R A I N I N g y O U R D E S I gn e ye 119Use analytics  
Don’t just launch a design and forget about it  
—  
look at how  
well it’s doing after launch. Is your bounce rate \(the percent-  
age of visitors who leave your site immediately after viewing\)  
high? Is no one viewing your About page? Critiquing design  
can be hard because it’s very qualitative, relying on gut in-  
stincts and personal preference. Adding data through analyt-  
ics can help you make more quantitative design decisions.  
The gold standard in analytics is Google Analytics \(*hellobks*  
*.com/hwd/48*\), but there other analytics packages you can use  
instead. One option is Segment \(*hellobks.com/hwd/49*\), which  
allows you to tie in other analytics services, including Google  
Analytics and also Mixpanel \(*hellobks.com/hwd/91*\), and others.  
Congratulations on finishing this chapter! I’ve taken a lot of  
information and distilled it down into smaller, hopefully more  
manageable chunks. I hope at this point in the book you feel  
more confident about making design decisions and planning,  
prototyping, and building your designs.

# REASSURANCES  
Dear reader\: I have been working on design and websites for  
around 20 years now and, without fail, this is my mental dia-  
logue on every new project\:  
“crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap  
crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap  
crap crap crap . . . yes!”  
Sometimes it’s not a “yes!”  
—  
sometimes it’s a “maybe?” But the  
initial “crap” is always, always there.  
Design work may never feel easy, especially when you first  
start out. Your first sketches and mock-ups are more likely to  
feel terrible than good. Designing, unlike programming, is so  
qualitative rather than quantitative  
—  
we rely on our gut to tell  
us whether something looks and feels right; you will likely  
think that your first pieces of work are not working right.  
Welcome to designing!  
This isn’t meant to be discouraging  
—  
instead, I hope you  
remember that when you’re working on a new design and it  
123 doesn’t feel like it’s going well, you’re going through the same  
process as every other designer. Through iteration, inspira-  
tion, research, and work, your design will improve.  
When you’re thinking these thoughts, you’re not a bad  
designer  
—  
you’re a designer.  
Don’t give up, and keep working. I know you can do it! You’ll  
get better from iteration to iteration, new design work to new  
design work.
