Woodwork Institute of California Foreword to the Second Edition  
I am honored and delighted that the three coauthors, who collectively  
have over 100 years of experience in interior design education and  
practice, have asked me to write a foreword to the second edition of  
this great resource.  
Over the years, I have come to realize that the best interiors are the  
end result of a creative process that, at some point, must involve the  
collection and integration of a tremendous amount of practical infor-  
mation and technical data.  
When the first edition of *Time Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
*and Space Planning* was published a decade ago, it immediately  
served as a comprehensive and well-organized resource for such  
information and data and soon became the must-have reference for  
designers of the interior environment.  
This second edition is even more comprehensive than the first, with  
over 500 more pages. It contains sharper graphics, CADD-generated  
details, color representations of wood and marble finishes, as well as  
new and expanded sections including retail design, hospitality  
design, health care facilities, and conference centers. The section  
dealing with office spaces now includes additional information and  
planning data for the design of videoconferencing facilities. In addi-  
tion, an entirely new section on the ADA has also been added that  
provides an analysis of the various federal legislation that impacts  
accessibility. Also included are related detailed design guidelines.  
This very successful new edition reflects the increasing professional-  
ism of the interior design field and the ever growing acknowledg-  
ment that interior design is a serious subject affecting the health,  
safety, and welfare of the public. There is no doubt that interior  
designers, architects, facility managers, design educators, and design  
students will find the new *Time Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
*and Space Planning* indispensable.

*xiii*This page intentionally left blankForeword to the First Edition  
A resource of incredible range and detail, this volume was compiled  
by three remarkably inspired designers and educators. Because of  
their great knowledge of interior design and their sensitivity to the  
subject matter, they have created the most comprehensive source-  
book for the field ever.  
The editors spent three years bringing this volume to fruition, culling  
the best project drawings by outstanding designers to illustrate much  
of the subject matter and tapping their own anthropometric expertise  
to address space planning and special function areas. They also  
address the importance of historic influence on present-day design  
with an impressive review of period furniture and interior details. All  
of these things have produced a reference work of such scope and  
inclusiveness that the reader will be relieved of many hours in the  
pursuit of details and information, time saved that can be used for  
more innovation and creativity in developing solutions for client  
needs.  
The authority and abundance of this book are a testimony to the mat-  
uration of this profession of ours and to the editors’ appreciation and  
understanding of its importance.  
My pleasure in being invited to write part of the Foreword swiftly  
changed to respect and, in turn, awe at the scope and depth of this  
book.  
To say that it is an encyclopedic compilation and mass of information  
is obvious. But it is especially and uniquely user-friendly. It presents  
the written and illustrative data without a trace of pedantry; it meets  
a real need in our interior designer professional resources. The edi-  
tors’ effort, dedication, and patience, sustained during a period of  
over three years, are truly heroic. An astonishing number of hours of  
input have produced a reference of incalculable value.  
I offer the same cautionary advice mentioned in the Preface\: If the  
book is a wonderfully comprehensive reference and support for inte-  
rior design standards, historical material, suggested plan and design  
criteria, and regulatory limitations, it is not—it will never be—a sub-  
stitute for the inspired, creative design act, for imaginative solutions  
are always driven by new cultural conditions, programs, and func-  
tional requirements.  
So to all you designers\: Continue to spin your dreams, but do not  
stray far from this great resource.  
Jack Lowery, FASID, IDEC

*xv*This page intentionally left blankPreface to the Second Edition  
Several significant changes have been incorporated into this second  
edition. Section 1 has been expanded to include two entirely new sub-  
sections entitled “Banking Spaces” and “Health Care Spaces.” The  
existing subsection entitled “Hospitality Spaces” has been almost  
doubled in size and expanded to include planning data and layouts rel-  
ative to hotels and conference centers. The subsection entitled “Retail  
Spaces” has also been more than doubled in size. The subsection enti-  
tled “Office Spaces” has been expanded to include additional work-  
station configurations and planning criteria for videoconferencing  
facilities. For the first time in a professional handbook of this type,  
color has been introduced in the form of color plates of wood veneers  
and marble finishes. The entire book has also been expanded by more  
than 500 pages.  
Perhaps the most significant change, however, is the addition of a  
major section dealing with accessible design, including the Ameri-  
cans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\) requirements and related illustrated  
accessibility guidelines and legislation. It should be noted that many  
of the drawings throughout this book may not, in fact, conform to the  
requirements of the ADA for a number of reasons, as follows\:  
• The ADA requirements apply mostly to public accommodations,  
while many of the details in the various sections of this book may  
be used in other types of spaces.  
• In certain situations, such as minor alterations to existing spaces  
and/or when conformance is simply not feasible, nonconforming  
details may be used.  
• Projects located in foreign countries do not require conformance  
to the ADA.  
Accordingly, the reader is advised that, in such cases where confor-  
mance to the ADA is required, Section 5 of this book be consulted in  
order to ensure conformance. The reader is also cautioned that the  
ADA is to some extent a work in progress and always subject to inter-  
pretation, challenges, and changes. Moreover, conditions impacting  
negatively on accessibility continue to be brought to the attention of  
the U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board  
and new design guidelines developed and added. It is essential, there-  
fore, that the designer keep abreast of these ongoing changes to the  
law.

*xvii*This page intentionally left blankPreface to the First Edition  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design and Space Planning* is a  
professional handbook dealing with the planning, design, and detail-  
ing of interior spaces. Its primary goal is to provide, within a single  
reference, information that typically is found dispersed throughout a  
multitude of sources, including manufacturers’ catalogs, technical  
literature, books dealing with historic styles, and documents and  
drawings from various projects.  
This handbook can be used by the small and medium-size interior  
design or architectural firm to establish an instant reference library of  
design data and details by providing a broad selection of detail types  
and techniques. In addition, the large firm will be able to substan-  
tially augment and modify an existing library of details.  
Perhaps the most unique feature of this handbook is the vast array of  
construction and woodwork details reproduced directly from actual  
working drawings contributed by some of the nation’s leading inte-  
rior design and architectural firms. It is this that makes the handbook  
particularly useful to the interior designer, architect, and student  
alike.  
This book consists of five sections. The first, entitled “Planning and  
Design of Interior Spaces,” deals with residential, office, hospitality,  
and retail spaces in terms of the relevant planning, design, and detail-  
ing data specifically associated with each. The second section, enti-  
tled “Construction Details and Finishes,” deals with various basic  
interior construction components associated with most interior  
spaces. These components include partitions, wall openings, wall  
finishes, floors and floor finishes, doors, ceilings, stairs, fireplaces,  
and lighting. Details relevant to each component have been con-  
tributed by practicing interior designers and architects as well as  
manufacturers.  
The third section, entitled “Architectural Woodwork,” deals with  
standard joinery and casework details, customized woodwork  
details, cornices and moldings, and furniture hardware. The fourth  
section, entitled “Specialties,” deals with various specialized areas of  
equipment, systems, furnishings, and decoration, including signage  
and graphics, audiovisual systems, window treatments, and acces-  
sories. Information for these subject areas is drawn from manufac-  
turers, suppliers, and designers.  
The sixth section, entitled “General Reference Data,” provides the  
most comprehensive set of time-saving reference materials found in  
handbooks of this type, including tables, charts, formulas, and plan-  
ning guidelines. Of particular interest to the architect, interior  
designer, and facility manager are tables that can be easily used to  
determine carpet and wall covering yardage. Charts and drawings  
relative to human factors and planning standards are also provided.  
It should be noted that since the details and other information pre-  
sented in this book have been compiled from so many different  
sources, it is difficult to ensure that all the data are entirely accurate  
or appropriate; for example, in some instances planning guidelines  
may reflect minimum acceptable standards and not necessarily ideal  
or preferred standards. In other instances the details indicated may  
have been perfectly adequate in the context of the total building  
design of which they were a part, but they may well require modifi-  
cation to reflect design conditions and the reader’s intended use. It  
should also be noted that building codes, fire safety regulations,  
barrier-free standards, and many other laws governing the design and  
construction of buildings vary from state to state. Accordingly, the  
reader should consult all applicable local, state, and federal codes for  
conformance prior to applying any of the information contained in  
this book. Moreover, the reader is cautioned that the dimensional  
information provided in connection with furniture, equipment, appli-  
ances, accessories, and so on, has been obtained from manufacturers  
and technical literature and thus varies from supplier to supplier and  
from source to source. Certain items may have been discontinued,  
others modified, and still others replaced. Although every effort has  
been made to ensure the reasonableness of the information, the  
reader is cautioned to consult the manufacturer of the item specified  
for current dimensional data.  
The reader is also advised that most drawings and other illustrative  
material have been enlarged or reduced for reasons of page layout  
and page size. The reader is cautioned, therefore, to disregard any  
scale designations and not to scale the drawings in order to determine  
any additional dimensional information.  
Finally, as mentioned before, the plans and details contained in this  
book were extracted from complete sets of actual working drawings  
prepared by many different contributors. They were selected both  
because they were representative of typical situations faced by the  
designer of interior spaces and because they were particularly  
informative. The authors would like to underscore the fact that these  
plans and details, as well as all the other material presented in this  
book, are intended to serve only as a helpful point of departure in  
connection with the design process, and not as a substitute for origi-  
nal thinking and creativity.  
Although every effort has been made to present reasonably accurate  
information, the editors and publisher assume no liability or respon-  
sibility for damage to persons or property alleged to have occurred as  
a direct or indirect consequence of the use and application of any of  
the contents of this book. The reader is advised to view the subject  
matter primarily as guidelines for preliminary planning and detail-  
ing, and to properly review, modify, and process it to ensure confor-  
mance with local codes and practices and appropriateness of  
applicability.

# SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY AMERICAN\: COLONIAL  
Furniture made in America during the Early Colonial period  
\(the seventeenth century and the first quarter of the eighteenth  
century\) was necessarily, and possibly also by choice, of the sim-  
plest type. The early colonists, particularly those in New England,  
had not time or equipment to spare for any but the essentials of  
life.  
Turning on the lathe was the simplest to achieve and thus the most  
common form of furniture decoration. It was also a process capable  
of infinite variations of design \(some are shown in Fig. 1\).

Fig. 1 \(Continued\)  
Even the most costly furniture in this Early Colonial period was usu-  
ally of solid wood, unfinished except for stain or waxing. Veneering  
and shellacking, to gain carefully patterned graining and high finish,  
were still unexploited. The pine paneling on the walls might be left  
unfinished, waxed, or painted. Other woods near at hand in the  
forests and so commonly used were oak, birch, maple, and walnut.  
Generally, American work is patterned upon English work of 10 or  
20 years earlier. In Pennsylvania and Delaware, which were settled  
by colonists of Swedish and German descent \(in addition to the  
English\), much of the simple furniture was painted, with its motifs  
transferred from European peasant art.  
In the later years of the Early Colonial period, when New Englanders  
were already beginning to trade with the Orient, much Chinese porce-  
lain was imported. The oriental influence was strong in textiles; the  
Tree of Life pattern was very popular at this period. Native textiles  
copied the patterns and colors of India, Persia, and China. The origi-  
nals, or good copies of them, were usually imported from England.

The colors in common use were of a piece with the solid, sturdy fur-  
niture. They seldom escaped from the conventional round of blue,  
red, gold, and natural gray. The only exceptions were imported fab-  
rics and the occasional hard brilliance of the Chinese porcelain found  
in the great houses of the day. Whatever luxury there was at this time  
expressed itself in textiles and silver rather than in furniture. Settlers  
in the South, many of them English aristocrats, maintained a higher  
standard of comfort than those in the North; they imported most of  
their furniture and fabrics from England and continued to do so for a  
long time.  
Early Colonial furniture taken as a whole is sturdy, but not subtle.  
Furniture patterns in this country changed slowly. Paneling relieved  
the larger flat areas such as cupboard doors and drawer fronts. The  
latter were further decorated by quite elaborate fretted brass and  
wrought-iron hardware \(see Fig. 1\).  
More carefully embellished than the earliest American furniture  
were the pieces imported by the colonists from their various home-  
lands. These pieces, and the memories of others left behind, later  
served as models for American craftsmen. The dominant influence

was Dutch, for the English had a Hollander, William of Orange, as  
king. He and his queen, Mary, gave their names to a style of which  
elaborate stretchers \(particularly on highboys, lowboys, and occa-  
sional tables\) and scrolled legs are among the most obvious charac-  
teristics.  
Also from Dutch, Spanish, and Portuguese sources are derived most  
of the carved feet which distinguish this Early Colonial furniture and  
often give clues to its date and place of origin.  
# EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY AMERICAN\: COLONIAL  
Whereas furniture of the Early Colonial period was often so primitive  
as to be referred to as “kitchen Colonial,” in this succeeding era dig-  
nity and luxury prevail in the centers of taste. The furnishings reflect  
the fashionable contemporary styles of England and stately country  
homes, whether on New England farms or Virginia and Carolina plan-  
tations, followed these styles. This gave rise to a number of notable  
architects, craftsmen, and workers in metal and wood.

The eighteenth-century Colonial period was the first of the really  
great eras in American cabinetmaking.  
The manufacture of wallpaper in this country was begun by 1763.  
Before this it was from Europe. The “Pennsylvania fireplace” or  
“Franklin stove” was invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1742 and  
immediately became popular up and down the Atlantic seaboard.  
Philadelphia was a furniture style center—in fact, the most active in  
the creation of taste—with Boston and Charleston following.  
A number of artists and craftsmen of this period bear mentioning.  
Among the architects were Samuel McIntire, Charles Bulfinch, John  
James, Richard Mundy, Peter Harrison, John Kirk, and Isaac Royall.  
These men were greatly influenced by the English architects Isaac  
Ware, James Gibbs, Robert Morris, Abraham Swan, William Half-  
penny, Batty Langley, and William Pain, who in turn were in debt to  
the Italian masters Palladio and Giacomo Leoni. Among the cabinet-  
makers were Moses Dodge, Stephen Dwight, Henry Hardcastle,  
Gilbert Ash, Robert Wallace, Charles Shipman, John Brinner, John  
Tremain, Charles Warham, John Brown, Bemsley Wells, Thomas  
and Benjamin Laskey, Jonathan Goodhue, and Job Trask. Among the  
upholsterers were Stephen Callow, Richard Wenman, Joseph Cox,  
and John Taylor; among the metalworkers were William Coffin,  
Wilkins, Joseph Liddell, William Bradford, John Bassett, and Peter  
Harby; and among the painters were John Singleton Copley, Joseph  
Blackburn, John Ramage, James Peale, and Charles Wilson Peale.  
Important manufacturers were, of wallpaper, Jackson of Battersea  
\(England\) and, of window and bottle glass, Baron Stiegel and Caspar  
Wistar.  
Fabrics most commonly used during the Colonial period were damask,  
camblet, Indian gimp and binding, moreen \(woolen drapery cloth\),  
harrateen cloth, block-printed cotton and linen, cashmere, calico, dim-  
ity, durance, stout worsted cloth, turkey work \(tufted “pilelike”\), padu-

asoy \(strong silk\), soy, shalloon, watchet, linsey-woolsey, fustian, silk  
muslin, chintz, Indian calico, tabby, sarcanet, taffeta, horsehair, camak,  
bancours, and brocade.  
Woods most commonly used were oak, ash, elm, red cedar, mahogany,  
walnut, maple, pine, and cherry.  
The Chippendale style merges at one end with Queen Anne, at the  
other with Hepplewhite, Sheraton, and Duncan Phyfe. The Rococo  
mounts to its zenith and starts to decline within these years. Walnut  
has a new rival in mahogany. And American craftsmen produced  
pieces of a quality which compares favorably with English work.  
Marble was imported until after the Revolution, when domestic mar-  
bles began to be used. Marble chimney pieces, window sash, lead  
roofing, and hardware were all imported from London. The size of  
glass window panes gradually increased as the century progressed.  
An order of small pilasters or columns supporting the mantel  
in a chimney piece was found only in imported work prior to the

Revolution. Fireplace openings with neither cornice nor mantel  
shelf were long common. Ears on the architraves were almost uni-  
versal, and a pediment \(always broken\) was very common. After  
1760 the scroll pediment, or a similar treatment of the architrave,  
occurs.  
# EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY AMERICAN\: FEDERAL  
The Federal style is at its most suave and elegant in the furniture  
of Duncan Phyfe, a Scottish cabinetmaker who arrived in New  
York about 1795. He did not originate a style; he translated pre-  
vailing fashions into fine craftsmanship. Thomas Sheraton, then  
the current English favorite, and the French Directoire cabinet-  
makers set the style. All these designers were profoundly in-  
fluenced by a rediscovery of the classic splendors of Greece and  
Italy.  
Reeding of table, chair, and sofa legs and other framing members  
gives elegance to Federal furniture. Contrasting color veneer is used  
to outline the edges of tables and desks and to lend interest to large,

18th Century American\: Federal

plain surfaces. Another characteristic subtlety is the raised hairline of  
wood, known as a cock beading, which is used to finish off the edges  
of drawers. Phyfe used white wood linings for the drawers in his fur-  
niture, instead of the pine linings universally employed by other  
American cabinetmakers of this period.  
Brass ornaments \(probably for the most part imported\) are used  
extensively on Federal pieces. They have brass feet and casters, ring  
handles, and other types of applied ornament. Toward the end of the  
period, about 1825, china and glass knobs began to supplant brass  
rings as drawer pulls.  
The new United States was in its first throes of nationalism; conse-  
quently, its emblem, the eagle, appears everywhere—on transparen-  
cies in windows, painted on fans, and inlaid in mirrors, desks, knife  
boxes, and brass work. The “spread eagle” became a favorite tavern  
sign. All kinds of historic scenes and patriotic emblems appear as  
decoration on clocks.  
And yet, the Classic influence was even stronger than the patriotic.  
Earthenware and porcelain such as Crown-Derby, Worcester, and  
Wedgwood were molded in Classic forms and painted with delicate  
sepia figures in Classic robes. Silver and Sheffield plate \(the latter  
replacing pewter\) also followed Classic forms. Ireland sent Water-  
ford glass.  
Fabrics most used were damask, brocade, satin, taffeta, haircloth,  
toile de Jouy, printed cotton, and silk.

Woods most used were mahogany, cherry, and maple, and fruit  
woods in less splendid furniture. Curly maple often replaced the sat-  
inwood used in European models. After 1800, rosewood was used for  
the more costly furniture.  
The Federal motifs derive almost exclusively from classical  
sources. The acanthus leaf, the lyre, the saber leg, the lion’s mask  
and paw, the bowknot, rosettes, thunderbolts, trumpets, and drapery  
swags are all to be found on the list of standard Federal furniture  
motifs.  
After the War of 1812, when the Federal era rose to its zenith of pop-  
ularity, the laurel, cornucopia, and eagle motifs became especially  
popular. \(See Fig. 2.\)  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 13* Residential Spaces

Fig. 2 \(Continued\)  
Phyfe’s treatment of the acanthus leaf is so typical that many of his  
pieces depend upon this for their identification. It is simplified into a  
series of rounded grooves and ridges, with a raised tapering ridge up  
the center.  
The lyre was used to fill in the backs of chairs, to decorate the arms  
of sofas, and \(split apart\) to support mirrors on dressing tables. Two  
crossed lyres are used as support for a pedestal table.  
# EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLISH\: GEORGIAN  
Thomas Chippendale was a dominating factor in the history of  
Georgian furniture design and his name serves as a convenient tag  
for the period centering in the reign of the second of the three  
Georges who provide the period title. Yet this English cabinetmaker  
achieved eminence not so much by his own work as by that of his  
copyists.  
*14*

They all used the designs in *The Gentleman and Cabinet-Makers’*  
*Director,* published by Chippendale in 1754. To fill this book, Chip-  
pendale commandeered all the ideas he could lay his hands on and  
then embroidered them with his own fancy, adapted them to his own  
forms. He plundered the design manuals of China and the French  
Rococo, of the ancient Gothic masters, and of his immediate prede-  
cessors in the English furniture trade.  
From the craftsmen of the early eighteenth century Chippendale bor-  
rowed such tested forms as the cabriole leg, the claw-and-ball foot,  
and the typical acanthus leaf ornament. But to each of them he added  
a grace and charm of which the earlier furniture makers had never  
been capable.  
Chippendale was a typical product of that brilliant English society  
which flourished during the mid–eighteenth century. He was a con-  
temporary of Josiah Wedgwood, the potter, and of Edmund Burke,  
the orator. Boswell and Johnson, Benjamin Franklin, Garrick, Gib-  
bon, and Goldsmith, all added their wit and intelligence to the cre-  
ation of a sturdy culture.

Thomas Chippendale served their changing taste and their fashion-  
able whims. In his later years he was engaged in making furniture of  
classic, elegant simplicity for the brothers Adam. His earlier work to  
his own designs, his love of gilt and gaudy color, his fascination with  
the exotic—all typical of the age in which he lived—suggest that he  
might have made a brilliant stage designer.  
Chippendale is the first personality in the history of furniture style.  
This was due less to his fine craftsmanship than to his ability as a  
publicist. He was the first cabinetmaker to publish a book of furniture  
designs. The influence of his *Director* was particularly strong in  
Philadelphia, but the American cabinetmakers usually simplified his  
exuberant ornament to suit their clients’ taste and their workers’ skill  
*16*

Fig. 3 Motifs characteristic of Georgian furniture  
in carving. For it must be remembered that many of the published  
designs were too complex for reproduction in the solid, even by the  
most highly skilled English carvers. Such designs were intended for  
inspiration only.  
The introduction of mahogany about 1725 was a fundamental influ-  
ence on furniture design. Rosewood was another material in favor.  
Pine was used for paneling and also for intricate carving as, for  
example, on mirror frames. In the latter case it was usually gilt.  
Amboyna was occasionally used, mostly for inlays. But the consid-  
erable use of inlay is not found until the late Georgian period.  
From China come the rectangular leg and an infinite variety of fretted  
ornament, as well as the more obviously oriental pagoda forms. From  
the France of Louis XV come the elaborate combinations of foliated  
C and S scrolls so typical of the Rococo style of ornament. These  
came to a lush flowering in furniture hardware and gilt mirror frames.  
Serpentine fronts and sides broke down even the solid rectangular

and tables. \(For typical profiles and decorative motifs see Fig. 3.\)  
Romance was sought in the past as well as the East; the pointed  
Gothic arch and burgeoning crockets turn up in all kinds of furniture  
and decoration.  
# EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLISH\: LATE GEORGIAN  
Chippendale went for inspiration to Chinese and Gothic decoration.  
The great designers of the later Georgian period—the brothers  
Adam, George Hepplewhite, and Thomas Sheraton—were entranced  
by the recently discovered Classic glories of Pompeii and Hercula-  
neum, and by the slim prettiness in vogue at the French court.  
The motifs most characteristic of the later Georgian period \(see Fig.  
4\) are all of Classic origin\: acanthus leaf and honeysuckle, ram’s  
head, winged griffin and lion, laurel, and garland.  
Characteristic of this period is the perfect coordination between archi-  
tects, painters, and furniture designers. The four Adam brothers—John,  
Robert, James, and William, who trademarked themselves the Adelphi  
*18*

Fig. 3 \(Continued\)  
\(Greek for brothers\)—were Scots by birth, architects by profession.  
They did not consider their job at an end when they had designed the  
shell of a house. Every detail of furnishing, decoration, and lighting was  
especially designed by the Adams to give a rounded effect. Nothing  
was too small or unimportant to deserve their attention. The best crafts-  
men would then be employed to carry out their designs. Chippendale  
and Hepplewhite, perhaps Sheraton also, made furniture for the Adams.  
All these designers followed Chippendale’s lead by publishing  
design handbooks for the use of other less experienced and less  
imaginative craftsmen in this country and in the English provinces  
outside London. Here is seen the changing fashion\: lowboys are  
being supplanted by dressing tables, highboys by wardrobes. Color  
and inlay become more popular than carving, with Sheraton as the  
champion of inlay against painting.  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 19* Residential Spaces  
PERIOD FURNITURE  
18th Century English\: Late Georgian  
Fig. 3 \(Continued\)  
Hepplewhite’s work is usually characterized by his affection for  
curves, Sheraton’s by a preference for straight lines. This was proba-  
bly because Hepplewhite was more strongly influenced than Shera-  
ton by contemporary French work, which was enlivened by a  
profusion of delicate curves. Of particular interest in Sheraton’s work  
are his designs for ingenious folding and multipurpose furniture such  
as folding beds, combined bookcases and washstand, and couches  
that folded up to become tables. These were designed for use in those  
bedrooms which were now doubling as parlors during the day.  
This later Georgian period has often been labeled the Age of Satin-  
wood. All the designers eagerly exploited the possibilities of veneer-  
ing and inlay with woods such as satinwood and amboyna, ebony,  
sycamore, holly, kingwood, and lime. Ivory and brass inlay were  
often used to mark key plates.  
Some of these motifs \(the acanthus leaf, for example\) had been in use  
by English designers for more than half a century. But now, reintro-  
duced from Italy by means of measured drawings, they take on a

fresh elegance. Italian painters were brought in—Pergolesi, Zucchi,  
and Cipriani—to provide the background of decoration. Angelica  
Kaufmann, a Swiss, filled their wreathed panels with neo-Classic  
figures.  
Yet the solid tradition of English craftsmanship remained intact  
beneath all these changing fashions. The basic proportions remain  
almost inviolate. Hepplewhite attempted \(in his own words\) “to unite  
elegance with utility, and to blend the useful with the agreeable.”  
# LATE EIGHTEENTH- TO EARLY NINETEENTH-  
# CENTURY FRENCH\: DIRECTOIRE AND EMPIRE  
The Directoire was France’s recovery period after the shock of a six-  
year revolution. The Directoire, established in 1795, lasted only a  
brief four years, but this was long enough for the designers to sketch  
in the outlines of a new style. Those outlines were to be filled in later  
as Directoire merged into Empire; these are but two stages in a single  
style.  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 21* Residential Spaces  
PERIOD FURNITURE  
Late 18th–Early 19th Century French\: Directoire and Empire  
Fig. 4 \(Continued\)  
With the rise of Napoleon to absolute power, the delicate style of the  
Directoire was taken over and developed “for the good of the State.”  
It was to be made into a French national style thoroughly imbued  
with the political principles which were to guide the new state.  
Imperial Rome was found to provide the dignity and impressiveness  
required in the prototype, so all the imperial symbols were converted  
to use. The symmetrical shapes of heavy proportion were taken over  
unchanged, copied in wood instead of being reproduced in stone or  
bronze.  
Most pieces displayed large surfaces of highly polished wood, usu-  
ally mahogany. They were not, as a rule, decorated by molding or  
paneling, or even by carving. Ornamentation was almost always  
applied or inlaid. Most typically it took the form of gilded bas reliefs  
tacked to the smooth wood surfaces. Painted decoration was more  
commonly used on walls and ceilings than for furniture.  
The general color scheme is rich, dark, and somewhat heavy. Rich,  
deep mahogany, French polished and often stained red, was the  
favorite material. Rosewood and ebony were also in favor. Where

other woods were used, their nature was concealed by staining to  
imitate the more popular species.  
Round tables were popular. They usually stood on a pedestal or tri-  
pod vase. The top was commonly of porphyry or marble. Beds  
developed into Classic ceremonial couches with scrolled ends. The  
popular craze for all things Roman extended to include women’s  
dresses and Lucullan banquets.  
In the early \(Directoire\) part of the period, fabrics were quite deli-  
cately colored, the decorative motifs still possessed some Grecian  
delicacy of form, and much of the furniture was painted and gilt.  
Later, under Napoleon’s fist, fabrics were usually in deep primary  
colors, the motifs of Imperial Roman heaviness, the furniture of dark  
red polished mahogany.  
From each of his campaigns he brought home some new decorative  
motif, which he would turn over to his craftsmen for use in the next  
batch of furniture made to his order.  
The Egyptian campaign yielded an impressive collection of sphinxes,  
pyramids, obelisks, and lotus leaf capitals. From Italy came all the

paraphernalia of Imperial Roman decoration—acanthus leaves, laurel  
wreaths, torches, winged victories, cornucopias, and the rest, includ-  
ing the famous wreath of bees Napoleon is usually accused of having  
appropriated from the arms of an old Italian family, the Barberini.  
The early Empire pieces \(Directoire\) are simplified versions of the  
styles current under Louis XVI. These pieces have grace, simplicity,  
and charm. The hampering restrictions on foreign trade led to the use  
of native fruitwoods instead of mahogany.

Bed/Mattress Types and Sizes  
Fig. 1  
# BED/MATTRESS TYPES AND SIZES  
Figure 1 provides the designer with an array of typical bed and mat-  
tress sizes with which rooms can be planned. Tables 1 and 2, how-  
ever, suggest that within the bedding and mattress industries there  
exists a wide range of sizes from which to select. Many manufac-  
turers use bed/mattress terminology that reflects different dimen-  
sional standards than those of other manufacturers. Ultimately,  
the designer, in consultation with the client, must verify exact  
measurements. Be sure to take your clients to see and test the bed  
or mattress selected. After all, they are the ones who will have to  
sleep on it.  
# WATERBEDS, SOFA BEDS/CONVERTIBLE SOFAS, AND  
# WALL BEDS  
# TELEVISION VIEWING AREAS  
The shape of the viewing area is approximately as shown in Fig. 2.  
Its size is always based on the size of the image to be viewed. The  
human eye comprehends detail only within a limited cone angle  
\(about 21⁄2 minutes of arc\), and the length of chord subtending this  
arc—that is, the image of width—varies with its distance from the  
observer. Thus an object 20 ft away and 6 ft long appears the same as  
a similar object 10 ft away and 3 ft long. The size of the viewing area  
is determined by three dimensions\:  
• The maximum viewing angle \(3\), which is the angle between the  
projection axis and the line of sight of a person located as far  
from this axis as he or she can be and still see all image detail in  
proper brilliance  
• The minimum distance \(1\), which is the distance from the near-  
est part of the image to the eye of the closest viewer  
• The maximum distance \(2\), which is the distance from the fur-  
thermost part of the image to the most distant viewer

Furniture Arrangements

# LIVING ROOMS  
# FURNITURE ARRANGEMENTS  
The sizes of living rooms and the furniture arrangements contained  
within such spaces vary dramatically, depending on the size of  
the dwelling, the economic status and lifestyle of the user, and the  
relationship of the room to other areas of the dwelling. With regard  
to the luxury end of the scale, there are few limitations and no  
attempt has been made to identify the endless planning options pos-  
sible. There are, however, minimum requirements and basic plan-  
ning considerations that are applicable whatever the size of the  
space.  
# Minimum Requirements  
A living room for a three- or four-bedroom dwelling unit requires  
more space for its occupants than one for a one- or two-bedroom  
dwelling unit. Luxury units will necessarily need more space to  
accommodate more furnishings. In any case, the minimum living  
room with no dining facilities should be approximately 180 ft2 but  
preferably around 200 ft2. Figures 1 and 2 show two living rooms  
with typical furniture groupings \(no dining facilities\).  
Figure 3 shows a living room with one end used for dining. This area  
often is arranged in an “L” shape to achieve greater definition or pri-  
vacy from the living activities. Dwelling units with three or more bed-  
rooms should have separate dining rooms or clearly defined dining  
areas.  
The minimum width of a living room should be 11 to 12 ft. This is  
extremely tight, however, and if at all possible the width should be at  
least 14 ft.

apartment \(12.5 ft × 20 ft, 250 ft2\)

Circulation  
# Planning Considerations  
Planning considerations should include adequate floor and wall  
space for furniture groupings, separation of trafficways from centers  
of activity, and ease of access to furniture and windows.  
Circulation within the living room should be as direct as possible and  
yet not interfere with furniture placement. Ideally, there should be no  
through traffic. If such traffic is necessary, it should be at one end,  
with the remaining portion of the room a dead-end space.  
During social activities, people tend to gather or congregate in rela-  
tively small groups. Desirable conversation distance is also relatively  
small, approximately 10 ft in diameter.  
When the living room is combined with the dining area, the dining  
area should be offset into an alcove or be clearly identified as an  
entity in itself.  
# CIRCULATION  
# FURNITURE CLEARANCES  
Figures 5 to 10 show various groupings and related clearances. Fig-  
ure 5 shows that a space 12 ft 6 in × 15 ft 6 in should be provided  
in order to accommodate seating for five around a 56-in-diameter  
cocktail table. The piano, sofa, and cocktail table arrangement  
shown in Fig. 6 requires a space at least 11 ft 0 in × 16 ft 0 in. Fig-  
ure 7 suggests that a space at least 12 ft 9 in × 13 ft 3 in is required  
to accommodate a grouping to seat six or seven persons, while Fig.  
8 indicates that a corner arrangement for two requires a space at  
least 6 ft 3 in × 6 ft 6 in.  
When planning furniture arrangements, allowances for clearances  
should take into account the human dimension as well, as illustrated  
in Figs. 9 and 10.  
It should be noted that these diagrams are not intended as models for  
complete living room layouts. They are intended only as guidelines  
to illustrate minimum clearances for preliminary planning purposes.

drawings for the designer’s approval. Since at least two trades are  
involved, coordination of the trades by the contractor and a thorough  
review of the shop drawings by both contractor and designer are  
essential. It is important, also, that modifications conform with all  
applicable codes. The extent of hearth extension, the materials used,  
and the distance of combustible materials from the firebox are among  
the numerous items governed by codes.

# Spatial Characteristics and Arrangement  
*Requirement*  
Each living unit should contain space for the purpose of dining. This  
area may be combined with the living room or kitchen, or it may be  
a separate room.  
*Criterion*  
The amount of space allocated to dining should be based on the num-  
ber of persons to be served and the proper circulation space. Appropri-  
ate space should be provided for the storage of china and large dining  
articles, either in the dining area itself or in the adjacent kitchen.  
Space for accommodating the following sizes of tables and chairs in  
the dining area should be provided, according to the intended occu-  
pancy, as shown\:  
*1 or 2 persons\:* 2 ft 6 in × 2 ft 6 in  
*4 persons\:* 2 ft 6 in × 3 ft 2 in  
*6 persons\:* 3 ft 4 in × 4 ft 0 in or 4 ft 0 in round  
*8 persons\:* 3 ft 4 in × 6 ft 0 in or 4 ft 0 in × 4 ft 0 in  
*10 persons\:* 3 ft 4 in × 8 ft 0 in or 4 ft 0 in × 6 ft 0 in  
*12 persons\:* 4 ft 0 in × 8 ft 0 in  
*Dining chairs\:* 1 ft 6 in × 1 ft 6 in  
*Buffet or storage unit\:* 1 ft 6 in × 3 ft 6 in  
Figures 1 to 6 show the minimum requirements of the U.S. Depart-  
ment of Housing and Urban Development.  
*Commentary*  
The size of the individual eating space on the table should be based  
on a frontage of 24 in and an area of approximately 2 ft2. In addition,  
table space should be large enough to accommodate serving dishes.  
Desirable room for seating is a clear 42 in all around the dining table.  
The following minimum clearances from the edge of the table should

access and passage, 42 in for serving from behind chair, 24 in for pas-  
sage only, 48 in from table to base cabinet \(in kitchen\).  
In sizing the separate dining room, provision should be made for cir-  
culation through the room in addition to space for dining.  
The location of the dining area in the kitchen is desirable for small  
houses and small apartments. This preference appears to stem from  
two needs\: \(1\) housekeeping advantages; \(2\) the dining table in the  
kitchen provides a meeting place for the entire family. Where only  
one dining location is feasible, locating the dining table in the living  
room is not recommended.

# BEDROOMS  
# FURNITURE CLEARANCES AND ARRANGEMENTS  
Most of the clearances and bedroom sizes shown here are minimum  
and intended primarily for preliminary planning purposes. Some  
building codes permit rooms of even smaller sizes, while rooms in  
many private homes and luxury apartments are much larger. More-  
over, in the final analysis, lifestyle, the size and scale of furniture, the  
activities to be accommodated, and barrier-free design are all factors  
that should be taken into account during the design process.  
Ideally, the recommended minimum bedroom size should be 10 ft 0  
in × 12 ft 0 in exclusive of closets, while the recommended minimum  
size for a larger bedroom or master bedroom should be 12 ft 0 in × 16  
ft 0 in exclusive of closets.  
A larger proportion of the bedroom floor area is occupied by furni-  
ture than is the case with any other room; windows and doors  
account for a large percentage of the wall and partition space. These  
two factors complicate the planning of bedrooms, especially when  
the rooms are small.  
Because of the room layout, some bedrooms with smaller areas bet-  
ter meet the needs than larger ones. The location of doors, windows,  
and closets must be properly planned to allow the best placement of  
the bed and other furniture.  
Privacy, both visual and sound, are desirable for the bedroom. Chil-  
dren’s bedrooms should be located away from the living room,  
because conversation in the living room prevents the children from  
sleeping. Closets should be used between all bedrooms wherever  
possible.  
Each child needs a space that is his or her own to develop a sense of  
responsibility and a respect for the property rights of others. The  
ideal plan would provide a bedroom for each child, but since this is  
not always possible, there should be a bed for each.  
The minimum room width shall be determined by the space required  
for the bed, activity space, and any furniture facing the bed. Widths  
less than 9 ft 0 in will usually require extra area to accommodate  
comparable furniture.  
Aside from sleeping, the bedroom is the center of dressing and  
undressing activities. An interrelationship exists between dressing,  
storage of clothes, and the bedroom.  
Inevitably, in a small apartment, it is not only economical but neces-  
sary to plan the use of the bedroom for more than one activity. It is  
essential to incorporate in the bedroom other functions such as relax-  
ation, work, or entertainment.  
A master bedroom should accommodate at least one double bed 4 ft

# PLANNING DATA AND FIXTURE ARRANGEMENTS  
A bathroom should have enough area to accommodate a lavatory, a  
water closet, and a bathtub or shower. Arrangement for fixtures  
should provide for comfortable use of each fixture and permit at least  
90° door swing unless sliding doors are used.  
The bathroom should be convenient to the bedroom zone and accessi-  
ble from the living and work areas. Linen storage should be accessible  
from the bathroom, but not necessarily located within the bathroom.  
Each complete bathroom should be provided with the following\:  
1\. Grab-bar and soap dish at bathtub  
2\. Toilet paper holder at water closet  
3\. Soap dish at lavatory \(may be integral with lavatory\)  
4\. Towel bar  
5\. Mirror and medicine cabinet or equivalent enclosed shelf space  
6\. In all cases where shower head is installed, provide a shower rod  
or shower door  
Each half-bath should be provided with items 2 to 6 from this list.  
# PLANNING DATA  
Figure 1 deals primarily with some of the more critical male anthro-  
pometric considerations. A lavatory height above the floor of 37 to 43  
in, or 94 to 109.2 cm, is suggested to accommodate the majority of  
users. It should be noted, however, that common practice is to locate  
the lavatory in the neighborhood of 31 in above the floor. In order to  
establish the location of mirrors above the lavatory, eye height  
should be taken into consideration.  
Figure 2 explores, in much the same manner, the anthropometric  
considerations related to women and children. Given the great vari-  
ability in body sizes to be accommodated within a single family, a

strong case can be presented for the development of a height adjust-  
ment capability for the lavatory. Until that is developed, there is no  
reason, on custom installations, why the architect or interior designer  
cannot take anthropometric measurements of the client to ensure  
proper interface between the user and the lavatory.

# Tile  
When detailing a ceramic tile wall or ceiling for wet or damp loca-  
tions, it is especially important to consider the performance of the  
entire assembly. Although ceramic tile, adhesives, and grout aren’t  
generally harmed by water, the setting bed and/or structure may be  
susceptible to moisture penetration. Keeping moisture out is usually  
achieved by the appropriate combination of setting bed and water-  
proofing membrane, which is generally either a flexible sheet or a  
trowel-applied system.  
# Flexible Sheets  
The three common types of flexible sheet membranes are tar-saturated  
felt paper \(also called tar paper\), 4-mil polyethylene film, and chlori-  
nated polyethylene \(CPE\) waterproofing sheet. The tar paper and poly-  
ethylene are applied behind the setting bed, so the setting bed must be  
able to withstand exposure to moisture. They are attached with staples,  
either directly to the framing or to a rigid backing. They are the least  
expensive, but also least reliable, waterproofing membranes.  
CPE is laminated to the surface of the setting bed with an appropri-  
ate setting material. CPE sheets are the most expensive waterproof-  
ing membranes, but the most effective, and may allow the use of a  
less expensive setting bed.  
# Trowel-Applied Waterproofing  
Single or multicomponent trowel-applied waterproofing membranes  
are available. The single-component system consists of a liquid or  
paste that cures into a continuous membrane. It is applied to the sur-  
face of the setting bed.  
The multicomponent system is a combination of liquid latex and fab-  
ric applied to the surface of the setting bed. The liquid is first spread  
on the setting bed and the fabric is embedded in it. A second coat of  
liquid is then applied over the fabric.  
Trowel-applied waterproofing typically costs about the same as the  
CPE membrane, but is more versatile and effective in complicated  
installations.

# Accessibility  
It is essential that the design of interior spaces, as well as exterior  
spaces, be responsive to the needs of those having physical disabili-  
ties. There is a proliferation of state and local legislation in this  
regard, and, more recently, federal legislation \(Americans with Dis-  
abilities Act of 1990\) that provides design guidelines and require-  
ments. The designer should become familiar with those codes and  
other requirements in her or his area prior to initiation of design and,  
where possible, go beyond the very minimum standards.  
The design of the bathroom is perhaps one of those areas where the  
interface between the physically disabled and the interior space is the  
most critical. Accordingly, this page and the following pages present  
design guidelines prepared by the Veterans Administration and the  
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Anthropometric Data

# KITCHENS  
# ANTHROPOMETRIC DATA  
The height of a kitchen work counter, the proper clearance between  
cabinets or appliances for circulation, the accessibility to overhead  
or undercounter storage, and proper visibility are among the pri-  
mary considerations in the design of cooking spaces. All must be  
responsive to human dimension and body size if the quality of  
interface between the user and the components of the interior space  
are to be adequate. In establishing clearances between counters, the  
maximum body breadth and depth of the user of larger body size  
must be taken into account as well as the projections of the appli-  
ances. Refrigerator doors, cabinet drawers, dishwashing machine  
doors, and cabinet doors all project to some degree in their open  
position into the space within which the user must circulate and  
must be accommodated.  
Standard kitchen counter heights manufactured are all about 36 in, or  
91.4 cm. But such a height does not necessarily accommodate the  
body dimension of all users for all tasks. Certain cooking activities,  
for example, may be more efficiently performed from a standing  
position, but with a counter height less than 36 in. In overhead cabi-  
nets the upper shelves are usually inaccessible to the smaller person,  
while the lower shelves are usually inaccessible to most without  
bending or kneeling. The logical answer is the development of  
kitchen cabinet systems capable of total adjustability to accommo-  
date the human dimension of the individual user. Such a system  
could accommodate not only those of smaller and larger body size,  
but also elderly and disabled people.  
Figure 1 provides some general anthropometric data for establishing  
basic heights of cabinetry and appliances above the floor. Figures 2  
and 3 show in more detail the interface of the human body and the  
kitchen environment.  
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the clearances related to range centers. Fig-  
ure 2 indicates a minimum clearance between appliances of 48 in, or  
121.9 cm. The anthropometric basis for the clearances are amplified  
in Fig. 3.  
The 40-in, or 101.6-cm, wall oven work zone clearance is adequate  
to accommodate the projected wall oven door, in addition to the max-  
imum body depth dimension of the user. The standing figure shown  
in broken line, however, indicates both dimensionally and graphi-  
cally that the 40-in clearance will not permit comfortable circulation  
when appliances on both sides are in operation at the same time. The  
range work zone clearance, also 40 in, is adequate to accommodate  
the open range door and the body size of the kneeling user.  
An extremely important, but frequently overlooked, anthropometric  
consideration in kitchen design is eye height. In this regard, the dis-  
tance from the top of the range to the underside of the hood should  
allow the rear burners to be visible to the user.

Anthropometric Data

# TYPICAL LAYOUTS  
The U-shaped plan is the most efficient. When not broken, it provides  
the opportunity and floor space for several simultaneous activities.  
The corridor or gallery kitchen is typically accessible from both ends,  
often converting it from a work space to a corridor. It sometimes is  
closed off on one end, thereby creating a variation of the U-shaped  
plan, which, although small, can produce a fairly comfortable kitchen.  
The broken U-shaped plan often results from the necessity of locat-  
ing a door along one or two of the three walls of a typical U-shaped  
scheme. The resulting through traffic reduces the compactness and  
efficiency of the plan.  
The typical L-shaped kitchen allows for the location of a small  
breakfast area in the opposite corner.  
# STORAGE AND CABINETS  
# Kitchen Storage  
Each kitchen or kitchenette should have \(1\) accessible storage space  
for food and utensils, \(2\) sufficient space for the average kitchen  
accessories, and \(3\) sufficient storage space for those items of house-  
hold equipment normally used and for which storage is not elsewhere  
provided.  
# Clearances over Cooking Ranges  
In Fig. 10, dimension A\: 2 ft 6 in minimum clearance between the top  
of the range and the bottom of an unprotected wood or metal cabinet,  
or 2 ft 0 in minimum when the bottom of a wood or metal cabinet is  
protected.  
Dimension B\: 2 ft 0 in minimum when hood projection X is 18 in or  
more, or 1 ft 10 in min. when hood projection X is less than 18 in.  
Dimension C\: not less than width of range or cooking unit.  
Dimension D\: 10-in minimum when vertical side surface extends  
above countertops.  
Dimension E\: when range is not provided by builder, 40-in mini-  
mum.  
Dimension F\: Minimum clearance should be not less than 3 in.  
Cabinet protection should be at least 1⁄4-in asbestos millboard covered  
with not less than 28-gauge sheet metal \(0.015 stainless steel, 0.024  
aluminum, or 0.020 copper\).  
Clearance for D, E, or F should be not less than listed UL or AGA  
clearances.

Storage and Cabinets  
Above a sink, plan for a minimum of 22 in to the bottom of a wall  
cabinet. Since the wall behind a sink often holds a window, measure-  
ment for a cabinet is academic. But if wall space is minimal, a cabi-  
net over the sink makes good sense.  
The use of large pans, pancake flips, and similar cooking maneuvers  
dictate a distance of 30 in between rangetop and wall cabinet bottom.  
A fan mounted in the wall is the means here to exhaust cooking  
fumes to the outside.  
A range of 15 to 18 in is the proper span between standard base and  
wall cabinets. Opt for the 15-in distance if you are 5 ft 4 in or less; a  
wider span if you’re taller. For the highest shelf, 6 ft from the floor is  
a reachable distance.  
Kitchen activities become tiresome in poor light. A single fixture  
centered on the ceiling is insufficient. Your need for light is great-  
est over the work centers. A good light there reduces the danger of  
cutting yourself, eases the task of monitoring color changes during  
a mix, and so on. The best place to install fixtures for this purpose  
is beneath the wall cabinets \(with a shield to prevent glare when  
you’re seated in the kitchen\). A workable alternative is found in fix-  
tures installed in an extended soffit. Plan for light above a rangetop  
and over the sink as well. Choose incandescent deluxe warm white  
or deluxe cool white lamps for the fixtures to avoid poor color ren-  
dition.  
# Utensil and General Storage  
Space for utensils includes storage for dishes, pots and pans, uten-  
sils, and appliances. With the increased use of such electrical appli-  
ances, their storage becomes a significant problem. General storage  
requires space for linens, towels, and kitchen supplies. Included in  
this category are brooms, mops, and other cleaning equipment and  
supplies.

# Ranges and Built-in Ovens  
Freestanding ranges and built-in ovens come in a variety of sizes  
and configurations. Some of the larger ranges consist of mod-  
ular cooktops providing anywhere from two to seven heating ele-  
ments as well as modular grills, griddles, and even downdraft built-  
in ventilators. Normally, a minimum clearance of 30 in is required  
above any range or cooktop, but the designer is cautioned to  
carefully verify local code requirements. Manufacturers’ specifica-  
tions should be carefully reviewed for rough opening require-  
ments and any venting requirements, particularly for self-cleaning  
ovens.  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 175* Residential Spaces

Dishwashers and Refrigerators  
# Dishwashers  
Built-in, freestanding, and undersink dishwashers are fairly well  
standardized in terms of overall dimensions. Access to plumbing and  
waste lines is the major consideration, as is the method of securing  
the dishwasher in order to minimize vibration.  
# Refrigerators  
Refrigerator door swings and clearances are of critical importance.  
While a 90° door swing may provide sufficient room for a person to  
observe storage within a refrigerator or freezer, a 180° door swing  
may be required to clean a refrigerator and remove storage bins. This  
is particularly true of the side-by-side door configuration. In addi-  
tion, adequate clearance should be allowed between the sides and top  
of the refrigerator and any adjoining cabinet work, especially if a  
built-in look is desired. The designer should check requirements with  
the manufacturer.  
While these drawings can be used for preliminary planning, final  
dimensions and clearance must be verified with the manufacturer.  
Often overlooked are clearances for refrigerator handles or pulls as  
well as coils mounted at the rear of the refrigerator.

*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design* **Requirements**  
The ANSI and UFAS standards require accessible and adaptable fea-  
tures which make the kitchen usable by most people. The fixed  
accessible features specified in ANSI 4.32.5 and UFAS 4.34.6  
include requirements for doors, clearances, clear floor space, appli-  
ances, storage, controls, and knee space. The adaptable features are  
removable base cabinets at knee spaces and counters that can be  
adjusted in height or fixed at a lower-than-standard height.  
The adaptable features for kitchens specified in the standards are  
shown in Figs. 13 and 14. In Fig. 13, the kitchen is shown in a stan-  
Fig. 13 ration  
An adaptable kitchen in conventional configu-

dard configuration with the counter height at 36 in and the knee  
spaces covered with base cabinets.  
In Fig. 14, the kitchen has been adapted by exposing the knee spaces  
and lowering the work surface and sink counter segments. No other  
changes have been made to the kitchen.  
Since removable base cabinets and adjustable height counters are not  
now products that are readily available for purchase, they are usually  
custom-made items.  
The kitchen shown in Figs. 17 and 18 is an example of a more elab-  
orate kitchen having ANSI/UFAS-accessible/adaptable features.  
This kitchen exceeds the ANSI/UFAS minimum requirements.  
# Work Surfaces  
People who use wheelchairs and other people who must or wish to sit  
down while preparing food need at least one work surface lower than  
the usual 36-in-high counter \(Fig. 19\).  
The standards \(ANSI 4.32.5.4 and UFAS 4.34.6.4\) require that at  
least one 30-in-wide, adjustable-height work surface be provided in  
an adaptable kitchen, although a wider size is preferred. The wider  
work surface provides space for pots, dishes, and other utensils as  
well as small appliances, and makes it easier to work on several  
things at once or to cook using many ingredients.  
*Work surfaces at ovens*  
If a wall oven is installed, a lowered work surface with knee space  
should be installed next to the wall oven. The standards specify that  
when the wall oven is not self-cleaning, a knee space must be located  
next to the oven to permit a disabled person in a wheelchair to pull up  
close enough to clean the oven.  
Even if a self-cleaning oven is installed, locating the knee space next  
to the oven makes it easier and safer for a disabled person to remove  
hot items from the oven.  
When an oven with a side-opening door is used, a pull-out shelf  
located beneath the oven must be installed. The shelf is used as a  
transfer surface for dishes as they are placed into or taken out of the  
oven. When not needed, the shelf is pushed back into the oven cabi-  
net \(Fig. 23\). When an oven with a drop-front door is used \(Fig. 21\),  
the pull-out shelf is not needed because the door serves as a transfer  
shelf.  
See ANSI 4.32.5.7 and UFAS 4.34.6.7 for dimensions and details of  
oven.  
# Cooktops in Adjustable-Height Counter Segments  
ANSI 4.32.5.6 and UFAS 4.34.6.6 permit use of a standard range if  
the controls comply with ANSI 4.25 or UFAS 4.27. The controls  
must be placed along the front or the side of the range so that a  
seated person need not reach across a hot burner to adjust the con-  
trols \(Fig. 24\).  
Some wheelchair users cannot use conventional ranges because the  
surface is too high and there is no knee space for maneuvering.

Cooktops in lowered counter segments with knee space below allow  
some wheelchair users to get close enough to operate the controls  
and move heavy pots and pans \(Fig. 25\).  
Cooktops with smooth surfaces are preferred by people with limited  
hand and arm strength because they can slide pots of hot food on and  
off the cooktop rather than lifting them over raised burners and  
knobs.  
When a cooktop is installed in a lowered counter, the width of the  
counter segment and knee space should be at least 30 in and should  
provide space to the side of the cooktop for utensils and maneuver-  
ing. An additional 30 in to the side is recommended \(Fig. 26\).  
When the knee space is under a cooktop, the standards require that  
the bottom of the cooktop be insulated to protect against accidental  
burns.  
While this type of installation may be the only way that some people  
can cook, it does expose a person in a wheelchair to the hazard of  
spilling hot food in his/her lap. People who pull up beneath the cook-  
top must exercise extreme care and cool hot foods before moving  
them.

Anthropometric Data  
It is difficult to develop precise formulas by which to design residen-  
tial library shelving or to project the number of books that can be  
accommodated on a unit base because of the many variables  
involved. The size of books, the types of books and other reading  
materials, the reach limitations of the user, and so on, all have an  
impact on the design requirements.  
It is possible, however, for preliminary planning purposes, to apply the  
broad guidelines indicated in Figs. 1 to 3. Seven volumes per foot of  
shelving can be used as a rule of thumb to project capacity. The height  
of the highest shelf above the floor should be limited to between 78 and  
81 in; 24 in is the minimum height above the floor to gain access to a  
shelf without squatting. Limitations for shelving to serve children will  
differ and are indicated in Fig. 3.

Here is a simple method of building in bookshelves, bar units, and the  
like, for residences and other types of buildings by using an egg-crate  
system. The front of the shelf is supported by the vertical members and  
the back of the shelf is nailed to the plywood back. These built-in book-  
shelves and bar unit were developed for a residence on the Eastern  
Shore of Maryland. In this design Hugh Newell Jacobsen, FAIA,  
divided the built-in bookcases into units of three shelf widths and intro-  
duced a recessed vertical divider 3 in deep by 71⁄2 in wide between book-  
case units. The major trim piece is solid wood 11⁄8 in × 11⁄8 in with a 3⁄8 in  
wide by 3⁄8 in deep groove at the middle. This simple trim piece acts as  
framing for sides, top, and bottom of the bookshelves and also for the  
bar unit with glass shelves and mirrored back, sides, top, and bottom.

Indoor recreational activities invariably require definite spaces for  
equipment and clearances for using it. Not all games occupy floor  
areas indicated as necessary for those diagrammed on this page. But  
if interiors are planned to accommodate large units of equipment  
such as that required for table tennis and provide necessary playing  
clearances, spaces will be adequate for many other uses as well.  
Dimensions of game equipment and floor areas required for its use  
are both subject to variation. Sizes noted here are comfortable aver-

# Home Laundry Activities  
Home laundry encompasses the processes from sorting through iron-  
ing of clothes and household linens, including pretreating, washing,  
drying, and sprinkling.  
*General Planning Suggestions*  
1\. 2. It is desirable to plan space for specific laundry processes.  
Moistureproof surfaces are needed for pretreating and sprinkling  
of clothes.  
3\. Drying areas should be accessible for use under all climatic con-  
ditions.  
4\. To control moisture in the room, dryers should be located to per-  
mit venting to the outside of the house.  
5\. Adequate storage for washing equipment and supplies should be  
located near the place of first use.  
6\. Facilities for hanging drip-dry garments after washing should be  
provided.  
7\. In locating the washing equipment, consideration should be  
given to convenience of interrelated household activities, dis-  
tances from the source of soiled clothes, and the drying areas, and  
the isolation of clutter.  
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate arrangements of laundry equipment. Space  
needed by a single worker in front of equipment or between equip-  
ment placed opposite is indicated. Overall dimensions of areas will  
vary with type and size of equipment selected. No allowance has  
been made between the back of equipment and the wall for electrical,  
plumbing, and dryer vent connections. The space required will  
depend on the type of installation used.  
Counter space is provided for sorting and folding three washer loads  
of clothes. The space under the counters has been used for bins, one  
for soiled clothing and the other for dry, clean articles that require  
further treatment before use or storage. Additional counter space can  
be provided by the tops of the dryer and washer, depending on the  
type selected.  
A tall storage cabinet for laundry supplies would complement each  
arrangement. In this cabinet, an ironing board, iron, mops, and buck-  
ets \(needed for cleaning the laundry area\) may also be stored.

pass through when someone is doing the laundry. If a  
washer and dryer are located opposite each other, this  
dimension should also be 1200 mm \(4 ft\)

# Laundry Location  
The ideal location of the laundry space is a matter of preference. The  
laundry area may be separate or combined with the bathroom, the  
kitchen, the utility space, or the corridor. The most frequently men-  
tioned advantages and disadvantages of these various options are  
listed as follows.  
*Separate Laundry*  
# Advantages  
A separate space can be used for other activities such as sewing  
and hobbies, if it is large enough.  
Clothes may be hung for air drying without interfering with other  
household activities.  
Noise from laundry appliances can be shut off from the rest of the  
dwelling.  
Temporary holding or storage of clothing to be washed or ironed  
is made easier.  
# Disadvantages  
Providing this extra room increases the cost of the dwelling.  
*Laundry in Combination with Bathroom*  
# Advantages  
When the bathroom is located near the bedrooms, the washer and  
dryer are close to where most laundry originates. This facili-  
tates gathering soiled articles and putting away clean linen  
and clothing.  
Combining the laundry space with a half bathroom adjacent to  
the kitchen provides many of the advantages of a separate  
laundry room.  
The tops of the laundry appliances provide useful horizontal  
space on which to lay clothes.  
Floor and wall finishes in bathrooms are usually resistant to high  
humidities.  
Usually, additional plumbing costs are minimal.  
The bathroom sink may be used for hand washing.  
Mechanical ventilation can be provided economically for both  
functions.  
# Disadvantages  
A bathroom will usually accommodate only washing and drying  
facilities. Other laundry-related activities such as ironing,  
will have to be carried out elsewhere in the dwelling.  
Occupants may wish to use the bathroom when laundry is being  
washed or dried.  
*Laundry in Combination with Kitchen*  
# Advantages  
Suitable in housing for young families because the person doing  
the laundry can keep an eye on the washing machine while  
doing other jobs and supervising the children.  
Direct access to the outside for clothes drying is likely to be easier  
than from laundries located in a basement or on a second story.

Sewing Center Clearances  
Kitchen sinks are usually sizeable and can be used for laundering.  
Additional plumbing costs are usually small.  
# Disadvantages  
Danger of cross-contamination through the handling of dirty  
washing during food preparation.  
Grease and cooking smells can be passed on to clean clothes.  
Noise generated by running appliances cannot easily be shut off  
from the rest of the dwelling.  
*Laundry in Combination with Utility Space in Basement*  
# Advantages  
Generally, as much space as needed can be provided.  
Noise generated by running appliances can be easily shut off  
from the rest of the dwelling.  
# Disadvantages  
Laundry must be carried up and down stairs, although automatic  
dryers have eased the problem of carrying heavy baskets of  
damp clothes to outdoor clotheslines.  
*Laundry in Combination with Corridor*  
# Advantages  
The space is used more economically \(Fig. 9\).  
The space above the appliances may be used as a linen closet.  
The appliances can be hidden from sight when they are not in  
use; they can be recessed into the wall and enclosed with  
doors.

# Disadvantages  
Noise generated by running appliances cannot be easily shut off  
from the rest of the dwelling.  
An alcove adjacent to a corridor will accommodate only a mini-  
mum-sized laundry area. Other laundry-related activities,  
such as ironing, will have to be carried out elsewhere in the  
dwelling.  
# Planning for Efficiency  
The sequence of laundering operations determines the planning of  
space and facilities and the placing of equipment. Convenience and  
time-and-step saving are easily achieved by placing the elements in  
their natural order of use\: \(1\) clothes chute \(with or without bins or  
hampers\), \(2\) sorting table or counter, \(3\) washing machine, \(4\) laun-  
dry trays, \(5\) dryer, \(6\) ironer or mangle, \(7\) ironing board, \(8\) rack,  
“horse,” or table for finished laundry. In addition, storage closet or  
cabinets will be necessary for soaps, powders, bluing, bleaches,  
starch, basket, clothespins, iron, and so on.

4\. 5. An area especially planned for sewing, convenient to other activ-  
ity areas, is desirable.  
Most houses need storage space for sewing materials and equip-  
ment. The amount and kind of storage required varies according  
to the quality and frequency of sewing.  
A minimum sewing area should include the machine, auxiliary  
work surfaces, a chair that permits freedom of motion, and stor-  
age arrangements. The work surface for layout and cutting may  
be outside the area for sewing machine operations and serve mul-  
tiple purposes.  
Consideration should be given to work surfaces at comfortable  
heights for the varying activities of sewing.  
Light should be adequate for the activity.

# CLOSETS/STORAGE AREAS  
Figures 1 and 2 show the vertical clearances related to male and  
female closet and storage facilities. Wherever possible or practical,  
the closet shelf should be located within human reach. The height  
shown for the high shelf has been established based on fifth-percentile  
male and female data in order to place it within reach of individuals of  
smaller body size. Any shelf located at a greater distance should be  
used primarily for storage that requires only infrequent access. The  
location of the shelf just above the rod is essentially a function of rod  
height. The clearance between the bottom of the shelf and the top of  
the rod should allow for easy removal of the hanger.  
Figure 3 illustrates two various types of walk-in storage facilities.  
Undoubtably, it can be argued that the 36-in, or 91.4-cm, clearance  
shown between the hanging garment and the storage shelf or between  
opposite garments could be reduced about 50 percent. The authors  
contend, however, that in order to achieve any degree of comfort in  
the selection and removal of the desired garment, a minimum of 36  
in. shold be maintained. The degree to which this dimension can be  
reduced is a question of the level of comfort the user is prepared to  
tolerate in exchange for the floor space saved. The two drawings of  
the plan view of the human figure illustrate clearances required for  
donning a coat or putting on a pair of stockings.  
# Clothes Closet  
The capacity of a clothes closet depends on h accessible length of  
rod. Three types of closets are common.  
Reach-in closet The minimum front-to-back depth of space for  
hanging clothes is 24 in. The accessible rod length is equal to  
the width of the door opening plus 6 in on each side.  
Edge-in closet By providing an edge-in space of at least 18 in  
the accessible rod length can be much longer than the door  
width. This requires less wall space than a full front opening.

Walk-in closet This type provides rods on one or borth sides of an  
access space within the closet may be used as a dressing area.  
*Rod Lengths and Heights*  
The Minimum Property Standards of HUD \(1973\) require that each  
bedroom have a closet, with rod and shelf, with minimum dimen-  
sions as follows\:  
Double-occupancy bedrooms\: 24 in by 60 in  
Single-occupancy bedrooms\: 24 in by 36 in  
Closet at entrance to house\: 24 in by 24 in  
A more desireable front-to-back depth would be 28 in for bedroom  
closets and 30 in for entrance closets to accommodate bulky outer  
garments.

Types of Closets  
The average rod space per garment is about 2 in for women’s cloth-  
ing, 21⁄4 in for men’s clothing, and 4 in for heavy coats.  
Recommended heights of rods are 68 i nfor long robes, 63 in for  
adult clothing, and 32 in for children’s clothing.  
*Shelf Space and Lighting*  
The shelf is normally located 2 in above the rod and another shelf  
may be located 12 higher. Shelves higher than the rod may also be  
installed at the end of the closet.  
A fluorescent fixture over the door is recommended for lighting a  
closet. Deluxe cool white tubes match daylight for selecting clothing

INTRODUCTION  
Planning and Design  
# INTRODUCTION  
The amount of office space built during the past few decades can be  
measured in the hundreds of billions of square feet. Within these  
buildings, workers spend nearly half their waking hours and a third  
of their entire lives.  
Over the life span of a typical office building, the same spaces may  
be occupied by a succession of different tenants, each with their own  
programmatic requirements. Consequently, interior spaces may be  
recycled and redesigned many times, simply to accommodate the  
changing needs of new corporate users. In many instances redesign  
may be necessitated solely by the effect of technological change on  
the methodology of transacting business. Moreover, the escalating  
costs of land acquisition and construction and the increasing scarcity  
of urban building sites make it essential that the redesign reflects an  
efficient, cost-effective utilization of space, as well as one that is  
responsive to the human factors involved. It is necessary, therefore,  
for the designer to be familiar not only with the general planning cri-  
teria associated with office design, but with the architectural detail-  
ing of some of the typical interior elements contained within these  
spaces.  
Accordingly, this section includes general planning criteria and  
examples of actual working drawings of typical interior conditions,  
prepared by various design professionals. The details referred to  
include such items as trading desks, elevated computer floors, library  
furniture, built-in storage cabinets, work counters, wall paneling, van-  
ities, reception desks, and conference room elements. Also included  
are illustrations and dimensional data pertaining to typical office fur-  
niture, equipment, and electronic media storage.

GENERAL OFFICES AND MULTIPLE WORKSTATIONS  
Planning Data\: Basic Workstations  
Fig. 1 Basic workstation with visitor seating  
# GENERAL OFFICES AND MULTIPLE  
# WORKSTATIONS  
The so-called general office takes on a variety of forms and configu-  
rations. In its simplest variation, it may be nothing more complex  
than several standard desks with returns located within a room or  
space. In its more sophisticated and ergonomically designed form,  
the general office may be based on an open planning or office land-  
scaping concept, involving a system of workstations. The worksta-  
tions include desk surfaces, files, acoustic partitions, and a host of  
other optional components to suit the nature of the particular work  
tasks involved. The systems are extremely flexible, allowing the  
workstations to be configured in a variety of shapes. Provision for  
power and lighting is quite common.  
The design of the general office, like the design of the private office,  
requires a knowledge of the basic dimensional requirements and  
clearances of the workstation and, where applicable, of the visitor  
seating to be accommodated.  
In certain instances, where customized and/or built-in storage ele-  
ments, work counters, credenzas, and so on, are required, a knowl-  
edge of architectural woodworking, as may be related to the design  
of such elements, can be quite helpful.  
Accordingly, this part includes basic planning criteria for general  
office design, in addition to examples of architectural woodwork  
details in connection with some of the more common customized  
components of general office spaces.  
The basic workstation, as illustrated in plan in Fig. 1, is the funda-  
mental building block in understanding the anthropometric consider-  
ations for the planning and design of the general office. The  
work-task zone must be large enough to accommodate the paper-  
work, equipment, and other accessories that support the user’s func-  
tion. The work/activity zone dimension, shown in Fig. 1, is  
established by the space requirements needed for use of the typical  
return. In no case should this distance be less than the 30 in, or 76.2  
cm, needed to provide adequate space for the chair clearance zone.  
The visitor seating zone, ranging in depth from 30 to 42 in, or 76.2 to  
106.7 cm, requires the designer to accommodate both the buttock-  
knee and buttock-toe length body dimensions of the larger user. If an  
overhang is provided or the desk’s modesty panel is recessed, the vis-  
itor seating zone can be reduced due to the additional knee and toe  
clearances provided. The specific type and size of the seating \(i.e., if  
it swivels or if it has casters\) also influence these dimensions.

Fig. 3 Floating or free-standing workstations tend to utilize more floor area than workstations placed against a wall  
or sharing the same wall panel. Clustering of workstations will ultimately result in the use of less floor area, but at the  
expense of major ergonomic considerations. Decisions relative to both acoustical privacy and personal space are  
often sacrificed in the name of economy

Multiple workstations can result in efficient utilization of space and

computer terminals is intensive, individual CRTs should be provided.  
Figures 4, 5, and 6 each show eight workstations, yet the setups range  
in area from 448 to 1012 ft2. Furniture size, function, and ergonomic  
considerations all affect setup.

It is not unusual to have two or more persons share an enclosed office  
space. In planning this type of office space, both circulation and  
clearance become critically important. Door swings, the extension of  
file drawers, and points of entry must all be carefully considered.

PRIVATE OFFICES  
Executive Workstation  
The design of the private office requires a knowledge of the basic  
dimensional requirements and clearances of the executive worksta-  
tion and, where applicable, of visitor seating accommodations. In  
certain instances where various aspects of the office interior are cus-  
tomized and/or built into the construction, a knowledge of architec-  
tural woodwork detailing is also desirable.  
This page and the following pages include the necessary planning cri-  
teria required, as well as details of certain customized components.  
Executive workstation and/or desk size and configuration can be cus-  
tomized, depending on desired image, scale, and ambience. Desks  
are also available in generally accepted standard sizes. It is these  
standard desks that are most used in the design of the private office.  
Figure 1 illustrates the range of desk dimensions, chair dimensions,  
and clearances involved.  
Many private executive offices are being designed with desks that do  
not conform with the basic rectangular shape. Such a situation is  
illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows a circular executive desk. Such a  
desk is often selected if the executive in question plans to hold con-  
ferences within the office and prefers the psychology of having either  
visitors or employees gather around the work surface in an egalitar-  
ian fashion. While a minimum desk size of 48 in, or 121.9 cm, is  
shown, this dimension is also influenced by the number of side chairs  
to be grouped around the desk.  
A circular executive desk must be supported by supplementary cre-  
denza or file storage within easy reach of the executive chair. Side  
arm reach relative to the work/activity zone must always be studied  
carefully.  
Figure 3 illustrates a typical circular lounge grouping found within  
an executive office. Providing for the appropriate leg clearance  
of 12 to 18 in, or 30.5 to 45.7 cm, is also determined by the sit-  
ting zone requirements. Buttock-knee length must also be consid-  
ered.

The private offices illustrated in Figs. 4 to 17 reflect middle to senior  
management functional, as well as status, requirements. Each office  
layout should be carefully reviewed with the client to ensure that all  
programmatic functions have been met. Offices of this size do not  
easily accommodate an independent conference function.

# ELECTRONIC WORKSTATIONS  
# PLANNING DATA\: ANTHROPOMETRICS  
New electronic technologies, together with the advent and prolifera-  
tion of the microcomputer and the availability of inexpensive pack-  
aged software, have changed the complexion of the office workplace.  
The ergonomic considerations related to this new work environment  
have necessitated a reevaluation of the traditional interface between  
the seated office worker and his or her workplace. It is essential that the  
design of this electronic workstation be responsive to human factors in  
order to avoid physical discomfort for the user. The location of the key-  
board, angle of the visual display terminal, adjustability of the chair,  
field of vision, provisions for back support, and height of the seat  
above the floor are a few of the considerations in the design process.  
This page and the following pages provide a variety of anthropomet-  
ric and ergonomic planning data and details for use as reference in  
the design of the electronic workstation.  
Figure 1 illustrates guidelines for use in establishing preliminary  
design assumptions for a workstation display console. Since the  
types of displays and the nature of the tasks associated with those  
displays can vary considerably, Fig. 1 cannot be taken too literally.  
The configuration shown, however, is fairly representational. Certain  
basic factors should be noted anthropometrically. The use of an  
adjustable chair will permit the eye height of the seated viewer to be  
raised or lowered to view the display, as may be required depending  
on body size. An adjustment range between 15 and 18 in, or 38.1 and  
45.7 cm, should be adequate to accommodate the eye height sitting  
requirements of about 90 percent of all viewers. Adjustability, how-  
ever, will be of little value if the vertical distance between the under-  
side of the desk and the floor is insufficient to accommodate the knee  
height and thigh clearance when the seat is adjusted to the appropri-  
ate position. If such distance is not less than 26.5 in, or 67.3 cm, the  
majority of viewers will be accommodated.  
The location of the top of the display should align with the standard  
sightline for optimum viewing conditions. Since the eye and the head  
can rotate within certain limitations and, in so doing, increase the  
area that can be scanned, displays can be located above the standard  
sightline when absolutely necessary. It should also be noted that the  
more perpendicular the normal sightline is to the display plane, the  
greater the viewing comfort. Accordingly, consideration should be  
given to sloping the display plane since the normal sightline is about  
15° below the horizontal.  
*Stature* is the vertical distance from the floor to the top of the head,  
measured while the subject stands erect, looking straight ahead.  
*Elbow height* is the distance measured vertically from the floor to the  
depression formed at the elbow where the forearm meets the upper  
arm.  
*Eye height* is the vertical distance from the floor to the inner corner  
of the eye, measured with the subject looking straight ahead and  
standing erect.  
*Sitting height erect* is the vertical distance from the sitting surface to  
the top of the head with the subject sitting erect.  
*Sitting height normal* is the vertical distance from the sitting surface  
to the top of the head, measured with the subject sitting relaxed.  
*Eye height* is the vertical distance from the inner corner of the eye to  
the sitting surface.

Planning Data\: Anthropometrics  
*Shoulder height* is the distance taken vertically from the sitting  
surface to a point on the shoulder midway between the neck and  
acromion.  
*Shoulder breadth* is the maximum horizontal distance across the del-  
toid muscles.  
*Elbow to elbow* is the distance across the lateral surfaces of the  
elbows measured with elbows flexed and resting lightly against the  
body, with the forearms extended horizontally.  
*Hip breadth* is the breadth of the body as measured across the widest  
portion of the hips. Note that a hip breadth measurement can also be  
taken with the subject in a standing position, in which case the defi-  
nition would be the maximum breadth of the lower torso.  
*Elbow rest height* is the height from the top of the sitting surface to  
the bottom of the tip of the elbow.  
*Thigh clearance* is the distance taken vertically from a sitting surface  
to the top of the thigh at the point where the thigh and the abdomen  
intersect.  
*Knee height* is the vertical distance from the floor to the midpoint of  
the kneecap.  
*Popliteal height* is the distance, taken vertically, from the floor to the  
underside of the portion of the thigh, just behind the knee, while the  
subject is seated with body erect. The knees and ankles are usually  
perpendicular, with the bottom of the thigh and the back of the knees  
barely touching the sitting surface.  
*Buttock-popliteal length* is the horizontal distance from the rearmost  
surface of the buttock to the back of the lower leg.  
*Buttock-knee length* is the horizontal distance from the rearmost sur-  
face of the buttocks to the front of the kneecaps.  
*Buttock-toe length* is the horizontal distance from the rearmost sur-  
face of the buttocks to the tip of the toe.  
*Buttock-heel length* is the horizontal distance from the base of the  
heel to a wall against which the subject sits erect with his leg maxi-  
mally extended forward along the sitting surface. This is sometimes  
referred to as *buttock-leg length.*  
*Vertical reach* is the height above the sitting surface of the tip of  
the middle finger when the arm, hand, and fingers are extended  
vertically.  
*Vertical grip reach* is usually measured from the floor to the top of a  
bar grasped in the right hand while the subject stands erect and the  
hand within which the bar is grasped is raised as high as it can be  
conveniently without experiencing discomfort or strain.  
*Side arm reach* is the distance from the center line of the body to the  
outside surface of a bar grasped in the right hand while the subject  
stands erect and the arm is conveniently outstretched horizontally  
without experiencing discomfort or strain.  
*Thumb tip reach* is the distance from the wall to the tip of the thumb,  
measured with the subject’s shoulders against the wall, arm extended  
forward, and index finger touching the tip of the thumb.  
*Maximum body depth* is the horizontal distance between the most  
anterior point on the body to the most posterior. Anterior points are  
usually located on the chest or abdomen while the posterior points  
are usually found in the buttock or shoulder region.  
*Maximum body breadth* is the maximum distance, including arms,  
across the body.  
• Both the work surface and the display monitors must be lowered  
and raised as a unit, with 31.8 cm of travel.  
• The work surface must be tilted anywhere between a horizontal  
position to 35° below horizontal. The work surface, at its lowest  
setting and with a 10° tilted angle, as is common in use, must be  
63.5 cm in height at its front edge.  
• The work surface must raise to a horizontal height of 104 cm,  
accommodating a majority of people in a standing position.  
• The monitor screens must be tiltable to any position between 15°  
forward of vertical and 15° back. This lets the user adjust the  
screen to avoid reflective glare, and it accommodates various  
working positions of different lines of sight.  
• Adjustment controls designed for hand operation must be located  
within the operator’s extended reach envelope.  
• All surfaces must have matte or dull finishes. This reduces the  
likelihood of reflective glare.

CONFERENCE ROOMS  
Planning Data\: Table Sizes and Seating Capacities  
Consideration must be given to clearances and circulation around the  
larger conference table, as indicated in Figs. 1 and 2. A minimum of  
48 in, or 121.9 cm, is suggested from the edge of the table to the wall  
or nearest obstruction. This dimension under ordinary circumstance  
allows for a circulation zone beyond the sitting zone of 30 to 36 in,  
or 76.2 to 91.4 cm, based on a maximum body breadth measurement  
of the larger person. The greater dimension is recommended to allow  
for the chair in a pulled-out position.  
The actual dimensions of the conference table are a function of the  
number of people to be seated. The square table illustrated in Fig. 1  
provides for eight people, with each side ranging from 54 to 60 in, or  
137.2 to 152.4 cm. The larger dimension is more appropriate to  
accommodate people of larger body size and to allow for a more gen-  
erous work zone for each person. This translates into 30 in, or 76.2  
cm, per person, which constitutes a comfortable perimeter allocation.  
The circular table shown in Fig. 2 comfortably accommodates five  
people while allowing for a 30-in, or 76.2-cm, access zone between  
chairs. To accommodate both sitting zone and circulation zone, a  
space with a radius ranging from 72 to 81 in, or 182.9 to 205.7 cm,  
must be provided.  
Round conference tables offer the advantages of intimacy, equality,  
and compactness. On the other hand, if status is an issue, or if one  
wall within the space is an audiovisual wall, this table shape can be  
less than satisfactory. The same problems can arise with a square  
conference table. In both instances, however, the total seating around  
each table shape must be viewed in the context of chair size, chair  
spacing, and tasks to be performed at the table.

Rectangular and boat-shaped conference tables lend themselves to  
formal settings where status and hierarchy are important. Both table  
shapes are also more suitable in a room where an audiovisual wall is  
placed at one end of the space, or where speakers are making presen-  
tations. The boat-shaped table also offers greater visibility of others  
seated at the table, as well as ease of circulation around its perimeter.

Table Base and Edge Treatments  
It is important for the designer to understand and appreciate some of  
the important details that make up a conference table. The base treat-  
ments shown in Fig. 4 are but a few of the myriad possibilities. Perhaps  
even more important to consider are the finished edges of glass and  
wood conference tables, representative details of which are shown in  
Figs. 5 and 6. Other edge details could be made of marble, granite, or  
even leather. Fingers, hands, and arms make intimate contact with  
these edge details something that should be carefully considered.

Credenzas and Heating Unit Enclosures  
Custom credenza units are often designed to complement the details  
of a conference table. They serve multiple functions, including stor-  
age, incorporation of electronic media equipment, and display, as  
well as serving as a work surface. In addition, architectural wood-  
work is used to enclose existing convector covers and to frame win-  
dow openings. It is important for the designer to consider providing  
ease of access to the heating and air-handling elements behind the  
woodwork, as well as allowing the appropriate flow of air.

Equipment Requirements  
# Cameras  
You will require one to three cameras.  
• The first camera is to focus on the participants’ faces.  
• The second camera provides an alternate view of the participants.  
If it is not possible to get everyone in the view of one camera,  
have one camera on each side of the room. A button on your  
remote control will alternate the views.  
• A document camera is used to transfer images of documents or  
3D objects that the participants want to display to the other group  
in their presentation.  
When planning a videoconference room, the most important factor is  
where the camera is placed.  
• At the beginning of a meeting, it is nice to see an overall view of  
the participants. Make sure that the camera is not too close to the  
table to capture everyone.  
• Place the camera between 36 in and 60 in above the floor.  
• At 36 in high, your participants will be seen at eye level, but their  
feet will also be in the picture. Make sure you choose a table with  
a modesty panel if you are placing the camera at this level.  
• Place the camera directly on top or in front of the monitor. If the  
camera is too far away from the monitor the participants will seem  
as if they are not making eye contact with the alternate party.  
• If the camera is over 60 in high, it will spotlight the follically  
challenged users.  
• If someone is standing up to make a presentation, adjust the cam-  
era height to their height. It is also a good idea to mark the floor  
with tape to emphasize the boundary of the camera’s view. This  
will prevent a mobile speaker from accidentally walking out of  
the picture.  
# Microphones  
There are many choices to be made concerning sound transmission.  
Many video systems have built-in microphones that track where a  
voice is coming from within a 12- to 15-ft diameter and direct the  
camera to capture the current speaker. This also eliminates the need  
for tabletop microphones and the use of a remote control during a  
conference.  
• The best type of microphone to purchase is a boundary micro-  
phone, which can pick up voices from 14 ft away. It can also be  
daisy-chained from one microphone to another. Only one or two  
are necessary for your entire group.  
• When a participant is standing up to give a presentation, use a  
lapel microphone.  
• Ask your videoconference dealer or sound contractor which solu-  
tion is best for your facility.  
# Single or Dual Monitors  
You will require one or two monitors. The first monitor is to display  
the participants you will be conferencing with or to display docu-  
ments or 3D objects they want to share with you. The optional sec-  
ond monitor is to display your own picture. As vain as this may seem,  
it is very useful to show who the camera is spotlighting. Most moni-  
tors have Picture in Picture \(PIP\) to display both groups. Groups  
larger than four people will not be able to see the PIP box, so an alter-  
nate monitor is recommended.  
*286*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
• When a group of 2 to 5 people will be meeting, use a 27- to 32-  
inch monitor.  
• For a group of 6 to 12 people, use a 32- to 37-inch monitor.  
• When a group of 13 to 20 will be meeting, use two 37- to 45-inch  
monitors.  
• When a group of 21 or more will be meeting, use two projection  
screens with data projector ceiling mounts.  
• You must purchase a monitor, not a TV. Remember, monitor  
screens are measured diagonally on the glass portion only.  
• Offer an additional monitor or screen whenever a document cam-  
era, DVD, VCR, data projector, white board, or other display  
equipment will be used.  
# ISDN Lines \(Integrated Services Digital Network\)  
ISDN lines can be installed and maintained by the local telephone  
company.  
• In each ISDN line there are two channels.  
• Your videoconferencing system will require one to four ISDN  
lines. If only one line is ordered, the user’s voices and move-  
ments could be choppy. If you have ever watched a kung fu  
movie that was translated to English, you know what one-line  
videoconferencing is like. With the addition of each line, the pic-  
ture and transmission will become smoother.  
# DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS  
# Room Size  
• A few general rules remain constant when planning any size  
room. There are specific color schemes, lighting, furniture, and  
acoustics that are standards for videoconferencing.  
• When getting started, your primary focus should be the number  
of people that will be participating in the videoconferences. The  
number of people will dictate what size the room should be, what  
kind of furniture you should use, and the type of system that is  
required.  
# Room Shape  
• For smaller meetings, a square room is acceptable.  
• For meetings with four or more people, a rectangular room is best.  
# Entrances  
• Two entrances to the room are ideal so participants are able to enter  
the room and sit down without walking in front of the camera.  
• The entrances should be on the camera wall or the walls perpen-  
dicular to the camera. They should be as close to the camera wall  
as possible.  
• The wall behind the participants should not have any doors or  
windows.  
# Acoustics  
• Pay close attention to the ventilation system in the room. Does  
it create a lot of noise that could muffle the participants’ voices?  
If the vent is directly over the microphone, the sound will  
amplify like a hurricane. Try placing a cover over the vent that  
redirects the airflow in a different direction rather than straight  
down. Office Spaces  
VIDEOCONFERENCE ROOMS  
Equipment Requirements  
• Does the room have a lot of exposed wood or high ceilings? Pad  
as much in the room as possible to prevent echoed or amplified  
voices in a large room. Upholstery on chairs, carpet on the floor,  
and ceiling tile will absorb most of the reverberations in the room.  
• The videoconference room should be in a remote area that is  
away from the cafeteria or other gathering places in the office. It  
is also a good idea to place a red light or a sign outside the room  
to forewarn others that a conference is in progress.  
# Color  
• The best choice for wall paint color is a light blue or light gray.  
Bretford recommends Benjamin Moore paint numbers 1627,  
829, 996, and HC-169. The worst wall color to use is white.  
White creates too much of a contrast and can literally erase the  
faces of participants with dark skin tones from the camera’s view.  
• A light- to medium-colored conference table will reflect light  
upward and make shadows disappear from users’ faces. Do not  
use a white or black laminate or other high-intensity colors that  
could reflect too much light and wash out the participants’ faces.  
Also keep in mind that the pattern on the laminate should be cam-  
era friendly. Bretford recommends the following laminate colors  
by Wilson Art from Bretford’s finish card\: Featherstone, Pebble,  
Pewter, Sea Breeze, Bronze Legacy, Grey Tigris, Saffron Tigris,  
Fusion Maple, or Wild Cherry. If you plan to use a veneer con-  
ference table, natural cherry, medium cherry, and natural maple  
are excellent choices.  
• Avoid patterns that are large or repeated on furniture, walls, or  
clothing.  
• The room does not have to be monochromatic, but keep it simple.  
# Accessories  
• Logos can be placed behind the users as long as they do not  
reflect or detract from the participants.  
• Artwork or plants are okay as long as they are not on the table or  
in the camera’s view.  
• Additional wall clocks are an excellent idea to hang in the room  
to display alternate time zones.  
# Furniture  
• Use tables that taper to allow the camera to see all of the partici-  
pants’ faces. Tables should also have modesty panels and provide  
access to power and data.  
• Chairs should be padded and comfortable. They should not rock  
or roll. Wheels squeak when they roll, and the rocking motion  
provides a distracting activity for camera-shy users.  
• Carts or cabinetry for the video equipment should provide power,  
cord management, and rear access to fix technical difficulties. A  
cart should also lock and have wheels to stow it in the corner  
when not in use.  
# Lighting  
• The room should have indirect fluorescent lighting.  
• The light should shine upward and reflect evenly off of the ceil-  
ing. Lights that shine down create shadows on the participants’  
faces.  
• If there are windows in the room, make sure to use light-blocking  
shades. Hunter Douglas Light-Lines or Levelor’s Mark One mini-  
blinds are recommended because they provide the best light con-  
trol. You will be amazed to compare the room with and without  
sunlight. If sunlight is shining directly into the camera, the partic-  
ipants will look like silhouettes.

RECEPTION AREAS  
Planning Data\: Receptionist’s Workstation  
Proper design of the reception area is critical in communicating an  
organization’s desired corporate image. Reception spaces are both the  
first and the last areas with which the visitor interacts and, accord-  
ingly, have considerable visual impact in communicating that image.  
Not only must the reception space look attractive, but it must func-  
tion properly as well. The two most important planning elements in  
this regard are the visitor’s seating area and the receptionist’s work-  
station or desk.

RECEPTION AREAS  
Planning Data\: Seating Arrangements  
While most of the examples in this part are drawn from corporate inte-  
riors, the designer is urged to take into consideration the needs of spe-  
cial user groups who must interact with a receptionist. If small children  
are to communicate \(or see or be seen\), how high is the privacy wall?  
If a wheelchair-bound user is to approach the reception desk, is there  
room for the footrests to be accommodated? The designer must con-  
sider all user populations.  
This part deals primarily with basic planning data relative to the  
design of a receptionist’s workstation and furniture arrangements of  
the seating areas. Also included are related details directly from the  
working drawings of design firms.  
For the purpose of privacy or security, the receptionist’s workstation  
is often an area physically separated by built-in furniture and/or par-  
titions. Figure 1 shows a counter height receptionist’s workstation.  
While the relationship of work surface to seat height is key, other  
anthropometric considerations are eye height and sitting height nor-  
mal. The minimum height of the opening above the floor has been  
established at 78 in, or 198.1 cm. Sitting height and eye height are  
significant in providing unobstructed vision. Figure 2 depicts a desk  
height receptionist’s workstation. The depth of the work surface  
ranges from 26 to 30 in, or 66 to 76.2 cm, allowing for thumb tip  
reach required for the exchange of papers and packages. Both Figs. 1  
and 2 show in broken line an added countertop element often pro-  
vided for security or as a visual screen of the work surface top.  
# PLANNING DATA\: SEATING ARRANGEMENTS  
Fig. 3 The seating arrangements illustrated here provide some typical conditions that the designer must address.  
Individual seats are preferred over sofas. Corner seating arrangements must always consider leg clearance. Circula-  
tion between low tables and the edges of chairs must be adequate to allow for the legs of persons seated in the  
chairs. Convenient locations for side tables, so that magazines, ashtrays, artwork, or portable lighting can be placed  
on them, are important

the incorporation of electronic equipment, and task lighting

erly. Many designers do not give this adequate thought. Overall costs of custom-designed reception desks can be  
reduced by integrating standard metal file components into the architectural woodwork

# DESKS AND SEATING  
Furniture, furnishings, and equipment are the basic building blocks  
in the design of office spaces. The illustrations and dimensional data  
contained in this part are based on the product lines available from  
particular manufacturers.  
Although the data, to a great extent, are fairly standard throughout  
the industry, there will be some variations according to manufacturer.  
Accordingly, although the information presented is adequate for pre-  
liminary planning purposes, the designer is cautioned to reconcile  
preliminary assumptions with the actual dimensional data of the  
manufacturer whose product is ultimately specified.  
Included in the data provided in this part are examples of filing cabi-  
nets, storage cabinets, conference tables, desks, and electronic media.

Chairs  
Chair types are often associated with certain generic job titles. The  
designer, however, is cautioned not to make assumptions about chair  
selection without a thorough understanding of the tasks the individual  
is to perform. Ergonomic considerations are to be carefully reviewed  
in order to select a chair with appropriate attributes—that is, seat  
height, adjustability, back and arm support, firmness, and so on. Over-  
all chair size must be understood within the context of available clear-  
ances and workstation configuration.

Conference Tables  
Conference tables come in an infinite variety of shapes and sizes.  
Figures 4 to 6 attempt to provide a representative sampling of  
such tables, along with dimensional information and seating capac-  
ities. The designer is cautioned to use such information as a pre-  
liminary planning tool only, and to carefully lay out conference  
rooms with actual furniture pieces that have been selected. Chair  
width and spacing will ultimately dictate conference table seating  
capacity.

Vertical File Cabinets  
Standard vertical file cabinets are usually designed to accommodate  
standard-height drawers and half-height file insert drawers \(optional\).  
Cabinets are available in letter-size widths \(147⁄8 in\) and legal-size  
widths \(171⁄8 in\). Vertical file drawers are usually 12 in high and accom-  
modate front-to-back filing.  
Standard cabinets are available in four heights\: five-drawer \(585⁄8 in\),  
four-drawer \(523⁄8 in\), three-drawer \(411⁄4 in\), and two-drawer \(293⁄8 in  
or 273⁄8 in\). The depths of the three-, four-, and five-drawer cabinets  
are 289⁄16 in, while the depth of the 2-drawer cabinets is 30 in. Table 1  
lists these dimensional data. It should be noted that, although ade-  
quate for preliminary planning purposes, the data are based on Steel-  
case cabinets.  
# Guidelines for Customizing Vertical Files  
Depending on the manufacturer, vertical file cabinets can be cus-  
tomized. Usually two half-height file insert drawers may be substi-  
tuted for a 12-in-high drawer in any or all positions. Table 2 indicates  
the dimensions and linear capacities of such insert drawers, while  
Fig. 7 illustrates basic guidelines for customizing.

Lateral File Cabinets  
Standard lateral file cabinets are usually available in three widths—  
30 in, 36 in, and 42 in—and with 12-in-high drawers or roll-out  
shelves. Some cabinets are designed on a 3-in module to accommo-  
date 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-in-high drawers and shelves.  
Ganging hardware is usually included with each file cabinet. Cabi-  
nets should be ganged with adjacent files or bolted to the floor. Coun-  
terbalance weights should be used for single-application files.  
Table 4 shows the outside and inside dimensions of four lateral file  
cabinets and their loaded floor weights based on 12-in-high drawers  
filled to capacity.  
It should be noted that the dimensional data and load factors are  
based on Steelcase cabinets. Although these data are adequate for  
preliminary planning purposes, it is essential that the data of the  
equipment being specified be verified with its manufacturer.

Filing Arrangements  
Most lateral file drawers are designed for filing both letter-size and  
legal-size documents, in addition to EDP printouts. Lateral file draw-  
ers can usually accommodate materials in a front-to-back \(F-to-B\)  
arrangement or in a side-to-side \(S-to-S\) arrangement. In some  
instances, a combination of the two is possible. The actual capacity  
in linear inches for each arrangement and for each particular drawer  
or shelf has been calculated and is shown in the “Linear capacity”  
column in Tables 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8. It should be noted that the dimen-  
sional data in Table 5 are based on Steelcase drawers.

Storage Cabinets  
Standard cabinets often provide a fast, flexible, and economical solu-  
tion to many storage problems. Table 7 provides dimensional data  
and capacities for four typical cabinet types. These cabinets are man-  
ufactured by Steelcase. The dimensions of cabinets of other manu-  
facturers will differ somewhat. The data in Table 7, however, are  
adequate for preliminary planning purposes.

Electronic Media Storage  
# Microfiche  
Microfiche is a 4- × 6-in film transparency containing multiple rows  
of greatly reduced page images of any written, printed, or graphic  
material. Image reductions range from 13 up to several hundred times  
smaller than the originals. A microfiche viewer enlarges the images so  
that they are readable. Labeling information is written or printed on a  
narrow strip along the long edge at the top of the microfiche.  
Microfiche may be stored in interior card trays, in lateral file 6-in-  
high roll-out shelves, and in a lateral file media compartment.  
# Microfilm  
Microfilm is roll photographic film on a reel or in a square cartridge  
that contains images of pages of written, graphic, or printed material  
reduced hundreds of times. A microfilm viewer enlarges the images  
so that they are readable. Microfilm on a reel is kept in a square plas-  
tic or cardboard box for protection and ease of handling. Microfilm  
is most conveniently stored on edge. Labeling is placed on one of the  
edges of the reel or box.  
Microfilm may be stored in the lateral file media compartment kit, in  
an interior card tray, and in lateral file 6-in-high drawers or shelves.  
# Printout Paper  
Printout paper, also known as continuous form data processing paper,  
is used in almost all computer printers and some word processing  
equipment. The most common types are recognizable by\:  
• Small pin-feed holes along both edges, which are used by the  
printer to grip and advance the paper.  
• Green or gray-shaded stripes across the paper, which serve to  
organize the printed information.  
After printing, the printout may exist in a fan-folded stack or it may  
be “burst,” that is, separated into individual sheets along the perfora-  
tions that exist at the fold lines.  
If the printout consists of a significant number of sheets, it may be  
bound for easier handling. Fan-folded printouts *must* be bound along  
the top or long edge. Printouts that have been burst may be bound along  
either the long edge or the short edge. The binding may consist of only  
a narrow metal or plastic clamp or it may include a stiff plastic or fiber-  
*328*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
board cover. Frequently the binding may include hooks at both ends so  
the printout may be hung from two rails like a hanging file folder.  
Other hooks may be used to suspend it from special bars or rails.  
Identification information may be marked on one of the edges  
\(depending on how the printout is stored\) or on the front sheet of the  
binding cover.  
Printout paper may be stored in Steelcase lateral and vertical files,  
depending on the paper size. Check the file which will accommodate  
your paper. Boxed paper can be stored in storage cabinets.  
# Cartridges  
Cartridges have 1⁄4-in-wide magnetic tape loaded into a reel-to-reel  
cartridge generally made of clear plastic with metal back plate. They  
look similar to an oversize recording cassette. Cartridges come in  
and are sometimes stored in flip-open plastic or cardboard boxes.  
Labels and identification information are located on the long edge or  
on the side along the long edge of the cartridge or the box.  
Cartridges may be stored in interior card trays or in a media com-  
partment kit in lateral file 6-in-high drawers or shelves.  
# Cassettes  
Cassettes are available in standard and mini sizes and consist of mag-  
netic tape loaded into a reel-to-reel configuration in a plastic case.  
Standard cassettes for electronic equipment are identical in size and  
appearance to those used for home recording. Cassettes may be used  
in microcomputers and in word processing or dictation equipment.  
They come in and are frequently stored in flip-open plastic cases.  
Labels or identification information may be located on the long edge  
or side of the cassette or its case.  
Cassettes may be stored in a lateral file media compartment kit. **Disk Cartridges**  
Disk cartridges are round plastic cases which contain a series of rotat-  
ing platters \(or disks\) on which data is magnetically recorded. The  
number of platters in a case varies with the height of the case. In use,  
the entire case is inserted in a computer disk drive unit, where record-  
ing arms, which read/record information, enter the case through a slot  
with a spring door.  
Disk cartridges are flat in appearance with an elongated Y-shaped  
protrusion on the top. They can be stored flat or on edge.  
Labels for identification are usually located on the edge of the disk  
cartridge. Frequently disk cartridges have to be stored in a tempera-  
ture/humidity-controlled environment.  
Disk cartridges may be stored in lateral file 6-in-high roll-out  
shelves, storage cabinets, and bookcases.  
# Disk Packs  
Disk packs are round plastic cases which contain a series of rotating  
platters \(or disks\) on which data is magnetically recorded. The number  
of platters in a unit varies with the height of the plastic case. In use, the  
entire case is inserted in a computer disk drive unit, where recording  
arms, to read/record information, enter the case through a slot with a  
spring door. Disk packs are flat on the bottom and upright, with the han-  
dle on top. Identification is generally located on the edge of the disk  
pack. These units should be stored in a temperature/humidity-controlled  
environment. Disk packs *must not* be stored on top of one another.  
Disk packs may be stored in storage cabinets, bookcases, and on 3-  
in- and 6-in-high lateral file shelves.  
# Floppy \(Flexible\) Disks  
Floppy disks, also called diskettes or flexible disks, are small,  
record-like disks, each permanently enclosed in a square, stiff paper  
envelope. They are used to magnetically record information in all  
types of small computer and word processing equipment. Labels are  
placed on the paper envelope.  
Floppy disks may be stored in 12-in-high lateral file drawers and  
shelves.

# Laser Disks  
Laser disks look like long-play record albums, complete with a paper  
protective sleeve. Data are stored and retrieved by laser beam.  
Laser disks may be stored in 15-in-high lateral file drawers and  
shelves.  
# Magnetic, Tab, and Aperture Cards  
Magnetic cards, also known as mag cards, are a tab-size black plas-  
tic card with magnetic material coated on one or both sides. The  
cards are used to record or reproduce information in word processing  
equipment. In some cases, one or more of the cards will be kept in a  
paper envelope. Identifying information will be marked on the face  
of the envelope.  
Tab cards, also known as keypunch cards, are 80-column cards or  
punch cards with small holes in them to represent bits of data.  
Although they may be stored in a workstation or central storage area,  
they are usually used and produced in a mainframe computer room or  
keypunch department, and are stored in specially separated decks.  
The decks are most frequently identified by markings across the  
edges of the cards.  
Aperture cards are tab cards with a piece of microfilm mounted over  
a hole in their center. They are most frequently used for microfilm  
images of engineering or architectural drawings. Aperture card  
reader/printers enlarge the image on a screen for reference and, if  
required, reproduce a full-size copy of the drawing. Identifying infor-  
mation is printed in a narrow band along the top \(long edge\) of the card.  
These cards may be stored in interior card trays and in lateral file 6-  
in-high drawers and roll-out shelves.

# Magnetic Tape Reels  
Magnetic tape is typically 1⁄2-in wide and loaded on reels of varying  
diameters. A flexible plastic strip locks around the outside of the reel  
to protect the tape and prevent unraveling when it is not in use. This  
medium is used in large tape drive units that are generally found only  
in computer rooms. The long-term storage of magnetic tapes is sub-  
ject to strict temperature and humidity requirements to prevent dam-  
age. Tapes are labeled both on the side and on the flexible strip that  
is placed around the edge of the reel. They can be stored flat or on  
edge. For flat storage, handle like disk cartridges.  
Magnetic tape reels may be stored in the lateral file add-on cabinets,  
storage cabinets, or in freestanding wire racks on lateral file shelves.

RESTAURANTS  
Types and Sizes of Table Arrangements  
The basic components of any restaurant interior are the chair and the  
table. Depending on restaurant type, menu, service, table setting, fur-  
niture selection, and degree of intimacy required, table size and over-  
all chair space requirements can, and should, vary greatly. A  
restaurant that encourages rapid turnover of customers will normally  
provide small tabletop and chair sizes. On the other hand, those  
restaurants that encourage limited turnover and emphasize the win-  
ing and dining experience will typically provide larger tabletop sizes  
and larger, more comfortable chairs, with greater distance between  
table groupings.  
There is no agreement among even the most experienced restaura-  
teurs and restaurant designers as to what the optimal table and chair  
dimensions should be. In addition, many other design factors will  
influence the final decision, including circulation and egress, acces-  
sibility standards, methods of service, and the overall dimensions of  
any given space.  
Figures 1 to 19 provide the designer with restaurant planning stan-  
dards that have been developed by many experienced architects and  
interior designers. These drawings not only show the various indi-  
vidual table and chair arrangements, but provide the designer with  
groupings of these arrangements, as well as an indication of overall  
size, floor area, and number of persons accommodated. These  
arrangements, however, should be utilized only for preliminary plan-  
ning information.

Fig. 10 These drawings highlight several critical dimensions that the designer must consider. Aisle circulation must be  
adequate in width; other clearances to consider include chair depth from edge of table and clearance between  
chairs. While laying out chair and table arrangements, a designer must anticipate the potential conflict between a  
patron leaving a seat and a tray-carrying waiter

Dining Room Seating  
# Restaurant and Dining Room Seating  
Dispersed seating suitable for guests with restricted mobility should  
be available in restaurants, coffee shops, and dining facilities. As a  
guide, the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards \(UFAS\) require a  
minimum of 5 percent of restaurant seating to be accessible. Acces-  
sible aisles should connect the entrance to these locations, public rest  
rooms, and self-service areas such as salad bars, condiment stands, or  
buffet tables. Comfortable seating for waiting should be available to  
customers near the entrance.  
A variety of accessible seating should be available, suitable for large  
and small dining groups. Small tables may not be accessible to  
guests in wheelchairs because of the restricted knee space. There-  
fore, a party of one or two may require a table usually set up for four.  
Restaurants or coffee shops with built-in seating, such as booths or  
banquettes, should also provide some chairs for guests who have  
difficulty getting into and out of bench seating. These chairs can be  
removed to seat guests in wheelchairs. Where seating areas are  
raised on platforms, accessible seating and similar services should  
be available on the main-floor level, or a ramp to the upper level  
should be provided.  
Aisles serving accessible seating should be at least 3 ft 0 in wide,  
which typically requires a 6 ft 0 in clearance between parallel tables,  
or 4 ft 6 in between rotated tables. \(See Fig. 21\). Aisle widths should  
also provide room for customers to be seated at tables. At least a 2 ft  
6 in clear space should be available behind each seating location.  
This space allows chairs to be withdrawn from the table and staff to  
assist guests in repositioning chairs close to the table.  
For wheelchair seating, a 3 ft 0 in to 3 ft 6 in aisle is necessary,  
depending on the width of the knee space. \(See Fig. 25.\) Wheelchairs  
positioned at tables project approximately 5 in farther into aisles than  
most chairs. To allow guest with restricted mobility to turn around,  
seating arrangments should also include a 5 ft 0 in-diameter circle to  
T-shaped clear area at dead-end aisles.  
Fig. 20 Restaurants or coffee shops with fixed seating  
should include some movable seating for guests in  
wheelchairs and guests who have difficulty getting into  
and out of the bench seating. Number in parentheses is  
dimension in centimeters

*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
# Dining Tables and Chairs  
Accessible seating locations should allow guests with restricted  
mobility to dine with ambulatory customers. Tables should provide  
knee space for customers in wheelchairs, and dining chairs should be  
coordinated to provide comfortable seating at the same table height.  
Dining room chairs should be stable to maintain balance as guests seat  
themselves, and they should be comfortable to sit in during dinner.  
Chairs should be light and easy to reposition. The seat should have a  
slight slant to the rear to transfer body weight to the back of the chair.  
However, an exaggerated incline makes it difficult to rise. The seat  
should be approximately 16 in deep and at least 16 in wide to allow  
space for customers to reposition themselves during the meal. Padding  
or cushions on the chair seat should be firm, and the chair back should  
also be slightly inclined to the rear. To help guests sit and rise, dining  
chairs should have armrests 7 to 8 in above the front edge of the seat.  
\(See Fig. 22.\) Supports or cross-bracing should not interfere with kick-  
space below the seat, so the feet can be positioned to rise. The front  
edge of the chair seat should be low enough to allow the feet to rest on  
the floor, but not so low that it is difficult to rise. This is determined by  
the lower leg length \(popliteal height\), which varies between 15 and 20  
in for most adults.  
The height of the chair seat should be 101⁄2 to 111⁄2 in below the top  
of the table. Common seat heights vary between 14 and 18 in. Because  
the height of wheelchair seats is typically 19 in, a relatively high chair  
seat is necessary to coordinate with the table height. A chair with an 18-  
in-high seat is comfortable for most ambulatory guests and closely  
approximates the height of a wheelchair seat.  
Dining room tables should have a stable surface at a convenient  
height and knee space and legroom below the tabletop for customers  
in wheelchairs. Narrow table configurations allow face-to-face seat-  
ing, which reduces the distance between diners, making conversation  
easier and table lighting more effective. For safety, the corners and  
edges of the top should be rounded.  
Fig. 21 Aisles serving accessible seating should provide  
a path at least 3 ft 0 in wide for passage and clear space  
for guests to seat themselves at tables. Numbers in  
parentheses are dimensions in centimeters Hospitality Spaces  
RESTAURANTS  
Dining Room Seating  
Full-height wheelchair knee space is 2 ft 6 in, which requires table-  
tops to be at least 2 ft 7 in above the floor—too high for most seating.  
Many wheelchairs now provide adjustable or two-tier armrests,  
which allow customers to sit close to tables in a knee space only 2 ft  
3 in high. To provide this knee space, the tabletop \(without an apron\)  
should be 2 ft 41⁄2 in to 2 ft 5 in above the floor. This is 11 to 111⁄2 in  
above the chair seat, 101⁄2 to 11 in above the seat of wheelchairs, and  
convenient for both. This knee space also permits the armrests of  
chairs to pass below the tabletop so seated customers can draw close.  
This combination of tables and chairs is suitable for the majority of  
wheelchair users and most ambulatory guests. \(See Fig. 23.\)  
Foot room is important for customers with wheelchairs or leg braces.  
The footrests of wheelchairs are 21⁄2 to 3 in above the ground and  
angled slightly forward, which requires 1 ft 7 in of foot room, meas-  
ured from the edge of the tabletop. The outside width of footrests is  
only 1 ft 6 in, but 2 ft 6 in of side-to-side clearance is necessary to  
maneuver into position beneath the table. To provide knee space,  
table legs should be at least 2 ft 6 in apart, and the tabletop, for face-  
to-face seating, should be 3 ft 6 in wide. Pedestal-base tables should  
have low, tapered bases and a minimum diameter of 3 ft 6 in, al-  
though 4 ft 0 in is preferred.  
A portable raised leaf should be available to modify tables for cus-  
tomers in wheelchairs with high armrests. The leaf should be approx-  
imately the size of a place setting, 1 ft 4 in by 2 ft 0 in, and secured  
to the underside of the of an accessible table with clamps. The raised  
leaf should project 6 in beyond the edge of the table and provide 2 ft  
6 in clearance above the floor. \(See Fig. 24.\)  
Fig. 22 Dining room chairs should have a  
seat 101⁄2 to 111⁄2 in below the top of the table  
and armrests 7 to 8 in above the seat. To  
coordinate with an accessible table, the  
seat height should be 18 in. Numbers in  
parentheses are dimensions in centimeters  
Fig. 23 Accessible tables should provide knee space at least 2 ft 3  
in high by 2 ft 6 in wide with 1 ft 7 in of foot room. To increase the  
knee space height, a raised portable leaf can be provided. \(See  
Fig. 24.\) Numbers in parentheses are dimensions in centimeters

Banquettes\: Design Criteria  
Figure 26 shows the basic dimensions for the design of banquette  
seating. The lack of armrests makes it difficult to define seat bound-  
aries. The user, therefore, tends to establish a territory by assuming a  
desired sitting posture and placing personal articles—such as a brief-  
case, purse, or package—next to him or her. Since the nature of this  
type of seating can permit some form of body contact, hidden dimen-  
sions and personal space also play an important part in how close the  
users sharing the banquette will sit.  
Because of the many hidden psychological factors involved, the  
actual efficiency of this seating type in terms of capacity is question-  
able. Figure 27 indicates two possible seating situations, each dic-  
tated by the anthropometrics involved. One arrangment is based on  
the premise that the user’s elbows will be extended, possibly in con-  
junction with some activity, such as reading, or simply as an attempt  
to stake out additional territory, as would be the case in the strategic  
positioning of some personal article on the seat. In this situation it

would be reasonable to assume that each user would take up about 30  
in, or 76.2 cm, of space. The other diagram shows a more compact  
seating arrangement. Figure 26 shows a section through a typical  
banquette.  
Banquette seating provides the designer with one of the few opportu-  
nities to custom design restaurant seating. While there can be a great  
variety of aesthetic solutions achieved through use of various materi-  
als, ergonomic considerations must be analyzed carefully. Specific  
attention should be given to depth of seat, slope of seat and back,  
height of back, and relationship of seat height to table height.

Banquette/Bench Seating Details  
Banquette seating can be detailed relatively simply, as Figs. 28 to 30  
suggest. The simplest banquette may take the form of a plywood  
seating platform with a removable seat cushion or a box cushion seat  
and back support. Such seating is appropriate in fast-food or quick-  
turnover restaurant operations.

Lunch Counters\: Design Criteria  
# LUNCH COUNTERS\:  
# DESIGN CRITERIA  
Figure 31 shows some of the basic clear-  
ances required for a typical counter\: 36 in,  
or 91.4 cm, for work space behind the  
counter; 18 to 24 in, or 45.7 to 61 cm, for  
the countertop; and 60 to 66 in, or 152.4 to  
167.6 cm, between the front face of the  
counter and the nearest obstruction. Figure  
32 shows a section through the counter and  
back counter. Most counters are about 42  
in, or 106.7 cm, in height. The clearance  
from the top of the seat to the underside of  
the countertop and the depth of the counter-  
top overhang are extremely important. But-  
tock-knee length and thigh clearance are  
the key anthropometric measurements to  
consider for proper body fit. Footrest  
heights should take into consideration  
popliteal height. In most cases this is  
ignored, and 42-in counters are provided  
with 7-in, or 17.8-cm, footrests that are 23  
in, or 58.4 cm, below the seat surface, which  
cannot work. The popliteal height of the  
larger user, based on 99th-percentile data, is  
only about 20 in, or 50.8 cm. Therefore, the  
feet dangle unsupported several inches  
above the footrest and the body is deprived  
of any stability. The footrest shown in Fig.  
32, although higher, only serves a portion of  
the seated users and is intended primarily  
for standing patrons. The most logical solu-  
tion is a separate footrest, integral with the  
stool.

Wheelchair Accessibility to Self-Service Areas  
# Self-Service Areas  
Salad bars, buffet lines, condiment stands, and other self-service  
areas should be accessible. Cafeteria or food-service lines should  
have a minimum width of 3 ft 0 in, but a width of 3 ft 6 in is recom-  
mended to permit ambulatory customers to pass customers in wheel-  
chairs.  
The tray slide should be 2 ft 10 in above the floor, the maximum  
height for customers in wheelchairs and convenient for ambulatory  
guests. The tray slide should be continuous, if possible, from the  
entrance to the cashier. Tray slides restrict access to the counters and  
therefore should not be wider than necessary \(1 ft 0 in recom-  
mended\). In this instance, the reach of a customer in a wheelchair is  
extended if the wheelchair can be angled or positioned perpendicular  
to the tray slide. This is possible if the lower face of the counter is  
recessed to provide low knee space. \(See Fig. 34.\)  
For guests with a limited range of motion, food, beverages, utensils,  
or other items should be displayed near the edge of the counter where  
they are easier to see and reach. When duplicate items are displayed,  
a vertical rather than horizontal arrangement allows customers to  
select items at the most convenient height. Self-service systems, such  
as beverage or ice dispensers, should be easy to operate without fine  
hand function. Instructions and price information should be promi-  
nently displayed in large, clear lettering.  
Salad bars and buffets should provide a 3 ft 0 in wide clear space  
for access on all sides and plate slides, or areas to temporarily set  
plates, at a maximum height of 2 ft 10 in. This permits customers to  
serve themselves with one hand, without simultaneously balancing  
the plate or bowl. Knee space 2 ft 3 in high below the counter or  
table allows front wheelchair approach, to increase customers’ for-  
ward reach. Condiments should be located as low and close to the  
edge of the counter or table as practical. A tilted mirror above the  
food display at salad bars also aids customers in wheelchairs and  
children. \(See Fig. 35.\) For some customers with restricted mobil-  
ity, poor balance, or limited hand function, it is more difficult to  
carry a plate. Therefore, trays should be available at both salad bars  
and buffets.  
Fig. 34 Cafeteria lines should be wide enough to accommodate guests in wheelchairs. Food and beverages should  
be within a convenient vertical and horizontal reach. Numbers in parentheses are dimensions in centimeters

Bar Section Details  
The distance between bar and backbar should allow adequate work  
space. A minimum of 36 in, or 90 cm, should provide space for one  
bartender to serve and another to circulate behind. Maximum body  
depth and maximum body breadth are the primary anthropometric  
considerations in establishing clearance. A one-bartender operation  
would require a 30-in, or 75-cm, clearance. \(See Fig. 1.\)  
In regard to bar stools, clearance between the stool seats is more crit-  
ical than center line spacing, and it should allow patrons of larger  
body size a comfortable side approach and departure from the stool  
without body contact with the next person. A 12-in, or 30-cm wide  
stool on 24-in, or 61-cm, centers \(which is quite common\) will allow  
only less than 5 percent of male users access to the stool without dis-

turbing the next patron, while a 30-in, or 75-cm, spacing will accom-  
modate 95 percent of the users. The tradeoff, however, would be the  
loss of two seats for every 120 in, or 300 cm, of bar length. A spacing  
of 12-in stools on 28-in, or 70-cm, centers is suggested as a compro-  
mise. The ultimate decision is an individual one and must reconcile  
human factors with economic viability.  
To ensure proper circulation and interface, adequate clearances in  
front of the bar are illustrated in Fig. 2. A customer activity zone of  
18 to 24 in, or 45.7 to 61.0 cm, should be provided to allow for seat-  
ing, standing, and access, in addition to a general circulation zone of  
at least 30 in, or 76.2 cm. If a supplementary drinking surface or shelf  
is provided, a smaller activity zone of 18 in is suggested in front of  
the shelf. The shelf can be 10 to 12 in, or 25.4 to 30.5 cm, deep. Fig-  
ure 3 shows suggested clearances for 18- or 24-in cocktail tables.

The detailing of bars and backbars can vary from the very simple and  
basic to the complicated and intricate. Figures 23 to 40 provide the  
designer with selected examples of working drawings from some of  
the most experienced restaurant and hospitality design firms in the  
world. Careful review of these drawings would suggest that overall  
dimensions and clearances vary from detail to detail. In that regard,  
individual requirements based on bar type and the hospitality area  
serviced must be given careful consideration. In addition, local  
building codes and health codes must be consulted.

Guest Room Plans  
It is interesting to note how trends in hotel design have headed off in  
two directions, especially in regard to the design of rooms. On one  
hand, an effort is being made to provide more luxurious multipurpose  
rooms and suites. The hotel room as office away from work or as fan-  
tasy sleeping/relaxation environment often results in rooms with work  
areas, living rooms, and hot tubs, just to name a few of the more pop-  
ular amenities. On the other hand, there is a trend toward economy  
accommodations. Hotel rooms are being designed as a place to rest and  
sleep, a place to feel comfortable and safe at a reasonable cost. Accord-  
ingly, these rooms use less floor area and provide fewer secondary or  
frill items. With both of these approaches, however, designers must  
ensure that the room or suite layouts are accessible to the physically  
challenged. In that regard, various room layouts and bathroom plans  
are provided in this section that address this issue. \(See Figs. 1 to 4.\)

Accessible Guest Room Plans  
Accessible guest rooms have design features and floor plans that pro-  
vide the maneuvering clearances for guests with limited mobility.  
Figures 5 to 9 show sample plans of guest rooms and bathrooms with  
the required\:  
• Widths and clearances at the entry, connecting, closet, and bath-  
room doors  
• Maneuvering space in front of the closet, in the sleeping area, and  
within the bathroom  
• Clearances to use and transfer to fixtures in the bathroom  
• Clearances to open dresser drawers, to maneuver into knee space  
at the desk, and to access the bed, bedside table, windows, blinds,  
and thermostat  
Clearances may depend on the design of specific furnishings. The  
width of the access aisle at the bed is determined by the design of  
the bedside table. Access to dressers is determined by the width of  
the drawer. The maneuvering space to turn into the desk is deter-  
mined by the width of the knee space.

Fig. 6 This alternative 12 ft 0 in bay-spacing design  
requires the dresser to be offset from the foot of the bed.  
The bathroom wall is stepped back to provide clear-  
ances for the bathroom door and connecting door. The  
heating/cooling unit projects into the room to allow  
access to the thermostat. If balconies are provided, a  
minimum depth of 5 ft 0 in is recommended to allow  
guests with wheelchairs to turn around  
Fig. 7 A 13 ft 0 in bay spacing provides room for wheel-  
chair clearances, including a turning space in front of the  
closet and at the foot of the beds, an access aisle between  
the beds, a T-turnaround at the window aisle for access to  
temperature controls and blinds and drapes, door clear-

than standard\) is suitable for both ambulatory guests and guests in wheelchairs. A pull-out lapboard at a height of 2  
ft 6 in provides a work space for guests in wheelchairs. The kitchenette should include a 5 ft 0 in turning space

Registration Desk  
The hotel registration desk serves as both a symbol of hospitality  
for the arriving guest and the operational nerve center for the hotel.  
With the advent of electronic check-in procedures, credit cards, and  
computer-aided management, the registration desk has become a  
sophisticated electronic workstation not unlike a trading table or an  
airline reservations desk. At the same time, this electronic data pro-  
cessing capability is meant to be maintained at low visibility for  
reasons of hotel image and confidentiality. Accordingly, the  
designer must be able to project the appropriate hospitality image  
while at the same time integrating all of the required technologies.  
Figures 10 to 13 show examples of architectural working drawings  
and details that meet many of these requirements.  
The design of a front desk or registration desk can take many forms  
and be constructed with a variety of materials. Regardless of the  
design vocabulary used or architectural style, certain important  
design considerations must be observed.  
1\. The number of persons actively staffing the counterlike facility  
will dictate both the width and overall depth of the front desk. It  
is suggested that between 5 and 7 ft be allocated per staff work-  
station and that one workstation be allocated for every 125 to 150  
rooms. For every additional 125 to 150 rooms, an additional  
workstation should be provided. Peak check-in/check-out loads  
could require even more staff workstations.

HOTELS  
Registration Desk  
2\. 3. 4. The front desk should be easily accessible from and to the main  
hotel entrance. “Easily accessible” strongly implies clear visibility.  
Elevators servicing the hotel guest rooms should be readily visi-  
ble from the front desk. This is not always feasible in extremely  
large hotels.  
The front desk should be designed in such a way as to take into  
consideration the various users it will accommodate. Special  
attention should be given to the fact that hotel guests may be  
physically challenged or chairbound. The overall height, writing  
surfaces, and overhangs should be designed to accommodate a  
hotel guest seated in a wheelchair.  
5\. The basic front desk design should avoid, wherever possible,  
visual obstructions that block sight lines or create blind spots.  
Accordingly, columns and high walls should be avoided.

6\. Equipment and custom elements that are typically incorporated  
within the front desk include computer monitors/CRTs with key-  
boards and printer, room racks, reservation racks, information  
racks, room status displays, mail drawers, key drawers, alpha  
guest listings, message-waiting display, credit card imprinters,  
fax and telex, guest/employee paging system, automatic wake-up  
system, electric receptacles, cable chases, alarm systems, and file

SHOPS  
Planning Data  
The essential function of retail spaces is to display and sell merchan-  
dise. The design of these spaces involves the manipulation and coor-  
dination of architectural, interior design, and merchandising elements  
as necessary to meet the programmatic needs of the client. It is criti-  
cal that the space in which the customer and store personnel function  
is of the highest quality. Ensuring this quality requires a knowledge of  
the planning and design of the various interior components that con-  
stitute the building blocks of retail spaces.  
Figure 1 shows the clearances involved for a 42-in, or 106.7-cm, high  
counter to service a seated user. By filling the recess with an addi-  
tional display, however, the counter can also be used exclusively as a  
typical sales counter. It should be noted, however, that, although  
sometimes used for special display situations, such a counter height  
is not recommended. Both the customer and the sales clerk of smaller  
body size would find coping with such a height uncomfortable  
anthropometrically, particularly when one considers that the counter  
would be higher than the elbow height of slightly more than 5 per-  
cent of the population. From a merchandising viewpoint, where cus-  
tomer convenience is of paramount importance, it would be unwise  
to exceed 39 to 40 in, or 99 to 101.6 cm, as a counter height. In addi-  
tion, the smaller sales clerk forced to tend such a counter for  
extended periods of time could be subjected to severe backaches and  
pains. Getting on and off a high stool for elderly and disabled people  
or those of smaller body size can be not only difficult, but hazardous.

Planning Data  
Figure 3 shows the clearances required for a medium-height display  
counter. The suggested seat height of 21 to 22 in, or 53.3 to 55.8 cm,  
requires a footrest for the seated customer. The counter height shown  
will allow the display to be viewed by both the seated customer and  
the standing sales clerk. The customer activity zone allows adequate  
space for the chair. Knee height, buttock-knee length, popliteal  
height, and eye height sitting are all significant human dimensions to  
consider in the design of counters to be used by a seated customer.  
Figure 4 shows a low 30-in, or 76.2-cm, display counter also for use  
by a seated customer. The anthropometric considerations are the  
same. Although the counter height is responsive to the anthropomet-  
ric requirements of the seated customer, it is less than ideal for the  
standing clerk. For the standing user’s optimum comfort, the counter  
height should be about 2 or 3 in, or 5 to 7.6 cm, below elbow height.  
This will allow a person to handle objects comfortably on the counter  
surface or use the counter as support for his or her arms. The 30-in  
height is too low to permit such use.

Planning Data  
Shelving is probably used more than any other single interior com-  
ponent for the storage and/or display of merchandise. Not only must  
the merchandise be within reach anthropometrically, but it must be  
fairly visible as well. The heights established must therefore be  
responsive to vertical grip reach dimensions as well as to eye height.  
In establishing height limits, the body size data of the smaller person  
should be used. Since, in retail spaces, departments may cater exclu-  
sively to members of one sex or the other, two sets of data are pre-  
sented. One is based on the body size of the smaller female and the  
other on the body size of the smaller male. The suggested heights  
reflect a compromise between reach requirements and visibility  
requirements. \(See Fig. 5.\)  
Figure 6 illustrates the clearances involved in hanging-type mer-  
chandise cases. Rod heights should be related not only to human  
reach limitations, but in certain cases to the sizes of the merchandise  
displayed. There is usually no conflict in respect to garments.

Plumbing Fixture and Accessory Heights  
While Fig. 1 provides specific vertical dimensions of both plumbing  
fixtures and accessories, the designer is cautioned that every plumb-  
ing fixture and accessory must be carefully analyzed in light of the  
users to be served. Plumbing contractors will follow the manufac-  
turer’s recommendations or their own standards unless the designer  
provides this information on the working drawings. In large-scale  
projects, it is suggested that the designer carefully provide all fixture  
mounting heights on all interior elevations or on a separate diagra-  
matic drawing, such as is shown in Fig. 1.

Plans and Elevations  
The women’s room shown in Fig. 9 requires approximately 250 ft2  
for the toilet area and about the same for the vanity area. Wall eleva-  
tions for the two areas are shown in Fig. 10. The designer should  
carefully analyze the number of lavatories and water closets specified  
for a given facility. Research suggests that most fixture counts pro-  
vided by city or state codes are too low and do not adequately reflect  
the amount of time that women require. As a result, it is not unusual  
to see long lines in front of women’s rooms, particularly those that  
service places of public assembly. Note that the plan in Fig. 9 pro-  
vides supplemental vanity or counter surfaces.

Wheel Chair-Accessible Design  
The design data contained on the following pages are intended to  
illustrate functional accessibility concepts. Some examples illustrate  
minimum federal requirements, while others are culled from among  
the various state standards. Designers are cautioned to consult local  
standards in their respective jurisdictions.  
The current minimum federal standard is ANSI A117.1-1986, pub-  
lished by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. It specifies  
a stall typified by detail a/3. This “front transfer” type stall requires a  
water closet mounted at 1 ft 8 in a.f.f., preferably wall hung. Stall  
doors must be outswinging.  
Because a significant portion of people using wheelchairs cannot  
transfer in this manner, the side transfer stall \(b/3\) has been devel-  
oped. Clear stall dimensions and seat heights vary somewhat with  
jurisdiction. Most standards that address side transfer stalls require  
lower seat heights with 15- to 17-in mounting heights being typical.  
We recommend locking devices for doors that do not require twisting  
and grasping motions, avoidance of foot-operated flush valves,  
installation of ceiling or wall-hung partitions as practical, and avoid-  
ance of curtains in lieu of doors.  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 705* Public Rest Rooms, Toilets, and Coatrooms  
REST ROOMS AND TOILETS  
Wheel Chair-Accessible Design  
Federal standards mandate grab bars of 11⁄2-in o.d. The bars must be  
securely mounted 11⁄2-in clear from the wall or partition. This mount-  
ing distance is critical, as it provides a cradle for a forearm during  
transfer or if a user loses her or his grip.  
Lavatories need not be specialized designs to be accessible. Utiliza-  
tion of clearances shown will do much to make lavatories accessible.  
Because persons with loss of sensation in their legs cannot feel pain  
\(and because they heal at a slower rate\), hot water lines and drains  
must be insulated. Also, under several state codes, faucets are  
required to be lever, blade, or multiarm handle operated.  
Single lever controls are preferable. Spring-operated faucets must  
have time delay devices.  
At least one mirror must be located with the reflecting surface  
mounted at 3 ft 4 in a.f.f. \(3 ft 2 in or lower preferable\). Where pos-  
sible, full-length mirrors are preferable.  
At least one of each type of toilet accessory must also be located at 3  
ft 4 in a.f.f. or less. Note that this dimension is measured to the high-  
est control required for operation. Controls that require twisting and  
grasping motions should be avoided.  
Because people that use wheelchairs require increased fluid intake,  
drinking fountains become more than convenience items. While  
there is not space here to address all configurations, the following  
concerns are typical to all\: controls should be operable without the  
need for precise grasping; the faucet should not direct spray away  
from the user and must be located as near the front edge as practical;  
the units must be free of sharp edges and corners and overhead  
obstructions.  
Urinals, if provided, should have elongated bowls with the opening  
of the basin located at 19 in a.f.f. or less, or mounted level with the  
main floor. Many state standards specify maximum mounting heights  
of 15 to 16 in a.f.f. These lower dimensions are preferable.  
The toilet room itself should provide a clear floor area with minimum  
dimensions of 60 in × 60 in to facilitate maneuvering wheelchairs.  
Additionally, provide a minimum of 3 ft 6 in clearance in front of  
accessible toilet stalls to facilitate entry.  
Similarly, adequate clearances must be provided at entrances. The  
spaces shown in details l/3 to o/3 represent typical dimensions spec-  
ified in state codes. Note, however, that federal and many state stan-  
dards require 12-in clear jamb areas adjoining both sides of all doors.  
A clearance of 18 in or more on the strike side of a door is more  
effective. In vestibules having doors in series, there must be space for  
a wheelchair to clear one door prior to opening another.

# BARRIER-FREE PUBLIC REST ROOM FLOOR PLANS  
# Design Solutions for Large Public Washrooms  
When designing large washrooms with multiple compartments and  
lavatories, follow this simple check list\:  
• Entrances and exits are properly laid out for universal access.  
• Passageways and access aisles are at least 48 in \(1067 mm\) wide.  
• There is 80 in \(2032 mm\) minimum clear height throughout all  
circulation routes, passageways, and access aisles.  
• Wheelchair turning spaces are provided wherever required.  
• Accessories are fully recessed into the walls wherever possible.  
• Each type of accessory meets or exceeds ADAAG specifications.  
• 30 in × 48 in \(760 × 1219 mm\) minimum clear floor space is pro-  
vided for each accessory.  
• Lavatories, urinals, and toilet compartments meet or exceed  
ADAAG specifications.  
• If there are six or more toilet compartments, there is a 36-in \(914-  
mm\) compartment similar to the alternate compartment 36 in \(914  
mm\) wide in addition to the standard accessible compartment.  
The following three plans illustrate barrier-free washrooms with sug-  
gested universal-design features that meet or exceed ADAAG speci-  
fications.

# Design Solutions for Small Public Washrooms and Individual  
# Toilet Rooms  
*Small Public Washrooms*  
These require one standard 60 in \(1524 mm\) wide toilet compartment  
because it is the most universally usable. Minimum 60 in \(1524 mm\)  
diameter or T-shaped turning spaces are also required, as well as a  
barrier-free lavatory, accessories, and access aisles that meet ADAAG  
specifications. Entry doors should swing into vestibules, not directly  
into corridors, access aisles, or clear floor spaces required by lavato-  
ries and other washroom equipment.  
*Individual Toilet Rooms*  
Under ADAAG, the minimum size of individual toilet rooms is deter-  
mined by combining the clear floor spaces required for each feature  
or fixture, the turning space, and maneuvering clearances at doors.  
In-swinging entry doors must not swing into any clear floor space  
required for lavatories and other washroom equipment. Outswinging  
entry doors may be used only if they swing into another room, such  
as a patient’s room or a private office, vestibule, or alcove, but never  
into a corridor. Locating the lavatory next to the toilet will eliminate  
the option of a parallel approach to the toilet by people using wheel-  
chairs; therefore, to maximize usability, design individual toilet rooms  
so there is a minimum clearance of 60 in \(1524 mm\) from side wall of  
toilet to the adjacent lavatory, or locate lavatory on a different wall  
altogether. This 60 in \(1524 mm\) minimum dimension is a require-  
ment in the ICC/ANSI 98 Standard. Additionally, the clear floor space  
required for toilets not located in compartments is larger than those in  
the ADAAG. In ICC/ANSI 98 no fixture can obstruct the 60 in × 56 in  
\(1524–1422 mm\) minimum clear floor space for toilets. These differ-  
ences may result in larger minimum room sizes when following the  
ICC/ANSI 98 Standard than may result from ADAAG specifications.  
Drawings in this section reflect these differences. Because individual  
toilet rooms provide privacy for a physically disabled person who  
needs the help of an attendant \(or even a child who needs the help of  
a parent\), especially when they are of the opposite sex, it may be use-  
ful to provide this type of unisex or family toilet room in addition to  
multicompartment washrooms in many large public buildings.  
As in all barrier-free facilities, small public washrooms and individ-  
ual toilet rooms should meet or exceed ADAAG specifications for  
entrance and exit, lavatories, toilets, grab bars, accessories, controls,  
and operating mechanisms.

Toilet Accessories  
In Figs. 23 to 29, various generic toilet accessories and grab bar con-  
figurations are illustrated. While most manufacturers have similar  
accessories and grab bars within their catalogs, overall dimensions  
and methods of installation vary greatly. Placement of accessories in  
relationship to plumbing fixtures, door swings, and interior circula-  
tion is to be carefully studied by the designer.

*Note\:* The above floor areas are approximate and should only be used for preliminary space  
planning requirements.  
Since the number of coats per linear foot of hanging can vary from 4 to 8, the floor area can vary  
dramatically. A lightweight overcoat, for example, can measure 1-1.5 inches in width. A medium  
weight to heavyweight coat might measure from 2 to 4 inches. A fur coat might require a minimum  
of 4-6 in. The designer must consider the overall size of coatroom based upon the following critical  
factors\: \(1\) geographic location/climate; \(2\) attendants required or not required; \(3\) aisle clearance;  
\(4\) peak entry/exit loads for coat retrieval; \(5\) assumed garment thickness or garments per linear  
foot; \(6\) linear feet of counter surface and overhead shelving; and \(7\) other storage components, i.e.,  
hats, umbrellas, briefcases, packages, etc.

receptionist in an office. In those situations where a supervised self-  
service coatroom is inappropriate or cannot be provided, self-service  
keyed locks offer a viable alternative. In addition to being able to pro-  
vide secure coat storage, lockers can also store briefcases, packages, or  
other encumbrances.  
# TYPES OF CHECKROOM SYSTEMS  
Coatrooms typically fall into two categories\: those that are self-  
service and those that are controlled by one or more attendants. The  
latter category of coatroom can be more compact because only one,  
or perhaps two, attendants have access to the coats. A self-service  
coatroom must have more space between rows of coats so that sev-  
eral persons can enter and get their coats.  
Self-service coatrooms are susceptible to theft of property, particularly  
expensive outerwear. Therefore, it is desirable that these coatrooms be  
visible to someone at all times, such as a maitre d’ in a restaurant or a  
Three basic types of manufactured or prefabricated coat storage units  
are shown in Figs. 1 to 3. Exact coat storage capacities are provided  
by the manufacturer. All units can be customized to suit various room  
configurations. Note the adjoining counter space to speed operations.  
Coat capacities relative to length are listed in Table 2.

Characteristics of Interior Partitions  
# PARTITIONS AND WALL FINISHES  
Selecting the appropriate partition or wall type is both a science and  
an art. In fact, there are so many options available to the designer that  
it is not unusual to refer to the partition or wall as a system, a combi-  
nation of framing, sheathing, and finish elements, all working  
together to meet aesthetic, functional, code, and economic require-  
ments.  
In that regard, this section explores the great variety of wall and par-  
tition types, examining all of their characteristics with the exception  
of load-bearing capacity and cost of labor and materials. With respect  
to load-bearing or structural capacities, while many of the wall and  
partition types are able to carry superimposed loads, it is not the  
intent of this book to discuss structural issues. With respect to cost,  
too many factors and variables make this a topic that is difficult to  
analyze with any precision.  
Information on both traditional and contemporary partitions and wall  
types is provided. Many traditional materials and methods of con-  
struction, such as solid gypsum plaster and plaster on clay tile, are  
cited, thus providing information to the designer who is redesigning  
or altering older structures.  
A large portion of this section is devoted to the detailing of contem-  
porary partition systems. In addition to providing examples of parti-  
tion types, these pages place great emphasis on the detailing of  
unusual interface conditions that many designers often leave to the  
contractor to work out in the field. It should be noted that most, if not  
all, of these details have been selected from the working drawings of  
outstanding architectural and interior design firms.  
While general information has also been provided about acoustics,  
sound transmission, and fire ratings of various walls and partitions,  
the designer is cautioned to verify all such information with manu-  
facturers’ certified test results, as well as with those building and fire  
codes having jurisdiction. It also should be noted that while test  
results may demonstrate a certain fire rating or sound transmission  
classification, it is important to determine if the results have been  
accepted by the local building or fire department.  
It is often necessary to apply a finish to a wall or partition. Again,  
both traditional and contemporary methods to apply wood paneling,  
ceramic tile, and stone are clearly illustrated through the use of archi-  
tectural details.  
Finally, walls and partitions must ultimately meet floors and ceilings,  
and, of course, have doors and openings penetrate them. While some  
examples are provided in this section, the designer will also find  
important information in the sections entitled “Floors and Floor Fin-  
ishes,” “Doors,” and “Ceilings,” which follow.

Sound Insulation and Transmission  
The resistance of a building element, such as a wall, to the passage of  
airborne sound is rated by its *sound transmission class* \(STC\). Thus,  
the higher the number, the better the sound barrier. The approximate  
effectiveness of walls with varying STC numbers is shown in the fol-  
lowing tabulation\:  
*STC no. Effectiveness*  
25 35 45 48 Normal speech can be understood quite easily  
Loud speech audible but not intelligible  
Must strain to hear loud speech  
Some loud speech barely audible  
50 Loud speech not audible  
Sound travels readily through the air and also through some materi-  
als. When airborne sound strikes a conventional wall, the studs act as  
sound conductors unless they are separated in some way from the  
covering material.  
# Wall Construction  
As the preceding STC tabulation shows, a wall providing sufficient  
resistance to airborne sound transfer likely has an STC rating of 45 or  
greater. Thus, in construction of such a wall between the rooms of a  
house, its cost as related to the STC rating should be considered. As  
shown in Fig. 15, details A, with gypsum wallboard, and B, with plas-  
tered wall, are those commonly used for partition walls. However, the  
hypothetical rating of 45 cannot be obtained in this construction.  
Good STC ratings can be obtained in a wood-frame wall by using the  
combination of materials shown in Fig. 15D and E. One-half-inch  
sound-deadening board nailed to the studs, followed by a lamination of  
1⁄2-in gypsum wallboard, will provide an STC value of 46 at a relatively  
low cost. A slightly better rating can be obtained by using 5⁄8-in gypsum  
wallboard rather than 1⁄2-in. A very satisfactory STC rating of 52 can be  
obtained by using resilient clips to fasten gypsum backer boards to the  
studs, followed by adhesive-laminated 1⁄2-in fiberboard \(Fig. 15E\). This  
method further isolates the wall covering from the framing.  
A similar isolation system consists of resilient channels nailed hori-  
zontally to 2- by 4-in studs spaced 16 in on center. Channels are  
spaced 24 in apart vertically and 5⁄8-in gypsum wallboard is screwed  
to the channels. An STC rating of 47 is thus obtained at a moderately  
low cost.  
Thus, use of a double wall, which may consist of a 2 by 6 or wider  
plate and staggered 2- by 4-in studs, is sometimes desirable. One-  
half-inch gypsum wallboard on each side of this wall \(Fig. 16A\)  
results in an STC value of 45. However, two layers of 5⁄8-in gypsum  
wallboard add little, if any, additional sound-transfer resistance \(Fig.  
16B\). When 11⁄2-in blanket insulation is added to this construction  
\(Fig. 16C\), the STC rating increases to 49. This insulation may be  
installed as shown or placed between studs on one wall. A single wall  
with 31⁄2 in of insulation will show a marked improvement over an  
open stud space and is low in cost.  
The use of 1⁄2-in sound-deadening board and a lamination of gypsum  
wallboard in the double wall will result in an STC rating of 50 \(Fig.  
16D\). The addition of blanket insulation to this combination will  
likely provide an even higher value, perhaps 53 or 54.

FLOORS AND FLOOR FINISHES  
Typical Characteristics of Floor Finishes  
# FLOORS AND FLOOR FINISHES  
The designer must be familiar with the great variety of floor types,  
finishes, and patterns in order to specify and detail architectural  
flooring properly. While some examples of “soft finishes” such as  
carpeting and resilient flooring are shown, this section explores in  
depth the installation and detailing of “hard” or architectural finishes.  
It is important for the designer to research the various characteristics  
of the floor finish being specified. While aesthetics and color are  
obviously important considerations, the designer must also analyze  
other factors. Among these factors are wear resistance and durability,  
soil resistance, maintenance, resiliency, flammability, costs of instal-  
lation, and life cycle cost. Once these factors have been analyzed, the  
final specification and detailing of the architectural finish must be  
developed.  
Examples of standard patterns are provided, but the designer must  
become familiar with the infinite number of pattern possibilities. The  
inherent limitations of materials control their sizes and thicknesses.  
The patterns of certain materials are dictated by both the thickness of  
the material and the weight or “dead load” of the material superim-  
posed on the structure. For example, a large pattern of marble or  
granite will necessitate a slab of material that will weigh much more  
per square foot than that of a smaller pattern. This greater weight  
might have structural consequences, as well as make floor transitions  
more significant.  
Transitions between flooring materials, particularly under doors or at  
entrances, and transitions between flooring and walls are some of the  
key material interfaces that have to be detailed. Again, this section  
provides such information using both traditional and contemporary  
approaches.  
Finally, a portion of this section is devoted to the detailing of raised  
computer room floors. While not traditionally a floor finish, raised  
computer room floors seem appropriate for this section. While  
generic architectural details are provided, the designer should always  
develop final details in conjunction with the manufacturer\(s\) being  
specified.

Terrazzo Floors and Base Details  
The edges of terrazzo at a wall may be trimmed with any base mate-  
rial, but are most often finished with a terrazzo base. Base is avail-  
able precast, or it may be poured in place with the same material used  
for the body of the floor. It is difficult to grind the top edge of poured-  
in-place base because of the proximity of finish wall materials. A  
metal base cap is usually used to eliminate the need for grinding the  
base top. A divider strip should be located between the main floor  
and the flush precast or poured base.  
Where terrazzo meets other flooring it is best if the two materials are  
flush. A terrazzo divider strip can serve as a transition between the  
two surfaces. If the terrazzo is not flush with the adjacent flooring, its  
edge may be treated similar to that of tile or masonry.  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 825* Construction Details and Finishes  
FLOORS AND FLOOR FINISHES  
Terrazzo Floor Details  
The most durable terrazzo floors are installed over a mortar base. The  
mortar base adds strength and helps to isolate the terrazzo topping  
from the structure and minimize cracking. The mortar base can be  
applied directly to a concrete slab or over a thin sand cushion, further  
isolating the terrazzo from the structure. Over a wood subfloor, a  
mortar base provides stiffness and a cementitious surface to which  
the terrazzo topping can adhere. A mortar base installed over a sand  
cushion or wood structure needs reinforcement, but no reinforcement  
is required when the mortar is directly on a concrete slab.  
To apply the terrazzo, a thin \(1⁄4 to 5⁄8 in\) mixture of terrazzo is placed  
on the mortar base or concrete subfloor and is compressed with a  
roller to force out excess water and cement. The compressed wet sur-  
face is troweled flat and even with the tops of the divider strips. The  
cured terrazzo is machine ground to achieve a smooth, polished fin-  
ish. A clear sealer is applied to prevent the cement matrix from stain-  
ing or absorbing moisture \(the marble or granite aggregate is not  
porous and will not absorb the sealer\).

Wood Strip Floor Construction Details  
Perhaps the most widely used pattern is a 25⁄32- by 21⁄4-in *strip flooring.*  
These strips are laid lengthwise in a room and normally at right  
angles to the floor joists. Some type of a subfloor of diagonal boards  
or plywood is normally used under the finish floor. Strip flooring of  
this type is tongued-and-grooved and end-matched \(Fig. 5\). Strips  
are random length and may vary from 2 to 16 ft or more. End-  
matched strip flooring in 25⁄32-in thickness is generally hollow backed  
\(Fig. 5*A*\). The face is slightly wider than the bottom so that tight  
joints result when flooring is laid. The tongue fits tightly into the  
groove to prevent movement and floor squeaks. All of these details  
are designed to provide beautiful finished floors that require a mini-  
mum of maintenance.  
Another matched pattern may be obtained in 3⁄8- by 2-in size \(Fig. 5*B*\).  
This is commonly used for remodeling work or when subfloor is edge-  
blocked or thick enough to provide very little deflection under loads.  
*Square-edged strip flooring* \(Fig. 5*C*\) might also be used occasion-  
ally. It is usually 3⁄8 by 2 in in size and is laid up over a substantial sub-  
floor. Facenailing is required for this type.

Floor Construction Sound Insulation  
Sound insulation between an upper floor and the ceiling of a lower  
floor not only involves resistance of airborne sounds but also that of  
impact noises. Thus, impact noise control must be considered as  
well as the STC value. Impact noise is caused by an object striking  
or sliding along a wall or floor surface, such as by dropped objects,  
footsteps, or moving furniture. It may also be caused by the vibra-  
tion of a dishwasher, bathtub, food-disposal apparatus, or other  
equipment. In all instances, the floor is set into vibration by the  
impact or contact and sound is radiated from both sides of the floor.  
A method of measuring impact noise has been developed and is com-  
monly expressed as the *impact noise ratings* \(*INR*\). The greater the  
positive value of the INR, the more resistant is the floor to impact  
noise transfer. For example, an INR of −2 is better than one of −17,  
and one of +5 INR is a further improvement in resistance to impact  
noise transfer.  
Figure 7 shows STC and approximate INR\(db\) values for several  
types of floor constructions. Figure 7*A,* perhaps a minimum floor  
assembly with tongued-and-grooved floor and 3⁄8-in gypsum board  
ceiling, has an STC value of 30 and an approximate INR value of  
−18\. This is improved somewhat by the construction shown in Fig.  
7*B,* and still further by the combination of materials in Fig. 7*C.*  
The value of isolating the ceiling joists from a gypsum lath and plas-  
ter ceiling by means of spring clips is illustrated in Fig. 8*A.* An STC  
value of 52 and an approximate INR value of −2 result.  
Foam-rubber padding and carpeting improve both the STC and the  
INR values. The STC value increases from 31 to 45 and the approx-  
imate INR from −17 to +5 \(Fig. 8*B* and *C*\). This can likely be further  
improved by using an isolated ceiling finish with spring clips. The  
use of sound-deadening board and a lamination of gypsum board for  
the ceiling would also improve resistance to sound transfer.  
An economical construction similar to \(but an improvement over\)  
Fig. 8*C,* with an STC value of 48 and an approximate INR of +18,  
consists of the following\: \(a\) a pad and carpet over 5⁄8-in tongued-and-  
grooved plywood underlayment, \(b\) 3-in fiberglass insulating batts  
between joists, \(c\) resilient channels spaced 24 in apart, across the  
bottom of the joists, and \(d\) 5⁄8-in gypsum board screwed to the bot-  
tom of the channels and finished with taped joints.  
The use of separate floor joists with staggered ceiling joists below  
provides reasonable values but adds a good deal to construction  
costs. Separate joists with insulation between and a soundboard  
between subfloor and finish provide an STC rating of 53 and an  
approximate INR value of −3.

Floor Construction Sound Insulation  
# Sound Absorption  
Design of the “quiet” house can incorporate another system of sound  
insulation, namely, sound absorption. Sound-absorbing materials can  
minimize the amount of noise by stopping the reflection of sound  
back into a room. Sound-absorbing materials do not necessarily have  
resistance to airborne sounds. Perhaps the most commonly used  
sound-absorbing material is acoustic tile. Wood fiber or similar mate-  
rials are used in the manufacture of the tile, which is usually  
processed to provide some fire resistance and designed with numer-  
ous tiny sound traps on the tile surfaces. These may consist of tiny  
drilled or punched holes, fissured surfaces, or a combination of both.  
Acoustic tile is most often used in the ceiling and areas where it is not  
subjected to excessive mechanical damage, such as above a wall  
wainscoting. It is normally manufactured in sizes from 12 by 12 to 12  
by 48 in. Thicknesses vary from 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 in, and the tile is usually fac-  
tory finished ready for application. Paint or other finishes which fill  
or cover the tiny holes or fissures for trapping sound will greatly  
reduce its efficiency.  
Acoustic tile may be applied by a number of methods—to existing  
ceilings or any smooth surface with a mastic adhesive designed  
specifically for this purpose, or to furring strips nailed to the under-  
side of the ceiling joists. Nailing or stapling tile is the normal appli-  
cation method in this system. It is also used with a mechanical  
suspension system involving small “H,” “Z,” or “T” members. Man-  
ufacturers’ recommendations should be followed in application and  
finishing.

# DOORS  
# HOLLOW METAL DOOR CONSTRUCTION  
The design, specification, and detailing of a door can have serious  
consequences for functional considerations such as accessibility and  
sound transmission. The door is also one of the most important archi-  
tectural elements with respect to design image and aesthetics. A  
door can be a major part of design expression\: a monumental door to  
a church or synagogue, the main entrance to a residence, the doors  
to a corporate board room—all of these doors have symbolic impor-  
tance.  
Doors come in a variety of standard heights, widths, and thicknesses,  
yet they may also be custom designed, assume a variety of shapes and  
forms, and be constructed with a variety of materials. The design,  
specification, and detailing of a door is, in fact, a rather complex task.  
A door is typically set within a frame or jamb, but may also be  
installed within a wall without a frame or jamb. The frame/jamb  
interface between door and wall partition is another area requiring  
special attention by the designer.  
The design of a door is never complete without the specification of  
hardware. Hinges, locksets, closers, stops, and thresholds are but a  
few of the hardware elements that a designer must consider.

Hollow Metal Door Construction  
This section on doors provides the designer with extensive informa-  
tion on door types, materials, door frames, and materials and meth-  
ods of door construction and installation. Details show doors and  
frames installed in all types of walls and partitions, including wood  
and metal stud, masonry, concrete, and glass.  
Of special interest to the designer are examples of less standard door  
types such as elevator doors, sliding pocket doors, and fabric-  
covered doors. The majority of the details in this section are taken  
from the actual working drawings of successfully executed projects.  
# Panel Construction  
There are two basic types of panel construction\:  
*Steel stiffened\:* Face sheets supported by steel stiffeners, which  
are channels, Z-shaped sections, hat-shaped sections, or sim-  
ilar members, positioned vertically. Sheets are attached to  
these members by spot welding.  
*Laminated core\:* Sandwich construction employing a core of  
impregnated kraft paper honeycomb, plastic foam, or struc-  
tural mineral blocking, to which the steel face sheets are lam-  
inated, using a structural adhesive.  
# Types of Construction  
The four basic types of construction for hollow metal swing doors  
are illustrated and identified in Fig. 1. The type usually specified in  
commercial work is the continuously welded edge seam construc-  
tion. Type A, and it is this type which is the basis of NAAMM Stan-  
dard HMMA 861.  
Most custom hollow metal doors are of the full flush type with con-  
tinuously welded edges \(Type A\). When glazed openings, recessed  
panels, or louvers are to be provided, they are built into the door dur-  
ing fabrication, rather than being cut out of a flush panel door by  
field modification.  
Fire-rated doors may differ in certain details of construction; see  
NAAMM Standard HMMA 850, Fire-Rated Hollow Metal Doors  
and Frames.  
Fig. 1 The top edge of Types A and B doors may have only an inverted channel \(standard construction\) or may have  
an additional closing channel. Types C and D have tubular rails and stiles, with no edge seams. S = stile \(hinge stile is  
stile at edge where hinges or pivots are located, lock stile is stile in which a lock or latch is installed, and meeting stile  
is stile adjacent to another door, in a pair of doors\); TR = top rail; CR = center rail; BR = bottom rail; P = panel; P/G = panel

Hollow Metal Door Hardware\: Pivots  
Pivots are stronger and more durable than hinges and are better able  
to withstand the racking stresses to which doors are subjected. Their  
use is generally recommended on oversize doors, on heavy doors  
such as lead-lined doors, and on entrance doors to public buildings  
such as schools, theaters, banks, stores, and office buildings.  
NOTE\: Because of adjustments that must be made during the instal-  
lation of doors with bottom pivots, it is recommended that reinforce-  
ments be furnished in blank and that drilling and tapping be done in  
the field by the contractor.

Hollow Metal Door Hardware\: Floor Closers  
# Overhead and Floor Closers  
Overhead closers \(Figs. 3 to 8\) are hydraulic devices, containing a  
piston, fluid chambers, and a spring. When the door is opened, the  
piston is pulled back, the spring is compressed, and the fluid is  
moved from one side of the piston to the other. With release of the  
door a reverse action takes place, closing the door. Closing speed is  
controlled by an adjustable valve or valves. Overhead closers may be  
installed on either single- or double-acting doors.  
Floor closers, generally more durable than overhead closers, provide  
concealed closing mechanisms often appropriate for doors having a  
high frequency of use. As shown, the type of closer used depends on  
whether the door is hung on hinges, offset pivots, or center pivots.  
Both overhead and floor closers are available in a range of sizes for  
various door sizes, locations, and job conditions. The manufacturer’s  
recommendations should always be followed in determining which  
size and type should be used.  
Where surface-mounted closers are specified, internal reinforcement  
plates shall be provided in the door and frame by the manufacturer.  
Drilling and tapping for the closer shall be done in the field by the  
installer. Only after the door is installed and adjusted can the closer  
be mounted for proper operation. If drilling and tapping have been  
done at the factory, the necessary field adjustments become difficult  
if not impossible.

Hollow Metal Door Hardware\: Panic and Fire Exit Hardware  
# Types of Installation  
Panic hardware is tested and labeled for casualty only; fire exit hard-  
ware, for both casualty and fire resistance. Only the latter may be  
used where fire-rated doors are required. Both types are always  
releasable from the inside by depressing the crash bar. The mortise  
type \(Fig. 9\) and the concealed vertical rod type \(Fig. 10\) are the least  
conspicuous, and either of these types is readily applicable to custom  
hollow metal doors.  
Rim and mortise types are used on  
Single door  
Active door of pair  
Both doors of pair with mullion  
Vertical rod types are used on  
Single door  
Active door of pair  
Both doors of pair  
Where rim type \(Fig. 11\) or exposed vertical rod \(Fig. 12\) exit  
devices are specified, internal reinforcement plates shall be pro-  
vided in the door and frame by the manufacturer. Drilling and tap-  
ping for trim and mounting plates shall be done in the field by the  
installer. The hardware can then be more readily adjusted for best  
operation.  
In preparing the door for a lock, the drilling of three bolt holes \(1⁄2 in  
diameter or less\) and/or the drilling and tapping for sectional or full  
trim plates shall be done in the field by the installer and not at the fac-  
tory. After the lock is installed and adjusted, the trim plate can be  
applied to suit the final position of the latching device. If through-  
bolt holes or tapped holes are provided at the factory, this adjustment  
becomes difficult, if not impossible.  
The manufacturer shall drill for all function holes—cylinder, turn  
piece, and knob.  
# Door Coordinators  
Coordinators \(Figs. 13 and 14\) are used on pairs of doors having  
overlapping astragals and closers. When both leaves are open, the  
coordinator holds the active leaf open until the inactive leaf is closed,  
preventing interferences of the astragal.

Hollow Metal Door Hardware\: Flush Bolts  
These bolts are installed on the inactive leaf of a pair of doors to  
secure it in the closed position to serve as a latching point for the  
active leaf. They may also be used as auxiliary locking devices for  
added security. Bolts may be either surface mounted or flush \(con-  
cealed rod\); only the latter type is illustrated in Fig. 15.  
There are many variations of these flush bolts; only the more com-  
mon types being shown in Fig. 15. Due to the variety of frame con-  
struction encountered, the selection of the most appropriate type of  
strike is particularly important, and clearance at the floor must be  
very carefully controlled to ensure proper engagement.  
The manual type \(Fig. 15*A*\) requires hand operation of the operat-  
ing lever for both latching and unlatching. The variable length of  
the extension rod, however, permits convenient location of the  
operating mechanism in the door edge. The self-latching types \(Fig.  
15*B* and *C*\) latch automatically when the inactive leaf is closed, but  
must be unlatched manually. The automatic type \(Fig. 15*D*\) both  
latches and unlatches automatically when the inactive leaf is closed  
or opened.  
None of these types of flush bolt should be used on doors that are  
intended to serve as emergency exists. NFPA pamphlet 80 should be  
consulted for the selection of bolts for fire-rated pairs of doors.  
Fig. 15 Except for Type C, only top bolts are shown; bottom bolts are similar in all cases.

Hollow Metal Door Frames  
The prime functions of the door frame are to hold the door and its  
controls in the opening, and to trim the opening. But frames often  
serve other esthetic or functional purposes also, such as trimming a  
wall opening having no door, or enclosing glazed areas that provide  
through-wall visibility or admitting light and/or air. Hollow metal  
frames, which are strong, sturdy, and durable, serve all such func-  
tions economically.  
The variety of configurations available in custom hollow metal  
frames is virtually unlimited. Illustrated in Fig. 16 are some of the  
more common and representative types.

Hardware  
Hardware for doors may be obtained in a number of finishes, with  
brass, bronze, and nickel perhaps the most common. Door sets are  
usually classed as \(a\) entry lock for exterior doors, \(b\) bathroom set  
\(inside lock control with safety slot for opening from the outside\), \(c\)  
bedroom lock \(keyed lock\), and \(d\) passage set \(without lock\).  
# Hinges  
Using three hinges for hanging 13⁄4-in exterior doors and two hinges  
for the lighter interior doors is common practice. There is some ten-  
dency for exterior doors to warp during the winter because of the dif-  
ference in exposure on the opposite sides. The three hinges reduce  
this tendency. Three hinges are also useful on doors that lead to  
unheated attics and for wider and heavier doors that may be used  
within the house.  
Loose-pin butt hinges should be used and must be of the proper size  
for the door they support. For 13⁄4-in-thick doors, use 4- by 4-in butts;  
for 13⁄8-in doors, 31⁄2- by 31⁄2-in butts. After the door is fitted to the  
framed opening, with the proper clearances, hinge halves are fitted to  
the door. They are routed into the door edge with about a 3⁄16-in back  
distance \(Fig. 26*A*\). One hinge half should be set flush with the sur-  
face and must be fastened square with the edge of the door. Screws  
are included with each pair of hinges.

Hand of Locks and Lock Functions  
Locks not designated as reversible are made right-hand, left-hand,  
right-hand reverse bevel, or left-hand reverse bevel.  
The hand of a lock is invariably determined from the outside of an  
entrance door or from the corridor or hall side of a room door. An  
easy method of determining the hand of a lock is to imagine one-  
self on that side of the opening from which the lock is controlled or  
operated by the key. Viewing the opening in this position, note  
which one of the following is true\: \(1\) If the door swings in and is  
hinged at your right hand, the lock is right-hand; \(2\) if hinged at  
your left hand, the lock is left-hand; \(3\) if the door swings toward  
you and is hinged at your right, the lock is right-hand reverse  
bevel; \(4\) if hinged at your left hand, the lock is left-hand reverse  
bevel.  
You may find that many locks are marked “reversible,” meaning that  
they are interchangeably right- or left-hand, and in these instances no  
reference to hand or bevel of lock is necessary. These are locks which  
operate alike from both sides or locks which can be inverted in order  
to reverse the locking functions.

CEILINGS

# CEILINGS  
# SUSPENSION SYSTEM TYPES  
This section provides the designer with information on both sus-  
pended ceilings and ceilings directly attached to the structure above.  
It starts with a review of generic suspension systems and then pro-  
vides details and discussion of the various suspended ceiling types.  
Large-scale details show how, in addition to standard acoustical  
tiles, other ceiling materials such as plaster, metal panels, baffles,  
gypsum board, and wood can be attached to suspension systems. A  
variety of unusual conditions are also detailed, including curved and  
vaulted ceilings, wall conditions, light coves, and lighting fixture  
framing.  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 951* Construction Details and Finishes  
CEILINGS  
Suspension System Types  
The designer is cautioned that in many jurisdictions, suspension sys-  
tems must attain a higher level of structural integrity than most other  
architectural elements. For example, wire hangers may not be an  
acceptable method of suspending channels from the structure above.  
Rather, steel rods of a minimum diameter or flat bar hangers of a  
minimum width and thickness may be required. Local or state codes  
should always be consulted prior to finalizing such details.  
In many situations, the ceiling “skin” takes on further importance  
beyond aesthetic, acoustical, or visual requirements. It can also be  
used to complete an envelope that provides a fire-resistive rating to  
the structural members above. Again, it is necessary to thoroughly  
investigate the building and fire codes that might govern ceiling  
design.

STAIRS AND RAMPS  
Planning Data  
Nowhere is the personal safety and comfort of the user more impor-  
tant than in the design of stairs. This section, therefore, provides the  
planning data necessary to solve most problems of stair design.  
Various stair types are illustrated, including straight run, long L,  
wide L, double L, and narrow and wide U. Stair tables and related  
diagrams are provided that indicate vertical and horizontal areas,  
headroom clearances, and tread and riser dimensions for various  
stair systems. Information concerning nosings, landing widths, and  
so on, is also included. In addition to general planning data, this  
section includes barrier-free design data as well as actual construc-  
tion details of wood, steel, and concrete stairs prepared by various  
design firms.  
It should be noted that stair design must conform to local building  
codes. Most codes require that means-of-egress stairways not be less  
than 44 in \(1118 mm\) in width, that the least dimension of landings  
and platforms not be less than the required width of the stair, and that  
the minimum headroom in all parts of a stairway not be less than 6 ft  
8 in \(2032 mm\) measured vertically from the tread nosing or from  
the floor surface of the landing or platform. In one- and two-family  
dwellings, most codes require that stairways not be less than 3 ft \(915  
mm\) clear in width, and that hand rails not be less than 30 in \(762  
mm\) nor more than 34 in \(864 mm\) measured vertically from the  
nosing of the treads and be provided on at least one side of stairways  
of four or more risers.  
# Critical Dimensions and Clearances  
Dimensions indicated in Fig. 1 and listed in Table 1 determine the  
vertical and horizontal areas and headroom clearances for stair sys-  
tems with tread and riser proportions shown. They can be used  
directly in developing sketches or working drawings and eliminate  
the need for experimental stair plans or sections. All dimensions refer  
to face of treads without nosing.  
Tabular data refer only to minimum conditions for straight run stairs.  
All figures may be adjusted according to requirements of design or  
stair use. For similar dimensional information controlling other types  
of stairways, see the following pages.  
Widths of stairways may vary with these requirements. For pas-  
sage of furniture, minimum clear widths should be selected from  
Table 2.  
*980*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
# Clearances for Furniture Passage  
Width is not always a critical factor of stairway design but is important  
when the layout involves one or more turns with straight runs. Typical  
layouts for such stairways include the long L, double L, wide U, wide  
L, and narrow U. \(See Fig. 3 for layouts and tabular data on these  
types.\)  
Stairways used solely as circulation from floor to floor can be 2 ft 0  
in wide for comfortable passage of one individual or 3 ft 6 in for two,  
side-by-side. When furniture must be taken up and down, minimum  
clear widths of straight runs and landings must be carefully selected  
or corners will constitute obstructions in many instances.  
Recommended minimum clear widths as shown in Table 2 are not nec-  
essarily the width of stairs, either rough or wall-to-wall. Projections of  
newels, handrails, or baseboards can obstruct passage of furniture and  
must be taken into account when determining actual stair widths.  
Headroom is also a controlling factor of design. With minimum  
headroom conditions shown in Table 1, clear widths for furniture  
passage must be greater in most cases than may be necessary if head-  
room is unlimited or equal at least to the ceiling heights. This is par-  
ticularly important at the first riser and at turns, where the under rake  
of the first stair limits the vertical clearance of the stairway below.  
Therefore, if stairs must be comparatively narrow and if furniture  
must be transported over them, headroom, or vertical clearance, must  
be increased accordingly.  
Landing widths may be increased to provide greater turning space for  
maneuvering furniture. If this is done, minimum clear widths can be  
proportionately decreased. However, this expedient is not effective  
unless hallways at either end of the stairway are at least equal to the  
landing widths. Narrow hallways often offer as great an obstruction  
to furniture maneuvering as low headroom, narrow runs, or cramped  
turns.  
Open-well stairways give more opportunity to maneuver furniture,  
since even very bulky but light pieces may often be lifted over rails  
or newels. In general, a closed-string stair should be wider than an  
open-string type for the same degree of convenience.  
The data in Table 2 reflect safe *average* clearances for transportation  
of items listed. Dimensions of furniture are subject to wide varia-  
tions. Consequently, the minimum clear widths recommended here Table 1 Stair table \(Dimensions in feet and inches\)

are susceptible to adjustment in certain instances.  
# Purpose  
The six diagrams in Fig. 3 represent unit plans for types of non-  
winder stairways which are most frequently encountered in the aver-  
age residential planning problem. Tabular information with each was  
developed from data contained in Table 1.  
Unit plans are drawn to 1⁄8-in scale and therefore can be supplied  
directly as a check of stair layouts to sketch plans and elevations.  
Each represents an average condition with a stair pitch well within  
the comfort zone. The basis is a 9 ft 6 in floor-to-floor height with 16  
risers each 7.13-in in height. Width is 3 ft 0 in from wall to wall.  
Tabular data with each unit plan indicate dimensional variations  
which occur when stairways of substantially similar pitches are  
planned for floor-to-floor heights from 8 to 11 ft.  
Width is the only critical dimension missing from this unit plan infor-  
mation. This varies with requirements of design and stair use and  
should be selected from data in Table 2. Width is a dimension con-  
trolling critical clearances on all stairs that contain a turn.  
Winders have not been included in these unit plans because they  
represent a stair condition generally regarded as undesirable. How-  
ever, use of winders is sometimes necessary due to cramped space.  
In such instances, winders should be adjusted to replace landings so  
that the narrow portions of treads at the inside of the turn are at least  
equal to 3⁄4 in T. When this is done, dimensions of L1 and L2 are  
decreased by approximately 1⁄2T, the exact figure depending on the  
width selected. The practice of adding a winder-riser to bisect the  
landing diagonally from the corner of a newel is to be avoided in all  
cases, for it produces a dangerously narrow step in a particularly  
undesirable place.  
# Application of Unit Plans  
Diagrammatic data can be used on sketches as a graphic check as  
noted. Tabular data can be applied to either sketches or working  
drawings to eliminate the necessity of developing experimental  
stairway sections to determine run, proportional rise, horizontal  
and vertical areas, and location of under-rake minimum head-  
room.  
Dimensional data have been confined to a single pitch for all floor-  
to-floor heights. The pitch indicated is that most generally desir-  
able for human comfort. Data for other pitches listed as tread and

Layouts and Dimensions  
riser proportions in Table 1 can be substituted for values of L1, L2,  
and M.  
# Nosings  
Nosings extending 3⁄4 to 11⁄2 in \(usually 11⁄4 in\) beyond the face of the  
riser are functionally necessary and are required by most building  
codes. Nosings may be provided by extending the treads or by slop-  
ing the risers. The latter method is customary in concrete stairs  
because of easier forming, and in any type of stair where carpet is to  
be installed. This type of nosing is also recommended for stairs to be  
used by people with disabilities.  
# Stairway Layouts  
Comfortable stairways cannot be designed except in relation to  
dimensions of the average human figure. As applied to stairways,  
these dimensions and the equivalent of the average comfortable  
walking stride of about 24 in fix the gradient of stairways, the pro-  
portional relation of treads and risers, the height of the handrail, and  
the minimum necessary headroom.  
Figure 4 indicates the influence of human figure dimensions and sug-  
gests the desirability of varying ceiling clearances and handrail  
heights according to variations in stair gradients. These variations are  
included in Table 3.  
Treads and risers in curved stairs should be proportioned on an  
assumed *line of travel* 18 in from the inner \(smaller radius\)  
handrail.  
All building codes have strict specifications for stairs which are  
required exits. The National Building Code of the American Insur-  
ance Association and the New York City code both require that treads  
and risers be proportioned by the formula T × R = 70 to 75, with ris-  
ers not over 73⁄4 in high and treads not less than 9 in wide, exclusive  
of nosings. Minimum stair width for most uses is 44 in, based on two  
22-in lanes of traffic. Handrails are required on both sides and may  
project a maximum of 31⁄2 in into the required width. Winders and

# WOOD STAIRS  
# Types of Stairs  
Four types of stairs are defined\: straight stairs, circular stairs, curved  
stairs, and spiral stairs.  
Straight stairs are by far the most common type, representing the bulk  
of the stair market. Though the term “straight” is self-explanatory, for  
purposes of classification a straight stair is defined as one in which the  
stringers are straight members. Straight stairs, unlike stairs of the  
other three types, may be arranged in several different ways\:  
*Straight run\:* Either a single flight extending between floors, as  
shown in Fig. 5*A,* or a series of two or more flights in the  
same line, with intermediate platforms between them, as  
shown in Fig. 5*B.*  
*Parallel\:* Successive flights which parallel each other and are  
separated only by one or more intermediate platforms, as  
shown in Fig. 5*C.*  
*Angled\:* Successive flights placed at an angle of other than  
180° to each other \(often 90°\), with an intermediate platform  
between them, as shown in Fig. 5*D* or *E.* The type shown in  
Fig. 5*D* is often referred to as a “trussed” stair.  
*Scissor\:* A pair of straight-run flights paralleling each other in  
plan and running in opposite directions on opposite sides of a  
dividing wall, as shown in Fig. 5*F.*  
Circular stairs are stairs which, in plan view, have an open circular  
form, with a single center of curvature. They may or may not have  
intermediate platforms between floors.  
Curved stairs are stairs which, in plan view, have two or more centers  
of curvature, being oval, elliptical, or some other compound curved  
form. They also may or may not have one or more intermediate plat-  
forms between floors.  
Spiral stairs are stairs with a closed circular form, having uniform  
sector shaped treads and a supporting center column.  
# Classes of Stairs  
The class designation of stairs, as already noted, is a key to the type  
of construction, the quality of materials, details and finish, and, in  
most cases, the relative cost. As stairs of all classes are built to meet  
the same standards of performance in respect to load-carrying capac-  
ity and safety, these class distinctions *do not represent differences in*  
*functional value, but in character and appearance.* It is important to  
recognize that where function is the prime concern, and esthetics are  
of minor importance, significant economies can be achieved by spec-  
ifying one of the less expensive classes.  
The following four classes of stairs are listed in order of increasing  
cost \(as a general rule\); the general construction characteristics of  
each class are described.  
*Industrial Class*  
Fig. 5  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1011* Construction Details and Finishes  
STAIRS AND RAMPS  
Classification of Steel Stairs  
Stairs of this class are purely functional in character and, conse-  
quently, they are generally the most economical. They are designed  
for either interior or exterior use, in industrial buildings such as facto-  
ries and warehouses, or as fire escapes or emergency exitways. They  
do not include stairs which are integral parts of industrial equipment.  
Industrial-class stairs are similar in nature to any light steel construc-  
tion. Hex-head bolts are used for most connections, and welds, where  
used, are not ground. Stringers may be either flat plate or open chan-  
nels; treads and platforms are usually made of grating or formed of  
floor plate, and risers are usually open, though in some cases filled  
pan type treads and steel risers may be used. Railings are usually of  
either pipe, tubing, or light steel angle construction.  
*Service Class*  
This class of stairs serves chiefly functional purposes, but is not unat-  
tractive in appearance. Service stairs are usually located in enclosed  
stairwells and provide a secondary or emergency means of travel  
between floors. In multistoried buildings they are commonly used as  
egress stairs. They may serve employees, tenants, or the public, and  
are generally used where economy is a consideration.  
Stringers of service stairs are generally the same types as those used  
on stairs of the industrial class. Treads may be one of several stan-  
dard types, either filled or formed of floor or tread plate, and risers  
are either exposed steel or open construction. Railings are typically  
of pipe construction or a simple bar type with tubular newels, and  
soffits are usually left exposed. Connections on the underside of the  
stairs are made with hex-head bolts, and only those welds in the  
travel area are smooth.  
*Commercial Class*  
Stairs of this class are usually for public use and are of more attrac-  
tive design than those of the service class. They may be placed in  
open locations or may be located in closed stairwells or in public,  
institutional, or commercial buildings.  
Stringers for this class of stairs are usually exposed open channel or  
plate sections. Treads may be any of a number of standard types, and  
risers are usually exposed steel. Railings vary from ornamental bar or  
tube construction with metal handrails to simple pipe construction,  
and soffits may or may not be covered. Exposed bolted connections  
in areas where appearance is critical are made with countersunk flat-  
or oval-head bolts; otherwise, hex-head bolts are used. Welds in con-  
spicuous locations are smooth, and all joints are closely fitted.  
*Architectural Class*  
This classification applies to any of the more elaborate and usually  
more expensive stairs, those which are designed to be architectural  
features in a building. They may be wholly custom designed or may  
represent a combination of standard parts with specially designed  
elements such as stringers, railings, treads, or platforms. Usually this  
class of stair has a comparatively low pitch, with relatively low risers  
and correspondingly wider treads. Architectural metal stairs may be  
located either in the open or in enclosed stairwells in public, institu-  
tional, commercial, or monumental buildings.  
The materials, fabrication details, and finishes used in architectural  
class stairs vary widely, as dictated by the architect’s design and  
specifications. As a general rule, construction joints are made as  
inconspicuous as possible, exposed welds are smooth, and soffits are  
covered with some surfacing material. Stringers may be special sec-  
tions exposed, or may be structural members enclosed in other mate-  
rials. Railings are of an ornamental type and, like the treads and  
risers, may be of any construction desired.

struction and are designed and constructed to carry a minimum live  
load of 100 lb/ft2 of projected plan area or an alternative concentrated  
load of 300 lb applied at the center of any tread span. Railings and  
handrails are designed and constructed to withstand a minimum  
force of 200 lb applied in any direction at any point on the rail.  
The platform \(Fig. 6\) is shown constructed with a steel channel, A, of  
adequate strength to span the well on line X, through Secs. 1, 2, and  
3, and supported at both ends by the wall strings. Newel posts rest on  
this channel through angle clips, around which the platform plate is

Center railings are recommended for wide stairs. They may be a sin-  
gle pipe or tubing railing or they may be designed with double rails  
and panels of interesting design.  
NOTE\: A number of codes require that railings have a level exten-  
sion beyond the nosings at the floors as indicated in Fig. 11 by  
dashed lines. This applies to both wall and center railings.  
# General Information  
Functional and decorative plastic handrail moldings of polyvinyl  
chloride plastics are available in a variety of sizes and profiles, sev-  
eral of which are illustrated in Figs. 16 to 19. Consult suppliers’ cur-  
rent literature for variations in details and features.  
Plastic handrail moldings are not structural and require bar, tube, or  
channel members to support vertical and horizontal loads.  
Plastic handrail moldings are produced in a range of colors from  
subdued to bright, to suit either formal or informal design situations.  
The color is integral with the plastic, which is highly resistant to  
wear, weathering, and corrosion.  
The thermoplastic material becomes pliable when heated \(not over  
165°F\), at which time it can be fitted over the support member and  
conforms to vertical, horizontal, or combined vertical and horizontal  
curves within certain limitations.  
Lateral bends should have a minimum centerline radius of not less  
than 2 times the width of the plastic section or 21⁄2 to 3 times the width

be used if sharper turns are required.  
Combined vertical and horizontal turns can be formed by twisting the

The material can be joined by thermal welding, and end caps can be  
shaped using a knife, a file, or abrasives.  
The use of a cleaning solution for removing grease and foreign material

Fabricators provide several standard types and designs of treads and  
platforms. These include open riser, closed riser, and cantilever  
types, with surface of checkered plate, abrasive plate, steel grating,  
or plain surface to receive wood, resilient flooring, carpet, or other  
covering. Pan-type treads to receive concrete or terrazzo fill are also  
available.  
Material may be steel, stainless steel, cast iron, or aluminum. Treads  
are supported in cantilever fashion by the column, each consecutive  
tread being rotated at a predetermined angle. The platform attaches to  
the column and is fastened to the floor structure to hold the column  
secure. The spiral railing is supported by balusters attached to the  
# Stair Height  
Spiral stairs are adaptable to any height, the height being equal to the  
distance from finished floor to finished floor.  
# Stair Diameter  
Spiral stairs are available in various diameters from 3 ft 6 in to 8 ft 0

12 or 16 treads to the circle. Headroom should be calculated on the  
basis of three-fourths of a circle. On a 12-tread circle, 9 in is approx-  
imately the minimum rise, providing 6 ft 9 in head room. On a 16-  
tread circle, 7-in rise will provide 7 ft 0 in headroom. A rise up to 12  
in per tread may be employed.  
Any potential hazards must be eliminated. Stairs should be easy  
going; that is, there must be an appropriate relationship of riser to  
tread. Treads are of nonslip material, which is also extended onto  
platforms and landings for a distance equal to the width of the stair  
treads. Double handrails, one higher than the other, are provided on  
stairs for each line of short or tall pupils. The posts, which support  
the center handrails of double stairs, are extended high enough above  
the top handrail to prevent pupils from sliding down.

Handrails should be oval or round with 11⁄2-in/4-cm hand clearance  
between the rails and the wall\: 11⁄2-in/4-cm clearance will provide  
ease of grip but will prevent the hand or wrist from slipping between  
the handrail and the wall if the person loses balance. Handrails  
should be positioned on both sides of steps and stairs and should  
extend beyond the first and last steps on at least one side and prefer-  
ably on both to allow people with long leg braces to pull themselves  
beyond these points. To guard against falls and to help children, some  
codes require another, lower, handrail.  
Steps, stairs, and handrails should not be made of slippery material.

The function of the fireplace today differs dramatically from its role  
of years ago. Whereas its original function was primarily to provide  
heat for warmth and/or cooking, today it serves more as a decorative  
asset and as the focal point of interior spaces and conversational  
groupings, providing the esthetic pleasure and comfort of firelight.  
Of particular interest to the interior designer is the proportion and  
scale of the fireplace opening, the treatment of wall surfaces sur-  
rounding the fireplace, the design of mantel pieces and hearth exten-  
sions, and the array of fireplace accessories available. Accordingly,  
the information contained in this section addresses these considera-  
tions. Drawings include elevations, plans, and details of various fire-  
places; elevations of a wide selection of prefabricated mantel types;  
and a sampling of fireplace accessories including andirons, wrought-  
iron fire sets, and log grates. It should be noted that, aside from their  
decorative aspects, the fireplace and chimney have important struc-  
tural implications and require special foundations. Moreover, the  
fireplace must be designed to carry smoke away safely.  
With respect to hearth extensions, most building codes require that  
for fireplaces having an opening of less than 6 ft2 \(0.56 m2\), the  
hearth must extend a minimum of 16 in \(406 mm\) beyond the face of  
the opening and a minimum of 8 in \(203 mm\) on each side. For fire-  
places whose openings exceed 6 ft2, the hearth must extend a mini-  
mum of 20 in \(508 mm\) beyond the face of the opening and 12 in  
\(305 mm\) on each side.  
Most building codes also require that woodwork or other com-  
bustible materials not be placed within 6 in \(153 mm\) of a fireplace  
opening, and that combustible material within 12 in \(305 mm\) of a  
fireplace opening not project more than 1⁄8 in for each 1-in distance  
from such an opening.  
Since building codes may vary, it is important that the designer have  
her or his plans checked for conformance with the applicable local or  
state codes. Any structural modifications to an existing fireplace and  
chimney or the design of a new fireplace and chimney should be  
reviewed by a professional engineer or registered architect.  
A fireplace that draws properly can be ensured by applying proper  
principles of design. The size of flue should be adequate and should  
be based on the size of the fireplace opening. One rule commonly  
used is to take one-tenth of the area of the fireplace opening to find  
the minimum area of the flue. For example, if a fireplace had an  
opening 3 ft wide by 2 ft 6 in high, it would have an area of 1080 in2  
.  
Construction Details and Finishes  
FIREPLACES  
Components and Terminology  
One-tenth of 1080 in2 equals 108 in2. The standard-size flue nearest  
to this requirement and readily available is a 13- by 13-in flue lining,  
which has an inside cross-sectional area of 126.56 in2. One could also  
use a 13-in round flue that has a cross-sectional area of 113.0 in2  
.  
The front of the fireplace should be wider than the back and the upper  
part of the back should tilt forward to meet the throat in order to  
throw heat into the room instead of up the chimney. The arch over the  
top of the fireplace opening should be only 4 in thick, and the throat  
should project toward the front as much as possible to form the  
smoke shelf behind it. The area of the throat should be 11⁄4 times the  
area of the flue, with minimum and maximum width of 3 and 41⁄2 in,  
respectively, so that the narrow throat will cause a quick suction into  
the flue. The sides of the fireplace above the throat are drawn  
together to form the flue, which always starts exactly over the center  
of the width of the fireplace. The smoke shelf is very necessary to  
stop back drafts. The depth of the fireplace should be one-half the  
height of the opening, with a maximum of 24 in. The back should rise  
one-half the height of the opening before sloping forward and should  
be two-thirds the opening in width.  
The back, sides, and parts of the hearth that are under the fire must be  
built of heat-resistant materials. Firebrick laid in fire clay is the best  
combination.  
The damper is a large valve that can be adjusted to regulate the draft.  
Many types of commercial damper units are manufactured. The posi-  
tion of a damper unit is important. The damper is generally set about  
8 in above the top of the fireplace opening and is concealed by the  
brickwork. One advantage of these units is that they are correctly  
designed and have correctly proportioned throat damper and cham-  
ber to provide a form for the masonry and to reduce the risk of fail-  
ure in the function of the completed fireplace.  
The hearth consists of two parts, the front or finish hearth and the  
back hearth under the fire. The front hearth is simply a precaution  
against flying sparks and, while it must be noncombustible, it need  
not resist intense prolonged heat. Because the back hearth must with-  
stand intense heat, it is built of heat-resistant materials. In buildings  
with wood floors, the hearth in front of the fireplace should be sup-  
ported on masonry. The front hearth should project at least 16 in from  
the front of the fireplace.  
At the back part of the hearth it is customary to have an ash dump for  
dropping the ashes into the ash pit, which is generally located in the  
basement, with a door for cleaning out ashes.

# LIGHTING  
Although lighting design is a discipline in and of itself, the interior  
designer and architect must be knowledgeable about the interface be-  
tween lighting elements and the interior architecture. This section,  
therefore, focuses primarily on the detailing of this interface. Details  
from actual contract drawings, prepared by various interior design  
and architectural firms, are provided for the reader’s reference.  
Among the details are those for valance and cove lighting and for the  
lighting of stairs, columns, and skylights. This section also provides  
some basic planning data including illuminance values for resi-  
dences, offices, stores, and industrial spaces.

# What to Light and How to Light It  
The lighting must make the dining room beautiful and functional for  
a variety of uses. It should make people, the table setting, food, and  
prized possessions look their best, as well as providing for other  
activities at the table or around the room. The plan, used to exemplify  
some typical lighting for dining, has a formal layout, with a table,  
sideboard, china cabinet, painting, and a pair of small tables on either  
side of a doorway leading to a patio. Two lighting schemes are shown  
to illustrate different approaches.  
*Focal Point*  
For the dining table, the main consideration is to enhance the color  
and texture of the food and the complexions and apparel of the din-  
ers, creating a festive mood by highlighting the table setting \(*sug-*  
*gested illuminance 10–20 fc*\).  
*General Lighting*  
This serves the need for flexible use of the room\: buffet-dinner, cock-  
tail party, cleanup \(*suggested illuminance 5–10 fc*\).  
*Accent Lighting*  
Accent lighting brings featured objects or special areas to light\: the  
painting, the sideboard, the flower arrangements \(*suggested illumi-*  
*nance on the table 25–50 fc*\).  
*Controls*  
Use lighting controls to match the lighting to the activity\: a dinner  
party, cleanup, breakfast the morning after. Use one dimmer for the  
overtable lighting and put other lights in the room on separate chan-  
nels. A multiscene push-button control is particularly useful.  
Accent lighting over the table  
must be kept well within the  
perimeter of the table. Do not  
place downlights over the  
chairs, as the beams from above  
will cast unpleasant shadows on  
people’s faces and the heat can  
be uncomfortable  
Chandeliers should be pro-  
portioned to both the table  
and the room; a diameter  
of 24 to 30 in will suit typi-  
cal spaces. The diameter  
should not be larger than  
the width of the table, less  
12 in or people may hit it  
when rising from the table  
When the chandelier has  
no central downlight, the  
table setting and center-  
piece can be enhanced  
by accent lighting using  
recessed adjustable fix-  
tures with narrow- to  
medium-spread beams,  
spaced and angled to  
avoid casting shadows.  
Reflections from glass-  
top tables,however,must  
be considered when  
placing and adjusting  
the fixtures  
At the sideboard, carving  
and serving tasks should  
be provided with plenti-  
ful shadow-free lighting,  
from the ceiling or the  
wall \(suggested illumi-  
nance 30–50 f.c.\)

Planning Data\: Living Rooms  
# What to Light and How to Light It  
Most living rooms today serve many different functions. Whatever  
the activity, the room should be comfortable and beautiful, and the  
lighting should be flexible enough to provide for the range of tasks,  
situations, and desired aesthetic effects. The living room shown in  
the plan is intended to show some typical lighting applications. It has  
a window wall, a vaulted ceiling, a stone wall with fireplace and a  
niche for art objects \(or TV\), a wall of paintings, an audio/bookshelf  
section, and a bar. The piano, game table, and lounge seating com-  
plete the furnishings. Two lighting schemes are shown to illustrate  
possibilities.  
*Focal Point*  
The fireplace wall is the focal point. The main objectives are high-  
lighting the texture and colors of the stonework and of the hood over  
the hearth and enhancing the beauty of the art objects—a small sculp-  
ture perhaps—in the niche \(*suggested illuminance on wall 10–20 fc*\).  
*General Lighting*  
This provides for ease of moving about in the room and serves to  
bring the various sections of the room together. General lighting is  
supplied in most positions of the room by reflections of light directed  
to the walls and furnishings \(*suggested illuminance 5–10 fc*\).  
*Task Lighting*  
This is needed to supply extra lighting for seeing small detail, such as  
music at the piano, the game table, and the titles of books and record-  
ings, and for reading at the lounge chairs and sofa \(*suggested illumi-*  
*nances 20–50 fc*\).  
When lighting a small to  
medium-size picture, have  
the lighting reach the picture  
at an angle of about 30° from  
the vertical. See the table  
below for suggested spacing  
from the wall. Lighting placed  
much farther from the wall  
may cause disturbing reflec-  
tions on the picture; lighting  
placed much closer may  
cause unwanted shadows  
cast by the frame  
*Ceiling height Distance from wall*  
8 ft 2 ft  
9 ft 3 ft  
10 ft 4 ft  
A group of pictures is best  
lighted by lighting the sur-  
face as a whole rather  
than by lighting the pic-  
tures individually. Use the  
same spacing from the  
wall as for a single picture  
and, for even illumination,  
make the space between  
units not more than twice  
that from the wall. Lighting  
from multiple units can be  
smoothed using a spread  
lens or beam elongator.  
These guidelines can also  
be used for lighting a very  
large picture  
*1102*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
*Controls*  
Permit the lighting to be varied according to the occasion—quiet  
conversation, a party, reading, listening to recordings, singing around  
the piano, a game of cards.  
The texture of a surface  
can be raised by placing  
the fixtures close to the sur-  
face, so that the lighting  
strikes it at a grazing angle.  
If there are unwanted irreg-  
ularities in the wall, place  
the fixtures well away from  
the wall  
In wall washing the sur-  
face is illuminated smoothly  
and evenly from top to bot-  
tom. Wall washing makes  
spaces seem larger and is  
useful for achieving a com-  
fortable level of balanced  
brightness  
Three-dimensional objects,  
such as sculptures, often  
look best lighted from one  
side, in front and above,  
with a wide beam, and  
from the other side, in front  
and above, with a narrower  
beam. Glass objects, such  
as vases, however, often  
look best when seen rest-  
ing on a translucent shelf or  
in front of a translucent wall *Lighting Scheme 1*  
1\. 2. 3. Downlights, placed close to wall, enrich the texture of the stone.  
Downlights provide general lighting and task lighting at the piano.

5\. 6. 7. The bar and cabinet above are illuminated by wall washers.

Planning Data\: Kitchen Spaces  
# What to Light and How to Light It  
The kitchen is fundamentally a work area for food preparation and  
cleanup, but it is often used for other activities\: dining, homework,  
games, entertaining. It should be functional, comfortable, and beau-  
tiful; therefore, the lighting scheme should provide a combination of  
general, task, and accent lighting, controlled to suit the activity.  
*General Lighting*  
General lighting is needed to see into cabinets and drawers and for  
ease of moving about. It is best provided by surface-mounted fluores-  
cent lighting or by an array of downlights. Fluorescent produces the  
most light for the lowest cost. Downlights are very flexible, as they  
can be arranged to provide even illumination throughout the kitchen,  
even if it has an irregular shape \(*suggested illuminance 10–20 fc*\).  
# Task Lighting  
Task lighting is needed at the counter, the sink, and the stove. These  
areas are often in shadow, whether created by the person working or  
the cabinet above; therefore, the lighting should come from in front  
of the person. It must also be shielded from the view of others who  
may be seated nearby. Task lighting is also often required for reading  
at the kitchen table or dining counter; a pendant fixture not only can  
do the job, but adds visual appeal \(*suggested illuminance 20–100 fc*\).  
*Accent Lighting*  
Accent lighting of special objects, such as cookware, a noteboard, or  
a painting, contributes to making the kitchen the feature place it has  
become in so many homes \(*suggested illuminance\: 20–50 fc*\).  
*Lighting Controls*  
Lighting controls allow one to set the lighting for the activity\: food  
preparation, a late snack, or breakfast.  
*Kitchen 1*  
1\. General lighting is from two decorative surface-mounted fluores-

erous lighting, as well as task lighting over the sink.  
Shielded undercabinet track turns the corner to follow the coun-  
tertop, providing the correct task lighting.  
A group of small, glowing pendants over the dining counter pro-  
vides light for reading and a visual focal point.  
MultiSet controls, master and remote, enable one to set the light-  
ing scene at either doorway.

*1104*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design* **What to Light and How to Light It**  
Today, most homes contain two or more bathrooms\: the master bath,  
children’s bath, and guest bath or powder room. While the master  
bath may be larger and even include space for exercise, the children’s  
bath simpler and more functional, and the guest bath something of a  
decorative statement, the lighting priority in each should be given to  
grooming at the mirror.  
*Lighting at the Mirror*  
Lighting at the mirror serves for cleaning, makeup, shaving, and  
dressing. It should be plentiful; evenly distributed over the face, hair,  
and neck; without shadows; and free from glare. Lighting placed in  
the center of the ceiling puts the face in shadow and, while useful for  
general lighting, cannot serve well for grooming \(*suggested illumi-*  
*nance 20–50 fc*\).  
Fluorescent lighting of good color quality is now widely available  
and can provide high levels of illumination, with less heat and lower  
operating cost than incandescent. Incandescent and halogen offer  
greater decorative possibilities and, if well spaced and properly dif-  
fused, can be used very effectively.  
*Other Areas*  
Other areas in the bathroom that should be considered are the tub,  
where some people like to read; an enclosed toilet; and an exercise  
area, where general lighting from recessed or surface-mounted fix-  
tures will serve to illuminate the space and closets \(*suggested illumi-*  
*nance 5–10 fc*\).  
Elongated lighting at the  
side of the mirror works  
best. It should be at least 16  
in long. Lighting above the  
mirror should be at least 24  
in long to light both sides of  
the face and avoid shad-  
ows under the chin  
Recessed downlights have  
the benefit of being unob-  
trusive, but will produce  
shadows under the eyelids,  
nose, and chin unless  
placed close to the mirror,  
spaced well apart and  
above a light-colored  
counter top, which can re-  
flect the downlight upward  
to erase shadows

by day or by night. The lighting of these areas is important not only

*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design* **Where to Light and How to Light Them**  
Work at home, whether the homework of a student, the after-hours  
efforts of an office worker, or the all-day work of a self-employed  
person, usually involves two kinds of tasks that pose different light-  
ing problems\: computer tasks and paper tasks.  
*Computer*  
The computer screen is self-illuminated, and if it receives much ex-  
ternal light the contrast between the letters and the background is re-  
duced and seeing becomes more difficult. Prolonged work under  
difficult visual conditions results in fatigue.  
*General Lighting*  
General lighting should be provided in order to balance the bright-  
nesses in the field of view. This is often provided by a center-ceiling  
fixture, or a standing lamp \(*suggested illuminance\: 10–20 fc*\).  
Task lighting for prolonged  
reading is often best provided  
by ceiling-mounted fluores-  
cent, placed slightly behind  
or at either side of the desk  
Avoid reflections of bright  
light sources on the  
screen, as those of a win-  
dow, which should be  
shaded, or those of a ceil-  
ing fixture or a lampshade.  
Therefore, the screen  
should be oriented at right  
angles to a window and  
set so that no bright  
objects are reflected on it.  
\(The illuminance on the  
screen should be 10–20 fc\)  
Alternatively, local task  
lighting can be used effec-  
tively. As noted above, this  
should be placed at the  
side, rather than in front of  
the task. The illuminance on  
the task should be 20–50 fc,  
and in the case of older  
eyes working with small  
detail, 100 fc

*Paper Tasks*  
Paper tasks, especially those involving high-gloss paper, should be  
illuminated from either side rather than from in front, in order to  
avoid reflections of the light source in the surface of the task. These  
veiling reflections reduce the contrast between the print and the  
paper, imposing a veil over the task, which makes it hard to read.

perceived colors of objects illuminated by a source conform to those  
of the same objects illuminated by a reference source of comparable  
color temperature.  
**Color temperature \(of a light source\)\:** The absolute temperature  
of a blackbody radiator having a chromaticity \(apparent color\) equal  
to that of the light source.  
**Contrast\:** The difference in the luminance of an object and its  
immediate background \(e.g., between print and paper\).

**Dimming ballast\:** Special fluorescent lamp ballast, which, when  
used with a dimmer control, permits varying the light output.  
**Efficacy\:** The ratio of output to input, measured in different units.  
The efficacy of a lamp is the ratio of its output \(lumens\) to the input  
power \(watts\).  
**Efficiency\:** The ratio of output to input, measured in the same  
units. The efficiency of a luminaire is the ratio of its output \(in  
lumens\) to the input \(lumens from the lamps\).  
**Energy\:** The power consumed over a period of time. Electrical  
energy is measured in kilowatt-hours \(kWh\).  
**Floodlighting\:** Lighting designed to light a scene or object to a  
luminance greater than that of its surroundings. It may be for utility,  
advertising, or decorative purposes.  
**Fluorescent lamp\:** A tubular electric lamp filled with mercury  
vapor and having a coating of fluorescent material on its inner sur-  
face. Light is emitted by the phosphors when excited by an arc dis-  
charge between cathodes at the ends of the lamp. The composition of  
the phosphors determines the color quality of the lamp.  
**Footcandle \(fc\)\:** A unit of illuminance, the amount of light falling  
on a surface. 1 fc = 1 lumen/ft2  
.  
**Footlambert \(fl\)\:** 1 fl = 1 lumen/ft2  
.  
A unit of luminance, the brightness of a surface.  
**Frame-in kit\:** The electrified mounting frame or housing which  
supports the optical assembly \(reflector-trim\) of a recessed fixture.  
Frame-in kits are of various types, according to the nature of the con-  
struction and the lamp.  
**Halogen\: \(tungsten halogen\)\:** A type of incandescent lamp filled  
with a halogen gas. The advantages over regular incandescent lamps  
include excellent lumen maintenance and compactness. They also  
provide whiter light and longer life at a given light output.  
**Illuminance\:** The density of luminous flux falling on a surface.  
The level of illumination. Measured in footcandles.  
**Incandescent \(tungsten\) lamp\:** A lamp in which light is produced  
by a tungsten filament heated to incandescence by an electric current.  
**Kilowatt-hour \(kWh\)\:** A unit for measuring electrical energy con-  
sumption, kilowatt/hour = watts × hours/1000. Electric energy is sold  
by the kilowatt-hour \(kWh\).

LIGHTING  
Planning Data\: Glossary  
**Lamp\:** An artificial light source. \(Portable luminaries, equipped  
with cord and plug, are more properly referred to as *portable lamps.*\)  
**Lens\:** A glass or plastic element used in luminaries to change the  
direction of and control the distribution of light rays. Also called  
*prismatic lens.*  
**Light distribution, luminaires\:** Luminaires are classified accord-  
ing to the distribution of light up, down, or up/down\: indirect, direct,  
or indirect/direct.  
**Louver\:** A shielding element used to intercept light traveling in  
undesirable directions. A louver is generally an assembly of baffle  
elements arranged in grid or concentric form.  
**Low-voltage lamps\:** Incandescent lamps that operate at low volt-  
age, such as PAR 36 and MR-16 lamps that operate at 12 V.  
**Lumen\:** naire’s light output.  
The unit of luminous flux. A measure of a lamp’s or lumi-  
**Luminaire\:** A complete lighting unit consisting of a lamp or lamps,  
together with the parts designed to distribute the light, to position and  
protect the lamps, and to connect the lamps to the power supply.  
**Luminance\:** The luminous intensity of any light-emitting surface.  
Often referred to as *brightness.* Measured in footlamberts.  
**Matte surface\:** A dull surface, as opposed to a shiny \(specular\)  
surface. Light reflected from a matte surface is diffuse.  
**Parabolic reflector\:** A reflector shaped in cross-section like a  
parabola. A small light source at the focal point of the parabola pro-  
duces an essentially parallel beam of light.  
**Power\:** is measured in watts.  
The rate at which energy is developed or expended. Power  
**Power factor\:** The ratio of watts to volt-amperes drawn by fluo-  
rescent ballasts. It is, in effect, a measure of ballast efficiency. Com-  
mercial jobs require high power factor \(90 percent or higher\)  
because, for a given load, they draw less current, permitting more  
fixtures on a circuit and lower wiring costs.  
**Reflection\:** The process by which incident light is returned by a  
surface. It can be classified as specular or diffuse. Specular reflectors  
are like mirrors, returning rays of light at the same angle as they  
arrive and preserving sharp images. Diffuse reflectors return light in  
many directions; images are blurred or absent altogether.  
**Refraction\:** The process by which the direction of a ray of light  
changes as it passes obliquely from one medium to another. Fresnel and  
prismatic lenses utilize refraction to control the distribution of light.  
**Shielding\:** direct view of the light source.  
An arrangement of light-controlling material to prevent  
**Shielding angle\:** The angle measured from the horizontal at which  
a light source in a luminaire first becomes visible. It is the comple-  
mentary angle of the cutoff angle.  
*1112*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
**Spacing ratio\:** The spacing ratio for a particular luminaire is deter-  
mined from its candlepower distribution curve and, when multiplied  
by the mounting height above the work plane, gives the maximum  
spacing of luminaires for even illumination.  
**Specular reflector\:** A shiny, highly polished surface that acts like  
a mirror. It is used to control light precisely and looks dark except  
when viewed from the direction in which an image of the light source  
is projected.

That which is to be seen. The visual function is  
**Task lighting\:** Lighting directed to a specific surface or area to  
provide illumination for visual tasks.  
**Thermal protector\:** A device which disconnects power to a lumi-  
naire to protect against overheating due to abnormal conditions.  
**Transformer\:** down\) electrical voltage.  
A device used to raise \(step up\) or lower \(step  
**Veiling reflections\:** The reflections of light sources in a task which  
reduce the contrast between detail and background \(e.g., between  
print and paper, or print and the computer screen\), thus imposing a  
veil and decreasing task visibility.  
**Volt \(V\)\:** The unit of measurement of voltage.  
**Voltage\:** Electromotive force. The force or pressure which causes  
electricity to flow. Voltage is measured in volts \(V\).

**ANSI \(American National Standards Institute\)\:** The organiza-  
tion that develops voluntary guidelines and product performance  
standards for the electrical and other industries.  
**Ampere\:** A unit expressing the rate of flow of electric current.  
**Average rated life\:** An average rating, in hours, indicating when  
50 percent of a large group of lamps have failed, when operated at  
nominal lamp voltage and current; manufacturers use 3 h per start for  
fluorescent lamps and 10 h per start for HID lamps when performing  
lamp life testing procedures; every lamp type has a unique mortality  
curve that depicts its average rated life.  
**Ballast\:** A device used with an electric-discharge lamp to obtain  
the necessary circuit conditions \(voltage, current, and waveform\) for  
starting and operating; all fluorescent and HID light sources require  
a ballast for proper operation.  
**Ballast factor \(BF\)\:** The measured ability of a particular ballast  
to produce light from the lamp\(s\) it powers; ballast factor is derived  
by dividing the lumen output of a particular lamp/ballast com-  
bination by the lumen output of the same lamp\(s\) on a reference  
ballast.  
**Candela \(cd\)\:** The unit of measure indicating the luminous inten-  
sity \(candlepower\) of a light source in a specific direction; any given  
light source will have many different intensities, depending on the  
direction considered.  
**Candlepower distribution\:** A curve that represents the variation  
in luminous intensity \(expressed in candelas\) in a plane through the  
light center of a lamp or luminaire; each lamp or lamp/luminaire  
combination has a unique set of candlepower distributions that indi-  
cate how light will be spread.  
**Center beam candlepower \(CBCP\)\:** The intensity of light pro-  
duced at the center of a reflector lamp, expressed in candelas.  
**Color rendering index \(CRI\)\:** The measure of a light source is its  
ability to render the color of objects “correctly,” as compared with a  
reference source with comparable color temperature.  
**Correlated color temperature \(CCT\)\:** A specification of the  
color appearance of a lamp, relating its color to that of a reference  
source heated to a particular temperature, measured in degrees  
Kelvin \(K\); CCT generally measures the “warmth” or “coolness” of  
light source appearance.

*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
**Energy\:** A measure of work done by an electrical system over a  
given period of time, often expressed in kilowatthours \(kWh\).  
**Footcandle \(fc\)\:** foot.  
A unit of illuminance equal to 1 lumen per square  
**Frequency\:** The number of times per second that an alternating  
current system reverses from positive to negative and back to posi-  
tive, expressed in cycles per second or hertz \(Hz\).  
**Glare\:** Excessive brightness that may be caused by either direct or  
indirect viewing of a light source.  
**Harmonic\:** An electrical frequency that is an integer multiple of the  
fundamental frequency; for example, if 60 Hz is the fundamental fre-  
quency, then 120 Hz is the second harmonic and 180 Hz is the third  
harmonic; some electronic devices, such as ballasts or power supplies,  
can cause harmonic distortion, directly affecting power quality.  
**Illuminance\:** Light arriving at a surface, expressed in lumens per  
unit area; 1 lumen per square foot equals 1 footcandle, while 1 lumen  
per square meter equals 1 lux.  
**Lamp\:** Manufactured light source; the three broad categories of  
electric lamps are incandescent, fluorescent, and high intensity dis-  
charge \(HID\).  
**Light\:** Radiant energy that is capable of producing a visual sensation.  
**Light center length \(LCL\)\:** The distance from a specified reference  
point on a lamp base to its light center, typically expressed in inches.  
**Lumen \(lm\)\:** A unit of luminous flux; the overall light output of a  
luminous source is measured in lumens.  
**Lumen depreciation\:** The decrease in lumen output of a light  
source over time; every lamp type has a unique lumen depreciation  
curve \(sometimes called lumen maintenance curve\) depicting the  
pattern of decreasing light output.  
**Luminaire\:** A light fixture; the complete lighting unit, including  
lamp, reflector, ballast, socket, wiring, diffuser, and housing.  
**Luminance \(L\)\:** Light reflected in a particular direction; the pho-  
tometric quantity most closely associated with brightness perception,  
measured in units of luminous intensity \(candelas\) per unit area  
\(square feet or square meters\).

**Maximum overall length \(MOL\)\:** The total length of a lamp,  
from top of bulb to bottom of base, typically expressed in inches.  
**Power\:** The rate at which energy is taken from an electrical system  
or dissipated by a load, expressed in watts; power that is generated by  
a utility is typically expressed in volt-amperes.  
**Power factor\:** A measure of the effectiveness with which an elec-  
trical device converts volt-amperes to watts; devices with power fac-  
tors \(0.90\) are high-power-factor devices.

INTRODUCTION  
Most residential and commercial projects require the design of a cer-  
tain amount of architectural woodwork. Such woodwork may be in  
the form of built-in furniture, cabinets, display cases, reception desks,  
credenzas, work counters, kitchen cabinets, and so on. The extent of  
detail necessary to intelligently communicate and identify the scope  
and character of required woodwork is an important consideration in  
the preparation of contract drawings. It is necessary, therefore, that the  
designer have a knowledge of basic wood joinery and understand how  
to apply it in the preparation of construction details.  
Accordingly, the information in this section can be used as a general  
guide in the detailing of most woodwork items and addresses four  
areas of concern. The first deals with basic joinery and typical case-  
work details. This information is fundamental to an understanding of  
the detailing of woodwork. The typical joints illustrated vary in  
sophistication and structural integrity and represent the most com-  
mon methods of joining any two wood members. The casework  
details are intended to illustrate the construction of routine casework  
and are divided into three categories\: exposed face frame, flush over-  
lay, and reveal overlay. The second area deals with custom wood-  
work and includes details of woodwork items selected directly from  
contract drawings contributed by various interior design and archi-  
tectural firms. This information should prove helpful in providing the  
reader with a more global perspective of how different firms  
approach the detailing of some common types of woodwork items  
and the extent of that detailing. The third area of this section deals  
with standard cornices and moldings, and is intended to simply pro-  
vide the designer with dimensional and design information relative  
to the many standard items available on the market. Since many  
woodwork items involve some movable elements, the fourth area of  
this section deals with furniture hardware.

# Characteristics of Joints  
Joints may be divided into four general types\: *butted, shiplapped,*  
*tongued-and-grooved,* and *mitered.* Used in their simple basic form,  
none is satisfactory for cabinet work except the tongued-and-  
grooved type in certain instances. However, when variously com-  
bined or when reinforced with gluing and dowels or splines,  
satisfactory joints can be developed.  
*Butt Joint*  
This is a simple but weak joint that opens easily and may show end  
wood when used at angles. Strength and range of use is greatly  
increased by use of the *mortise and tenon* and *dowels* and even more  
when a *straight spline* is included. Use of a glued *butterfly spline*  
with a butt joint produces an extremely strong joint. These variations  
are widely used to produce large flush surfaces of solid wood or  
backing for veneers.  
*Shiplap Joint*  
Stronger than a butt joint but subject to opening from shrinkage,  
shiplap joints are rarely used in a simple form in cabinet work except  
for door rebates. This joint is often molded to conceal shrinkage in  
quirks or combined as a *miter and shoulder* for corners. Another  
variation is the *shoulder joint.*  
*Tongue-and-Groove Joint*  
A strong joint, the tongue-and-groove joint is widely used for reen-  
trant angles. The effect of wood shrinkage is concealed when the  
joint is beaded or otherwise molded. In expensive cabinet work,  
glued *dovetail* and *multiple tongue-and-groove* are used.  
*Miter Joints*  
Miter joints are weak and difficult to fit if used alone. Joints with  
*miter brads* are sufficiently strong for short lengths. Joints made in  
combination with other forms, as a *tongue-and-groove miter,* are  
tight and sturdy.  
# Use of Joints  
Use of certain types of joints depends to a large degree on the type of  
work and skill involved. The following notes indicate use of joints in  
various categories, but cannot be regarded as an inclusive checklist.  
*For Panels and Shelving*  
For panels, shelving, or wherever the end of one piece butts against  
the face of another, use a *housed joint,* with or without cover mold, or  
some type of *tongue-and-groove* joint. Omit glue to avoid splitting  
due to swelling or shrinkage.  
*For Joining Stiles and Rails*  
Use *mortise and tenon,* glued in better work. Dowels may be used or  
hardwood wedges may be driven and glued into ends of tenons in  
high-grade work.  
*For Reentrant Corners*  
Use *shoulder joints* for inexpensive work. *Tongue-and-groove* is  
sturdier. Both should be glued, are often screwed together, and may  
be glued to a rough frame.  
*For External Corners*  
Simple *miter* and *quirk and miter* both lack strength. *Miter brads* are  
practical only for short lengths. *Miter and shoulder* glued and face-  
screwed or nailed is satisfactory \(generally millwork\). *Miter and*  
*spline* is preferable. In high-grade work exterior corners are rein-  
forced by gluing to a corner post or short lengths of blocking.  
*Glued Joints*  
When screws, nails, and so on, can not be used, or when fine work is to  
be veneered, the strength of the joint depends on the accuracy of milling  
and total glue surface. Glue surface may be tremendously increased by  
using multiple or offset tongues and grooves, by forming miter cuts into  
waves, multiple shoulders, tongues and grooves, and so on. Such work  
is cabinet work. If done by a reliable cabinetmaker, a guarantee should  
be obtained and joint detail and composition of glue left to him or her.  
*Moldings*  
Moldings should be applied in continuous lengths if possible. Use  
simple miter for necessary joints, cope reentrant angles unless exces-  
sively undercut; miter external corners.  
# Terminology  
**Blind dado\:** Variation of conventional dado with applied edge  
“stopping” or concealing dado groove. Used when case body  
edge is exposed.  
**Conventional dovetail joint\:** Traditional method for joining  
drawer sides to fronts or backs. Usually limited to flush- or  
lipped-type drawers.  
**Conventional mortise and tenon joint\:** Joinery method for  
assembling square-edged surfaces such as case face frames.  
**Dowel joint\:** Alternative joinery method for serving same  
function as conventional mortise and tenon.  
**Drawer lock-joint\:** Another joinery method for joining drawer  
sides to fronts. Usually used for flush-type installation but  
can be adapted to lip- or overlay-type drawers.  
**Edge banding\:** Method of concealing plys or inner cores of  
plywood or particleboard when edges are exposed. Thickness  
or configuration will vary with manufacturers’ practices.  
**Exposed end detail\:** Illustrates attachment of finished end of  
case body to front frame using butt joint.  
**Exposed end detail\:** Illustrates attachment of finished end of  
case body to front frame using mitered joint.  
**French dovetail joint\:** Method for joining drawer sides to  
fronts when fronts conceal metal extension slides or overlay  
the case faces.  
**Haunch mortise and tenon joint\:** Joinery method for assem-  
bling paneled doors or stile- and rail-type paneling.  
**Paneled door details\:** Joinery techniques when paneled effect  
is desired. Profiles are optional, as is the use of flat or raised  
panels. Solid lumber raised panels may be used when width  
does not exceed 10 in. Rim raised panels are recommended  
when widths exceed this dimension or when transparent fin-  
ish is used.

**Spline joint\:** Used for gluing plywood in width or length.  
Since the spline serves to align faces, this joint is also used  
for items requiring site assembly.  
**Stop dado\:** Another method of concealing dado exposure.  
Applicable when veneer edging or solid lumber is used.  
**Stub tenon\:** Joinery method for assembling stile- and rail-type  
frames that are additionally supported, such as web or skele-  
ton case frames.  
**Through dado\:** Conventional joint used for assembly of case  
body members—dado is usually concealed by application of  
case face frame.

# Using a Corner Lipping  
For preveneered chipboard, a lipping can be used to make a corner  
joint that also masks the core. The grain of the lipping is set at right  
angles to the face veneer of the board and forms a feature. The lip-  
ping can be left square or you can shape it. You can also use con-  
trasting wood.  
*Joints for Corner Lippings*  
Butt-join the lipping or, for improved strength, make a tongue-and-  
groove joint. Use a loose-tongued joint or cut the groove in the edge  
of the board and the tongue in the lipping. Whichever way you decide,  
stop the tongue and the groove so they do not show on the edge \(**1**\).  
A stronger joint suitable for plinths or carcase construction can be  
made using a thicker lipping. Cut a barefaced tongue on the board  
and a matching goove in the lipping. The section can be shaped if  
required, as indicated by the broken line \(**2**\).  
# Types of Lipping  
The edges of man-made boards must be finished with a lipping to  
cover the core material. You can use either long-grain or cross-grain  
veneer or a more substantial solid-wood lipping of matching or  
contrasting wood. Lippings can be applied before or after surface  
veneering. In the case of preveneered boards, you have no choice but  
to lip the edge last.  
*Applying Lippings*  
The simplest edging to apply is the preglued veneer type that is  
ironed onto the edge. These edge lippings are primarily sold for fin-  
ishing veneered chipboard panels and are available in a limited range  
of matching veneer.  
For a more substantial edging, and one that can be shaped, cut thick  
lippings from matching solid wood. Butt-join the lipping to the edge  
or tongue and groove it for greater strength.  
Miter the corners of thick lippings to improve the finished appear-  
ance. This is particularly necessary if the edge is molded.  
When gluing up a long lipping, use a stiff batten between the lipping  
and the clamp heads to help spread the clamping forces over the full  
length of the work.  
When planing glued-on edge lippings to width, take care not to touch  
the surface veneer, particularly when working across the direction of  
the grain. Finish the edge with a sanding block.  
Deep lippings will substantially stiffen the boards for use as shelves  
or worktops. Set the full thickness of the board into a rabbet cut in the  
lipping.  
# Working Man-Made Boards  
*Cutting by Machine*  
Man-made boards are best cut to finished dimensions with clean-  
cutting, high-speed machine tools. Use a circular saw blade with  
tungsten-carbide-tipped teeth if cutting a lot of board. The teeth of  
the saw blade should pierce the board from the face side. When using  
a hand-held power saw, have the panel face down, and for a table  
saw, face up. Run the board across the saw relatively quickly. If using  
a band saw, run the saw fast but feed the board slowly. You can also  
use a handheld router run against a long fence clamped to the work.  
*Cutting by Hand*  
For handsawing, use a 10- to 12-PPI panel saw. A tenon saw can also  
be used for smaller work. To prevent breakout of the surface, make  
all cutting lines with a knife to sever the fibers or laminate. Also, hold  
the saw at a shallow angle. Support the board close to the cutting line.  
Lay it face side up over the bench, or, if it is a particularly bulky  
piece, support it on sawhorses.  
If cutting a large board, climb onto it so you can reach the cutting line  
comfortably. Have an assistant support the offcut if it is unmanage-  
able. Otherwise, set up some means of support so it does not break  
away before you finish the cut.  
*Planing the Edges*  
Plane the edges as you would for solid wood, but treat each edge as  
though it were end grain. You should, therefore, plane from both ends  
toward the middle.

Cabinet Work  
# Purpose  
The following information outlines methods of assembly and instal-  
lation of common cabinet work. Solutions of typical problems are  
presented without attempting to detail specific cabinets.  
# Assembly  
High-grade cabinet and veneered work is assembled as far as  
possible at the shop. Joints are glued and blocked, and sometimes  
secured with finishing nails or screws. Carpentry and millwork are  
generally put together with finishing nails if of soft wood, or with  
screws if of hardwood. Hardwood should be drilled to prevent  
splitting before using nails or screws, and heads should be counter-  
sunk and concealed by cover molds, molding quirks, or putty, plas-  
tic wood, or other filler, colored to match the finish. No nails,  
screws, or joints should be visible unless they are intentionally  
incorporated in design.  
*Shrinkage and Warping*  
Such effects can be largely eliminated by proper detailing and con-  
struction. *Wide flat surfaces* \(solid or veneered\) should be made up of  
several narrow strips glued and doweled, splined, or dovetailed  
together. Cleats may also be screwed or keyed to backs of wide sur-  
faces. *Joints in corners, sheathing, and so on,* should be concealed  
within quirks of molds \(as in molded tongue and groove\) or return  
faces \(shoulder joints\). *Panels* should be rigidly secured on one side  
only, and are often left entirely loose. Housed joints, not glued, per-  
mit panels to expand and contract without splitting.  
*Large Molded Surfaces*  
These surfaces \(such as cornices or mantels\) should always be shop-  
assembled and delivered with scribe-molds \(see “Scribing”\) loosely  
tacked to assembled units.  
# Installation  
All grades of woodwork should be preservative treated or back  
painted before erection, preferably before delivery to the job. Satis-  
factory priming coats are aluminum paint or white lead in linseed oil,  
thinned with turpentine or mineral spirits.  
*Preparation*  
On frame walls plaster may be limited to one or two coats, recessed  
between studs, or omitted. In the latter case, building paper should be  
used between woodwork and studs. On masonry, plaster may consist  
of one or two coats or may be omitted. Masonry surfaces, particu-  
larly exterior walls, should be waterproofed or woodwork should be  
protected by a layer of waterproof paper and should always be furred  
out. When finish of the interior of cabinets is plaster, either plain or  
canvas covered, the final coat of plaster is applied after erection of  
cabinet.  
*Grounds*  
Grounds of soft wood for attaching cabinet work must be accurately  
located, are secured directly to framing members or furring, and must  
be concealed.  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1189* Architectural Woodwork  
STANDARD JOINERY AND CASEWORK DETAILS  
Plastic-Covered Casework  
*Blocking*  
Blocking of rough lumber should be erected for supporting raised  
floors and large or heavy cabinet work, if it can be concealed. Block-  
ing must be accurately placed and secured with nails.  
*Shimming*  
Minor irregularities in blocking, furring, or placement of studs may  
be corrected by using shims \(wedge-shaped pieces of wood, often  
shingles\) to bring completed work to plumb and level lines. Shim-  
ming should be concealed.  
*Scribing*  
Scribing is the practice of fitting edges of cabinet work accurately to  
all irregularities of finish plaster, masonry, or other abutting surfaces.  
Wood moldings, panel frames, or cabinet returns to be scribed should  
be provided with a beveled edge.  
*Prefabricated Woodwork*  
Prefabricated woodwork is generally delivered knocked down for  
assembly on the job and is erected similarly to custom-made work.  
Consult manufacturers’ data.

Classical Composite Column  
The columns of the classical orders of Greek and Roman architec-  
ture are often adapted for modern construction. These orders are  
Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. The Composite  
figure \(below\) names the basic features of a classical order and  
gives some of the proportions of the column in relation to the shaft  
diameter as a basic unit of measurement.  
Pilasters are rectangular in plan, without taper from top to bottom. If  
used structurally they are usually referred to as *piers,* but are treated  
architecturally as columns. The typical pilaster extends a third or less  
of its width from the wall surface behind it.

# INTRODUCTION  
In most instances, the design process requires a knowledge of, or at  
the very least an awareness of, certain specialized elements that can  
contribute heavily to the success or failure of a project in terms of  
aesthetics or function, or both. These elements may take the form of  
manufactured off-the-shelf products or consist of design theories,  
standards, and guidelines for certain areas of expertise. Accordingly,  
this section deals with 10 such elements, ranging from plantscaping  
to accessories.  
Information can be found concerning the height, spacing, and diam-  
eter of indoor trees and floor plants. Also included are planting stan-  
dards, details, and maintenance information. The section dealing  
with signage and graphics provides information on signage systems,  
symbols, mounting heights, and locations. Other sections provide  
data on audiovisual systems, including projection room layouts and  
details, and auditorium seating arrangements and sightlines. The sec-  
tion dealing with security includes information on door and window  
hardware, mailbox rooms, lighting, and security systems. Still other  
sections provide information on color theory and window treatments,  
including draperies and curtains, shutters and shades, and rods, hold-  
backs, and ties.

PLANTSCAPING  
Design Guidelines  
# PLANTSCAPING  
# DESIGN GUIDELINES  
# Designing with Plants  
Any successful design uses plants that are compatible not only in an  
aesthetic design sense, but also in their growing requirements. No  
matter how beautiful the design, if neighboring plants are not matched  
to the correct growing conditions, parts of the design will either dete-  
riorate or require elaborate maintenance. The aesthetic design consid-  
erations involve choosing the proper variety of plant textures, heights,  
and spacing to give the desired effect. The growing considerations  
involve the proper matching of light intensity, soil, and water, as well  
as proper container size, to the plant environmental requirements.  
Of all the growing conditions, the most important is the light intensity.  
It is easy to underestimate the amount of available light, since the  
human eye can easily see in 20 footcandles of light, while even the  
plant needing the lowest light requires 50 to 75 footcandles to remain  
healthy. If the light intensity is to be below 100 footcandles, even these  
low-light plants must be slowly acclimatized prior to installation.  
No matter if the space to be planted is a small office, a large interior  
garden, or a cafeteria, the first step is to ascertain the actual level of  
the existing or planned lighting. To allow maximum creativity in the  
planting design, the light intensity should be considered in the initial  
planning stages, especially in large areas such as those in shopping  
malls or corporate interior gardens. Adding the needed lighting fix-  
tures after the initial electrical installation is often expensive or  
impossible. In smaller-scale situations, such as offices or homes,  
extra light fixtures should be added or the plants should be chosen  
according to the available light. If the plants do not have the proper  
light intensity, they will die. The lower the light intensity below the  
minimum needed by the species, the faster they will do so.  
Since the light source \(incandescent, fluorescent, sun, or other\) is not  
important, but the light intensity is, accurate intensity measurements  
are essential. For these measurements we recommend the General  
Electric Model 213 or 214 light meter or its equivalent. The mea-  
surements must be made at the level of the plant foliage; they must  
be made several times a day on several days typical of the location if  
sunlight is used; and they must take curtains, tinted glass, and other  
light-shielding devices into account. Only light hitting the top of the  
leaves is effective. While underlighting with spotlights can create  
dramatic effects, it does very little to help the plant.  
After the light intensity is determined, the plants should be selected  
from the appropriate light-level group \(see Fig. 7\), consistent with the  
design aims. Plants that will be growing near one another should also  
have similar water requirements \(also given in Fig. 7\). If plants with  
different watering requirements must be close, they should be kept in  
their own growing containers so they can be watered separately.  
An interior planting designer creates the mood through the interplay  
of plant texture and plant height, working only with those plants that  
will live under the predetermined light intensity. Color cannot really  
*1328*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
be used as a design element, since the average interior light intensity  
is seldom more than 100 footcandles and brightly colored plants or  
blooming flowers need up to 1000 footcandles. If flowering plants  
are used where the lighting conditions are normal, they will generally  
have to be replaced every few days.  
*Plant Texture*  
The good designer will provide for design variety through the clever  
use of plant texture. The term is used here to describe the general  
structure, shape, and appearance of the plant, regardless of height. It  
includes the size, shape, edging, and thickness of the plant’s leaves,  
as well as its overall shape and the arrangement and number of leaves  
on the plant.  
Five general rules concerning texture should be kept in mind.  
1\. Juxtapose fragmented foliage \(such as that of a palm\) with solid  
foliage \(say, that of a dracaena\).  
2\. Avoid too much of the same type of foliage \(e.g., large flat  
leaves\) in one area, unless a border or hedge effect is desired.  
3\. An exception to these previous rules on groupings is the palm.  
Although all palms have similar foliage, they vary slightly in  
color and interest, so that different types of palms may be planted  
together.  
4\. To create interest, mix small-leaved with large-leaved plants, and  
narrow-leaved with broad-leaved plants.  
5\. When using plants as specimens, especially as interior design  
elements in offices or homes, pick the plant with the background  
fabric, carpet, or wallpaper in mind. For example, a busy foliage  
plant will fight with a busy fabric.  
*Plant Height*  
Plant height not only determines the scale of the design, but adds  
variety to the plant groupings. There are six general rules regarding  
plant height selection to keep in mind.  
1\. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. In the plant grouping, build up with the low plants in front. If the  
grouping can be seen from all sides, the grouping must be well  
balanced throughout and built up to the center height.  
If a plant has canes with no lower foliage, try to place the lower  
plants in front to conceal the absence of foliage of the taller plants  
in the rear.  
Uneven sizes throughout a grouping add more interest than con-  
sistent levels of foliage.  
If a single plant is desired to hide a column or some other object,  
be sure that the plant height, including its container, is about  
three-fourths the height of the object to be concealed.  
Keep the scale of the surroundings in mind when choosing the  
plant height. A 3-ft plant is fine next to a desk, but a plant of at least  
6 ft should be selected if it is to be viewed when entering a room.  
By convention, interior plant heights are measured from the bot-  
tom of the root ball or planter, while exterior plant heights are  
measured from the top of the root ball. The reason is that interior  
plants are usually placed in a container or raised planter, and the  
total available height from floor to ceiling is fixed. Specialties  
PLANTSCAPING  
Design Guidelines  
*Plant Spacing*  
Under certain conditions, the plants of an interior landscaping design  
will grow. Therefore, any possible change in the plant size must be  
considered by the designer. If the lighting intensity is at or below the  
recommended level, there will be little or no plant growth and the  
plant size and relationships will change little over time. If the light-  
ing intensity is well above the required level, there will be plant  
growth, with different plant species growing at different rates.  
Unlike outdoor plants, indoor tropical plants seldom grow outward;  
most of their growth occurs upward. The main exceptions are the  
*Ficus* family, the schefflera, and the *Philodendron Selloum,* which  
will spread somewhat outward. If a full plant design is desired, the  
required number of plants should be placed close together at the time  
of installation since future growth will seldom fill in the bare spots.  
Even if the light intensity is high enough, before the plant can grow  
significantly, its root system must be able to expand. Thus, the best  
way to ensure that the size relationships of the plants do not change  
is to keep them in their original growing containers and not to replant  
them into a growing medium. If they are kept in the original contain-  
ers, they will become pot-bound and future growth will be automati-  
cally limited.  
Plant material is sold on the basis of height or growing-container  
size, and one must be familiar with the particular species to know  
what the spread will be. For each plant species considered here, Fig.  
1 lists the height range for each plant in each standard growing-  
container size and gives a recommended minimum center-to-center  
plant spacing. This recommended spacing is based on experience  
with the plant’s branching habits and growth patterns and will give a  
full plant design. If an open or a less full design is called for, the  
spacing should be increased.  
When the plants are to be displayed in individual planters or decora-  
tive containers, each plant, still in its growing can, is placed directly  
into the planter or container, on top of a layer of drainage material of  
the appropriate depth. However, many standard planters have lips  
that reduce the interior diameter to less than the overall diameter.  
This inner diameter should be larger than the growing can’s diameter  
so that the plant can be placed directly into it without being repotted  
and risking the attendant danger of root damage. To emphasize this  
requirement, Fig. 2 gives the standard planter diameter needed for  
each standard size of growing container. The size of the lip changes  
when a nonstandard type is used. If space is limited, this measure-  
ment should be carefully checked.

fact that most standard planters  
have either a 1-in lip or no lip at all.  
Because the growing cans some-  
times have ridges or become  
deformed, it is always best to allow  
for a little extra leeway, even for  
planters with no lip. Some manu-  
facturers, however, put 2-in lips on  
their planters, a possibility that  
should be checked. If the planter is  
an automatic watering type, the  
inside and outside diameters will be  
quite different, depending on the  
manufacturer.

*1332*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design* **DESIGN GUIDELINES**  
*Writing Specifications*  
The interior landscaping business is very competitive, and a common  
practice is for the architect or designer to send out the landscaping  
specifications for bids. Unless the specifications for the job are well  
written, however, there are many ways for the contractor to cut corners  
and still be within the specifications. Consequently, the final installa-  
tion may not be what the designer had in mind. The lowest bid is not  
necessarily the best bargain, unless the specifications are very tightly  
written or unless the architect is dealing with a well-established land-  
scape contractor with a reputation for high-quality work.  
The following are some suggested guidelines to use in writing spec-  
ifications. If they are observed, the bids received will accurately  
reflect the design requirements of the job.  
1\. Specify the plant heights within a 6-in bracket. For example, des-  
ignate 5 to 51⁄2 ft or 51⁄2 to 6 ft. If the specification were simply “5  
to 6 ft,” the supplier could use all 5-ft plants, which are consider-  
ably less expensive than 6-ft plants.  
2\. For corn plants, dwarf dragon trees, and the like, specify the  
number of canes and approximate number of foliage heads, as  
well as the height. The difference in cost between a two-cane and  
a three-cane corn plant of the same height is not minor.  
3\. For reed palms, bamboo palms, and the like, specify the number  
of stems desired, five to six being medium full.  
4\. For the green dracaena and white-striped dracaena, list the num-  
ber of main foliage stems desired. They range from one to three  
stems.  
5\. For ficus trees, it should be specified whether the bush style or  
standard tree style is desired. In the bush style, the plant has multi-  
ple stems \(ranging from two to five in number\) branching out from  
the base of the plants. The standard tree or “lollipop” style has one  
main 5- to 6-ft stem with a sheared, ball-shaped foliage head.  
6\. Small plants should be specified as to single plants or combina-  
tions or several plants. Examples are dumb cane, Chinese ever-  
green, and white flag.  
7\. If ivy trailers are desired, their length should be specified. The  
trailers take up to eight months to grow, depending on the length,  
so the designer must plan for these up to a year before installa-  
tion. Examples are grape ivy, swedish ivy, golden pothos, com-  
mon philodendron, and wax plant.  
8\. Specifications should call for plant cleaning and spraying before  
installation.  
9\. Perlite should be specified as the drainage material for both  
planters and decorative containers. Styrofoam, which is much  
cheaper, is often used but has little long-term value.  
10\. The amount of ingredients in large planters \(soil mixture,  
drainage material, soil separator\) should be specified, as should  
the composition of each of the ingredients.  
11\. If bark chips, moss cover, or other soil coverings are desired, they  
should be specified.  
12\. Special attention should be given to the description of specimen  
plants, including the number of heads, stems, or canes, and any  
unusual stem structure that is desired. If canes with character  
\(such as angle and peculiarity of growth\), tufts of foliage at vari-  
ous heights, or other unusual features are wanted, they should be  
specifically mentioned.  
13\. If the landscape contractor will not maintain the plants after  
installation, provision should be made for a training program for  
the maintenance crew. Also, the contractor should provide for  
Specialties  
PLANTSCAPING  
Plant Use and Procedures  
two weeks’ initial maintenance of the plants and replacement of  
any that fall below specifications during the period.  
14\. If the landscape contractor is to maintain the plants after the  
installation \(usually the best all-around solution\), such an agree-  
ment should be reached before the plants are installed and a  
maintenance contract should be signed. This contract should  
include a provision for the replacement of any plant that falls  
below specifications because of faulty maintenance. This stipula-  
tion gives the contractor incentive for professional-quality main-  
tenance.  
15\. If a large garden is planned and the landscape contractor is given  
design responsibility for it, the contractor should provide a floor  
plan of the garden for the designer’s approval, before the instal-  
lation.  
16\. If the architect or designer provides the landscape contractor with  
a detailed planting floor plan and the contractor finds it impossi-  
ble to meet all the specifications \(because of unavailability of  
certain species, etc.\), the contractor and the designer or architect  
should agree in writing on any changes.  
# PLANT USE AND PROCEDURES  
# Use of Interior Plants and Procedures  
The general rule of interior planting design is to vary the plant  
heights, shapes, and textures to give the desired design feeling con-  
sistent with the available light level and planting space. The best way  
to learn to apply this rule to specific situations is to study successful  
designs.  
Interior planting designs have usually been found to fall into one of  
two categories\: \(1\) interior gardens, both large and small, such as  
those seen in residential and hotel lobbies, corporate headquarters  
reception areas, and enclosed shopping mall public spaces; and \(2\)  
open plan or specimen design, like office landscaping designs and  
designs that use individual plants as living sculptures. In both cate-  
gories of design, the main requirements to be considered are the  
available light intensity, the scale of the design, and the client’s  
wishes and budget. After these basic requirements are determined,  
however, the design considerations are somewhat different for the  
two types of design.  
*Interior Gardens*  
Interior gardens are planting areas, sometimes contained in built-in  
planters, that have a variety of plants and that convey their design  
feeling through plant arrangements rather than through individual  
plant specimens. Small gardens generally contain only a single  
grouping of plants, act as a single design element, and have uniform  
lighting and watering requirements throughout. Large gardens have a  
variety of plant groupings and varying design feelings among the  
groupings, and they can encompass areas of different lighting and  
watering requirements. Since any garden conveys its effects through  
the juxtaposition of different plants, a single dominant plant cannot  
be considered a garden from the design point of view, even if it is in  
a built-in planter with ground-cover plants.  
In designing any built-in planter, enough planter depth must be pro-  
vided to allow the root ball or the planting can be covered with soil  
and to rest on 4 to 8 in of drainage material. Since soil and gravel are  
expensive, it is best not to overdesign the planter by making it larger  
than necessary and not to buy too much soil to fill in between the  
plants. \(For example, a depth of 11⁄2 to 2 ft is usually enough for most  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1333* Specialties  
PLANTSCAPING  
Plant Use and Procedures  
small gardens.\) Figure 1 lists the size of the growing can for different  
sizes of plants of each species. The depth of the largest growing can,  
plus the depth of the drainage material, yields the minimum planter  
depth for the garden. The volume of the planter minus the total vol-  
ume of all the growing cans indicates the amount of additional soil  
and drainage material to be provided.  
If the planter is already in place, its depth may limit the size of the  
plants that may be used. Since soil must reach to the top of the root  
ball or can, the only way to utilize too shallow a planter is to put  
the large plant in the center and to build up from the edge inward.  
The planter must be wide enough to slant the soil gradually so that  
the slope is not too great.  
**Small gardens** While a garden may be large enough to have only a  
single design function, that function can be quite varied, provided  
that the lighting intensity is appropriate. It can serve as a small glen  
or a space separator, or it can be simply a large decorative planter.  
The garden can be airy and open or it can be dense and closed.  
Planter depth of 11⁄2 to 2 ft is usually sufficient.  
Also, some small gardens can be designed to be changed with the  
seasons. Often, flowering plants, such as chrysanthemums or azal-  
eas, are used, but the plants must then be replaced every two weeks.  
If the seasonal or flowering plant changes are desired, the plants  
should be left in their containers so that they may be easily moved.  
Some care should be given to the planter design so that the growing  
cans are not obvious and do not detract from the arrangement.  
Creative additions of volcanic rocks, small ponds, or fountains can  
be quite attractive and set off and enhance the plants. However, with  
the usually limited space in the small garden, these additions can pro-  
duce a crowded or overdone appearance. Overcrowding will give a  
jungle effect that is rarely desired.  
Just as in other design fields, good proportion and good sense will  
create a pleasing design that is neither overlooked or overbearing.  
**Large gardens** Large gardens are simply larger versions of small  
gardens, but their very size opens up more design possibilities, since  
they may be subdivided into related sections. The shape, height, and  
texture of the planters may be varied from section to section. The  
plants may be chosen to reflect varying design moods and functions.  
The lighting and watering requirements may differ between sections.  
In fact, variety is often necessary for good large-garden design, since  
a large mass of similar plants or plant groupings will create the  
impression of a monotonous forest or field.  
Because large indoor gardens usually are in areas of high ceilings,  
the light level must be very carefully considered. Just the presence of  
windows or skylights does not guarantee enough light. In addition, if  
the light sources are distant from the plants, the taller plants may  
effectively block some of the light from reaching the lower plants  
and foliage.  
When large areas are to be planted, there is a tendency to use rocks,  
pools, gravel, or fountains to cut down the plant costs and simplify  
the maintenance. Care is essential when using these elements to pre-  
vent the plant arrangement from looking bare and sterile.  
Large gardens are most commonly used in shopping malls. The  
skilled designer will take this illumination into account, as well as  
design the garden to enhance the shopper’s view of the stores.  
*1334*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
The designer will always remember that large gardens achieve their  
effectiveness by both the proper variation of plant groupings and the  
proper variation of plants within the groupings.  
**Procedures for planting gardens** As pointed out earlier, a suc-  
cessful garden needs proper planting, since improper procedures can  
inflict severe damage. Correct planting involves not only correct  
technique and design but also correct organization.  
The techniques of proper drainage, spacing, and handling will ensure  
that the plants remain healthy once they are installed. Experienced  
supervision of the installation staff will be important in this regard,  
since a large installation of expensive plants is no place for the on-  
the-job training of the supervisor.  
Proper planning and organization will ensure that the plants remain  
healthy between unloading and planting. If the plants are left on an  
unheated loading dock or stored in an unlighted or unheated room  
until they are installed, irreversible damage may occur.  
**Drainage** Overwatering of plants leads to root rot and is often  
more harmful than underwatering. To minimize this danger, the  
planter or container should be installed with proper drainage. The  
simplest technique is to provide a porous reservoir below the plant-  
ing soil; any excess water will then drain into it from the root ball and  
be slowly fed back to the soil as the soil dries out.  
To prepare the planter or decorative container, the drainage material  
is poured into the bottom and leveled. The plant growing can is  
placed on top of the drainage layer and surrounded with more of the  
drainage material. For the smaller plants \(in pots 6 in or less in diam-  
eter\), a 1-in depth of drainage material is usually enough. For the  
larger plants, a layer of 3 to 4 in is suggested. For very large gardens,  
about one-third of the planter depth should be the drainage layer, pro-  
vided it leaves enough room for the root ball or planting can.  
The drainage material can be perlite \(a readily available synthetic  
material\) alone or mixed with small pebbles or gravel. The perlite is  
suggested since it is porous enough to feed back the excess water to  
the soil as the soil dries out. If only gravel or pebbles are used, the  
excess water will sit and stagnate in the reservoir and will not be fed  
back to the plants.  
Even with the proper drainage layer, overwatering is possible if so  
much excess water is used that it fills up the reservoir. The water  
level in a small container can be determined by tapping the container  
at various intervals and listening for the change in sound. In large  
planted areas, it is wise to provide for dipstick readings of the water  
level. To take such a reading, rigid hollow plastic tubes, with a cloth  
over their lower ends, are planted at intervals along with the plants.  
The hollow tubes reach from the top of the container to just above the  
drainage layer and the cloth on the bottom prevents soil or drainage  
material from entering the tube. A dipstick is lowered into the tube  
until it touches the cloth. If the stick, upon removal, shows more than  
1⁄2 in of water, there is too much water in the bottom of the planter.  
If gravel is used as part of the drainage material, it should be 3⁄8 to 1⁄2  
in in diameter. Under no circumstances should limestone be used,  
since it is alkaline and will raise the pH of the water to a level that is  
too high for most tropical plants.  
**Soil separator** If the plants are removed from their growing cans  
and replanted in growing soil, it is usually best to use a soil separator Specialties  
PLANTSCAPING  
Plant Use and Procedures  
Fig. 3 Soil separation  
between the drainage layer and the planting soil. The separator is a  
semiporous sheet, often composed of fiberglass wool, which serves  
to keep the soil from falling into the drainage material. If the separa-  
tor is not used, soil will clog the drainage material. Fiberglass wool  
of building material grade should not be used, as it contains chemi-  
cals that will damage the plant \(Fig. 3\).  
**Planting medium** Because the root systems of tropical plants are  
much finer than those of outdoor plants, pure topsoil is too heavy and  
too easily compacted to be used as a planting medium. It will con-  
strict the plant roots and will retain too much water.  
For the common tropical plants discussed here, we recommend the use  
of the foliage plant mix developed by Cornell University. Because it is  
easiest to calculate the quantity of needed soil in terms of the volume  
of the planter to be filled, the formula given here is for 1 yd3 of soil. For  
conversion purposes, 1 yd3 equals 21.7 bushels, 765 L, or 27 ft3  
.  
*Sphagnum peat moss\:* 1⁄2 yd3 = 383 L  
*Vermiculite \#2\:* 1⁄4 yd3 = 191 L  
*Perlite, medium fine\:*1⁄4 yd3 = 191 L  
*Ground limestone, dolomitic\:* 0.85 gal = 13.5 cup = 3.2 L  
*Superphosphate 20% solution\:* 0.21 gal = 3.4 cup = 0.79 L  
*10-10-10 fertilizer\:* 0.32 gal = 5.1 cup = 1.2 L  
*Iron sulphate\:* 0.11 gal = 1.7 cup = 0.41 L  
*Potassium nitrate\:* 0.11 gal = 1.7 cup = 0.41 L  
While this Cornell foliage plant mix gives the best all-around results,  
a simpler mix that gives good results in most cases is as follows\:  
1⁄3 by volume sterilized commercial mix of peat moss and vermic-  
ulite  
1⁄3 by volume sterilized topsoil  
1⁄3 by volume perlite  
This mix is particularly effective for container planting. If it is to be  
used in a larger garden planting, such as a shopping mall garden,  
more perlite should be added for improved drainage.  
The peat and topsoil mix is considerably heavier than the Cornell  
mix and both are heavier wet than dry. If the garden is not situated at  
grade level, this weight can be an important consideration. Figure 4  
gives guidelines to be used in estimating the weight of the planting  
medium.  
**Planting organization** The basic ingredients for a large planting  
installation are drainage material, planting medium, soil separator,  
plant material, material-handling equipment, light, water, and labor.  
Organization of all these ingredients is important since every one  
must be ready and available for a successful installation. Arrange-  
ments for all these factors should be made ahead of time, and they  
should be ready and waiting when the plants are delivered.  
The amount of interior volume in the planters and containers deter-  
mines the amount of needed drainage material, soil separator, and  
planting medium. If detailed blueprints are not available, actually  
measuring the planters is generally a good way to obtain this volume.  
The relationship between planting medium, drainage material, and  
soil separator can be determined using the guidelines of the previous  
subsection. If the plants are to be left in their cans \(as generally rec-  
ommended\), the space between the plants is filled with drainage  
material. If they are removed from their cans, the space between  
plants is filled with planting medium. In either case, the volume dis-  
placed by the plants is simply the sum of the volume contained in the  
growing cans. Information for each standard size of growing con-  
tainer is given in Fig. 5.  
The installation should not be started unless all lights and water con-  
nections are operating, as the plants will need both light and water  
during the installation—especially the light. If the plants are deliv-  
ered dry, they should be watered in their cans unless they are to be  
planted at once and watered immediately after planting. If the plants  
are removed from their cans and placed into dry planting medium,  
they and the planting medium should be thoroughly watered imme-  
diately afterward.  
Fewer design mistakes will be made if the plants are installed one  
section at a time, under the direction of a supervisor familiar with the  
design of the section. If the installation is in an office building, it may  
be necessary to arrange for a workroom and a freight elevator with  
access both to the loading dock and to the workroom. Depending on  
the exact arrangements, a crew of four to six workers per supervisor  
is generally optimum.  
It is recommended that each section be planted in the following  
order. First, leftover building material and other debris are removed  
from the planting areas. Second, drainage material is added to the  
proper depth and leveled. Third, the plants, either in or out of their  
growing containers, are placed on top of the drainage material and  
the soil separator if present, and arranged according to the design.  
The spaces between the plants are then filled in with drainage mate-  
rial or planting medium, depending on whether the plants are in or  
out of their growing containers. If planting medium is used, it should  
be lightly compacted to prevent its settling later. \(If the light intensity  
is below specifications and periodic replacement of the plants is  
expected, the plants should be left in their cans.\)  
After the spaces between the large plants have been filled in, the  
ground cover, if any, is planted. The use of decorative bark or marble  
chips on top of the soil is not recommended, as they easily mix with  
the soil and are hard to remove if the plants are replaced.  
After all the spaces have been filled, the plants should be thoroughly  
watered and the maintenance schedule begun. If dry planting medium

weight for each of the materials in both the dry and the wet state.  
The exact weight depends on the degree of compaction of the

week to ensure that it is completely wet.  
**Removing plants from cans or burlap** A healthy root system is  
necessary for the maintenance of a healthy plant. It is the new, very  
fine, feathery roots that are the most important and also the most eas-  
ily damaged. This damage is very likely if the soil between the fine  
roots is dislodged in the course of repotting. Whether the tropical  
plants are delivered in growing cans or with their roots wrapped in  
burlap, the root system must be handled with care.  
The best procedure for removing a plant from its container is to lean  
the pot on its side, tap on the container sides and bottom, and care-  
fully slide out the plant. In large container-grown plants \(in 17-in or  
larger cans\), the root system may be held very tightly in the can. In  
this case, a can cutter, which works on either metal or rubber cans,  
may be the most gentle way of removing the can. Once the can is  
removed, the root ball of soil and roots should be scored by making  
1⁄4-in deep vertical cuts at 3-in intervals around the root ball from top  
to bottom. If the can removal and ball scoring are done near the  
planting site, the exposed root system is subjected to minimum han-  
dling.  
Very large plants and trees are frequently field-grown rather than  
container-grown. The root balls of such plants will come wrapped in  
burlap. When planting them, only the upper half of the burlap should  
be removed. The lower portion will disintegrate in the soil after the  
plant is installed.  
**Rock formations and decorative pools** Natural elements, such as  
rock formations, decorative pools, water fountains, and waterfalls,  
can add an artistic touch and turn an unimaginative large planting  
arrangement into a full garden. Unfortunately the overuse of such  
design elements is tempting, since they are usually inexpensive com-  
pared with the cost of filling the same area with plants. Provided they  
are not overused, they can serve as natural sculpture or as the answer  
for areas with too little light to support plants or where conditions  
limit the variety of plants that can be used.  
In rock formations, volcanic rock is the most commonly used type  
because it is much lighter than ordinary rock. This weight factor can  
be of considerable importance when the weight of the garden must be

limited. This type of rock is also easy to shape with a hammer and  
chisel.  
Although a large decorative pool or fountain must be custom  
designed, there are small fiberglass pools that can be purchased in a  
variety of sizes and are available in kidney, free-form, or rectangular  
shapes. They are usually no longer than 6 ft, but they are of a stan-  
dard 16-in depth, which is deep enough to accommodate any water  
plants, recirculating pump, and a filter tray with mat and gravel.  
Their high-capacity, low-pressure pumps are usually adequate for  
small fountains and waterfalls.  
If decorative pools are used, some thought might be given to using  
water plants in them. These plants are very attractive and can be eas-  
ily grown indoors. As with all plants, different species have different  
growing and flowering habits. A reputable dealer should be consulted  
for information.  
The use of fish in pools should be carefully studied in light of the  
plant maintenance requirements. Fertilizer, plant chemicals, and  
limestone runoff from the planting area may enter the circulating  
water system and kill the fish. Fish can be an attractive design ele-  
ment, but their maintenance requirements must be considered along  
with the maintenance requirements of the plants.  
*Open Plan and Specimen Design*  
Modern offices are sometimes sterile places in which to work. The  
introduction of live plants into such an environment is one way of  
making the space seem less austere and more comfortable without  
disrupting the integrity of the original design. For windowless  
offices, plants provide an attractive natural setting appreciated by the  
occupants. For offices and other windowed areas, the plants provide  
a transition which makes indoors and outdoors seem to flow  
together.  
In all locations, however, the light intensity must be at the proper  
level before the plants are introduced. The intensity cannot be taken  
for granted, since artificial lighting designed for office vision is sel-  
dom enough for any but the lowest-light plant species. Even a large  
window will not provide enough light if it has an overhang or a  
northern exposure. If the light intensity cannot be directly measured  
or calculated from detailed ceiling plans, one must assume the worst  
and use only low-light material. There is sometimes a tendency to  
use plants to fill in otherwise forgotten spots, such as corners, stair-  
wells, and hallways. Such areas are often poorly lit and no plant will  
survive there unless additional lighting is installed.  
In large areas with barely enough light, the usual design problem is  
how to arrange the limited number of low-light species so that differ-  
ent areas stand out from one another. Design interest can be accom-  
plished by using different types of foliage \(for example, fragmented  
and solid\) in the different areas, varying the plant sizes among the  
areas or using specimen plants selectively.  
Specimen plants usually have fuller foliage or an unusual stem struc-  
ture and hence appear to be different from other plants of that  
species. The true specimen plants are more expensive than ordinary  
plants of the same species, but can solve many a design problem.  
However, a plant with fuller foliage than most will also require more  
light than most to maintain the foliage.  
If the office has floor-to-ceiling walls, the best design procedure is to  
select specimen plants that act as living sculptures. Since these plants  
are used for visual emphasis, the plant height and container size  
should conform to the scale of the rest of the interior design. The  
plant texture and container finish should blend with each other and  
with the wall and floor treatments. The particular plant specimen  
chosen should have an inherently interesting shape and texture.  
If the office area is very large or is designed along an “office land-  
scaping” plan with movable partitions, the plants can become an  
integral part of the design. They can be used with the partitions as  
space dividers and are excellent for indicating the importance of the  
space. They also may be effective in relating widely separated areas  
with one another. They break the monotony of the partitions with  
both color and texture. They act as sound absorbers. Also, specimen  
plants can be used in the office landscaping scheme for visual  
emphasis.  
**Planting into individual planters** Individual decorative contain-  
ers are used for individual plants or small plant groupings. The plants  
are left in their growing containers and placed directly into the deco-  
rative planter on top of 4 to 6 in of perlite as the drainage material.  
The decorative planter or container must be tall enough to accommo-  
date the growing can and the perlite, and wide enough to accommo-  
date the width of the growing can. The space between the growing  
can and the inner wall of the planter can be filled with additional per-  
lite. \(See Fig. 2 for size-selection guidance.\) As a decorative finish-  
ing, bark chips or sheet moss may be placed on the surface of the soil  
in the growing can. This decorative cover can be easily removed if  
the plant is replaced and it does not mix with the soil, as sometimes  
happens in large gardens.  
Removing the plant from the growing can and repotting it directly  
into the planter is not generally recommended. Replacing the plant, if  
necessary, is a messy job unless drainage material and soil separator  
are added to the bottom of the container. Also, once removed from its  
growing container, the plant may take up to four weeks to adjust fully  
to its new environment.  
# Plant Containers  
*Decorative Containers\: Different Types*  
A plant container should be more than decorative. Its proper selec-  
tion is the first element of proper maintenance, since the container  
must provide the plant roots with sufficient growing room and with  
adequate drainage.  
All small to medium-size plants are received from the grower in  
growing containers, usually metal cans or rubber tubs. Large plants  
are either in large growing containers or their root balls are wrapped  
in burlap. As a rule, these growing cans provide the proper volume of  
soil for the size of the plant and have a hole in the bottom for  
drainage. There is seldom any need to remove the plant from its  
growing container, especially since rough handling of the root sys-  
tem can shock the plant. Only the smaller plants, such as ivy, can be  
repotted without much disturbance of the root system. If it is  
absolutely necessary to repot a larger plant, it should be done care-  
fully, as outlined earlier, and it should be always into a larger volume  
of soil, never into a smaller volume.  
The decorative container should be chosen so that its inside dimen-  
sions are large enough that the plant-growing container can be  
dropped directly into it. In addition, it should be deep enough for the  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1337* Specialties  
PLANTSCAPING  
Plant Use and Procedures  
growing container to rest on at least 2 in of perlite or other drainage  
material, and leave about 1 in between the top of the growing can and  
the top of the decorative container. Some care must be taken in the  
choice since the interior dimensions of the decorative container are  
often not uniformly related to the exterior dimensions. For example,  
some fiberglass containers have a large lip which limits the size of  
the growing can that can be dropped directly into them. Also some  
containers have a large false bottom, which makes the interior depth  
much less than the outside height.  
With these simple size-selection rules in mind, the proper decorative  
container can be selected using Fig. 6 as a guide. Figure 6 lists the  
decorative pros and cons of the most common types of containers.  
*Excess Water in Container*  
Overwatering of plants is more harmful than underwatering. This  
problem is most likely to occur when the plants are in individual dec-  
orative containers that do not allow the excess water to flow off. To  
minimize this danger, we have recommended that a plant in a decora-  
Fig. 6 Comparison of container types  
tive container be double-potted. In the bottom of the decorative con-  
tainer, below the plant growing can, there should be at least 2 in of  
perlite or other drainage material to act as a reservoir for excess water.  
Nevertheless, if the plant is continually overwatered, this reservoir  
will fill up and lead to root rot because the roots are in a pool of water.  
If the plant soil is continually wet to the touch, excess water may be  
the problem. The water level in the container may be determined by  
tapping the sides of the container. If the water level indicates excess  
water, the container is tilted on its side, the plant gently pulled from  
the container, and the excess water drained from the perlite. If the  
perlite is completely saturated or appears old, it must be discarded  
and replaced with new drainage material. If the plant has been sitting  
in a pool of water for some time, the root ball should be allowed to  
dry before repotting.  
If a very large container or garden has been overwatered and there is  
no way to drain out the excess water, not really much can be done  
short of using a small electric pump. One must simply avoid water-  
ing the plant or garden at all until the soil has begun to dry out and  
feels dry to the touch.  
*Automatic Watering Devices*  
In areas where regular maintenance would be difficult, the use of  
automatic watering devices can be of considerable help. Even when  
they are used, however, the plant must be checked periodically to see  
that the device is working properly, that its water reservoir is full, and  
that no other maintenance problems have developed.  
Automatic watering devices are either external to the container or are  
built into the planter. The external devices tend to work well only  
with small plants, and also, they are likely to detract from the design.  
For these reasons, the built-in type of device is preferred. The  
planters with this type come in both cylindrical and rectangular  
shapes and in several colors. The planter has a hollow space within  
its double-wall sides, which serves to hold a three- to four-week  
water supply, feeding the water to the plant soil by a wick mecha-  
nism, sensor, or capillary action. Most types have a float to indicate  
the amount of water remaining in the reservoir.  
Since the soil must be in contact with the wick or capillary tubes for  
the device to work, the plant must be removed from its original grow-  
ing can and repotted directly in the planter. As the soil never dries  
out, the plant must be watched for symptoms of overwatering.  
Because different plants use water at different rates under different  
humidity and temperature conditions, a timetable should be kept for  
each container so the maintenance staff will know when to refill each  
reservoir.  
The use of automatic watering devices will not eliminate mainte-  
nance personnel, but it will reduce the number of workers needed.  
One person can handle many more plants, devoting more time to  
cleaning and trimming, since the reservoir has to be refilled only  
every month or so. Occasionally, however, one will find a client who  
will resist the use of the automatic devices because he or she likes the  
assurance of seeing a person with a watering can once a week.

The use of the automatic watering devices is expected to increase in  
the future as more architects and designers become aware of them  
and convince their clients of their usefulness, and as the manufactur-  
ers produce more colors and styles and improve the efficiency of the  
devices.  
# \(False\) Aralia  
The aralia is a plant of grace and elegance with narrow, ribbonlike,  
notched leaves of dark green, usually borne on slender, single stems.  
The aralia is attractive if two or three plants are planted together in  
one pot. It grows very quickly, so prune the stem tips from time to  
time to prevent the foliage from thinning at the bottom.  
*Temperature*  
The aralia is tolerant of warm temperatures if there is plenty of  
humidity.  
*Light/Sun*  
The plant likes a semisunny to semishady window; an east or west  
window is ideal.  
*Water/Humidity*  
Keep the soil damp but not soggy. The false aralia likes a humid  
atmosphere. Place your plant on a pebble tray and mist the foliage  
daily.  
*Soil*  
The soil should be equal parts loam, sand, and peat moss.  
*1340*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
*Special care*  
You can rejuvenate leggy plants by drastically cutting the stems back  
to four to six in from the pot. Do this in the spring and leave the plant  
in a sheltered location, being sure to fertilize and water frequently.  
# African Violet  
The African violet, a longtime favorite houseplant, does insist on  
more care and attention, but its beautiful blossoms make the effort  
worthwhile.  
*Temperature*  
African violets are more contented and grow best within a tempera-  
ture range of 65 to 80 degrees. Be careful that your plants are not in  
an open window or a draft.  
*Light/Sun*  
The African violet enjoys a place in an east or west window. Direct  
sun is too strong, unless filtered through a curtain. Excess sun will  
cause spotting and loss of color, and too little light causes elongated  
stems and no blooms.  
*Water/Humidity*  
African violets should be watered from the saucer underneath in the  
morning with *lukewarm* water. Water when the soil begins to dry out.  
Do not keep it soggy. If the air is dry in your home, place the potted  
plant in a tray of moistened pebbles.  
*Soil*  
The soil should be porous for good drainage and should contain  
ample organic matter such as compost or peat moss. Commercial  
African violet soil mixture is specially prepared for these plants;  
however, add sand or perlite to ensure adequate drainage. A plastic  
pot is less likely to cause the lower leaves to rot where they touch  
the pot.  
# Asparagus Fern—Emerald Feather  
The bright feathery green of this delightful plant is best displayed in  
a hanging container. The long branches drape gracefully and are  
studded with tiny white flowers that ripen into red-orange berries.  
*Temperature*  
Asparagus fern is not fussy about temperatures, but prefers a range of Specialties  
PLANTSCAPING  
Typical Plants  
60 to 68 degrees.  
*Light/Sun*  
The bright filtered sun of an east or west window is a good location  
for this plant.  
*Water/Humidity*  
Soak the soil in the pot thoroughly and allow it to become dry to the  
touch before rewatering.  
*Soil*  
Use a well-drained potting soil or a mixture of equal parts of loam,  
peat moss, and sand or perlite.  
*How to Start New Plants*  
Allow the berries to ripen and when dry sow the seeds they contain.  
Asparagus fern can usually be grown from seed quite well.  
# Avocado  
The avocado comes easily from seed and is grown for its ornamental  
foliage. It makes a nice tree for your indoor garden. Allow the plant  
to reach the desired height and then begin regular pinching to force  
branching and encourage bushy growth.  
*Temperature*  
Temperatures between 60 and 70 degrees suit the avocado well.  
*Light/Sun*  
Keep your avocado in bright light but protected from direct sun. Avo-  
cados are easily sunburned, especially when they are first moved out-  
side.  
*Water/Humidity*  
Use tepid water and keep the soil moist. Place the plant on a pebble  
tray to raise the humidity level around it. This plant likes a fair  
amount of humidity and benefits from regular misting. Any sign of  
browning or crispness at the tips and along the edges of the leaves  
means the plant needs more humidity.  
*Soil*  
Use a mixture consisting of equal parts of sand, loam, and peat moss.  
# Boston Fern  
Exultant is a good adjective for this family of ferns that can fill a cor-  
ner with rich green foliage. These ferns are excellent for hanging bas-  
kets. Initially the ferns may need a lot of attention until the right  
combination of environmental factors is achieved, but the effort is  
well worth it. The leaflets grow on a midrib that is covered with fine  
brown hairs and vary from smooth-edged to feathery and even ruf-

PLANTSCAPING  
Typical Plants  
fled. A mature fern can have fronds ranging in length from 2 to 3 ft  
and 2 to 3 in across.  
*Temperature*  
With lots and lots of humidity, ferns will do well in house tempera-  
tures in the 60- to 70-degree range.  
*Light/Sun*  
Ferns need a location with good, bright light, but this means filtered  
sunlight. *Avoid direct sunlight.*  
*Water/Humidity*  
It is essential that the roots of the ferns never dry out at any time.  
Soak the soil regularly. Clay pots and hanging baskets can be soaked  
in a bucket or the sink for half an hour and then drained. The soil  
should be checked daily to make sure that it is not drying out.  
Humidity is the most important ingredient to successful fern grow-  
ing. Place pots of ferns on a pebble tray. Mist the foliage daily with  
room temperature water.  
*Soil*  
Ferns need a soil that is loose and easily penetrated by their dense  
root system. The soil mixture should be rich in peat moss and organic  
matter with a liberal amount of sand for drainage. A sprinkling of  
charcoal mixed in the soil helps to keep the soil from becoming sour  
from the frequent waterings. When potting ferns, place a layer of bits  
of broken pots or gravel in the bottom of the pot. Ferns do not take  
kindly to having their roots tampered with, so be careful not to dam-  
age them when repotting.  
# Chinese Evergreen  
*1342*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
This beautiful foliage plant has waxy dark green leaves. The leaves  
grow on a canelike stem and are oblong, tapering to a thin tip. Some  
of the varieties are variegated with splashes of creamy white or yel-  
low. Under optimal conditions, it will produce a flower spike sur-  
rounded by a white spathe. The flower is similar to a calla lily. The  
great thing about this plant is that it will adapt to a variety of envi-  
ronments, which makes it a good plant for a beginner or a difficult  
location.  
*Temperature*  
A range of 60 to 70 degrees suits this plant well.  
*Light/Sun*  
A shady spot, an artificial light, or any other location will suit this  
plant. The Chinese evergreen is an excellent plant for a north win-  
dow.  
*Water/Humidity*  
Keep the soil moist but not soggy. To avoid waterlogged soil, allow  
the surface soil to become dry to the touch before rewatering. The  
Chinese evergreen can be grown in water. The roots are attractive, so  
a clear glass container shows them off to best advantage. It is impor-  
tant to wash the leaves regularly to keep them dust free.  
*Soil*  
The soil should be equal parts of garden loam, peat moss, and sand.  
# Dracaenas  
There are several varieties of dracaenas, which vary in foliage color,  
variegation, and size. Here are three that are commonly available. Specialties  
PLANTSCAPING  
Typical Plants  
*Dracaena deremensis “Warneckei”* is a good choice for a loca-  
tion without much light. The gray-green foliage is striped  
with white and gray.  
*Dracaena marginata* has clusters of narrow deep green leaves  
edged with red, and gray stems strongly marked with leaf  
scars. This variety will reach a height of 5 or 6 ft.  
*Dracaena sanderiana* resembles a corn plant in the brightness of  
the green and the size and shape of the leaves, with the dif-  
ference that the leaves are striped with white.  
*Temperature*  
Moderate household temperatures in the 60- to 70-degree range suit  
these plants best. It is important to keep plants away from heating  
vents.  
*Light/Sun*  
The marginata and sanderiana should get only filtered sun or bright  
light. The Warneckei will fare well in a spot with very little light; it  
will flourish when more light is available.  
*Water/Humidity*  
These plants all like soil that is kept evenly moist but not soggy. Soak  
the soil in the pot thoroughly and then rewater when the soil surface  
feels dry to the touch. Humidity is a must. Brown, crispy leaf tips and  
margins mean too little moisture in the air. It is a good idea to place  
the dracaenas in pebble trays and mist the foliage daily.  
*Soil*  
Commercial potting soil is adequate, but added drainage material  
such as sand or perlite is advisable.  
# Dumb Cane  
The cool-looking foliage of this plant is yellow-green, mottled with  
white. The leaves are pointed ovals that become quite large as the  
plant matures. The dieffenbachia is known as the mother-in-law plant  
or dumb cane because when a piece of the stem is placed on the  
tongue it causes temporary numbness and loss of speech. All joking  
aside, *this plant is poisonous.*  
*Temperature*  
The dieffenbachia prefers warm temperatures and will tolerate hot,  
dry places with added humidity.  
*Light/Sun*  
This plant does well in an east or west window where it can bask in  
the sun for a few hours.  
*Water/Humidity*  
The soil should be allowed to dry out for a few days before rewater-  
ing. The plants indicate a need for water when the leaves show signs  
of dropping. Regular misting keeps the foliage dust free and luxuriant.  
*Soil*  
A porous soil of equal parts loam, peat moss, and sand is fine.  
# Gardenia  
The gardenia is a handsome foliage plant with intensely fragrant  
blooms, but it has an extremely temperamental nature. It is a chal-  
lenging plant to grow successfully indoors. The most frequently  
available varieties are *Gardenia radicans floraplena,* a low spread-  
ing plant with small double flowers, and *Gardenia florida,* which  
blooms in summer.  
*Temperature*  
The temperature must be kept above 65 degrees to maintain healthy  
foliage and flower buds. These plants hate drafts. Loss of flower  
buds is often due to sudden changes in temperature.  
*Light/Sun*  
The gardenia needs lots of light, but avoid strong sun that might burn  
the leaves.  
*Water/Humidity*  
The soil must be kept constantly moist without becoming soggy.  
Submerge the pot in a bucket of lukewarm water and allow it to soak  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1343* Specialties  
PLANTSCAPING  
Typical Plants  
for half an hour or until the soil is moist on the surface. Do not allow  
the pot to sit in water, as that will cause the roots to rot. Gardenias  
need very high humidity at all times. Place the pot in a tray of mois-  
tened pebbles. Mist the foliage daily with tepid water. Leaf or bud  
drops indicate the air is too dry.  
*Soil*  
Potting soil should be a mixture of equal parts peat moss, loam, and  
well-decayed manure, with sand or perlite added for drainage.  
# Grape Ivy  
Grape ivy is a climber or trailer. The olive-colored green leaves look  
a bit like those of holly without the stiffness of the sharp tips. The  
leaves form attractive groups of three and are accompanied by furry  
tendrils.  
*Temperature*  
The plant is fairly tolerant of a wide temperature range. Increase the  
amount of humidity as the temperature goes up.  
*Light/Sun*  
Grape ivy will do all right in low light and is often used in low-light  
areas. But it flourishes with bright light or filtered sunlight.  
*Water/Humidity*  
Soak the pot and soil thoroughly and then allow the soil to become  
dry to the touch before rewatering. Mist frequently and wash the  
foliage regularly to remove dust and restore the luster of the leaves.  
*Soil*  
A potting soil that is rich in organic matter is the best. Be sure to add  
plenty of drainage material to the soil mixture.  
# Jade Plant  
The jade plant is a tough plant well-suited to the hot, dry conditions  
so prevalent in office and apartment buildings. The rounded leaves  
*1344*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
are in pairs on the branched, treelike stem. A plant that is six to eight  
years old will produce clusters of lacy-looking, star-shaped flowers.  
*Temperature*  
Temperatures ranging from 65 to 75 degrees are fine. Lower and  
higher temperature will be tolerated.  
*Light/Sun*  
The jade plant will require full sunlight, with shade at midday if  
possible. A west or south window would be a good location. If  
you put the plant outside in the summer, place it in a lightly shaded  
spot.  
*Water/Humidity*  
The soil should remain dry for several days between waterings. The  
fleshy leaves soak up the soil water and store it for future use. Too  
much water will cause stem and root rot and certain death. Specialties  
PLANTSCAPING  
Typical Plants  
*Soil*  
The jade plant will do well in rich garden soil that has coarse sand or  
fine bits of broken pots added to it for drainage. Each year give the  
pot a top dressing of humus. A new pot will be necessary only after  
about three or four years.  
# Norfolk Island Pine  
The delightful symmetry of this evergreen makes it a desirable house-  
plant. The branches grow in tiers of six, each tier representing a year’s  
growth. The bright green needles are soft and pleasant to touch.  
*Temperature*  
The ideal temperature is between 50 and 60 degrees. High tempera-  
tures are tolerated when sufficient humidity is available.  
*Light/Sun*  
The filtered sun of an east or west window is best. Yellowing of the  
needles might mean too much sun.  
*Water/Humidity*  
Provide the plant with a well-drained soil and pot. Water thoroughly  
and allow the soil surface to become dry before rewatering. Daily  
misting is necessary for the warmer temperatures of most houses and  
offices. A pebble tray will help to add more moisture to the air around  
the plant.  
*Soil*  
Garden loam mixed with equal parts of sand and peat moss makes a  
suitable potting mixture. Repot the Norfolk Island pine only when it  
has become pot-bound \(the pot is crammed with roots\). This would  
be about every two or three years.  
# Parlor Palm  
The palm trees are not the easiest plants to grow. However, once you  
have discovered their basic needs, they are a delightful addition to  
your indoor garden. This palm grows to about 4 ft tall. It is most  
attractive when two or three plants are grouped together in a pot. The  
long feathery fronds grow out of a single stem. Other varieties to try  
are *C. seifrizii, C. erumpens,* and *C. costarincana.*  
*Temperature*  
The best growing temperatures for palms range between 60 and 75  
degrees.  
*Light/Sun*  
Palms are good plants for locations without much light. They do not  
like direct sunlight.  
*Water/Humidity*  
During the active growing season, between March and October, the  
palm needs moist soil, but it will not tolerate soggy soil. In the win-  
ter months, allow the soil to dry on the surface before rewatering. If  
the foliage shows signs of browning and drying on the tips, it needs  
more humidity. Misting regularly is recommended to keep the  
foliage healthy.  
*Soil*  
The palm needs well-drained soil of equal parts rich garden loam,  
peat moss, and sand. It will need repotting only every two or three  
years. It prefers being a bit pot-bound.  
# Philodendron  
By nature, the philodendron is a climbing plant, but it also trails. It  
looks best on a bracket beside the window frame, and for good effect  
must be kept strongly pinched back so that the plant is full of bushy  
young growth and does not deteriorate into two or three stringlike  
stems.  
*Temperature*  
Normal house or office temperatures are fine.  
*Light/Sun*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1345* Specialties  
PLANTSCAPING  
Typical Plants  
The philodendron is quite hardy and robust and will grow almost  
anywhere. However, it will fare better in a well-lighted area.  
*Water/Humidity*  
The plant should be kept evenly moist and never allowed to dry out.  
Be certain water does not remain in the saucer after watering. The  
foliage should be misted daily and the leaves cleaned of accumulated  
dust.  
*Soil*  
Potting soil mixed with perlite, vermiculite, or sand and peat moss is  
recommended.  
# Windowleaf Philodendron  
This philodendron has large, heart-shaped leaves that are slashed  
irregularly. It is an enthusiastic climber and needs a piece of bark or  
totem for support. The aerial roots can be inserted in the soil or  
encouraged to attach to the totem. Keep the growing tips pinched  
back so that the plant doesn’t get leggy.  
*Temperature*  
The windowleaf prefers temperatures between 65 and 70 degrees.  
*Light/Sun*  
Bright light is best for this plant. However, avoid putting the plant in  
a location where the plant would get direct sun.  
*Water/Humidity*  
Soak the plant thoroughly and allow the soil surface to remain dry for  
a day or two before rewatering. Mist the foliage daily and wash the  
leaves weekly to remove dust.  
*Soil*  
A soil mixture of equal parts garden loam, peat moss, and sand is fine.

# Purple Passion Plant—Velvet Plant  
The strikingly rich royal purple coloring and velvety texture of the  
foliage and stems attract many growers. The green leaves and stems  
are covered with tiny purple hairs. The straggly growth habit is best  
kept in check by frequent prunning.  
*Temperature*  
The purple passion plant likes temperatures in the 65- to 70-degree  
range.  
*Light/Sun*  
Direct or partial sun will promote the color.  
*Water/Humidity*  
It is important that the velvet plant not dry out. Keep the soil evenly  
moist at all times. A humid atmosphere is important to keep the bril-  
liant color. Mist the foliage frequently and place the pot in a tray of  
moistened pebbles to raise the humidity.  
*Soil*  
Use potting soil of equal parts garden loam, peat moss, and sand.  
This plant will also grow in water.  
# Rubber Tree Plant  
This houseplant with dark green glossy leaves can grow to be 4 ft  
high with a little care and not too much water.  
*Temperature*  
Due to its hardy nature, the plant does well in any normal household  
temperature.  
*Light/Sun* The plant will do well in almost any light, but a well-lighted area is  
best for the rich green foliage characteristic of the rubber tree plant.  
*Water/Humidity*  
Water only when the soil is completely dry all through the pot. You  
should set the entire pot in a bucket when watering, so that moisture  
can penetrate the deepest roots. Clean the leaves every two weeks or  
so with a damp cloth. Do not artificially shine the leaves, as this clogs  
the plant’s pores and does not allow it to breathe!  
*Soil*  
Soil should be a well-drained mixture of equal parts of sand, peat  
moss, and garden loam. If pot is plastic or rubber, be sure to provide  
plenty of drainage material in the bottom of the pot.  
# Wandering Jew  
Specialties  
PLANTSCAPING  
Typical Plants  
This is a particularly attractive hanging plant. It is hardy and easy to  
grow, with only one special requirement, which is regular pinching to  
keep it full and bushy. There are several plants called Wandering Jew,  
distinguished from each other by their different colorings and mark-  
ings. The illustration shows a *Zebrina pendula.* The leaf is a pointed  
oval with a deep purple underside, and the upperside is dark green  
striped with pale silvery green. *Tradescantia fluminensis* has small  
oval green leaves marked with white, silver and white, or yellow.  
*Temperature*  
These plants prefer warm temperatures.  
*Light/Sun*  
Bright indirect sunlight keeps the foliage brilliant. Avoid direct sun-  
light, as they are susceptible to sunburn.  
*Water/Humidity*  
Water generously, keeping the soil moist at all times. During the win-  
ter months, it will not need quite as much water.  
*Soil*  
This plant grows in a well-drained potting soil or water.  
# Schefflera—Umbrella Tree  
If you are looking for a tree for your indoor garden, a schefflera is a  
good choice. It has handsome deep green leaves that radiate out from  
a long, slender stalk rather like the ribs of an umbrella.  
*Temperature*  
The umbrella tree does well in a room where the temperature ranges  
from 55 to 75 degrees.  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1347* Specialties  
PLANTSCAPING  
Typical Plants  
*Light/Sun*  
The schefflera does not like direct sunlight. It grows best in good  
light from a shaded window.  
*Water/Humidity*  
When watering your schefflera, soak the pot thoroughly and then  
allow the soil to dry before rewatering. The plant likes a humid atmo-  
sphere and responds well to daily misting with warm water. This is  
essential if the plant is in a room with forced hot air heat. This plant  
needs a pebble tray.  
*Soil*  
The soil mixture for the umbrella tree should be equal parts of peat  
moss, garden soil, and sand. The pot should have a layer of gravel or  
bits of broken pots underneath the soil to ensure good drainage.  
# Snake Plant  
Seen in many homes and offices, this spikey, banded plant will take  
almost any abuse.  
*Temperature*  
Normal household temperatures are best, *but* do not allow the plant  
to become suddenly chilled!  
*Light/Sun*  
The snake plant is a good low-light plant but needs sun in order to  
bloom.  
*Water*  
The plant likes the dryness of the home and should never be overwa-  
tered. The leaves should be cleaned with clear water every two  
weeks.  
*Soil*  
Garden loam, peat moss, and sand mixed together provide the best  
soil for the snake plant.  
# Spider Plant  
With its green and white foliage, the spider plant makes one of the  
best hanging plants. The graceful trailing runners have plantlets and  
white, star-shaped flowers. There are all-green varieties, but the more  
commonly seen one has a green leaf striped with white.  
*Temperature*  
The plant lives best in a warm location.

Planting Detail  
This lovely plant does very well hanging in indirect sun or a moder-  
ately lighted area.  
*Water/Humidity*  
The spider plant should be allowed to dry out before rewatering. Dry-  
ing leaf tips usually indicate lack of humidity. To tidy up the plant,  
just snip these off.  
*Soil*  
The plant grows contentedly in a rich soil composed of garden loam,  
sand, and peat moss.  
# Zebra Plant  
The zebra plant is one of the showiest houseplants one can grow. Its  
spike of waxy yellow flowers and deep shiny green leaves veined in  
white makes it a striking specimen.

Plant Containers  
Fig. 8 Detail 1\: In this window planter, the plants are placed directly in the earth or growing medium filling the planter  
and continue to grow and blossom there. The entire planter is contained within a galvanized steel pan with drain. The  
6-in-high perforated pipe allows for drainage of excess water over a long period of time before the entire planter has  
to be cleaned out and started anew. Detail 2\: This is a simple floor-level planter where the drainage can easily be con-

side and two screened drains are connected, trapped, and joined to a waste line. This takes care of any excess water,  
as it is eliminated by gravity drainage. Detail 2\: This planter is for areas where freezing does not occur, and the drainage  
of excess water can be taken care of by simply extending small pipes directly to the exterior. Detail 3\: In this planter the  
plants remain within the planter and excess water is carried off by a screened pipe at the bottom. Pea gravel is used  
as a 1-in topping so that odds and ends dropped into the planter can easily be removed. Detail 4\: A planter in a com-  
mercial lobby or entrance is shown in this detail. The plants are permanently installed and the tall drainage pipe takes  
care of any top-applied water. The white sand at the top is to bring contrast to the colors of the plants

SIGNAGE AND GRAPHICS  
Signage System Design Criteria  
Initial consideration should be directed toward determining the basic  
parameters required in developing the sign system. Each of them  
merits discussion here.  
# Performance Requirements  
Signs usually must be designed to meet specific performance  
requirements. The good designer will determine how a system is to  
perform within given space relationships. The sign system may func-  
tion entirely on its own merit, or it may be supplemented by staff per-  
sonnel at major decision-making locations, such as the main lobby  
and reception areas. Sign devices may become decorative amenities  
to be featured within the environment, or they may be subtle and  
low-key elements of minor importance. Supergraphics may be con-  
sidered in certain areas simply as an art form, or as a functional  
graphic device presented in large scale for emphasis of context. Cer-  
tainly, a combination of the two is feasible. These are only several  
performance considerations that should be addressed prior to the  
development of the signage system. The designer must evaluate the  
needs of the client, the unique traffic flow requirements and mount-  
ing restrictions dictated by the structure, and the basic performance  
requirements desired of the signing devices to be utilized.  
# Usage Considerations  
The general nature of the building complex often defines how signs  
are to be used. They may be given an appearance of being fixed and  
an integral part of the architecture by the appropriate selection of  
materials, colors, and mountings, or they may appear changeable and  
temporary should need so dictate. Some signage requires constant  
change to properly relate information to people or people to facility,  
while most sign devices are considered permanent fixtures within a  
given space. The designer is responsible for determining how signs  
are to be used most effectively and, at the same time, for enhancing  
the environment.  
# Durability Requirements  
Prior to the selection of materials for a signing system, durability  
requirements must be considered. The vast assortment of materials  
available for signs covers a wide spectrum of durability, from soft  
plastics to metals. The sign copy and background material should be  
evaluated both individually and jointly when considering durability  
requirements.  
# Vandalism Considerations  
Signs located in controlled spaces are often free from destructive  
vandalism; however, in many instances vandalism becomes rampant  
and uncontrolled. There are no materials that may accurately be  
labeled “vandal-proof.” However, some materials are more vandal-  
resistant than others. Where vandalism is of prime importance, only  
materials and graphic techniques engineered to resist destruction  
should be considered.  
# Flexibility to Accommodate Changes and Additions  
Modern architectural structures are designed to accommodate inner  
spacial changes to meet tenant needs. Partition systems, prehung  
door units, room dividers, and modular furniture have ensured ease  
of change in officescapes. The sign system may also require alter-  
ations to preserve continuity. Changes and additions to a sign system  
should be considered by the designer prior to the selection of materi-  
als, graphic techniques, and mounting methods to be used.  
# Readability Factors  
Sign readability is determined by the letter style selected, size of  
copy, interletter spacing, copy position relative to background, col-  
ors, and angle of observance.  
*Letter Style*  
Letter styles are classified as sans serif and serif. Sans serif letters,  
such as Helvetica, are more contemporary than serif letters, such as  
Clarendon \(Fig. 1\). Each letter style has its own unique personality  
and flavor. Printers carry alphabets in most letter styles, including  
lowercase letters as well as uppercase \(Fig. 2\). Test results indicate  
that messages starting with an initial uppercase letter and followed  
by lowercase characters are more recognizable than messages  
formed with uppercase characters only. Lowercase letters have  
more personality because their shape is varied by ascenders and  
descenders, resulting in characteristic word forms that are much  
easier to recognize than all-uppercase word forms. Also, people  
are more accustomed to reading text in upper- and lowercase than  
in all uppercase. The proper selection of a particular alphabet  
should be carefully considered, not only from a legibility point of  
view, but also from a personality standpoint. The letter style should  
make a concise and meaningful impression in the environment it  
serves.  
*Readability*  
Readability is directly related to the size of copy. Visibility studies  
indicate that 1-in-high Helvetica Medium, for example, is readable  
Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1359* Specialties  
SIGNAGE AND GRAPHICS  
Signage System Design Criteria  
from a distance of 40 ft. Using this as a measure for comparison, 1-  
in-high Clarendon style would be readable from a somewhat lesser  
distance, approximately 25 ft. The distance visibility per 1-in height  
may be used as a guideline to determine distance readability for  
larger letters; that is, 2-in-high Helvetica Medium will be readable at  
80 ft, and 3-in-high at 120 ft. This direct proportion may be helpful  
for determining copy \(text\) sizes for signs used in pedestrian situa-  
tions. However, the direct proportion may not hold true for vehicular  
traffic applications, where many other factors are involved. The  
designer must exercise caution after selecting the alphabet and copy  
size to make certain the lettering will fit properly on the sign back-  
ground. The sign size should be determined using the longest line of  
copy and the maximum number of copy lines that may be required.  
*Letters and Line Spacing*  
Interletter spacing and interline spacing of copy greatly affect the over-  
all readability of a sign. Message legibility and ease of recognition are  
increased when proper visual relationships are established between  
individual characters, words, and lines of copy. Copy with spacing too  
tight becomes very difficult to read; copy with too open spacing tends  
to break the message down into fragments \(Fig. 3\). Proper spacing  
depends largely on the distance from which the message is to be read.  
Messages to be read at close distances should employ tighter spacing  
than messages that will be read at greater distances. Spacing is also  
affected by the angle at which the message is to be viewed\: greater  
angles of observance require wider interletter spacing to prevent the  
characters of the message from appearing to run together.  
*Copy Position*  
The position of copy on the sign background influences the overall  
readability. Signs on which copy occupies most of the background  
are not as readable as signs that have sufficient background material  
surrounding the copy to form a visual barrier separating the message  
from the environment \(Figs. 4 and 5\).  
Emphasis should be placed on selecting an appropriate sign size to best  
accommodate the sign message. There are nine basic copy placement  
positions to be considered in determining the important relationship of  
copy to sign background. They are\: upper left, upper centered, upper  
right, centered left, centered, centered right, lower left, lower centered,  
and lower right. Traditionally, the most popular placement selections  
have been the centered and upper left positions.  
*Color*  
Color of copy and sign background greatly affect readability. Strong  
contrasting colors are more readable than less dramatic color combi-  
nations. White copy on a black background offers the greatest con-  
trast and readability. Color also influences the apparent relationship  
between the copy size and the background. For example, white copy  
on a black field appears larger than black copy on a white field,  
although letter height, size, and copy position remain the same in  
both examples \(Fig. 6\).  
Colors in a signage system should also relate harmoniously with the  
pallette of colors selected for the building and its environment. The  
designer may choose to select colors that blend with the environment  
or vibrant primary colors that accent the sign system and perhaps  
contrast with the architectural color scheme.  
*The Viewing Angle*  
The angle of observance is influential in the design of a signage sys-  
tem, since it affects interletter spacing and overall readability. Nor-  
mally, interior signs are viewed chiefly from a straight-on position;  
however, exterior signs are frequently seen from more than one  
angle. Signs to be read from vehicles moving at varying speeds with  
different angles of observance may require a compromise in letter  
spacing to best communicate the message.  
# Multilingual Needs  
The jet age is a contributing factor in bringing people together from  
all over the world to visit and transact business. Transportation ter-  
minals and public facilities that may be used by visitors unaccus-  
tomed to reading English should employ sign systems that bridge any  
visual communication gap. Multilingual messages in English and the  
dominant foreign languages used by visitors may be combined and  
presented on one sign background. However, sign design and graphic  
formats become very critical to prevent confusion. A more popular  
solution involves the use of pictorial symbols as word substitutes.  
Pictographic signs are bold, recognizable images not bound by lan-  
guage barriers.  
# Regulatory Considerations  
The designer should become aware of regulations governing signs.  
Federal regulations concerning safety signs are enumerated in Occu-  
pational Safety and Health Administration \(OSHA\) publications. The  
American National Standards Institute \(ANSI\) publishes standards  
Fig. 4 Fig. 5 Fig. 6  
*1360*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design* concerning signage for the physically handicapped. Underwriters’  
Laboratory \(UL\) issues standards applicable to illuminated signs. State  
and local codes contain regulatory information concerning sign sizes,  
mounting locations and heights, quantities of signs allowable in vari-  
ous zoning areas, and other restrictions relating to exterior signs. These  
rules, and those of other regulatory bodies, should be taken under  
advisement prior to completing a comprehensive signage program.  
# Need for Illumination  
Many signs are required to relate their messages after dark as well as  
during natural daylight. The careful designer will determine which  
signs require artificial illumination and decide on the method of illu-  
mination. Signs can be externally illuminated by readily available  
stock fixtures produced by many manufacturers, or they can be inter-  
nally illuminated. Fluorescent lighting is the most common source of  
internal illumination, although metal arc lamps, incandescent lamps,  
and neon are frequently employed.  
# Need for a Graphics Manual  
Many signage programs are developed for institutions that have a  
continuing need not only to maintain, but also to augment or change,  
their signage systems. The preparation of a signage manual contain-  
ing all the information required to create additional signs or compo-  
nents would benefit the client and ensure continuity in the system as  
changes and additions are made. The designer should determine this  
potential need and include the manual with other documents devel-  
oped for the signage program.  
# SIGN TYPES CATEGORIZED BY FUNCTION  
Signage systems should be logically broken down into various types  
of signs to be utilized on a particular project. Many categories of sign  
types may be developed, but one of the most conclusive listings is  
based on function. The following discussion of signage system com-  
ponents, including sign requirements for specific applications, cov-  
ers these functions.  
# Exterior Signs  
Exterior sign system components are normally viewed from vehicles  
or by pedestrians who have parked their vehicles and are walking  
toward their destination.  
*Primary Identification*  
All architectural projects require some form of identification that is  
both easily readable and recognizable. A person’s first association  
with a building is the identifying device selected to label the struc-  
ture. The importance of the first impression created by this device  
should be recognized. A sign that produces an image in keeping with  
the environment it serves reflects the quality of the people associated  
with that environment. Major corporations spend large sums of  
money on corporate identity programs to ensure that the visual image  
presented to the public best reflects corporate philosophy and prod-  
uct desirability. Equal emphasis should be placed on the image pre-  
sented by the device employed to identify an architectural structure.  
*Secondary Identification*  
Many complexes containing more than one basic structure require sec-  
ondary identification signs to properly identify the various elements  
Specialties  
SIGNAGE AND GRAPHICS  
Sign Types Categorized by Function  
within the complex. A systems approach to design will provide conti-  
nuity in the relationship of primary to secondary identification signs.  
*Vehicular Advance Notice*  
A system of road signs suitably located in advance of decision-  
making points will allow vehicular traffic to execute the proper deci-  
sions smoothly and safely at the appropriate times.  
*Vehicular Directional*  
Intersections and parking facility entrances are major decision-  
making locations requiring directional devices to guide drivers  
toward their destination.  
*Traffic Regulatory and Control*  
Vehicular traffic can be systematically controlled by employing sign-  
ing devices. Traffic codes are usually clear as to what signs are  
required, where they are to be located, and the height at which they  
are to be mounted. Usually, colors, sizes, and shapes are standardized  
by the traffic authorities. Stop, yield, and speed limit signs are repre-  
sentative of this classification of signs.  
*Instructional*  
Frequently, signs are required to instruct vehicular and pedestrian  
traffic. These notices must be properly installed in carefully selected  
locations to be effective. Examples include parking procedures,  
delivery and service directions, and the like.  
*Informational*  
Signs are required to present information that is both relevant to the  
location and important to the viewer. This information may pertain to  
parking rates, hours of operation, and security, or it may relate to  
items of interest within the environment.  
*Decorative*  
Decorative graphics may be employed to enhance the beauty or  
decor of a particular area; form, color, and design may be utilized to  
create interest and to become features of the exterior landscape.  
# Interior Signs  
Interior sign system components should assist visitors to travel from  
the building entrances throughout the complex until they reach their  
desired destination.  
*Identification*  
Multiple-occupancy buildings require tenant identification; fre-  
quently, buildings with only one tenant will also utilize identification  
in the main lobby or reception areas to reinforce the corporate signa-  
ture. Criteria for multiple-tenant signage are very important and  
should be included in lease documents to provide for visual continu-  
ity and architectural harmony. When individuals are allowed to  
implement their own desires concerning signage, each will attempt to  
outdo the other, resulting in clutter, confusion, and visual pollution.  
Signs that are too big, too gaudy, too competitive, and poorly con-  
ceived and executed will become commonplace unless controls on  
tenant identification are established and enforced.  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1361* Specialties  
SIGNAGE AND GRAPHICS  
Sign Types Categorized by Function  
*Primary Directory*  
Information relevant to one’s location within a complex should be  
clearly enumerated on the primary directory, usually located in a  
very visible area of the main lobby. Alphabetized listings of tenants,  
departments, and individuals should be concise and should designate  
the floor and room numbers. Such directories may be flush or  
recessed wall mounts, horizontal projected wall mounts, or pedestal  
or kiosk mounts, and internally illuminated or not, depending on the  
ambient lighting conditions.  
*Elevator Lobby Floor Directory*  
High-rise structures require well-positioned signage that not only  
identifies each individual floor, but also serves as a secondary direc-  
tory system for that floor. Frequently, the floor identification, direc-  
tory, and corridor directional signage may be included in one device.  
When a visitor exits from an elevator on a chosen floor, a sign show-  
ing the floor number and also the direction of the office or room  
number sought is both helpful and reassuring.  
*Pictorial “You Are Here” Indicators*  
Pictorial schematic maps may become an integral part of directory  
systems, or they may be utilized separately as visual aids in depict-  
ing one’s intended passage through a complex. Hospitals, sports  
complexes, and transportation centers are good examples of struc-  
tures that may require pictorial maps to supplement word mes-  
sages. Caution will be exercised by the expert designer to keep the  
pictorial map simple and correctly oriented in the building, accord-  
ing to where the viewer is standing, and to evaluate the need of  
color coding as part of the visual aid. Too frequently, designers  
employ a complicated color-coded system that becomes very con-  
fusing to the viewer and, in fact, compromises the effectiveness of  
the system.  
*Primary Directional*  
The maze that often results from interior corridor layouts creates  
many decision-making points for a visitor. Primary directional signs  
may be ceiling-mounted, wall-mounted, or floor-mounted as kiosk-  
type units in open areas. Areas with heavy pedestian traffic should  
have directional signs located so that people do not obstruct the line  
of sight to the sign device. Normally, ceiling-suspended or kiosk-  
type units are the best choice to enhance visibility.  
*Secondary Directional*  
Directional signs should be considered in locations where traffic  
flow and corridor layouts do not demand primary directional devices  
but do require some guidance for direction control. Corridors within  
suites of offices and corridors that change direction should be con-  
sidered as decision-making points that may require a secondary  
directional signage device.  
*Area Identification*  
Specific areas within a complex should be properly identified. These  
areas may be tenant spaces, divisions, or departments. When occurring  
along main corridors, they are usually designated by wall-, door-, or  
transom-mounted devices. Ceiling-suspended signs are a good solu-  
tion in open office spaces.  
*1362*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
*Room Identification*  
Wall- or door-mounted room identification signs are required to label  
the function of a particular room. Work functions are properly iden-  
tified within tenant areas, while service and maintenance functions  
should be suitably designated in most situations.  
*Desk Identification*  
Reception areas may require a sign device located on a desk or  
counter to identify a particular service or individual rendering assis-  
tance to visitors. Such signs may be permanently affixed or remov-  
able, and may provide for changeable name inserts.  
*Personnel Identification*  
Persons rendering a service to the public, such as nurses, mainte-  
nance personnel, and food service personnel, generally are identified  
by name badges or pins.  
*Regulatory and Control Signs*  
Signs that authorize or prohibit certain functions are required, fre-  
quently by law or code, to inform people using the facility. Examples  
include signs for the handicapped and signs relevant to no-smoking  
areas, elevator capacities, “no entry” areas, fire control, and “author-  
ized personnel only” areas. These signs are usually mounted on doors  
or their adjacent walls; they may employ colors which deviate from  
the standard colors used in the comprehensive signage system to  
emphasize a dangerous situation or the need for caution.  
*Exits*  
Exit signs are required by codes to designate exits effectively in  
times of emergency. Supplemental devices are used to give addi-  
tional information pertaining to a particular exit, such as “Emergency  
Exit Only” and “Alarm Sounds When Door Is Opened.” OSHA-  
approved exit signs are standard items manufactured by many light-  
ing companies and are generally provided by the electrical  
contractor.  
*Information Exhibit Cases*  
Notices, posters, attractions, and promotional pieces should be con-  
tained within an appropriately designed case to control the display of  
this type of information. Standard units featuring vinyl-covered cork  
panels housed within extruded aluminum frames with lockable doors  
are available from many directory manufacturers.  
*Decorative Features*  
Decorative designs may be reproduced on walls as interior features.  
Reproduction processes include appliqués, painting, and screen  
printing on location; or mural processes, which are applied much like  
wall-coverings, may be considered. Doors may also receive super-  
graphic treatments in which copy may become an integral part of the  
design.  
*Dedicatory Plaques*  
Building dedication plaques should be carefully conceived and imple-  
mented, using materials that reflect favorably on the talents involved  
in the realization of the project. Historically, these plaques have been Specialties  
SIGNAGE AND GRAPHICS

bronze or aluminum castings. However, modern technology has pro-  
vided photographic methods and photochemical processes which  
offer the designer a freedom of size, format, letter form, and color not  
available in the casting operation.  
*Donor Recognition*  
Buildings constructed in part by contributions from donors require  
special recognition for the donors. Hospitals, performing arts cen-  
ters, and service institutions rely on gifts to assist in financing build-  
ings, additions, and furnishings, and usually stipulate that donors be  
remembered and recognized in some prestigious location in the  
building. The designer is responsible for establishing controls and  
developing a system that fulfills promises made by those soliciting  
funds, while allowing flexibility to expand the system as future needs  
may dictate. Location selection is very important in the overall effec-  
tiveness of the donor recognition signage.  
*Mechanical, Instrumentation, and Control System Markings*  
Many industrial and mechanical installations require equipment,  
control, and pipe markings to meet codes, assist maintenance and  
service personnel, and ensure safety. Often, these locations are not  
public spaces and require an industrial, rather than an architectural,  
approach to signage. Elevator floor-indicator panels, however,  
should receive special attention and be considered in a comprehen-  
sive signage program.  
# CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF THE SIGN FACE  
Emphasis will not be placed on the graphic design of each sign  
required in a comprehensive signage program. However, the follow-  
ing considerations will help to ensure continuity, correctness, and  
aesthetic acceptability.  
# Alphabet Selection  
An alphabet must be carefully chosen that best exemplifies the  
graphic image to be portrayed to the public without compromising  
legibility and performance requirements. More than one alphabet  
may be selected, should need dictate. However, good design prac-  
tices should be maintained in choosing the family of alphabets to be  
employed.  
# Interletter, Word, and Line Spacing  
Each alphabet has its own personality and visual impact; therefore,  
spacing between characters, words, and lines of copy must be care-  
fully developed to give the best legibility and visual harmony possi-  
ble \(Fig. 8\).  
# Arrow Selection  
Directional arrows should be designed to reflect the personality of  
the letter form selected. Stroke width and size relationships are  
important considerations \(Fig. 9\).  
# Copy Determination  
The message for each sign must be accurately determined and the  
copy condensed to the fewest words that will still relay the desired  
message. Wordy signs are frequently misread or not read at all. The  
message must be concise, clear, and informative \(Fig. 10 and 11\).  
# Copy Placement Format  
The placement of copy on a sign face may take one of the nine basic  
positions or a custom format for special situations \(Fig. 12\).  
# Size Determination of the Sign Face  
After the copy for each sign is in final form, the sign with the great-  
est amount of copy is selected from each of the sign types utilized  
and the desired copy height is determined for each type. This height  
should be based on the distance from which the sign will be read and  
the graphic design portrayed. Using this letter height, the message  
should be laid out with photographic type or transfer lettering to  
scale, incorporating the copy placement and spacing requirements.  
The most pleasing shape and size for the message to be contained are  
then determined, realizing that this particular layout is for the maxi-  
mum copy required for that particular sign type. A shape and size for-  
mat should be chosen that works well as a module which can be  
proportioned and become applicable to the entire family of sign  
types. While this may be ideal, frequently the proportional system is  
not applicable. An example of each sign type should be drawn to  
scale and fully dimensioned to serve as a production guide for signs  
within that type \(Fig. 13\).  
# Color Selections  
Selection is then made of the copy and background colors that offer  
good contrast and harmoniously blend with the prominent colors in  
the environment. It is also wise to consider any corporate colors  
required by the client.

# SIGNAGE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHECKLIST  
The completed sign schedule, location plans, scaled drawings of typ-  
ical examples from each sign type, construction or assembly details  
or both, mounting details, and specifications form the documents  
required to bid competitively or to negotiate signage projects. Well-  
prepared documents prevent individual interpretation by vendors and  
result in comparable competitive bids.

Planning Guideline Summary  
# Designing the System  
The formulation of a communications program is based on the func-  
tional requirements delineated in the feasibility study. The presenta-  
tion modes to be utilized are a part of such a program. They might  
include slides, films, videotape, and a sound-recording and playback  
system. The detailed design of the facility includes the selection of  
basic equipment, possible modification of that equipment, and provi-  
sion for additional optical elements, as well as the engineering of the  
electrical control circuitry and the design of the electromechanical  
devices that may be needed.  
The implementation of a proposed audiovisual \(AV\) system is not  
merely an exercise in mechanical assembly. It is a highly complex  
process of logistics that involves providing specific functional  
requirements within architectural and economic constraints. Careful  
engineering and balancing of the alternatives available will generally  
achieve optimum results.  
A large number of variables is encountered in every AV design prob-  
lem. As an example, the dimensions of the presentation room have a  
significant effect on the audience size, the acoustic characteristics,  
the size of the projected image, the choice of equipment, and the  
location and the interrelationship of the components.  
The AV consultant who is responsible for the program planning, the  
design, and the engineering of this complex, multifaceted disci-  
pline should be intimately familiar with the problems of fabrica-  
tion, installation, and operation of such systems. This knowledge  
will enable the consultant to plan a facility whose execution will  
not create difficulties and whose construction and operation can be  
effected without costly changes. However, even when the consul-

tant has experience as an adviser to members of the architectural  
and engineering professions, the creation of a well-integrated facil-  
ity is not necessarily assured. His or her work and the completed  
facilities should be viewed and evaluated.  
*Optical Aspects*  
It is of critical importance for an AV system to have the ability to  
display bright, sharp images to all viewers and to maintain the sta-  
bility and consistency of those images in a simple and straightfor-  
ward manner. The picture quality is a function of a number of  
factors requiring careful attention during all phases of the project.  
These include\:  
• The quality of the original photography or artwork  
• The density, contrast, and sharpness of the actual material being  
projected  
• The output intensity of the projector light source  
• The optical characteristics of each projection unit  
• The optical characteristics of the integrated system  
• The ratio of the projection distance to the image size  
• The centering integrity of the light path from the material being  
projected to its image on the screen  
• The characteristics of the projection screen or other viewing sur-  
face  
*Projection Engineering*  
**Room size** Ideally, the dimensions of the viewing room should be  
an outgrowth of the estimate of the audience size that was estab-  
lished in the original AV study. In many cases, however, the AV  
design engineer must utilize a predetermined space. Given the  
characteristics of that space, the designer can determine the ideal  
audience size for each type of seating arrangement, and also ascer-  
tain whether a front or rear projection mode is feasible and what the  
image size should be.  
The type of relationship that is desired between the person making  
the presentation and the audience will determine the seating configu-  
ration\: theater, lecture, or conference format. That configuration will  
in turn dictate the number of viewers that can be comfortably seated  
for optimum viewing \(Fig. 1\).  
As an illustration, a room 20 ft by 32 ft can accommodate about 49  
people in a theatre configuration \(Fig. 2\); in a lecture arrangement,  
the audience size would be 24 \(Fig. 3\); a U-shaped table would seat  
18 \(Fig. 4\); and 15 people could fit comfortably at a conference table  
\(Fig. 5\). Circular and multiuse arrangements \(Figs. 6 and 7\) are addi-  
tional examples of the relationship of seating configuration and audi-  
ence size.  
Other seating configurations have been devised for other types of com-  
munication program modes, each with a direct relationship between  
room size and audience size. The audience size is also affected by the  
angle of view between each member of the audience and the screen  
\(Fig. 1\).  
Whenever the AV design engineer has the opportunity of establishing  
the dimensions of the presentation room, he or she should be aware  
of the important fact that a longer projection throw for a particular

Fig. 5 A room 20 ft by 32 ft, seating 15 people at a boat-

image size results in more even light distribution and sharpness as  
well as a better angle of view. Consequently, a larger audience can be  
accommodated than would be possible using a system with a short  
projection distance and a narrower angle of view. This question of  
projection distance applies to both front and rear projection systems.  
However, as the throw is normally quite short when a rear projection  
screen is used, this factor of design in rear projection facilities is an  
extremely critical planning element.  
Distortion, sometimes called “keystoning,” will result if the viewing  
surface is not precisely parallel to the plane of the image being pro-  
jected. Therefore, the light path, which is usually perpendicular to the  
projected material, must be carefully controlled in relation to the pro-  
jector and the screen. The size of the audience and the room, as well  
as the mode of projection, will determine whether the screen will be  
vertical or at an angle \(Fig. 8\). Normally, a rear projection screen will  
permit a vertical viewing surface.

AUDIOVISUAL SYSTEMS  
Planning Guidelines Summary  
**Screen image area** The most useful screen is one that is square, as  
it will permit both vertical and horizontal images, as well as square  
ones, of course \(Fig. 9\). A single image format will need one such  
screen, while a dual format will have a viewing surface that is the  
width of two images placed side by side \(Figs. 9 and 10\).  
It is an easy matter to determine the minimum image size necessary  
for a room of a given size. For a front projection screen, the mini-  
mum size is the distance between it and the farthest viewer divided  
by 6. For a rear projection screen, the division factor is 7.5. As an  
illustration, when the distance between the front projection screen  
and the last row of viewers is 45 ft, the minimum image size would  
be 7.5 ft; with a rear projection screen, the minimum image should be  
6 ft. These calculations assume that the original artwork from which  
the projection materials are made meets the generally accepted basic  
minimum standards.  
**Front projection** The projector in a front projection system trans-  
mits the image in the form of a light beam to an opaque screen, where  
it is reflected back to the viewers, creating the image. As the screen  
reflects any light falling on its surface, the general light level in the  
room during a presentation must be extremely low. If the full color  
and contrast of the projected image are to be retained, the ambient  
light should be no greater than 0.3 percent of the average screen  
brightness.  
Projectors are generally noisy and should be separated from the audi-  
ence to avoid distractions. If the space is available, a separate projec-  
tion booth can be built behind the room’s rear wall. Besides  
insulating the viewers from unwanted sound and light spill, this  
arrangement provides the opportunity for equipment to remain in  
place, ready for use. There are other possible arrangements when  
space is constricted \(Figs. 11, 12, and 13\).  
Creating an AV front projection system that is both aesthetically  
pleasing and functionally efficient requires a high level of technical  
expertise and design skill. The results of such a combination can be  
effective yet unobtrusive. Fig. 16 provides an example of a multi-  
media front projection system that is compatible with the decor of the  
room and its formalized seating arrangement.  
**Rear projection** The image in a rear projection system is focused  
on the back of a translucent screen and is visible to the audience on  
the other side. Since the light passes through the screen rather than  
being reflected off its front surface, there can be a reasonable light  
level in the viewing room during the presentation without affecting  
the quality of the image. It is only in the immediate vicinity of the  
screen that the room lights need be dimmed.

and square images to be shown

Fig. 10 A dual-image format uses a screen that is a dou-  
ble square—giving the same flexibility of image shape for  
each of the two images or for a single central image  
As is the case with all projection systems, for minimum distractions  
the equipment should be separated from the audience. This can be  
effected by means of a separate projection booth or by an enclosed  
cabinet within the viewing room. A separate room usually requires  
more space, but it may be the best solution for a particular situation.  
A cabinet within the viewing room permits front access to the pro-  
jectors, enabling the presenter to load the equipment without assis-  
tance.  
While technical expertise and design skill are needed for the creation  
of a front projection AV system, they are even more important for a  
system intended for rear projection, as a rear-mode arrangement has  
more inherent problems to overcome.  
A rear projection system utilizing the indirect deep method in a sep-  
arate projection booth requires a considerable amount of space. In  
addition, if more than one projector is used in such a system, either  
the projectors must be optically aligned each time a change is made  
\(as there is only one true screen axis\), or they are permanently posi-  
tioned a little off axis, resulting in a slight keystone or distortion  
effect in the projected image \(Fig. 17\).  
For good image clarity, the distance between the image source and  
the screen must be at least twice the picture size. To achieve this clar-  
ity within a limited amount of space, the folded light-path method  
can be used \(Figs. 18 and 19\). As the name implies, the light path  
from the projector is “folded” by means of a large mirror, usually  
placed some distance away. This arrangement has the advantage of  
reducing the depth required behind the screen while retaining an ade-  
quate projection distance. As a further advantage, several projectors  
can be aligned in optically true positions by the use of a movable mir-  
ror with preset position stops.  
The use of the folded light-path method of projection and a movable  
mirror can also be engineered in a cabinet that is directly accessible from the presentation room for hands-on operation by the person  
making the presentation. Both single-image and side-by-side dual-  
image systems can be designed in this manner \(Figs. 20 and 21\).  
A great number of variations are possible using the same basic engi-  
neering concepts. These variations can accommodate different func-  
tional requirements, spatial limitations, and image-quality parameters.  
Figures 14, 15, 22, and 23 illustrate some of the possible arrangements.  
User requirements and job conditions will guide the AV engineer in the  
design of a specific system.  
# The Optical Design Factor  
A projection system—of whatever nature—is only as good as the  
quality of the image on the screen. The clarity, sharpness, resolution,  
and angle of view that can be expected are a direct result of the  
thought and care that go into the optical design of the system. The  
more complex the system becomes, the more critical is the system  
optics. The need for larger images, sharper images, multiple images,  
and multiple image sources, and the existence of physically con-  
straining parameters all add to the conflicting requirements that must  
be satisfied. And they must be satisfied if an acceptable image qual-  
ity is to be achieved.  
# The Sound System  
The quality and the functional characteristics of the sound system  
that is part of an audiovisual facility are as important as the quality  
and functional characteristics of the optical system. The two aspects  
of a facility are complementary and the one should not be neglected  
in relation to the other if the goal of an effective and useful facility is  
to be attained.  
The quality of the sound, as perceived by the listener, will be influ-  
enced by such factors as\:  
• Sensitivity of controls  
• Quality of the amplifiers  
• Quality of the speakers

# The Remote-Control System  
Most people who make informational presentations are not audiovi-  
sual specialists. Their primary concern is with the material they are

AUDIOVISUAL SYSTEMS  
Planning Guidelines Summary  
presenting and not with the mechanics of how it is to be presented. As  
a result, any control devices they may be required to operate should be  
simple and logical. The presenter should be asked to make only a min-  
imum of effort to determine how to manipulate the controls in order to  
achieve a desired result. The fewer the operations necessary to reach a  
particular goal, the better. For example, in order for a change to be  
made from one presentation mode to another, it may be necessary to  
alter the ambient room lighting, reposition a mirror, turn one machine  
off and then another on. If all these things can be accomplished merely  
by flipping one clearly marked switch, the presenter is freed from  
mechanical distractions and can concentrate full attention on the mes-  
sage being delivered. The location and spacing of the various switches  
on the panel, as well as the use of nomenclature unmistakable to a non-  
technical person, are important parts of the design of a remote-control  
system that will aid the presenter in the use of the audiovisual facility.  
Other considerations that may affect the design of a remote-control  
system include\:  
• Seating configuration  
• Room lighting  
• Number of control points required  
• Use of a lectern incorporating a control module  
• Number and type of functions to be controlled  
• Degree of automation required to meet system objectives  
# SUMMARY  
An audiovisual presentation facility is made up of many components  
and subsystems which are interdependent and must perform as an  
integrated unit. Regardless of its size or scope, the AV system must  
be conceived, designed, and installed to function as a totality—as a  
single entity that works with optimum efficiency and effectiveness in  
an unobtrusive manner.  
In order to achieve this goal—that of developing a logical and work-  
able solution to any particular communication problem—careful and  
detailed preliminary investigations must be made. These will deter-  
mine the functional requirements that make up the design program.  
From this program, the space needs for the equipment and for the  
audience can be established early enough in the development of the  
project to avoid undesirable procrustean solutions later. The selec-  
tion, adaptation, manufacture, assembly, and installation of equip-  
ment and components should be carefully coordinated to ensure their  
functional integrity and performance.  
Ultimately, a successful audiovisual system is one that serves as a  
logical and natural extension of the human capabilities of the person  
using it. It should respond easily and unobtrusively to the communi-  
cator’s needs, and it should reproduce the material being communi-  
cated with the highest possible degree of fidelity.

d. An overhead projector cannot be used most effectively.  
# Rear Projection \(Rigid or Flexible Material\)  
1\. Viewing distance factor is 7.5. \(For example, if image size is 5 ft,  
the maximum viewing distance would be 37.5 ft.\)  
2\. Advantages  
a. A 20 percent smaller image than is required by front projection  
permits minimum standards to be met in low-ceilinged rooms.  
b. Can be used in higher ambient light conditions.  
c. No distracting light beam. \(Presenter can more comfortably  
point at details\).  
d. In a brighter room, the presenter easily maintains eye contact.  
e. An overhead projector can be used, so that neither it nor the  
presenter blocks the image from the viewers.  
3\. Disadvantages  
a. The inherent grain and directional quality of the rear screen  
eliminate it as a viewing medium to determine laboratory qual-  
ity of projectuals.  
b. The projection system must be designed to overcome apparent  
illumination falloff at the sides and improve the angle of view.  
c. d. Mirrored image is required for proper use.  
More space is required than with front projection.  
e. Usually costs more.  
# Seating  
\(Plan should permit several arrangements.\)  
1\. 2. 3. 4. 5. A U- or V-table layout provides for best viewing and viewer/pre-  
senter interaction \(lowest audience capacity\).  
Conference table \(boat shape or oval\) provides good interaction  
for conferences but not so good as the U- or V-table layout for  
audiovisual communication.  
Random seating style \(usually with writing tablets\) is frequently  
selected for high-level visitor presentations. It permits larger  
capacity and creates a more luxurious atmosphere than the two  
arrangements previously mentioned.  
Classroom style \(shallow tables parallel to front wall with chairs  
behind\) is the next best method, but is less conducive to student  
interraction.  
a. Stepped, curved seating \(lecture hall\) provides unobstructed  
viewing.  
b. When classroom style is contemplated, study and programmed-  
learning carrels should be considered.  
Auditorium style provides the largest seating capacity and is gen-  
erally used for large group-orientation and overview types of  
presentation.  
# Rear Projection System Factors  
1\. The physical center of all projector lenses must be in perfect  
alignment with the physical center of the screen to eliminate any  
keystone effect. \(For dissolve mode, 2° off center vertically is  
permitted.\) Specialties  
AUDIOVISUAL SYSTEMS  
Equipment Arrangement  
2\. A front-surface mirror should be used to reverse the image so the  
equipment can be loaded much as it is for front projection; slides  
in magazines need not be reversed, and special reversed prints  
are not needed for motion pictures. The use of a mirror can also  
extend the projection distance appreciably by folding the light  
path. Remember, the longer the projection distance, the better the  
viewing angle. Minimum projection distance should be at least  
two times the image size.  
3\. The screen-image area should be considered to be square to  
accommodate vertical and horizontal images unless the system is  
to be used for a special, limited requirement.  
4\. Apparent light falloff at the sides can be diminished or eliminated  
by increasing the projection distance and projector illumination.  
Another minor contributor is slide density. A dense or underex-  
posed slide reduces the amount of light transmission. This condi-  
tion increases apparent light falloff.

AUDITORIUM SEATING  
Sightlines and Building Codes  
Sightline studies vary depending on the particular event and seating  
configuration. The following are some basic design elements.  
NOTE\: Remember to review and verify slope, riser heights, tread  
depths, etc., with pertinent national and local code requirements.  
Refer to the visibility profile shown in Fig. 1\:  
*Angle A\:* Shifting position to look between heads in row imme-  
diately in front of spectator and over all other heads.  
*Angle B\:* Shifting position to look between heads of two rows  
immediately in front of spectators and over all other heads.  
Generally, the variables considered in determining these angles are\:  
• 3 ft 8 in eye level in the seated position  
• 5-in minimum eye clearance  
• Row spacing and row rise  
Angle A is commonly used in determining floor slope for auditorium,  
performing arts, or theater-type seating configurations. When the  
angle A profile is used in conjunction with a staggered seating  
arrangement \(chairs staggered or alternated in arrangement of sizes  
opposite every other row\), it allows spectators an unobstructed view  
to a determined focal point at the screen on stage. The final analysis  
is to have all sightlines intersect the desired focal point \(usually 5 ft  
6 in elevation either at the screen or 12 ft 0 in back from the front of  
the stage\).  
Angle B is most commonly used in determining riser or stepped  
applications for gymnasium, arena, or stadium-type seating configu-  
rations. When the angle B profile is used \(generally associated with  
an aligned seating arrangement\), it allows spectators an unobstructed  
view to a determined focal point at the court line or line of play. The  
final analysis is to have all the critical sightlines intersect the focal  
point or line of play at generally a 3 ft 0 in elevation.  
Legal responsibility lies with the owners and users of equipment in  
acquiring acceptance with local officials. The following are some  
basic guidelines.  
# Standard Seating  
1\. Row spacing shall provide a clear space of not less than 12 in  
\(30.5 cm\) from the back of one chair to the front of the most for-  
ward projection of the chair directly behind it when measured  
with the self-rising seat in the up position.  
2\. Rows of chairs shall not exceed 14 chairs between aisles and  
exceed seven chairs from an aisle to a row end.  
3\. Aisles serving 60 seats or less shall be a minimum of 30 in \(76  
cm\) wide. Aisles serving more than 60 seats shall be at least 3 ft  
\(91 cm\) wide when serving seats on one side and at least 3 ft 6 in  
\(107 cm\) wide when serving seats on both sides. These minimum  
widths, measured at the point farthest from an exit, cross aisles,  
or foyer shall be increased 11⁄2 in \(3.8 cm\) for each 5 ft \(152 cm\)  
in length toward the exit, cross aisle, or foyer. Where egress is  
possible in either direction, aisles shall be uniform in width. Dead-  
end aisles are not allowed over 20 ft 0 in \(61.0 m\) in length.  
4\. Cross aisles, foyer, or exit widths shall be not less than the sum of  
the required width of the widest aisle plus 50 percent of the total  
required width of the remaining aisles that it serves.  
# Continental Seating  
1\. 2. 3. Row spacing shall provide a clear space of not less than\: 18 in  
\(45.7 cm\) between rows of 18 chairs or less; 20 in \(50.8 cm\)  
between rows of 35 chairs or less; 21 in \(53.3 cm\) between rows  
of 45 chairs or less; 22 in \(55.9 cm\) between rows of 45 chairs or  
more to a maximum of 100 chairs per row, measured from the  
back of one chair to the front of the most forward projection of the  
chair directly behind it with the self-rising seat in the up position.  
There shall be exits of 66 in \(168 cm\) minimum clear width along  
each side aisle of the chair rows for each five rows of chairs.  
Aisles shall not be less than 44 in \(112 cm\) in clear width.

General Seating Arrangement  
# GENERAL SEATING ARRANGEMENT  
Seating arrangements in an assembly space will be identified as either  
*multiple-aisle* or *continental.* These terms are commonly found in  
design standards manuals, building codes, and similar architectural  
reference documents. Each is unique, with specific guidelines gov-  
erning row size, row spacing, and exitways.  
Basically, a multiple-aisle arrangement \(Fig. 2\) will have a maximum  
of 14 to 16 chairs per row with access to an aisleway at both ends. If  
an aisle can be reached from one end of a row only, the seat count may  
then be limited to 7 or 8. It should be noted here that the maximum  
quantities will always be established by the governing building code.  
In a continental arrangement \(Fig. 3\) all seats are located in a central  
section. Here the maximum quantity of chairs per row can greatly  
exceed the limits established in a multiple-aisle arrangement. In order  
to compensate for the greater length of rows allowed, building codes  
will require wider row spacing, wider aisles, and strategically located  
exit doors.  
Although more space would appear to be called for, a continental  
seating plan is often not any less efficient than a multiple-aisle  
arrangement. In fact, carefully planned, a continental arrangement  
can frequently accommodate more seating within the same space.  
For early planning an average 7.5 ft2 per person may be used. This  
will include both the seating area and space necessary for aisleways.

# LAYOUT INFORMATION  
# Design Considerations  
1\. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Lay out per applicable building and life safety codes, regulations,  
and ordinances.  
Allow sufficient distance between aisles for desired quantity and  
size of chairs plus end space.  
Space rows to allow for proper seat to back clear space.  
Determine radius or straight rows and locate by the chair size line.  
Allow 1 in minimum clearance from either side or rear of chair to  
any adjacent side wall, end walls, and so on.  
Provide adequate sightlines for either sloping or stepped \(riser\)  
floor configurations.  
Seating area should be free of obstructions.  
To allow for sufficient aisle illumination, aisle lights are gener-  
ally located in the end panel standards at least every other row.  
Locate aisle light junction box 6 in from the standard.  
Provide adequate floor or riser materials for sound anchorage.  
# ROW SEATING  
**Seat widths** Seating comfort is initially established by individual  
chair widths. Available sizes range from 18 to 24 in; however, all  
may not be produced by a single manufacturer. The most commonly  
used chair widths are 20, 21, and 22 in. It should be noted that these  
dimensions are nominal, being measured from center to center of  
the support legs. If seating comfort is a high priority, thought must  
be given to a particular width and the space taken up by chair arms  
to determine an actual size. Usually, smaller sizes of 18 and 19 in  
have limited application due to the minimum clear width provided.  
Typically, all manufacturers size their chairs along an imaginary  
line, which may be referred to as a *datum line, chair radius line,* or  
a *similar name.* For accurate planning in an assembly area, this line  
must be identified so as not to over- or underestimate the potential  
of a row of chairs.  
**Row spacing** Row spacing or back-to-back spacing of seats is also  
very important in developing a comfortable assembly area. A mini-  
mum dimension occasionally used is 2 ft 8 in \(32 in\). This spacing  
provides marginal clearance between a seated person’s knees and the  
back of the chair in the next forward row. At the same time, however,  
*1400*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design* Specialties  
AUDITORIUM SEATING  
Row Seating  
it will require that a seated person stand to permit the passage of  
another individual. As the row spacing is increased to 3 ft 0 in \(36 in\),  
seating comfort is dramatically improved and passage along a row of  
seated persons is accomplished with less disruption.  
**Floor design** Seating comfort will also be affected by the design of  
the assembly space floor. Flat or less steeply sloped floors will usu-  
ally allow a person to extend their knees and legs even under mini-  
mum row spacing dimensions. Here an individual can take advantage  
of the open area under a seat and the free space created by the pitched  
back of a chair. As the floor slope is increased, this free space dimin-  
ishes. The extreme condition exists where a large elevation change  
between rows is combined with a minimum row spacing. An exam-  
ple would be a 12-in-high riser and a 32-in-wide row spacing. At this  
point, it becomes necessary to consider increasing the back-to-back  
dimension to provide more leg room.  
The free space under a chair is also lost when a row of seats is located  
directly behind a low wall. In this case a recommended minimum  
clearance would be 11 in, measured from seat edge in the lowered  
position to face of wall. The back-to-back dimension of a row of  
seats abutting a rear wall should also be carefully studied. Normally,  
the pitched back of a chair will overlap a riser face, automatically  
reducing the width of that row unless succeeding rows are similarly  
positioned. Where a rear wall exists, the recommended procedure is  
to increase the dimension of the last row sufficiently to accommodate  
any overlap plus a minimal space between the wall and top edge of  
the chair back.

AUDITORIUM SEATING  
Visibility  
Visibility in an assembly space is a function of seat location. As  
stated earlier, building codes, comfort guidelines, floor design, and  
the overall form of an assembly space will play a part in seating  
arrangements. This information, combined with a basic under-  
standing of sightline analysis and related planning guidelines, can  
result in achieving an acceptable, if not optimum, level of viewing  
for spectators.  
Perhaps film projection requires the most critical sightline analysis,  
since poor seat location will result in distorted images. For this activ-  
ity, the seating parameters are established by the screen or image  
size. An angle of 30° up to 45°, measured perpendicular to the far and  
near edges of the screen, can establish a side-to-side seating limit,  
while the screen or image height may determine the maximum dis-  
tance. The minimum dimension or closest recommended seat will  
also be set by the screen height. \(It should be noted that these figures  
are approximate and apply principally to flat screen projection.\)

SECURITY  
General Control Guidelines  
# SECURITY  
# GENERAL CONTROL GUIDELINES  
# Control of Grounds  
Fencing can be a very effective means of limiting access to secondary  
exits and to vulnerable ground-level dwellings. Fencing functions as a  
control by requiring entry through a single, limited, highly visible area.  
The fencing surrounding most single-family homes does not have  
locked gates. It is intended primarily to protect children, pets, and gar-  
dens, and to define the area immediately around the home as the pri-  
vate outdoor space of that household. Any intrusion into the area  
within the fence is therefore noticeable. As a security measure, such  
fencing, used symbolically, is of minimal value against premeditated  
crime, but it does make criminal intent visible and so is an important  
deterrent.  
A conventional use of fencing in multifamily complexes is to limit  
access to backyards and windows of a housing cluster. On conven-  
tional city blocks, backyards of row housing are accessible only  
through one of the houses. However, in many superblock designs,  
such backyards are left open to public access. In this situation, addi-  
tion of a limited amount of fencing can protect a large group of  
homes \(see Fig. 1\). This approach can also subdivide the superblock  
and so create small, natural clusters.  
*The Lobby*  
Improving visibility is the most important ingredient in providing a  
naturally secure lobby. It is crucial that a tenant entering a building  
be able to see what is going on in the lobby from the outside. Hidden  
nooks and blind curves provide perfect hiding places. Where such  
features cannot be removed structurally, the use of mirrors, windows,  
and improved lighting may ease the situation.  
Ideally, a person walking down a path to enter a building should be  
able to see anyone standing in the lobby and elevator waiting area. In  
fact, it is often advantageous if the arriving person can see into the  
elevator from across the lobby.  
# Control of Interior Public Spaces of Multifamily Dwellings  
The most vulnerable locations in multifamily buildings are the inte-  
rior public spaces\: lobbies, elevators, stairwells, and corridors. These  
are areas open to the public but without the attending surveillance  
given a public street by passersby and police. The crimes that occur  
in these interior public spaces are the most fearful types of crimes,  
involving acts of personal confrontation such as robbery, assault, and  
rape. Limiting access to these spaces through the use of a doorman or  
intercom/door lock system can be of substantial benefit.  
Lobby visibility discourages a number of different kinds of crime.  
Crimes of personal confrontation may be deterred primarily because  
the potential victim can readily perceive and avoid a suspicious person  
in the lobby. The potential criminal must also fear the possibility that  
another tenant or the police may be viewing the crime in the well-lit  
open area.  
Mailbox crime—generally the theft of checks—can be deterred when  
mailboxes are located in a highly protected area of the lobby. This pro-  
tection can consist of placing the mailboxes behind an intercom or in a  
locked mailroom. It is essential that the mailboxes be visible from as  
many different viewpoints as possible. Improved visibility in this con-  
text can be a significant deterrent to crime.  
Some managers designate an area of the lobby as a legitimate resting  
place, where chairs and other lounging items are provided. Lounging  
may aid security, particularly if the building includes a high propor-  
tion of elderly. The best locations for such seating are areas with high  
visibility. Often tenant patrols use this space as a station and provide  
still another dimension of security.  
A bulletin board is an inexpensive device that can improve lobby  
security by providing a diversion. If, for example, a tenant enters the  
lobby and sees someone he or she doesn’t recognize waiting for an  
Fig. 1 vate areas  
Use of fencing to define and secure large semipri-  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1411* Specialties  
SECURITY  
General Control Guidelines  
elevator, the bulletin board provides the tenant with a natural excuse  
to pause and survey the situation.  
The area around the main entry to a multifamily building should be  
clearly distinguished from the public walkway which leads to it. A  
person entering through the main door should feel distinctly that he  
or she is entering a space controlled by the residents of the building.  
The main entry should be well lit and clearly visible from outside.  
Entry doors should be constructed of a transparent material covering  
as large an area as possible. In vandalism-prone areas, the main entry  
doors should be made of unbreakable glass or other, similar, very  
sturdy transparent material. Because of the need for good visibility,  
replacing glass panels with metal or other material should be  
avoided. For window walls and doors where the incidence of vandal-  
ism is extreme, glass panels less than 2 ft from the ground and higher  
than 7 ft from the ground may be replaced by solid materials.  
*Fire Doors and Fire Stairs*  
Secondary exit doors are the weakest link in security of buildings. An  
ideal secondary exit door would be one that allows exit but not  
entrance. Unfortunately, there is no acceptable emergency exit sys-  
tem that allows egress only.  
In the design of any security system there is a continuing clash  
between the need for security against crime and the need for safety in  
case of fire. Fire doors are frequently used for entry and exit by crim-  
inals. Installation of panic hardware and the absence of exterior hard-  
ware sometimes prevent criminal use. These measures will not  
suffice, however, where tenants do not cooperate in avoiding use of  
secondary exits and ensuring that they are kept closed.  
To a large extent, the design and location of secondary fire exits  
determine tenant attitudes about the exits. For example, a building’s  
main entry may face the street, but the parking lot may be to the rear  
of the building. If the secondary exit is also at the rear and close to  
this destination, the temptation to use the fire door as an entry or exit  
will be difficult to resist. Similarly, security is decreased in buildings  
where the main entries face the interior of the project while the fire  
doors face the surrounding streets with their parking and shopping  
facilities. Where the fire exit does not represent any shortcut or  
improved convenience to the tenant, it is far more likely to remain  
closed. A securely designed building is one in which the fire door  
exits to an area that is less convenient or desirable than the area out-  
side the main door.  
In cases of persistent breaks in security of secondary exits, it is pos-  
sible to modify the building plan at the ground level and open a new  
doorway in a better location. However, this improvement is costly  
and can only be done where architecturally possible.  
Another architectural modification to improve security involves  
making a fire exit into a legitimate secondary entry and developing a  
security system that protects both the main and secondary entries. If  
a fire door exits to a parking area, for example, this modification may  
be more successful than efforts to prevent tenants from using that  
exit. If the main entry is equipped with an intercom system, the sec-  
ondary entry should be similarly equipped and made easily surveill-  
able through the use of lighting and windows.  
Other mechanisms can be used to limit access to and prevent circula-  
tion through the emergency exit system. A fire exit passageway, for  
*1412*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
example, can be modified by installing a second door inside the  
building a short distance from the existing exterior door. Both doors  
should be equipped with hardware so that they can be opened only  
from the inside. The point of this system is that it is unlikely that both  
doors will be propped or jammed open at the same time. A tenant  
entering an open exterior fire door which leads only to the locked  
second door will have to exit and use another door. A few experi-  
ences of this kind will convince most tenants that it is probably more  
convenient to go directly through the main entrance. This double-  
door system generally does not conflict with fire codes.  
An extension of this concept is to have the fire door on each floor  
above ground level openable from the corridor only. Thus, once  
someone has gone into a stairwell he can exit only at the ground  
level. This system may be somewhat inconvenient to tenants accus-  
tomed to moving easily between floors, but it does create roadblocks  
for anyone attempting to enter the building from the ground-level  
exit door.  
The improvements outlined here are generally applicable to all  
dwellings. In buildings which have such security personnel, addi-  
tional measures are possible.  
A doorman or security guard can only be effective if he controls all  
access to the building, including access through fire doors. In a well-  
designed building, the doorman can see the fire doors from his posi-  
tion at the main entry. Where this is not possible, an inexpensive and  
effective solution is to install panic hardware with an alarm, and  
make sure the doorman can hear and respond to the alarm. Where the  
doorman or guard has access to closed-circuit TV, this may be used  
to monitor the fire doors. If the doorman can also be given a device  
for controlling the secondary door, it becomes very difficult for a  
criminal to use the fire entry.  
*Elevators*  
There are virtually no structural modifications that can improve  
security within elevators. The only possible improvements are use of  
mirrors, communication devices, emergency buttons, or an elec-  
tronic surveillance system.  
Security modifications to other areas of a building improve security  
within the elevator. If the elevator waiting area and the elevator cab  
are a visible extension of the lobby, the residents are afforded some  
protection. Similarly, if the fire door and fire stairs are secure, there  
is less chance of a criminal entering the elevator on an upper floor. In  
this sense, the safety of the elevator is dependent on the general secu-  
rity of the building.  
# Securing the Dwelling  
Illegal entry into dwelling units is traditionally prevented by use of  
hardware. However, there are building design features which in  
themselves limit access, improve surveillance, and promote neighbor  
recognition.  
*Windows*  
Ground-level windows are generally most vulnerable to illegal entry  
and breakage. \(All windows whose lower ledges are less than 7 ft off  
the ground should be considered ground level.\) There are three ways  
to discourage criminal entry through ground-floor windows\: design  
ground-floor areas which need few windows, house activities on the ground floor which hold no interest to the burglar, and assign the  
grounds immediately adjacent to the building for the use of the  
neighboring resident and fence off the grounds for his protection.  
Elaborate architectural details—protruding ledges, for example—  
often increase the vulnerability of lower windows. Fences, garbage  
containers, and parked cars, when located near windows, are used as  
stepping stones to an otherwise inaccessible window. Care should be  
taken to prevent this type of situation.  
Most windows above the ground floor are relatively inaccessible,  
with very important exceptions. Fire escapes make windows accessi-  
ble. Little can be done to modify fire escapes, except in terms of hard-  
ware, because of fire safety and fire codes. One solution is to ensure  
that the ladder from the lowest fire escape is at least 12 ft above the  
ground. The ground area under the fire escape should be highly visi-  
ble.  
Another point of entry to the fire escape is the roof, which can be  
secured with panic hardware and possibly patrolled. The roof also  
provides possible entry to windows or balconies on the top floor.  
Therefore, security of the roof is quite essential, particularly to top-  
floor residents. Other accessible windows are those located diago-  
nally across from a stairwell window. The criminal can open a  
stairwell window and cross from the stairwell into the units. It is not  
advisable to board up stairwell windows, as they provide the security  
of visibility to the stairwell and may have a fire safety function.  
Accessible windows are also those located above or near door  
canopies. Criminals can reach the canopy by climbing onto it from  
the ground or from a stair or hall window.  
*Doors*  
Security of doors, beyond the hardware aspect, depends on surveil-  
lance and neighbor recognition. An experienced burglar needs just a  
few seconds to enter a locked apartment door equipped with minimal  
hardware. Within this interval, the crucial factors are\: will the  
intruder be seen or heard by tenants, will the viewer perceive that the  
potential criminal is in fact an intruder, and will the viewer respond  
by calling authorities or in some way challenge the criminal?  
Physical design can directly influence the opportunity for surveil-  
lance of doors. Corridors that are open to view, either single loaded  
or with windows, are more easily surveillable by residents and  
police. Thus the opportunity for the criminal to attempt entry unde-  
tected is reduced.  
In most single-family homes \(detached or row\) where the entrance  
door is on the street, the only means of improving surveillance is to  
avoid placing trees and shrubs where they hide the doors and windows,  
and to locate lighting to improve visibility around these openings.  
In multiple-family dwellings, the apartment doors, located on interior  
corridors, are generally difficult to keep under surveillance. Any win-  
dows, mirrors, or lighting that allow someone inside an apartment or  
outside the building to view the hallway and doors can be helpful.

residential dwelling and the multifamily dwelling. Much of this  
material is intended to prevent burglary. However, some of the meas-  
ures, particularly those directed at multifamily dwellings, will also  
deter forcible entry, robbery, and vandalism.  
# The Residential Dwelling  
*Door Materials*  
The major security tests of door material are its ability to withstand  
efforts to force entry by brute strength and its ability to retain  
securely the locking devices attached. Materials most commonly  
used for doors are wood, aluminum, steel, and glass, often in combi-  
nation with hardboard, fiberboard, asbestos, and plastic. The two  
most common door designs are panel and flush. Panel doors consist  
of vertical and horizontal members framing rectangular areas in  
which opaque panels, panes of glass, or louvers are located. Flush  
doors consist of flat panels running the full height and width of the  
door. \(See Fig. 2.\)  
Solid-steel flush doors, although most secure, are rarely used except  
in very high security areas such as banks and prisons. Steel-clad  
doors, which are flush doors constructed of 24-gauge sheet metal fac-  
ing bonded to a nonresinous, kiln-dried wood interior, provide an  
optimum weight-strength situation for ordinary residential use. Hol-  
low steel doors \(13⁄4-in flush-type\) are satisfactory in multiple-  
dwelling buildings. Aluminum doors can provide sufficient protection  
but may be comparatively expensive.  
While less strong than steel-clad doors, wood doors can be secure.  
All exterior wooden doors should be of solid-core construction with  
a minimum thickness of 13⁄4 in. Although flush doors provide better  
security, if panel doors are desired for aesthetic reasons, the panels  
should have a minimum 1⁄2-in thickness \(see Fig. 3\). Both hollow-  
core wood doors and thin-wood panel doors are unacceptable where  
security is a factor.  
*Door Frames*  
The sides and top of a doorway are provided with a door frame which  
holds the door in position. The side members of the door frame are  
called *jambs;* the top member is called the *head* \(see Fig. 4\). The  
*strike* is the portion of the jamb which is cut out or drilled out to  
allow installation of a metal plate, which accepts the latch or bolt  
from the door lock \(see Fig. 5\).  
Wooden frames provide an unacceptable level of security unless they  
are at least 2 in thick. Metal-covered wood frames provide an opti-  
mum cost-security investment when used in combination with metal-  
covered wood doors. If a hollow steel frame is used, the residual air  
space behind the frame should be filled with a crush-resistant mate-  
rial such as cement grout, especially in the area of the strike \(see Fig.  
6\). This will prevent an intruder from wedging a crowbar between  
the door and frame and crushing the frame to free the lock.  
For doors swinging in, rabbeted jambs should be used. These are  
jambs containing a metal extension that protrudes beyond the edges  
of the closed door, thus preventing tampering in the area of the strike  
\(see Fig. 7\).  
For doors without rabbeted jambs, an L-shaped piece of angle-iron at  
least 2 ft long, mounted in the area of the strike, gives extra protec-  
tion \(see Fig. 8\). The iron acts as a lip which protects the strike from

attack.  
For doors opening out, a flat metal plate, called an *escutcheon plate,*  
can be mounted to the face of the door in the area of the lock. This  
plate, which extends beyond the edge of the door and fits flush with  
the jamb when the door is closed, will protect the lock from attack in  
the area of the strike \(see Fig. 9\).  
All plates located on the outsides of doors should be attached with  
tamper-resistant connectors such as round-headed carriage bolts or  
one-way screws.  
*Door Hinges and Closers*  
Spring hinges close the door automatically by using spring force. A  
spring hinge prevents a criminal from slipping in behind a resident  
who has neglected to close the door immediately upon entering. Also,  
spring hinges prevent the resident from leaving the door open when  
he or she exits. Door closers \(see Fig. 10\) serve the same purpose.  
These are for more heavy duty and are commonly used in lobbies and  
commercial facilities.  
Hinges should be mounted on the inside of the door so that burglars  
cannot remove the door from the hinges to enter. If hinges must be  
placed on the outside, they should have nonremovable pins. Pins can  
be made nonremovable by peening the straight end or by drilling and  
tapping a machine screw into the middle portion of each pin from the  
inside of the open hinge \(see Fig. 11\). Doors with outside hinge pins  
can also be protected by screwing two screws halfway into the jamb  
edge of the door. One screw is placed near each hinge, and a receiving

SECURITY  
Doors and Hardware  
hole is drilled into the jamb for each screw. These protruding screws  
hold the door when it is closed, even if the hinge pins are removed.  
*Door Locks*  
Locks must withstand or seriously delay not only a simple forced  
entry but also sophisticated criminal attack. Locks may also guard  
against window entry-door exit crimes.  
Parts of the a lock are defined as follows\:  
*Cylinder\:* A cylinder is that part of the lock into which the key  
is inserted. If the proper key is used, the cylinder will allow  
the key to turn, thus moving a bolt or latch.  
*Deadbolt\:* A deadbolt \(or bolt lock\) is a heavy metal bar which  
moves horizontally into the strike of the door jamb, thus lock-  
ing the two together. It is called a deadbolt because it cannot  
be pushed back unless the knob is turned by the correct key.  
*Latch\:* A latch \(or spring lock\) is the part of the lock that keeps  
the door in a closed position by extending into the strike auto-  
matically when the door is closed. The latch is most often  
operated by the doorknob. Most latches can be pushed back  
by external pressure without having to turn the doorknob.  
*Deadlatch\:* In a deadlatch, the latch is positively held in the  
projected position by an automatic mechanism which is  
depressed against the strike plate \(see Fig. 12\).  
*Strike\:* The strike is the portion of the jamb where a metal plate  
has been placed to receive the deadbolt and/or the latch \(see  
Fig. 5\).  
*Stopworks\:* Stopworks consist of two buttons located under the  
latch. Pressing the top button in allows the doorknob to turn  
freely and operate the latch, from both inside and out. Press-  
ing the lower button in allows the inside doorknob to operate  
the latch, but freezes the outside doorknob.  
*Throw\:* The throw of a lock is the length \(in inches\) that the  
deadbolt extends beyond the face of the lock.  
**Primary locks** Primary locks operate in conjunction with the  
latch. There are two major types\: mortise locks and cylindrical or  
bore-in tubular locks \(commonly called key-in-the-knob locks\).  
Mortise locks \(see Fig. 13\) are more common than key-in-the-knob  
locks and will provide good security. All mortise locks with latches  
should contain a deadbolt with at least a 1-in throw constructed of  
case-hardened steel, brass or zinc alloy, or bronze. Federal FF-H

*1416*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
Fig. 13 Mortise lock  
ified deadbolts are recommended. The deadbolt and latch should be  
key-operated from the exterior and operated from the inside by a  
device not requiring a key.  
Mortise locks with latches used in residences should not contain an  
automatic spring latch with stopworks. Although stopworks prevent  
the outside knob from being turned, they leave the premises open to  
easy entry because they do not prevent the latch from being pushed  
back. An intruder need only insert a credit card into the strike area,  
push back the spring latch, and open the door \(called “loiding” or  
“shimming” the lock\). In locks without stopworks, the deadbolt  
\(which cannot be loided\) must be thrown by the key of the resident.  
Eliminating the stopworks prevents the resident from relying on the  
stopwork and latch mechanism alone.  
Key-in-the-knob locks \(see Fig. 14\) are less secure than mortise  
locks. Although inexpensive due to easy installation, key-in-the-  
knob locks can be easily gripped by a tool and twisted until they  
break. A key-in-the-knob lock can include a deadbolt, at a compara-  
ble to slightly higher price than a mortise lock.  
**Secondary locks** A secondary lock \(rim lock\) operates independ-  
ently of the latch. “Secondary” is perhaps a poor name, since this  
type of lock is essential for good security. Secondary locks are usu-  
ally mounted above the primary lock at shoulder level. They are  
operated by a key from the outside, and by a turnbolt from the inside.  
Both mortise and secondary locks may require keys to open them  
from inside and outside—useful where access to premises may be  
gained through a small opening other than the door \(window tran-  
som\), since this will prevent the thief from using the door to remove  
large objects or to escape.  
There are three major types of secondary locks\: spring bolt, horizon-  
tal deadbolt, and vertical deadbolt. The spring bolt lock operates  
much the same as the primary door latch. Because the bolt must be  
spring loaded and bevelled to allow automatic latching, the bolt can Specialties  
SECURITY  
Doors and Hardware  
be easily opened. A button \(slide stop\) may be set to deadlock the  
bolt. However, the button must be set from the inside and can only be  
used when another means of egress is available. The spring bolt is  
not recommended as a secondary lock \(see Fig. 15\).  
Horizontal bolt rim locks operate much the same as deadbolts on pri-  
mary locks. While horizontal deadbolts afford much better protection  
than spring bolts, they still can be easily overcome. By inserting a  
crowbar between the door and the jamb, the intruder can pry them  
apart to release the bolt from the strike. For this reason, the longer the  
throw of the deadbolt, the greater the protection it affords. However,  
throws of over 11⁄2 in may have excessive cantilever. The recom-  
mended minimum throw is 1 in \(see Fig. 16\).  
Vertical bolt deadlocks should be used as secondary locks wherever  
possible. These utilize two deadbolts that fit vertically into eyeholes

or sockets attached to the jamb. This creates a firm bond between the  
door and the jamb. The vertical bolt deadlock made by Segal is  
highly recommended, both for its pressed-steel construction and for  
its ability to hold up under heavy use \(see Fig. 17\). For additional  
security, a pick-resistant cylinder should be installed in a good verti-  
cal deadbolt body. This combination provides excellent security.  
The locks discussed so far rely on the rigidity of an existing door  
frame to resist attacks on the lock. Since older buildings may contain  
weak door frames, a buttress-type door lock is advisable. Locks of  
this type include a bar set against a plate on the door and into a recep-  
tacle in the floor, thus forming a triangular buttress \(see Fig. 18\). Most  
of these locks can be operated only by a key from the outside. The  
Magic Eye Company buttress lock can be operated from the outside  
by a key and from the inside by a turnbolt to prevent accidental lock-  
ing \(see Fig. 19\). One model contains a heavy-duty deadbolt as well  
as the buttress bar, and affords still further protection \(see Fig. 20\).  
The double-bar lock may also be used to increase the strength of a  
door, by means of two steel bars that extend up to 21⁄2 in into each side  
of the jamb \(see Fig. 21\). The cylinder is protected on the outside by an  
escutcheon plate to prevent forcible removal. A pick-resistant cylinder  
can be installed for added protection. The Fox Police Lock and the  
Fichet Locking Bar are examples of high-quality double-bar locks.  
**Cylinders** Regardless of the type of lock purchased, the cylinder is  
critical in providing protection. It must withstand efforts by sophisti-  
cated criminals such as lock pick experts.  
The cylinder is the part of the lock into which the key is inserted. The  
most common type of cylinder is the pin tumbler, which operates as  
follows\: As the key is inserted, spring-loaded pins are raised to the  
proper position to allow the barrel and the key to turn; the turning  
causes the bolt or latch \(or both\) to move. If the wrong key is used,  
the pins will line up incorrectly and prevent the barrel from turning  
\(see Fig. 22\).  
Recently, cylinders have become available which utilize special  
keyways and keys to make the cylinder pick proof or pick resistant  
\(see Fig. 23\). Medeco, Illinois Duo, Sargent, Keso, Eagle Three  
Star, Mela, Fitchet, and Miracle Magnetic are highly pick resistant.  
Such cylinders provide improved security, but may require regis-  
tered keys that can be duplicated only at the factory upon receipt of  
a signed request. A compromise is the use of a key type whose  
blank is not available normally, but for which spare blanks are kept  
for replacements.  
Of all cylinders on the market, Medeco has proven most difficult to  
overcome. Medeco utilizes twisting tumblers operated by a key with  
angular or criss-cross cuts. Only if the proper key is inserted will the  
pins twist the exact amount needed to allow the barrel to turn.  
If special keyway cylinders are deemed unnecessarily secure or  
costly \(Medeco cylinders cost about two times the next adequate\),  
the cylinder used should be of solid-bar-stock bronze and machined  
for a tight fit.  
The cylinders of a master-key system of locks are constructed so that  
individual keys fit only one lock, but a single master key can open all  
locks in the system. Use of a master-key system makes maintenance  
and other authorized access simpler, but the dangers of improper use  
of a lost or stolen master key far outweigh the benefits. Specialties  
SECURITY  
Doors and Hardware  
From a security standpoint, a cylinder should have at least six pins.  
This often results in the cylinder being longer than the thickness of  
the door. In mortise locks \(which are recessed into doors\), a six-pin  
cylinder often extends slightly beyond the surface of the door, thus  
making it susceptible to forcible removal by use of a gripping tool.  
To prevent use of such a tool, protruding cylinders should be pro-  
tected by one of the following\:  
*Spinner ring\:* A hardened steel ring that forms a collar around  
the cylinder and spins freely around the cylinder when gripped  
\(see Fig. 24\).  
*Bevelled-ring cylinder guard\:* A case-hardened steel ring that  
prevents the cylinder from being gripped by a tool because of  
its bevelled shape \(see Fig. 25\). Scotsman makes a flat, very  
secure, cylinder guard ring.  
*Escutcheon plate\:* A metal plate mounted to the door, which

SECURITY  
Doors and Hardware  
covers all of the cylinder except the core \(the part where the  
key is inserted\), thus protecting the cylinder from attack. The  
escutcheon plate should be constructed of malleable cast iron  
and attached to the door with one-way screws. Machine bolts  
should not be used to mount escutcheon plates on mortise  
locks, as the increased pressure can have an adverse effect on  
the mechanism \(see Fig. 26\).  
*Sliding Doors*  
Sliding doors opening onto a ground-level patio or accessible bal-  
cony \(on the first floor or top floor, or adjacent to other balconies\)  
should be constructed so the movable section of the door slides on  
the inside of the fixed portion. Sliding doors should be break resist-  
ant \(plate glass\) and equipped with a vertical-bolt Segal lock \(see  
Fig. 27\), which uses a hook-type bolt to grip door and frame together,  
or a Loxem Sli-door lock that hoods at top and bottom \(see Fig. 28\).  
*Doors with Large Glass Panels*  
Exterior doors containing panes of glass are not recommended for  
security. French doors that open out should have hinges with nonre-  
movable pins. The vertical stile incorporating the lock should with-  
stand a concentrated horizontal load of 300 lb. The doors should  
contain a mortise-type lock that is key operated from the inside and  
outside. The lock should contain a pin-tumbler cylinder with at least  
six pins \(a pick-resistant cylinder can be used for extra protection\).  
Even when fitted with key-operated locks inside and outside, doors  
with large panes of glass are a security problem. Use of break-  
resistant glass substitutes is one modification. Bars or metal grilles,  
while providing good security, may be aesthetically unacceptable.  
Alarms may also be used on these vulnerable doors.  
*Double Doors*  
On double doors, the active leaf should be equipped with a mortise-  
type lock. The inactive leaf should be equipped with flush bolts with  
at least a 3⁄4-in throw at head and foot \(see Fig. 29\).

SECURITY

*Private Garage Doors*  
Many rolling overhead doors operated by electric motors offer ade-  
quate security because the motors are controlled by a key switch  
inside the garage or by a low-power radio transmitter. Manually  
operated doors should be provided with slide bolts on the bottom bar  
\(see Fig. 30\). Chair-operated doors should be provided with a cast-  
iron keeper and pin for securing the hardened-steel chain.  
*Door Interviewers*  
Interviewers are devices installed on opaque doors to allow residents  
to see and hear who is outside the door without opening it.  
An optical interviewer \(peephole\) should be installed on each door  
that provides entry into private dwellings. Many types of interview-  
ers are available, ranging in diameter from 2⁄10 to 3 in. Optics of the  
interviewer include one-way glass, plastic, and wide-angle glass.  
Fig. 33 Chain lock  
Fig. 31 Interviewer location  
Interviewers with openings of over 1⁄4 in are not recommended.  
Larger interviewers can easily be punched out to allow insertion of  
tools to open the door from the inside. Someone also may stick a  
knife, wire, or gun through the hole while the person is looking  
through it. Interviewers are located approximately 4 ft 9 in from the  
floor \(see Fig. 31\). The best interviewers contain a double glass for  
safety. Wide-angle glass allows maximum visibility. Although a  
wide-angle lens does produce a curved, fisheye image, clarity of the  
image is not impaired. If wide-angle glass is not used, the person out-  
side cannot be seen unless he or she is standing in a direct line with  
the interviewer \(see Fig. 32\).  
Instead of an optical interviewer, a case-hardened steel chain which  
fits into a horizontally mounted slide track on one end of the door  
jamb may be installed \(see Fig. 33\). The chain allows the door to  
open slightly \(preferably not more than 2 in\) to permit easy conver-  
sation without fully unlocking the door. These chains should be used  
for interviewing only, not to protect a locked door. The swing of the  
door, even if only 2 in, allows the criminal to exert strong force with  
momentum, which breaks most chain devices. The interviewing  
space also allows insertion and use of tools. Some slide chains have  
a locking mechanism which prevents use of a thumb tack \(or piece of  
tape\) and rubber band to pull back the slide mechanism and remove  
the chain from the track. Even when equipped with a locking mech-  
anism, steel chains and slides are readily overcome by simple tools  
and brute force.  
# Windows and Hardware  
*Window Materials*  
Because windows contain large sections of glass, they naturally  
impose a security problem. Windows most vulnerable are those on  
the first floor \(or otherwise accessible from the ground\) and those  
leading to fire escapes. Less vulnerable, but still easily reached, are  
windows over a canopy \(as above a main entrance\), windows adja-  
cent to stairwell windows, and windows on the top floor.

SECURITY  
Doors and Hardware  
*Window Locks*  
Among the common window locks are the crescent sash lock, often  
standard on residential windows; various friction or pressure  
devices, such as the thumb-screw latch; pin-type latches, such as  
the simple steel pin-in-the-hole device; and the slide-bolt latch. All  
of these devices can easily be overcome, especially if an intruder is  
willing to risk the noise of breaking a small section of the glass.  
\(See Figs. 34–37.\)  
Normal windowpane glass is approximately 1⁄8 in thick and extremely  
brittle, and it breaks easily. Plate glass is usually 1⁄4 in thick and is  
tempered to withstand an accidental knock. Plate glass is used for  
larger areas because of its greater strength and because the initial cost  
is worth the extra protection. Tempered glass has a thin, hardening  
coating and, while no stronger than plate glass, will not cut someone  
who breaks it.  
Several companies have developed unbreakable, transparent poly-  
carbonate materials which look like glass but are very difficult to  
break. GE’s Lexan, for example, is guaranteed unbreakable. It costs  
two to three times as much as glass and has low resistance to scratch-  
ing. An improved material, Lexan MR-4000, is slightly more expen-  
sive but is much less easily scratched. These polycarbonate materials  
have not yet been extensively used for private dwellings.  
Another type of durable “glass” is fabricated much like the safety  
glass used in automobiles\: two layers of high-quality glass are bonded  
together with a layer of tough vinyl between. This is sold by one com-  
pany as Secur-lite. While Secur-lite can eventually be broken, the  
noise and trouble required to do so are considerable deterrents.  
Oversized glazed areas should be avoided. Anything beyond stan-  
dard size \(6 ft by 8 ft for glass, for example\) is expensive and may be  
difficult to obtain.  
The only reliable devices are those with a key-operated locking  
mechanism. Yale and Ideal Security manufacture a window lock  
which is a modification of the pin-type lock. It can be locked in either

of two positions, one of which allows the window to be open slightly  
at the bottom for ventilation \(see Fig. 38\). Fox makes a window lock  
combining a pin-type lock and a hasp and padlock. Although some-  
what unsightly, it provides excellent protection. Ideal Security man-  
ufactures a modification of the crescent sash lock, which requires a  
key to operate.  
All of these devices provide adequate security for normal residential  
use. A set of keys should be convenient to the window for use in  
emergencies but far enough away so that a burglar cannot reach  
them.  
*Window Bars, Grilles, and Gates*  
Where tighter security is desired, metal bars, grilles, and gates have  
proven most reliable. If a wire mesh grille is used, the metal should  
be at least 1⁄8 in in diameter and the openings should not exceed 2 in  
\(see Figs. 39 and 40\). The grille should be attached to the window

frame with machine or roundhead bolts which cannot be removed  
from the outside.  
If bars are used, they should be placed not more than 5 in apart. The  
bars should have a diameter of at least 3⁄4 in and be set at least 3 in into  
the masonry.  
Sliding gates afford excellent protection and can be pushed aside or  
opened for emergency exit. The gates should be set in tracks on the  
top and bottom to prevent them from being pulled or pried away  
from the window \(see Fig. 41\). Protect-A-Guard gates are highly rec-  
ommended for residential and commercial use.  
All of these devices should be installed inside the window for maxi-  
mum security.

SECURITY  
Doors and Hardware  
The best protection for skylights is installation of metal bars, grilles,

and should be placed not more than 5 in apart \(see Fig. 42\). If mesh  
is used, it should be at least 1⁄8 in thick and the spaces should not be  
greater than 2 in. Mesh should be secured firmly by machine or  
roundhead bolts that cannot be removed from the outside.  
If metal is undesirable, a securely fastened hasp and padlock will dis-  
courage entry and exit through the roof, if the glass is not removed.  
Both hook-in-eye and sliding-bolt devices are unacceptable security  
measures for skylights.  
# Multifamily Dwellings  
*Lobby Doors and Walls*  
All lobby entrance doors should provide maximum visibility of the  
lobby. This often requires large glass areas in the lobby doors. Where  
there is a high degree of vandalism and crime, use of Lexan is rec-  
ommended. In all cases, oversized glass sheet should be avoided.  
Glazed areas should be divided so that sheets larger than 6 by 8 ft are  
not needed. The door frame should be constructed of rugged, heavy-  
duty metal. The vertical jamb incorporating the lock should with-  
stand a concentrated load of 500 lb and be a minimum of 5 in thick  
so that it can receive heavy-duty mortise lock sets.  
The main outer lobby door should have a key-operated lock with a  
pin-tumbler cylinder containing at least six pins. The key for this  
lock should not open any other door \(such as an apartment door\), as  
this makes the lobby-door cylinder susceptible to picking. An  
antifriction latch \(see Fig. 43\) and a sturdy door closer should be  
used in conjunction with the lock.  
Lobby doors, especially if locked or equipped with intercoms, should  
open out for fire safety and to reduce vandalism \(tenants who have  
misplaced their keys can kick an in-swinging door hard enough to  
break the locking mechanism\).  
*Secondary Exits*  
In multifamily dwellings, exit doors leading to fire stairwells on each  
landing should have self-locking deadlatches to allow free egress  
while prohibiting entry. The stairside surface of the door should be  
free of hardware to prevent access to one floor from another via the  
stairwell. Hardware should limit access to the roof or ground-floor  
exits via the stairwell.  
Panic hardware, if required, should be in the form of vertical-bolt  
latches on the top and bottom of the door. This hardware makes the  
door more sturdy and makes entry from the outside difficult \(see  
Fig. 43 Antifriction latch bolt  
Fig. 42 Skylight protection  
Fig. 44\).  
Doors leading into the buildings from garage areas should have self-  
locking deadlatches with a minimum throw of 1⁄2 inch, which allow  
free egress but require a key for entry into the building. The door  
should be protected in the area of the strike. All exit doors should be  
equipped with a self-closing apparatus that can be adjusted to the  
desired tension.  
Since fire doors are required by law to be operable from the inside,  
they are often a means of escape. Exit alarms \(see Fig. 45\) bring  
immediate attention to fire doors that are opened when there is no  
apparent fire. A panic bar or other device simultaneously opens the  
door and sounds a local alarm. However, effectiveness of the alarm  
as a security measure depends on the speed and consistence of  
response to the signal.  
Exit alarms on fire exits leading to roofs keep burglars from using the  
roof for escape or for access to top-floor apartments. However, the  
alarm may prove more a nuisance than a good security measure if  
teenage vandalism is prevalent. Teenagers often set off the alarm to  
harass the local official, who must respond to the signal and reset the  
alarm.  
*Elevators*  
In most middle-income multifamily dwellings, vandalism of eleva-  
tors is relatively rare. However, in many high-crime areas and low-  
income housing developments, this vandalism is reaching a critical  
level. In New York City Housing Authority projects, vandalism to

SECURITY  
Doors and Hardware  
Fig. 46 Mushroom button  
Fig. 44 Vertical bolt on exit door  
elevators and elevator equipment is responsible for almost 60 percent  
of elevator outages. Parts of the elevator most commonly vandalized  
are the hall buttons, indicator lights, hatch door glass, hatch door  
interlock, and buttons located inside the cab, especially the emer-  
gency and light switches.  
Hall buttons are most commonly vandalized because of their accessi-  
bility. Impatient tenants push the buttons excessively and often kick or  
smash them in frustration. To prevent damage to the button and the  
Fig. 45 Exit alarm  
electrical contacts inside, a stainless steel mushroom-type button  
should be used \(see Fig. 46\). The shape of the button prevents the con-  
tacts from being damaged by the button’s being pushed too heavily  
against them. Another stainless steel button has been developed on the  
same principle, except that the stopper is inside the mechanism so that  
the button has the more familiar stunted-cone appearance.  
Use of indicator lights for the lobby, the cab, and the other floors  
should be decided by the management. In some projects, indicator  
lights are so vandalized that it is easier to eliminate them. In other  
developments, indicator lights dampen user impatience and the result  
is less wear and tear on the buttons. If indicator lights are used, they  
should be protected by a heavy-duty plastic shield.  
There are two types of elevator doors\: swing and slide. This nomen-  
clature refers to the doors on each floor; the cab door is always a slide  
door. Slide doors, which are automatic, are becoming increasingly  
popular despite higher initial cost, because they increase protection  
against vandalism. Swing doors are inconvenient and more subject to  
vandalism \(short-circuiting of door interlocks, jamming of closing  
mechanisms, and joyriding on top of cabs\).  
In many older elevators \(especially the swing-door type\), the hatch  
and cab door contain small glass windows, which allow people to see  
inside before entering and allow passengers to see what floor they’re  
passing. In high-crime areas, this glass has proven more dangerous  
than helpful. Vandals smash the glass readily, even if wire glass is  
used. The opening left when the glass is broken presents a very dan-  
gerous situation. Hatch door glass should be eliminated by welding  
or bolting a piece of metal over the opening. Where this is prohibited  
by a strict building code, a variance is often granted in a high-crime  
area. A less desirable modification is to install a heavy steel grille  
over the opening and replace the glass with Lexan.  
Interlocks are more commonly vandalized on swing-door elevators.  
Causes of damage are excessive pulling on the elevator door while the  
cab is at another floor and short-circuiting due to water or urine dam-  
age. The latter problem can be solved by installing interlocks with  
hydrophilic \(non-water-absorbing\) contacts. When damaged, this  
type of interlock requires replacement of only the contact plates rather  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1425* Specialties  
SECURITY  
Doors and Hardware  
than the entire mechanism. Damage caused by excessive pulling may  
be alleviated by signs cautioning tenants against such pulling. Closing  
mechanisms \(keepers\) can be made to fit more securely when the bolt  
is in place to prevent too much play in the door.  
The emergency stop button presents a problem because it is often  
misused. The button may be activated to stop the elevator between  
floors to commit crimes such as mugging, rape, and drug abuse.  
Because every elevator has several automatic safety mechanisms that  
prevent it from falling freely down the shaft, the stop button is pri-  
marily a psychological comfort to passengers. Wherever possible,  
the stop button should be eliminated. The building code requirement  
for stop buttons is being challenged in New York and several other  
cities. If code change is unlikely, a variance should be applied for  
where elevator crime is common. A constant-pressure alarm switch is  
also somewhat better than the conventional toggle switch.  
Secer Light and Kendall are among the manufacturers of elevator  
dome lights that are highly vandal resistant \(see Fig. 47\). They are  
constructed of durable steel and contain a shatterproof plastic plate to  
protect the bulb. Where use of these lights is economically prohibi-  
tive, Lexan or an equivalent should be used to protect the light bulb.  
Aside from vandalism, joyriding on top of elevator cabs is becoming  
prevalent in high-crime areas. Injury occurs most often when chil-  
dren are struck by the counterweight when the cab and counterweight  
pass each other. In other cases, children are crushed between cabs,  
struck by dividing beams, or squashed under a cab in the pit.  
There are numerous means of access to elevator roofs and shafts\:  
door interlocks are jammed by using simple household tools, emer-  
gency stop switches are abused, and roof escape hatch doors are  
forced. Once on top, children often abuse passengers inside the cabs  
and interfere with normal elevator operation.  
It is difficult to prevent crime by modifying elevator equipment.  
Restricted access to the building through the use of a buzzer-reply  
system, tenant patrol groups, or doormen is more likely to be effec-  
tive. Closed-circuit television and audio-intercom systems mounted  
on elevators are other possible crime control devices.  
A common device used to increase visibility in an elevator is a con-  
vex mirror placed in the upper back corner of the elevator. This  
allows a person to see if anyone is waiting inside the elevator *before*  
Fig. 47 Unbreakable light fixture  
*1426*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
Fig. 48 Elevator mirror  
he or she walks into a possible assault situation \(see Fig. 48\).  
An elevator modification that may deter crime is the up-discharge,  
down-collect system. When controlled in this way, an elevator will  
stop only for a person who has selected “up” \(discharge\) at the  
ground-floor level. Passengers on the upper floor can enter the ele-  
vator only on its way down \(collect\). The advantage is that a person  
entering the elevator on the first floor can be assured that the eleva-  
tor will not stop at another floor to allow a suspicious person to enter.  
Such a system may be inconvenient for residents—a person wishing  
to go from the fifth to the seventh floor would have to travel down to  
the ground floor and then up again. The system is far from foolproof,  
as criminals can operate in other ways, but the modification is inex-  
pensive and may deter crime in buildings without security personnel.  
*Garage Doors and Secondary Entries*  
Doors to interior garages provide a means of entry that circumvents  
many security precautions. If access to the building is to be limited,  
entry through the garage door must be carefully controlled.  
The most practical solution is to have a locked door which tenants  
can open but which automatically closes behind them, usually within  
15 seconds. A large number of manufacturers provide such self-  
closing doors. The major variation is the means for opening the  
garage door. Radio-controlled devices, requiring each auto to have a  
transistor, are expensive and far from foolproof. If a device is stolen  
from one car, all the devices should be replaced \(an expensive proce-  
dure\). A convenient and less elaborate system has a key-operated  
switch mounted on the driver’s side of the garage, allowing the driver  
to use a key without leaving his car.  
Despite these controls, the garage door should be monitored by ten-  
ants, security personnel, or electronic equipment if a building is to  
retain a high level of security. A door leading directly from a parking area to the building interior  
must be treated the same as a main entry. Such a door will be used  
continually and requires equivalent security measures.  
The secondary lock recommended for storage rooms containing  
valuables is the Fox double-bar lock.  
*Mailboxes and Mailbox Rooms*  
Mailboxes are a major target for criminals within multifamily  
dwellings, particularly in low-income communities. The mail includes  
welfare, social security, and veterans’ checks as well as others. These  
checks are particularly vulnerable because they arrive on set days of  
the month.  
The bank of mailboxes should be located in the most secure and eas-  
ily surveyed space available. Some brands of mailboxes do provide  
security, but any mailbox can be opened in the 10 minutes required to  
force open the door. If there is any control of access to the building  
\(intercom or doorman\), mailboxes should be located inside the pro-  
tected area.  
Mailboxes may be located in a locked room. Such a room must con-  
tain a large window to make it visible from the lobby, and be lighted  
24 hours a day to reduce its potential as a location for muggings and  
other crimes. The door to a mailbox room should have sturdy self-  
locking hardware. Where back-loading mailboxes \(generally secure\)  
are used, a separate mail-loading room is often provided \(see Fig. 49\).  
The better mailboxes are constructed of 16-gauge metal. The doors  
are tightly fitted and are without holes, to prevent prying them open  
and to prevent matches from being dropped in. The metal may be  
corrugated for additional strength. Cylinder locks with at least five  
pins should be used. Door size should be kept to a minimum to fur-  
ther limit the possibility of prying doors open \(see Fig. 50\). American  
and Gorth manufacture such mailboxes.  
# LIGHTING  
Good lighting in a residential development permits adequate visibil-  
ity and surveillance. Generally, the higher the lighting level, the bet-  
ter the security. An appropriate level of lighting should be provided  
Fig. 49 Mailroom and loading room Specialties  
SECURITY  
Lighting  
in each area, the light should be without excessive glare and generate  
no heavy shadows, and lighting should be resistant to vandalism and  
easy to maintain.  
Fluorescent lamps are tubular glass lights that require special current-  
control devices called *ballasts.* Operating costs of fluorescent lamps  
are significantly lower than for incandescent bulbs\: fluorescent tubes  
typically produce 3 to 4 times as much light per watt and operate 7 to  
10 times longer than incandescent bulbs \(due in part to lower operat-  
ing temperatures\).  
# Interior Lighting  
Lobbies, elevators, stairwells, and corridors must be well lit. Interior  
lighting normally requires only conventional incandescent bulbs, but  
low-glare or frosted incandescent or fluorescent luminaries are  
preferable. Low wattages of 25 to 200 W generally suffice. It is usu-  
ally desirable to install low-wattage fixtures at close intervals to min-  
imize shadows and glare.  
The most common problem of interior lighting is vandalism. Naked  
bulbs provide maximum illumination at minimal installation cost,  
but they are so often and so easily broken that maintenance costs are  
very high, and crime is encouraged by lack of lights. Recessed light-  
ing suffers less from accidental breakage and vandalism. Transparent  
bulb protectors allow nearly total passage of light, but since the bulb  
can be seen, a vandal will likely try to break it. Translucent bulb cov-  
ers are therefore preferable, even though some of the light is blocked  
by the cover.  
Secer and Kendall have developed fixtures that are vandal resistant.  
They are made of plastic and come in a variety of shapes and sizes.  
# Exterior Lighting  
All heavily used spaces such as paths, entries, and parking areas  
Fig. 50 Mailboxes  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1427* Specialties  
SECURITY  
Electronic Systems  
should be lit by 5 to 10 foot candles. Higher fixture locations have a  
variety of advantages. As a general rule, the useful ground coverage  
of an elevated light fixture is roughly twice the height of the fixture.  
Thus, a 150-W incandescent lamp mounted 8 ft above the ground can  
provide adequate light for 16 ft along a walk. Higher luminaries are  
safer from vandalism. However, lighting fixtures mounted higher  
than the second floor may create a feeling of being in a compound.  
A variety of specialized, high-intensity light sources can illuminate  
large outdoor areas such as recreation facilities and parking lots.  
Mercury-vapor and sodium-vapor lamps are available in sizes up to  
1500 W; the eerie bluish light of early mercury-vapor lamps may be  
avoided by selecting one of the newer, color-corrected models. Once  
again, the point is to provide an appropriate level of light without cre-  
ating glare or shadows.  
Lamp and fixture breakage can be controlled in part by installing fix-  
tures of tough, break-resistant plastic. The spherical, white glass fix-  
tures so common today are less vulnerable, though not as tough as  
the more expensive plastic models.  
A final comment on lighting is specifically relevant to a building or  
residential development inhabited primarily by the elderly. The pupil  
in the human eye gradually decreases in size due to advancing age.  
As a result, about twice as much actual brightness is required to cre-  
ate the same degree of brightness on the retina of a 60-year-old as on  
the retina of a 20-year-old \(the ratio reaches 3 by age 75\). Therefore,  
lighting levels in residences for the elderly should be well in excess  
of conventional standards and much higher than what seems ade-  
quate to a \(younger\) management staff.  
# ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS  
Electronic security equipment includes alarms designed to detect  
unauthorized entrance; closed-circuit television systems, apartment-  
to-lobby intercom locks, and various audio equipment. While the ini-  
tial cost of many of these systems is high, each could reasonably be  
installed in moderate-income residential complexes and could pre-  
vent future need for more costly measures.  
# Alarms  
An alarm performs two functions\: it detects the presence of an  
Fig. 52 Lock alarm.  
Fig. 53 Ultrasonic detector  
intruder, and it reports the intrusion. The quality of an alarm mecha-  
nism is measured by its ability to perform these two functions.  
A wide range of devices detect intrusion of a criminal into a building.  
These fall roughly into two categories\: contact devices and motion-  
detection devices.  
*Contact Devices*  
Contact devices are mechanical switches that detect movement or  
perhaps the breakage of glass. A common type consists of a contact  
on the door \(or window\) and a contact on the frame. When the door  
is closed, the two contacts form part of an electrical circuit. When the  
door is opened, the contact is broken, the circuit is opened, and the  
alarm circuit is activated \(see Fig. 51\). A similar device, called a  
*string-pull alarm,* employs a slight variation in that the opening of  
the door pulls a string, which closes a switch that trips the alarm.  
Many contact devices are purely mechanical \(as just described\),  
while others include magnetic and mercury switches.  
Usefulness of a contact depends on its sensitivity \(how much the  
device can be jarred without being activated\) and its reliability. Most  
situations call for a device sufficiently sensitive that a skilled burglar  
cannot enter without setting off the alarm, but not so delicate that  
innocent jostling will disturb it.  
Fig. 51 Contact switch on door  
*1428*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design* Foil strips are a related mechanism used primarily to detect breakage  
of glass in windows and doors. A delicate strip of metal foil is glued  
or taped to the glass. The foil strip acts as one long, continuous elec-  
trical circuit. If the glass is broken, the foil is broken, which inter-  
rupts the circuit and activates the alarm. Foil can be circumvented if  
it is possible to break the glass or release a lock without breaking the  
foil. Primarily because of their unattractiveness, foil strips are sel-  
dom installed in residences.  
Contact devices can be made part of a lock mechanism \(see Fig. 52\).  
This type of alarm is set off whenever an attempt is made to force or  
pick the lock.  
Contact devices themselves are very inexpensive; a simple magnetic  
contact pair costs about \$2. But each contact device can protect only  
one opening; therefore, even a single-family house requires several  
devices to protect all points of entry. In addition, it is often expensive  
to install the alarms and connect them to an alarm-reporting device.  
Contacts may be hidden so criminals cannot locate and dismantle  
them easily. Hiding an alarm system lessens its value as a deterrent,  
but increases the criminal’s chances of being apprehended while  
committing a crime. Since deterrence is the primary goal of residen-  
tial security efforts, it is quite common to advertise the existence of  
an alarm without revealing the location of the mechanisms. This  
advertising is sometimes done where no alarm system exists. Con-  
sidering the minimal expense involved in such a ruse, it may be  
worth the cost, but even very unsophisticated criminals can pick out  
such fake systems.  
Heat-sensitive devices are sometimes combined with contact  
switches to provide an inexpensive fire-security alarm system.  
*Motion-Detection Devices*  
These devices detect the motion of an intruder as he or she moves  
about the protected space. This detection can be accomplished in a  
variety of ways. Seismographic devices are turned on by vibrations or  
weight on the floor \(these devices have been perfected so they are not  
triggered by a passing truck\). Photoelectric cells \(“seeing-eye” mecha-  
nisms\) use a beam of light to detect any motion across a protected  
span. Ultrasonic devices send inaudible sound waves through a room  
\(see Fig. 53\). Movement by an intruder changes the pattern of reflected  
sound waves and thus triggers an alarm. Increased sensitivity improves  
the effectiveness of each of these systems, but also raises their costs.  
Motion detectors are far more expensive than contact devices, but  
one motion device can protect an entire area, regardless of the num-  
ber of points of entry. Installation costs are often minimal, as the  
detection device need not be connected to any part of the structure.  
Motion detectors are most useful in spaces not used during scheduled  
periods of time, such as in commercial establishments which are  
totally empty at night and in homes left empty during vacation. More  
expensive motion-detection devices can protect limited areas, such  
as a single door or window.  
*Alarm-Reporting Systems*  
The term “alarm-reporting system” describes the mechanism that  
receives the message of an intrusion and reacts. Essentially, there are  
only two kinds of alarm-reporting systems. Intrusion is reported  
either by a loud alarm on the premises \(called a *local alarm*\) or via  
wires to a security force, which is prepared to react when notified  
Specialties  
SECURITY  
Electronic Systems  
Fig. 54 Local alarm  
\(called a *central alarm* or *silent alarm*\).  
A local alarm has a bell or buzzer connected to the intrusion device,  
which produces a loud audio signal on the premises when the alarm  
is activated. This is the simplest type of alarm and can be installed  
readily. The deterrent effect is dependent on the burglar’s being  
intimidated and driven off immediately by the noise. Noise of the  
local alarm can also stop a crime in progress and aid in apprehension  
if someone responds to the alarm. Local alarms are often operated by  
batteries \(see Fig. 54\). Instead of an alarm being sounded, lights in  
the building can be turned on by an alarm system, or both lights and  
alarm can be activated.  
This local system also protects people sleeping in a house by alerting  
them that a break-in is being attempted. Generally, keys are required  
to shut off local alarms.  
A central alarm-reporting system sounds an alarm at a remote point  
usually connected to the detection device by wires \(telephone lines  
are used in many cases\). The remote point is sometimes the residence  
of the owner of a protected business establishment and sometimes  
the local police station, but generally it is the headquarters of a pri-  
vate protective agency. These agencies have guards stationed at this  
headquarters who will respond to the alarm signal. Usefulness of the  
alarm system is dependent on the speed and reliability of the  
response.  
A local alarm signal is often activated at the same time as a central  
alarm, thus simultaneously frightening the criminal and alerting the  
authorities. If only a central alarm-reporting system is activated, the  
criminal is not warned that an alarm has been sent. This system  
\(called a *silent alarm*\) increases the possibility of apprehension while  
eliminating the possibility of driving the intruder off with noise.  
A variation on this central-alarm arrangement is to utilize regular city  
police to respond to the central alarm. In high-income, low-density,  
high-burglary-risk communities, the city police allow alarms to be  
hooked up to the police headquarters, where the dispatcher serves as  
monitor. Another arrangement is for the detection device to trigger a  
tape-recorded message that is automatically telephoned to the police,  
telling them the location of a burglary in progress.  
The single major problem of all alarm systems is the possibility of  
false alarms. They can be caused by defects in the intrusion-detection  
device or the reporting system. False alarms diminish the credibility  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1429* Specialties  
SECURITY  
Electronic Systems  
of the entire system.  
If neighbors experience repeated false alarms, if security guards are  
called out unnecessarily, or if police are accidentally telephoned a  
tape-recorded message, response by all of these persons slows dra-  
matically and will eventually cease. Thus, the intrusion device must  
be designed so that it is not accidentally activated by noncriminal  
occurrences.  
Related to the false alarm issue is the question of how the alarm is  
turned off. The most common method is for the alarm to operate after  
a 20-second delay; that is, the alarm will not sound for 20 seconds  
after a contact is broken or motion detected, allowing the resident a  
brief period in which to switch off the entire system. The switch can  
be simply a button located in a hidden place. A key-operated switch  
is more secure, but the possibility of false alarms increases because  
residents often forget or cannot locate their keys. However, the  
turnoff mechanism should not be so simple or accessible that the  
criminal can activate it.  
*Selecting Alarm Systems*  
The security alarm business is large and complex. It is therefore  
impossible to specify manufacturers or even types of alarm systems  
for general use. The quality of installation and the maintenance pro-  
gram that backs up the system are crucial elements that should out-  
weigh initial price in the selection of equipment. The best advice is to  
deal with firms that have a verifiable history of quality installation, a  
reliable guarantee/warranty record, and an established repair and  
maintenance program.  
The concept of a consistent level of security avoids excessive expen-  
ditures for one piece of equipment while other means of entry are  
unprotected. Equipment characteristics should fit specific installa-  
tion situations. It is often difficult to install contact switches in older  
houses because window frames often have warped or buckled.  
String-pull devices have to be set from the inside and therefore can-  
not be used for a normal exit door.  
Selection of alarm equipment should be based on specific system  
characteristics desired\: Is deterrence of crime or apprehension of  
criminals the primary goal? Should the system be visible to deter  
attempted burglary, or should it be hidden to increase the likelihood  
of apprehending a burglar?

# Closed-Circuit Television  
When used in residential settings, closed-circuit television \(CCTV\)  
is intended to provide “electronic windows”—that is, a visual sur-  
veillance where physical design has obviated unaided surveillance.  
The purpose is to create an environment in which residents know that  
normal restraints of surveillance by citizens and their authorized  
agents exist, albeit aided by electronics. While initially costly, CCTV  
often reduces security personnel requirements or obviates the need  
for expensive redesign of existing structures.  
Electronically aided surveillance is not equal to personal surveillance.  
A corrective response to a detected crime is obviously a step further  
away if the viewer sees the crime on a TV receiver rather than on the  
spot. The deterrent of having police or another person on hand is lost.  
There is also the possibility of equipment malfunction. But CCTV has  
a quality of its own\: being watched while unable to ascertain who, if  
anyone, is doing the watching is somehow unnerving, and definitely  
is a deterrent. A remotely controlled surveillance camera can be fitted  
with an automatic panning device so that the camera swings from side  
to side continuously, even when no one is monitoring the system.  
*CCTV System Requirements*  
In general, a CCTV system should perform at approximately the  
same level as commercial broadcast receivers. Specific equipment  
and the quality of image needed are determined by characteristics of  
the area under surveillance, schedules of operation, makeup of the  
monitoring staff and their expected responses to emergencies, and  
use of special equipment.  
American and foreign manufacturers have TV cameras suitable for  
security work. All equipment should meet the standards of the Elec-  
tronic Industries Association for CCTV. Service and maintenance are  
generally more difficult and expensive than installation; therefore,  
the capability and reputation of a local supplier is crucial. City police  
or traffic departments often have had experience with manufacturers,  
suppliers, and maintenance operations. To encourage reliance on the  
system by users and to prevent criminals from taking advantage of a  
lapse, the CCTV system should break down as infrequently as possi-  
ble and be repaired quickly in the event of a breakdown.  
Picture resolution depends primarily on camera quality and lighting  
levels; higher lighting levels permit the use of less sensitive, less  
expensive cameras.  
The entire system should operate unattended. This requires electron-  
ically stable equipment—meaning, for example, that no one should  
be required to constantly adjust the lens of the camera.  
It is difficult to project costs of CCTV systems because of the variety  
of system sizes and configurations and the range of equipment costs.  
Camera prices start as low as \$200, but more sophisticated models,  
such as those sensitive to very low light levels, cost up to \$10,000  
each. Complicated accessories, including zoom lenses, remote pan  
\(side-to-side movement\) and tilt \(up-and-down movement\) mecha-  
nisms, and low-light equipment, can increase installation and main-  
tenance costs tremendously. The cost of monitoring equipment can  
be as low as the cost of a conventional television receiver, but more  
specialized and sensitive equipment is far more expensive.  
*Camera Locations* The location of a CCTV camera and the light level at that point are  
key cost-effectiveness factors. A camera’s location defines the area to  
be observed by the camera, and the nature of the location greatly  
influences the camera’s vulnerability to theft and vandalism. Avail-  
able lighting dictates the type of camera needed to produce a final  
image of adequate quality. Of course, supplemental lighting may be  
provided at additional cost.  
The camera must be able to view an area that is significant in terms of  
crime control. Wide-angle or other special lenses should be avoided  
by choosing a different camera location. Most important, the camera  
itself must be protected from theft and vandalism. This means that the  
body and lens of the camera should be in an inaccessible place. A mir-  
ror is often used to reflect the image into the lens, so that the expen-  
sive lens will not be broken by pointed instruments, thrown objects, or  
bullets \(see Fig. 55\). All interior cameras should be placed inside  
sturdy housings which are installed with tamper-proof connectors.  
Cameras must be accessible for maintenance and repair, however.  
A number of locations meet all of these requirements. An elevator in  
a high-rise building is often protected by CCTV. The camera is gen-  
erally mounted on the outside of the elevator cab wall so that the  
image passes via a mirror in a corner of the elevator to the protected  
lens. In case of camera failure, the elevator must be stopped so that  
the camera maintenance person can step onto the top of the cab and  
reach over the side to repair the units. This is not overly inconvenient  
for repairpersons, but it does make access to the camera more diffi-  
cult for a potential thief.  
Building lobbies are another common location of interior cameras.  
Lobby cameras are commonly hung from the ceiling or recessed into  
the ceiling. The elevated locations require that repair personnel use a  
ladder. Use of a ladder, however, would make a thief very conspicuous.  
Outdoor locations usually depend on inaccessibility to protect equip-  
ment from theft and vandalism. Cameras are located atop steel poles  
or on poles extending from roofs or walls. An alternative is to place  
the camera in a wall or window of an accessible apartment.  
*Lighting for CCTV Systems*  
Lighting plays a key role in the cost and effectiveness of a CCTV  
system. For camera locations inside buildings, it is almost always  
less expensive to raise the light level than to use low-light-level  
equipment. The required lighting level is only slightly higher than  
normal for building interiors, can be achieved without glare, and has  
an intrinsic value as a crime deterrent.  
Exterior lighting can be very expensive. Cameras used outdoors are  
almost always more flexible and sensitive, being capable of adapting  
to full sun, cloudiness, and dusk. But as indicated earlier, camera  
costs rise dramatically for low-light-level equipment. While increas-  
ing of lighting levels is also expensive, well-designed extra lighting  
again has an intrinsic value as a crime deterrent.  
*Monitoring of CCTV Systems*  
The effectiveness of CCTV depends on the nature and quality of  
monitoring. Many people may be used as monitors\: city police, proj-  
ect security personnel, members of organized tenant patrols, tenants  
acting as individuals, and various combinations of these groups. The  
choice depends principally on availability of personnel and their  
monitoring costs.  
Specialties  
SECURITY  
Electronic Systems  
City police will monitor CCTV systems only if they believe it is the  
most efficient use of personnel. Thus an area being surveyed must  
suffer large numbers of crimes to warrant hiring police or civilians  
whose function is simply sitting, watching, and adjusting. Crime  
reduction or criminal apprehension through CCTV monitoring  
would have to be substantial to justify continued use of such person-  
nel. Police use of CCTV systems is generally limited to shopping dis-  
tricts and city-center areas. Police normally monitor large systems  
that include several cameras \(each equipped with pan, tilt, and zoom  
capability\) and a monitoring console, so that the viewer can watch  
activity in several places at once and adjust the equipment to con-  
centrate on a particular place, incident, or individual.  
Commercial and industrial facilities often hire private security person-  
nel to monitor CCTV systems. Guards are used less frequently in resi-  
dential complexes. The major advantage of using guards is that a  
single guard can control several entrances to a building or complex of  
buildings. Usually the guard can see all entrance doors, the lobby, and  
the elevator interiors on the monitor screens. The guard can be given  
audio contact with the lobby area. With the use of an intercom system,  
the guard can also control garage and front door entrances, and can  
also be given the ability to stop the elevator in midflight. Thus the  
security guard can see and hear every person entering the premises,  
prevent them from entering, and even exert some control after they  
enter.  
It is also possible to staff a monitoring panel with members of tenant  
patrols. Use of volunteer personnel eliminates payment of guard  
salaries. Because they are personally acquainted with the project res-  
idents, tenant monitors can easily pick out strangers and perhaps dis-  
tinguish a minor argument among friends from an impending fight.  
But, there are serious drawbacks in using tenant monitors. It is diffi-  
cult to guarantee the performance of unpaid people. The novelty of  
working with TV monitors will wear off quickly, and declining inter-  
est increases the likelihood of patrol members simply not showing  
up. Additionally, tenant patrol members are not equipped or empow-  
ered to take much action. The tenant monitoring the CCTV has no  
real authority over police or security personnel. Finally, there is the  
problem of tenant patrol members using their position to harass or  
intimidate other tenants.  
An alternative is in-apartment tenant monitoring. Tenants of a building  
or housing project can monitor CCTV on their home TV screens. By  
connecting CCTV equipment to a master antenna within a building,  
tenants can have the option of tuning in to unused TV channels to mon-  
itor lobby, elevator, playground, or parking lot activity. Tenants may  
watch CCTV when they are expecting someone to arrive, or when a  
child is playing within viewing range of a camera in a playground area.  
Older people may watch for less specific reasons. Obviously, this does  
not ensure continuous monitoring, but if one or more of 200 tenants is  
watching, it would be risky for intruders to take chances.  
An in-apartment tenant monitoring system requires that a cable TV  
or master antenna system be in operation in the building. CCTV is  
clearly most suited to large high-rise dwellings. Picture quality of the  
CCTV systems should be comparable to that of commercial broad-  
casting to promote tenant usage. While some picture disintegration  
may be acceptable in a conventionally monitored CCTV system,  
there should be no distortion in a system designed for in-apartment  
monitoring. It is desirable \(and generally not expensive\) to install a  
microphone system so that sound accompanies the TV picture, which  
makes the system more interesting and enjoyable.  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1431* Specialties  
SECURITY  
Electronic Systems  
It is possible to organize a voluntary in-apartment monitoring pro-  
gram to improve coverage. A tenant organization could arrange for  
persons to watch CCTV in their homes during specified hours. Such  
a scheduled system would promote better coverage and facilitate par-  
ticipation because there would be no requirement that residents leave  
their apartments.  
Also, CCTV monitors should be placed where responsible individu-  
als, such as management staff and patrolling guards, are at work or  
pass by continually.  
# Intercom Systems  
Most urban multifamily dwellings are equipped with buzzer-reply  
systems to limit access to the building to tenants and to people who  
have been interviewed by tenants on an intercom system. A typical  
buzzer-reply intercom system in an apartment building functions as  
follows. A panel located outside the lobby entrance door lists the  
names and apartment numbers of all tenants in the building. Next to  
each tenant’s name is a call button that, when pressed, rings a bell or  
buzzer within that tenant’s apartment. The tenant responds to the call  
by walking to a panel mounted on the wall of his apartment and  
speaking via an intercom system to the person outside the door.  
When identification is satisfactorily established, the tenant pushes a  
button on the panel, which momentarily allows the entrance door to  
be opened without a key. Because the costs involved in installing  
wiring for such a system in an existing building are very high,  
buzzer-reply systems should be installed in all new buildings during  
the construction phase.  
A modified version of the traditional buzzer-reply system has  
recently come into use. Local telephone companies install and serv-  
ice front-door intercom systems that use existing telephone wires  
instead of a separately wired system. The panel mounted outside the  
lobby door differs from a conventional panel in that it is supplied  
with a telephone receiver, and the list of residents has a three-digit  
number next to each name. A person wishing to enter the building  
dials the appropriate three-digit number, which makes the phone of  
the tenant buzz \(not ring\). The tenant then speaks with the person  
over the phone. If recognition is established, the tenant dials “4” to  
open the front door. If a tenant is speaking on the phone when the  
buzzer sounds, he or she can depress the receiver once, speak to the  
person in the lobby, buzz the visitor in by dialing “4,” and then  
depress the receiver again to return to the initial telephone conversa-  
tion. For tenants without telephones, a special unit that can be used  
only for the intercom can be installed. Fees for installation and serv-  
ice are billed by the phone company and added to the tenants’  
monthly rent.  
# Elevator Audio Systems  
Use of audio systems in elevators is rapidly increasing. An elevator  
audio system is an uncomplicated sound transmission installation  
consisting of a microphone and speaker located in the elevator cab  
and connected to similar devices near the elevator doors on each  
floor. The system allows someone inside the elevator to speak to any-  
one standing in the elevator waiting area, and vice versa. In office  
buildings or high-income residential buildings, an additional connec-

# COLOR THEORY  
**Primary colors** The longest extended slices on the color wheel  
\(Fig. 1\) show the three primary colors\: red, yellow, and blue. They’re  
called *primary* because all the other colors come from combinations  
of these three colors.  
**Secondary colors** Mix any two primary colors and you get the *sec-*  
*ondary* colors\: orange \(red and yellow\), violet \(red and blue\), and  
green \(blue and yellow\).  
**Tertiary colors** All of the other six colors on the wheel are called  
*tertiary,* or intermediate, colors. They are a mixture of the primary  
colors plus an adjacent secondary color. Thus\:  
Yellow orange \(yellow and orange\)  
Yellow green \(yellow and green\)  
Blue green \(blue and green\)  
Blue violet \(blue and violet\)  
Red violet \(red and violet\)  
Red orange \(red and orange\)  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1433* Specialties  
COLOR THEORY  
Basic Color-Scheme Planning  
Color has three dimensions\: the *hue,* distinguishing one color from  
another—such as red, green, blue, and so on; the *value,* denoting  
lightness or darkness; and the *tone* or *intensity,* which is the bright-  
ness or dullness.  
These hues, values, and intensities can appear to change when differ-  
ent ones are used together. Two or more light values combined afford  
little contrast, nor will darker values in combination provide much  
interest. But when a light value is used with a dark, the light appears  
lighter while the dark appears darker. White is the lightest of all col-  
ors, and values range from it through varying gradations of gray to  
black. Colors that are nearer white in value are called *tints* and colors  
that are closer to black in value are called *shades.*  
Intensities or tones also have similar effects. A brightly upholstered  
chair will appear brighter and will stand out when used with a carpet  
of dull color, as it will produce a spot of interest. In contrast, a few  
dull-colored pieces of furniture will sink into the background if the  
room contains brighter-colored rugs, draperies, and other furnishings.  
Contrasting or opposite hues will emphasize one another. Red with  
green will make the red look redder and the green appear more  
orange, while the red-purple will take on a bluish tone.  
There are many ways of combining colors for interest. Related color  
schemes such as reds, purples, and blues together can produce very  
pleasing effects. Contrasting hues, such as blues with oranges, can  
also be combined to give more vibrant results.  
Some people enjoy excitement. Warm colors such as yellow, orange,  
and red are exciting because they are associated with things like sun-  
shine, fire, heat, and even blood. Warm colors tend to advance, and a  
predominantly warm-colored wall will seem to come forward. They  
are especially effective in rooms that are on the east or north side of  
a house, because light entering from those directions seems to be  
cool light. The warm colors and cool light complement each other  
and make the room seem cozier and warmer.  
Cool colors are those associated with water, verdure, and the sky—  
blues, greens, and violets. These tend to recede, and under most con-  
ditions, light, cool-colored walls will create an illusion of greater  
space. They are good choices for rooms on the south and west sides  
of the house, since these areas receive a lot of sunlight all year  
around. Theirs is a cooling effect in the warm-light areas, another  
complementary association.  
Black, white, gray, and brown—and the tones of the latter two,  
known as griege and beige—are not considered to be colors so much  
as *neutrals.* In practice, they are the “no-color” colors, which are  
used with other colors to modify them or to contrast with them. But  
they are far from being negative. As you work with color, you will  
find that all colors are influenced by the company they keep. This is  
particularly true of the tints, shades, and so-called neutral colors. A  
juxtaposition of two muted colors, such as a gray and a tan, will bring  
out latent greens, lavenders, and pinks you did not see before. Colors  
also have visual weights. Dark and bright appear heavy, while light  
or dull seem to weigh less. Remember that a dominant color is the  
one that controls a room, while the others are accents.  
# BASIC COLOR-SCHEME PLANNING  
Successful decorating often depends on how well the total effect is  
anticipated. Here are four types of schemes that professional decorators  
*1434*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
have in mind when they start to plan a job. They are no guarantee of  
perfect results, but they do make an unwieldy subject easier to handle.  
**Monochromatic** This scheme is built around one color, using it  
somewhere in its full intensity, and then varying it with a number of  
shades and tints of the same color. For example, in a monochromatic  
scheme of yellow, the range could be from dark shades of gold, through  
clear yellow, to light, pale-yellow tints. A monochromatic color scheme  
can be restful, can create a feeling of spaciousness, and provides a good  
background for art objects, collections, or similar decorations. But,  
generally, when employing a monochromatic color scheme, the inter-  
est of the room comes through by using a variety of textures and pat-  
terns.  
**Analogous or related** Because it’s the easiest color scheme to  
work with, an analogous scheme is the one that enjoys the greatest  
popularity at the present time. It is based on two or three colors, such  
as yellow, yellow orange, and red orange, that lie close to each other  
on the color wheel, with relief provided by tints and shades of the  
same that have been tinged with adjacent greens or vermilion. The  
analogous color scheme is restful and refreshing also, and the colors  
are more interesting because of their variations in intensity and  
value. It is the kind of color scheme that is easily changed; a slight  
shift of emphasis here and there is all that is necessary to completely  
change the character of the room.  
**Complementary or contrasting** This scheme, which is rapidly  
coming into favor, uses colors that are opposite each other on the  
color wheel—blue and orange, red and green, yellow and violet. One  
color is usually a primary color and the other a secondary color.  
Using such contrasting colors will give a lively and vibrant room, but  
it is a color scheme that must be used with caution. One color should  
always dominate, with the others being primarily dramatic accents.  
The shock impact of a complementary color scheme can be softened  
by selecting unexpected shades and tints of the two colors. That is, a  
vivid color and its complement can be quieted, if you prefer, by gray-  
ing them, or reducing their values. Employing a pair of opposites in  
this manner means that there will be both cool and warm colors in a  
room, which makes a complementary association. A complementary  
color scheme tends to make a room seem smaller.  
**Accented** This is a combination of adjacent, related, or analogous  
colors—call them what you will—accented by a bold touch of color  
from the opposite side of the wheel. An example would be a scheme  
ranging through a number of strong, soft, and grayed yellows, spiked  
with purple or violet.  
There are also other color schemes, such as *triad* and *split-*  
*complementary,* that you can adapt from the color wheel, but the four  
suggested here are the easiest to visualize and to carry out.  
In whatever basic scheme you use, do not forget the neutrals\: black,  
white, the grays, and browns—to which you might add metallic gold  
and silver. Since they will appear, of themselves, in the wood and  
metal of your furnishings, they must at all times be considered for the  
part they play in the total effect. If you wish, the neutrals can consti-  
tute a fifth, and very sophisticated, color scheme of their own. But  
usually they must be more or less just accepted and played up or  
played down by the colors you combine them with. Incidentally,  
some black and white is an asset to almost any color scheme, but too  
many and indefinite neutrals, used with stronger colors, tend to com-  
promise a color scheme and make it look confused or merely drab. It  
is best to think of any neutral as a distinctive note of color, whether it Specialties

# MUNSELL SYSTEM OF COLOR  
One of the best-known and widely respected systems of color stan-  
dardization used in the United States today is that developed by  
Albert H. Munsell. He became greatly interested in the practical  
application of color and was disturbed by the fact that the popular  
names for colors did not describe them adequately for professional  
purposes. They are named after flowers or plants, such as violet,  
indigo, old rose, primrose; after fruits, such as peach, pomegranate,  
grape, avocado, plum; after places, such as french blue, naples yel-  
low, or prussian blue; or after persons, such as Davy’s gray or  
Hooker’s green.  
Essentially the system consists of an orderly arrangement of colors in  
the shape of a three-dimensional color solid. The system is based on  
a color circle of 10 major hues made up of 5 principal hues \(red, yel-  
low, green, blue, and purple\) and 5 intermediate hues \(yellow-red,  
green-yellow, blue-green, purple-blue, and red-purple\). Each hue is  
indicated by a symbol as follows\:  
Red\: R  
Yellow\: Y  
Green\: G  
Blue\: B  
Purple\: P  
Yellow-red\: YR  
Green-yellow\: GY  
Blue-green\: BG  
Purple-blue\: PB  
Red-purple\: RP  
Each of the major hues has been given a value of 5 in the inner scale  
around the hue circle \(see Fig. 2, hue symbols\)\: 5 R, 5 YR, 5 Y, 5 GY,  
5 G, 5 BG, 5 B, 5 PB, 5 P, and 5 RP. Between each of the major hues  
are values of 2.5, 10, and 7.5 for rough indication of hue. The outer  
scale of the hue circuit is divided into 100 segments to provide  
greater accuracy for indicating hue where needed.  
In the Munsell color tree each hue \(H\) is allotted 10 segments of the  
hue circle, making 100 hues, and these hues form the horizontal cen-  
ter, or equator, of the color solid. The center segment of each color is  
considered the true color, and the remaining segments in each hue  
section vary according to their proximity to adjoining colors; for  
example, as red gets closer to yellow it contains more yellow, and  
this is indicated by the numerical designation.  
The value \(V\) notation denotes the lightness or darkness of a hue,  
which is determined by a neutral core at the center of the hue circle.  
The core contains 10 gradations from a supposedly perfect white  
\(one having 100 percent reflectance\) at the top to 0, a perfect black  
\(having 0 percent reflectance\) at the bottom.

COLOR THEORY  
Munsell System of Color

The chroma \(C\) notation indicates the saturation of the hue, or the  
strength of the color. The chroma scale extends outward from the  
central core or axis, and the increments vary from 0 at a neutral gray  
to as high as 16, according to the amount of saturation produced by a  
given hue at a given value level. Since colors vary in chroma, or sat-  
uration, some colors extend farther from the neutral axis than others,  
and the solid is therefore not symmetrical, Pure red, with a chroma of  
14, for instance, extends farther than blue-green, with a chroma of  
only 6 \(see Fig. 1\).  
A Munsell notation indicating hue, value, and chroma \(H V/C\) might  
be given as follows\:  
Vermilion\: 5R 5/14  
Rose\: 5R 5/4  
With this information it is possible to describe exactly any given hue  
and to locate its place in the color solid. Furthermore, as Munsell  
stated, one can “select one familiar color, and study what others will  
combine with it to please the eye,” by the use of three typical paths\:  
one vertical, with rapid change of value; another lateral, with rapid  
change of hue; and a third, inward, through the neutral center, to seek

Window Types  
Windows are available in many types, each having advantages. The  
principal types are double-hung, casement, stationary, awning, and  
horizontal sliding. They may be made of wood or metal. Heat loss  
through metal frames and sash is much greater than through similar  
wood units. Glass blocks are sometimes used for admitting light in  
places where transparency or ventilation is not re-quired.  
Insulated glass, used both for stationary and movable sash, consists  
of two or more sheets of spaced glass with hermetically sealed edges.  
This type has more resistance to heat loss than a single thickness and  
is often used without a storm sash.

*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design* Wood sash and door and window frames should be made from a clear  
grade of all-heartwood stock of a decay-resistant wood species or  
from wood which is given a preservative treatment. Species com-  
monly used include ponderosa and other pines, the cedars, cypress,  
redwood, and the spruces.  
# Double-Hung Windows  
The double-hung window is perhaps the most familiar window type.  
It consists of an upper and lower sash that slide vertically in separate  
grooves in the side jambs or in full-width metal weatherstripping.  
This type of window provides a maximum face opening for ventila-  
tion of one-half the total window area. Each sash is provided with  
springs, balances, or *compression weatherstripping* to hold it in place  
in any location. Compression weatherstripping, for example, pre-  
vents air infiltration, provides tension, and acts as a counterbalance;  
several types allow the sash to be removed for easy painting or repair.  
The *jambs* \(sides and top of the frames\) are made of nominal 1-in  
lumber; the width provides for use with drywall or plastered interior  
finish. Sills are made from nominal 2-in lumber and sloped at about  
3 in 12 for good drainage. Sash is normally 13⁄8 in thick and wood  
combination storm and screen windows are usually 11⁄8 in thick.  
Sash may be divided into a number of lights by small wood members  
called *muntins.* A ranch-type house may provide the best appearance,  
with top and bottom sash divided into two horizontal lights. A colo-  
nial or Cape Cod house usually has each sash divided into six or eight  
lights. Some manufacturers provided preassembled dividers which  
snap in place over a single light, dividing it into six or eight lights.  
This simplifies painting and other maintenance.  
Assembled frames are placed in the rough opening over strips of  
building paper put around the perimeter to minimize air infiltration.  
The frame is plumbed and nailed to side studs and header through the  
casings or the blind at the sides. Where nails are exposed, such as on  
the casing, use the corrosion-resistant type.  
Hardware for double-hung windows includes the sash lifts that are  
fastened to the bottom rail, although they are sometimes eliminated  
by providing a finger groove in the rail. Other hardware consists of  
sash locks or fasteners located at the meeting rail. They not only lock  
the window, but draw the sash together to provide a windtight fit.  
Double-hung windows can be arranged in a number of ways—as a  
single unit, doubled \(or mullion\) type, or in groups of three or  
more. One or two double-hung windows on each side of a large,  
stationary, insulated window are often used to effect a window  
wall. Such large openings must be framed with headers large  
enough to carry roofloads.  
# Casement Windows  
*Casement windows* consist of side-hinged sash, usually designed to  
swing outward because this type can be made more weathertight than  
the inswinging style. Screens are located inside these outswinging  
windows, and winter protection is obtained with a storm sash or by  
using insulated glass in the sash. One advantage of the casement win-  
dow over the double-hung type is that the entire window area can be  
opened for ventilation.  
Weatherstripping is also provided for this type of window, and units  
are usually received from the factory entirely assembled with hard-

ware in place. Closing hardware consists of a rotary operator and  
sash lock. As in the double-hung units, casement sash can be used in  
a number of ways—as a pair or in combinations of two or more pairs.  
Style variations are achieved by divided lights. Snap-in muntins pro-  
vided a small, multiple-pane appearance for traditional styling.  
Metal sash is sometimes used but, because of low insulating value,  
should be installed carefully to prevent condensation and frosting on  
the interior surfaces during cold weather. A full storm-window unit is  
sometimes necessary to eliminate this problem in cold climates.  
# Stationary Windows  
Stationary windows used alone or in combination with double-hung  
or casement windows usually consist of a wood sash with a large sin-  
gle light of insulated glass. They are designed to provide light, as  
well as for attractive appearance, and are fastened permanently into  
the frame. Because of their size \(sometimes 6 to 8 ft wide\), 13⁄4-in-  
thick sash is used to provide strength. The thickness is usually  
required because of the thickness of the insulating glass.

# Wood Trim  
The casing around the window frames on the interior of the house  
should be the same pattern as that used around the interior door  
frames. Other trim which is used for a double-hung window frame  
includes the sash stops, stool, and apron \(Fig. 7A\). Another method  
of using trim around windows has the entire opening enclosed with  
casing \(Fig. 7B\). The stool is then a filler member between the bot-  
tom sash rail and the bottom casing.  
The *stool* is the horizontal trim member that laps the window sill and  
extends beyond the casing at the sides, with each end notched against  
the plastered wall. The *apron* serves as a finish member below the  
stool. The window stool is the first piece of window trim to be  
installed and is notched and fitted against the edge of the jamb and  
the plaster line, with the outside edge being flush against the bottom  
rail of the window sash \(Fig. 7A\). The stool is blind-nailed at the  
ends so that the casing and the stop will cover the nailheads.  
Predrilling is usually necessary to prevent splitting. The stool should  
also be nailed at midpoint to the sill and to the apron with finishing  
nails. Face-nailing to the sill is sometimes substituted or supple-  
mented with toe-nailing of the outer edge to the sill \(Fig. 7A\).  
The casing is applied and nailed as described for door frames, except  
that the inner edge is flush with the inner face of the jambs so that the  
stop will cover the joint between the jamb and casing. The window  
stops are then nailed to the jambs so that the window sash slides  
smoothly. Channel-type weatherstripping often includes full-width  
metal subjambs into which the upper and lower sash slide, replacing  
the parting strip. Stops are located against these instead of the sash,  
to provide a small amount of pressure. The apron is cut to a length  
equal to the outer width of the casing line \(Fig. 7A\). It is nailed to the  
window sill and to the 2- by 4-in framing sill below.  
When casing is used to finish the bottom of the window frame as well  
as the sides and top, the narrow stool butts against the side window  
jamb. Casing is then mitered at the bottom corners \(Fig. 7B\) and  
nailed as previously described.  
# CURTAINS/DRAPERIES  
# Curtains  
Curtains are soft window coverings that generally are shirred \(gath-  
ered onto a rod\) or have headings attached to solid-wood rods, round  
or oval metal rods, or café rods rather than cord-operated traverse  
rods. Curtains may be either stationary fabric panels or slid open and  
closed by hand. They are flexible in that they can be short or long,  
layered or tiered, or used alone or in combination with other soft or

Cross sections\: A, head jamb; B, side jamb; C, sill  
Fig. 7 Installation of window trim\: A, with stool and  
apron; B, enclosed with casing  
with hard treatments. *Curtain* is traditionally a term for informal  
treatments, such as café curtains. However, curtains also may be  
quite formal, as are shirred and elegant tied-back fabric treatments.  
Even though curtains are generally thought to be shirred treat-  
ments, other headings might be included in this category. Indeed,  
there is a crossover of terminology between draperies and curtains.  
Generally draperies are installed on cord-operated traverse rods,  
although they may be stationary pleated panels. Curtains may be  
installed on traverse rods \(as in a pleated café curtain, for example\),  
and headings such as the pencil pleat, drawstring pencil pleat,  
shirred spaced pencil pleat, alternate pencil pleat, ruffled shirring  
tape heading, and smocked heading may be called either curtain or  
drapery treatments.  
# Draperies  
Draperies are made with pleats. They are hung with drapery hoods  
onto carriers of conventional, architectural, or decorative traverse  
rods or into the rings of wood rods or café curtain rods, or they may  
thread onto spring-system traverse rods. Generally draperies are  
either hung straight to the floor or tied back. Thus they operate, or  
*draw,* by opening and closing with a cord or a wand or by hand. The  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1459* Specialties  
WINDOW TREATMENTS  
Curtains/Draperies  
exception is tied-back draperies, which sometimes are let down at  
night. However, tied-back draperies are trained to tie back at an angle  
and therefore should not be handled to any extent. Draperies draw in  
a pair and meet in the center \(center-meet\) or draw one way from left  
to right or from right to left. One-way draw draperies require one-  
way traverse rods.  
Draperies that hang at a doorway rather than at a window are called  
*portières.* They may be pleated in any fashion or shirred. They may  
be placed on a traverse rod, but historically \(and they were used  
extensively in the Victorian era\), they were tied-back stationary pan-  
els made of a heavy fabric that were let down when privacy or insu-  
lation was needed.  
Draperies can be made of any fabric. The selection will depend on the  
style, use, and needs. Sheer fabrics do best as diffusers of glare and as  
providers of daytime privacy. Medium- to heavyweight fabrics are  
excellent choices for overdraperies and plain tieback draperies. Lin-  
ing fabrics are the right weight for privacy liners or underdraperies. If  
a drapery is given a ruffled edge or a banding, that trim should be a  
lightweight, semicrisp, flexible fabric, not a heavy, stiff fabric or a  
sheer, slippery fabric.

*1460*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design* **Decorative Rods**  
*Measuring for Most Windows*  
**Outside mount** Decorative rods should be mounted on the wall.  
Measure width of glass; if total glass exposure is desired, add for  
stackback \(see Table 4\). Rods should be hung so that drapery head-  
ings \(pleated tops of panels\) are at least 4 in above the glass, so they  
can’t be seen from the outside.  
*Figuring Stackback*  
Stackback is the amount of wall space needed if open panels are to  
clear the glass completely. This dimension, added to the window  
opening, gives you the proper rod length.  
Begin by measuring the window opening, then consult Table 4. Find  
your opening measurement and read across for the right rod length.

WINDOW TREATMENTS  
Guidelines  
*Measuring for Special Windows*  
**Sliding doors** from two- to one-way draw.  
Measure as for outside mounted rod. Convert rod  
**Corner and bay windows** Decorative rods may be used at these  
windows. However, it is best to consult your dealer or designer about  
the measuring.  
*Layered Treatments*  
Decorative traverse rods are often used for overtreatments. If the  
undertreatment is inside mounted or is an outside-mounted mini-  
blind, pleated shade, Romanette woven wood, or a café curtain, set  
the brackets for maximum clearance. Drapery returns will be 41⁄2 in.  
If you are using an undercurtain, you will want a utility curtain rod.  
It comes with its own bracket supports.  
If you are using underdraperies, double brackets are available. They  
hold both rods and automatically align the headings. Overdrapery  
returns will be 6 to 7 in.  
If using a decorative rod over an outside mounted vertical blind or a  
woven wood shade other than Romanette, special brackets are avail-  
able. Overdrapery returns will be 6 to 7 in.  
# Pleated Shades  
*Measuring for Most Windows*  
**Inside mount** Measure width at top, center, and bottom. Use nar-  
rowest measurement. Shades will be made narrower to slip inside  
easily. Measure length from inside top of opening to sill. A 15⁄8-in-  
deep recess is needed for flush mounting; 21⁄4 in for Duette in 3⁄4.  
**Outside mount** Measure width of opening. Add at least 11⁄2 in on  
each side for overlap. Measure from top of frame to sill or 11⁄2 in  
below opening if there is no sill. \(If brackets are to go above window  
frame, add an extra 11⁄2 in for bracket bases.\)  
**Ceiling mount** Measure desired width and length of blind. Over-  
lap window openings by at least 11⁄2 in on each side.  
*Measuring for Special Windows*  
**Multiple shades** At very wide or sectioned windows and at sliding  
doors, it’s wise to use two shades hung from one headrail. Make a  
drawing of the window; include measurements of glass, woodwork,  
and overall size. Your dealer will do the rest.  
**Corner windows** Inside-mounted shades need no special measuring  
instructions. If outside- or ceiling-mounted shades are used, they can  
be overlapped. Make a drawing of the windows; include measure-  
ments of glass, woodwork, and overall size. Your dealer will do the  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1461* Specialties  
WINDOW TREATMENTS  
Guidelines  
rest.  
**Other special windows** Bays and other unusual windows can fre-  
quently be fitted for pleated shades. Make a drawing of the window;  
include measurements of glass, woodwork, and overall size, or ask  
your dealer to do the measuring for you.  
*Layered Treatments*  
Pleated shades are most often used with an undertreatment. If inside  
mounted, no extra projection is needed for the overtreatment. If out-  
side mounted, the overtreatment must have a clearance of 21⁄2 in to

# Conventional Traverse Rods  
*Measuring for Most Windows*  
**Outside or ceiling mount** Conventional rods may be mounted on  
the wall or ceiling. Measure the width of glass; if total glass exposure  
is desired, add for stackback \(see Table 4\). Rods should be hung so  
that drapery headings \(pleated tops of panels\) are at least 4 in above  
the glass, so they can’t be seen from the outside.  
*Figuring Stackback*  
Stackback is the amount of wall space needed if open panels are to  
clear the glass completely. This dimension, added to the window  
*1462*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
*Measuring for Special Windows*  
**Sliding doors** draw rod.  
Measure as for outside mounted rod. Use a one-way  
**Corner and bay windows** Measure each window as if it were set  
flat into the wall. At corners, run one rod into the corner and butt the  
other into it. At bays, butt all rods. Use either one- or two-way draw  
rods for corners. For bays, use 3 two-way rods or 2 one-ways with a  
two-way in the center.  
*Layered Treatments*  
Conventional traverse rods come in sets specifically for layered  
treatments. If you are using an undercurtain, you will want a traverse  
and plain rod set; both rods are on one set of brackets. Overdrapery  
returns will be 41⁄2 to 51⁄2 in.  
If you are using underdraperies, use a double traverse rod set. Again,  
one set of brackets holds both rods. Overdrapery returns will be 51⁄2 to  
61⁄2 in.  
If the undertreatment is inside mounted or is an outside-mounted  
miniblind, pleated shade. Romanette woven wood, or a café curtain,  
use a single rod and set the brackets for maximum clearance. Drap-  
ery returns will be 41⁄2 in.  
If the undertreatment is an outside-mounted vertical blind or a woven  
wood shade other than Romanette, special extender plates for brack-  
ets and supports are available. Overdrapery returns will be 51⁄2 to 61⁄2  
in.  
Remember, whenever you change the clearance of the brackets, you  
also change the drapery return.  
# Vertical Blinds  
*Measuring for Most Windows*  
**Inside mount** Measure width at top, center, and bottom. Use nar-  
rowest measurement. Verticals will be made slightly narrower to slip  
inside easily. Measure length from inside top of opening to sill. A  
minimum 31⁄4-in recess is required for track; 41⁄2-in if open vanes are to be flush with front of opening.  
**Outside mount** Measure width of opening. Add for stackback \(see  
Tables 6 and 7\). Measure from a point 21⁄2 in above top of frame to sill  
or floor; deduct 3⁄4 in for clearance.  
Minimum projection of front of vane from wall is 5 in; maximum is  
61⁄2 in. Minimum clearance of back of vane from wall is 1 in; maxi-  
mum is 21⁄2 in.  
**Ceiling mount** Measure desired width and length of verticals;  
deduct at least 3⁄4 in for floor clearance.  
**Cirmosa 2000** for you.  
Ask your designer, decorator, or store to measure  
*Measuring for Special Windows*  
**Sliding doors** Use a one-way draw. Measure width from trim to  
trim. Add to this measurement desired extra width for overlap  
beyond door. If total glass exposure is desired, also add for stackback  
\(see Tables 6 and 7\). Measure from a point 21⁄2 in above door trim to  
floor; deduct 3⁄4 in for clearance.  
*Layered Treatments*  
When layered, verticals are most often used as an undertreatment. If  
inside mounted, no extra clearance is needed for the overtreatment. If  
outside mounted, the overtreatment must have a clearance of 6 in to

*Figuring Stackback*  
Stackback is the amount of wall space needed if open verticals are to  
clear the glass completely. This dimension, added to the window  
opening, gives you the proper track length.  
Begin by measuring the window opening, then consult Table 6 or 7  
for the type of treatment you desire—one- or two-way draw. Find  
your opening measurement and read across for the right track.  
\(NOTE\: Stackback figure for two-way draw is total stack; one-half  
of this is on each side of the window.\)  
If your window opening is somewhere in between the measurements  
in the tables, go to the next smallest opening. Add the stackback  
listed there to your opening dimension.  
# Miniblinds  
*Measuring for Most Windows*  
**Inside mount** Measure width at top, center, and bottom. Use nar-  
rowest measurement. Blinds will be made slightly narrower to slip  
inside easily. Measure length from inside top of open to sill. A 13⁄8-in-  
deep recess is needed for flush mounting of Mono-Rail minis; how-  
ever, a difference of 1⁄4-in is not objectionable.  
**Outside mount** Measure height and width of area to be covered. It  
is recommended that blinds overlap window opening by at least 11⁄2-  
in on each side. Measure from top of frame to sill or 11⁄2 in below  
opening if there is no sill.

Guidelines  
**Ceiling mount** Measure desired width and length of blind. Over-  
lap window openings by at least 11⁄2-in on each side.

Fig. 8 Woven wood blinds. These blinds have horizontal or vertical reeds—long slats of wood from 1⁄4 to 1 in width—  
that are held together by decorative vertical yarns. They range in designs from those that are made mostly from  
exposed wood to those that are mainly yarns of several colors, creating various interesting effects. Woven wood blinds  
can be used with many window treatments including draperies and café curtains, and such shade types as Roman-  
fold, spring-rolls, cord and pulley, and duofold. Top treatments include canopies, valances, and arches, while scal-  
lops, fringes, and trims are suitable for the bottom. Because woven wood blinds add color and texture to a window,  
they are particularly adaptable to the natural look in decorating

Fig. 9 Inside shutters can be used next to windows in place of curtains. Some are put under curtains or draperies;  
others are used café style, either above or beneath café curtains. Shutters may be made from wood or metal. Natural

ELEVATORS AND WHEELCHAIR LIFTS  
Elevator Types and Planning  
# Elevator Types  
*Hydraulic\:* For low-rise buildings—speeds up to 200 ft/min.  
Ideal where design limitations preclude overhead supports  
and machine rooms. Economical to install and maintain; no  
penthouse or load-bearing walls required.  
*Geared traction\:* For low- to medium-rise buildings—speeds  
up to 400 ft/min. Recommended for all types of buildings  
where higher speeds are not essential.  
*Gearless traction\:* Recommended for high-rise applications  
requiring the ultimate in service—speeds of 500 ft/min and up.  
# Elevator Planning  
*Starting Point Recommendations for All Types of Buildings*  
When preparing schematics for a particular type of building, select  
the quantity, capacity, and speed from one of Tables 1 to 4 and keep  
in mind that generally\:  
• Passenger elevators should be wide and shallow with center-  
opening or single slide doors.  
• Service elevators should be narrow and deep with two-speed  
doors.  
• Combination passenger/service elevators should be almost square  
with either center-opening or two-speed center-opening doors.  
• Freight elevator size and shape should be determined by the  
dimensions of goods to be carried and by the loading/unloading  
methods used. Doors should be of the vertical biparting type.  
The data contained in Tables 1 to 4 are based on the following crite-  
ria.  
**Office buildings** 100 ft2 per person; an interval of 30 sec.; net  
rentable area = 80 percent of gross area; 5-min carrying capacity of  
12 percent of building population; typical floor heights were esti-  
mated at 12 ft and the main floor at 18 ft. When the building exceeds  
250,000 ft2 total, it is suggested that consideration be given to the use  
of separate freight elevators which are not included in Table 1.  
**Hospitals** Five-minute vehicular demand = .04 × the number of  
beds; interval of 35 to 50 seconds for vehicular traffic; visitor and  
staff population = 3 × number of beds; 5-min carrying capacity equal  
to 12 percent of building population.  
**Hotels** Registration during conventions = 1.5 × the total number of  
rooms; maximum 1-h peak is 1.15 × total registrations; 5-minute car-  
rying capacity = 10 percent of total 1-h peak load.  
**Apartments** Population established at two persons per bedroom;  
5-min carrying capacity of 7 percent; maximum waiting interval of  
60–90 sec; average of 9 ft 0 in floor height. Further, Table 4 applies  
only for average or middle-income apartments. For applications  
beyond the scope of Table 4, such as local-express arrangements,  
luxury apartment buildings, and other considerations, please consult  
your local elevator company representative.

be designated by *raised* standard alphabet characters for letters,  
Arabic characters for numerals, or standard symbols as shown in  
Fig. 3*a,* and as required in ANSI A17.1-1978 and A17.1a-1979.  
The call button for the main entry floor shall be designated by a  
*raised* star at the left of the floor designation \(see Fig. 3*a* and *b*\).  
All *raised* designations for control buttons shall be placed imme-  
diately to the left of the button to which they apply. Applied  
plates, permanently attached, are an acceptable means to provide  
*raised* control designations. Floor buttons shall be provided with  
visual indicators to show when each call is registered. The visual  
indicators shall be extinguished when each call is answered.  
*Height.* All floor buttons shall be no higher than *48 in \(1220*  
*mm\), unless there is a substantial increase in cost, in which case*  
*the maximum mounting height may be increased to 54 in \(1370*  
*mm\),* above the floor. Emergency controls, including the emer-  
gency alarm and emergency stop, shall be grouped at the bottom  
of the panel and shall have their centerlines no less than 35 in  
\(890 mm\) above the floor \(see Fig. 3*a* and *b*\).  
*Location.* Controls shall be located on a front wall if cars have  
center opening doors, and at the side wall or at the front wall next  
to the door if cars have side opening doors \(see Fig. 3*c* and *d*\)\:

In elevator cars, a visual car position indicator shall be provided  
above the car control panel or over the door to show the position of  
the elevator in the hoistway. As the car passes or stops at a floor  
served by the elevators, the corresponding numerals shall illuminate  
and an audible signal shall sound. Numerals shall be a minimum of 1⁄2  
in \(13 mm\) high. The audible signal shall be no less than 20 dB with  
a frequency no higher than 1500 Hz. An automatic verbal announce-  
ment of the floor number at which a car stops or which a car passes  
may be substituted for the audible signal.  
# Emergency Communications  
If provided, emergency two-way communication systems between  
the elevator and a point outside the hoistway shall comply with ANSI  
A17.1-1978 and A17.1a-1979. The highest operable part of a two-  
way communication system shall be a maximum of 48 in \(1220 mm\)  
from the floor of the car. It shall be identified by a raised or recessed  
symbol and located adjacent to the device. If the system uses a hand-  
set, then the length of the cord from the panel to the handset shall be  
at least 29 in \(735 mm\). The emergency intercommunication system  
shall not require voice communication.

INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW  
# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW  
Although the Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\) was signed by  
President Bush on July 26, 1990, the notion of making buildings and  
products usable and accessible to those with disabilities has been  
with us for at least four decades. At various times and in various ven-  
ues, terms such as “inclusive design,” “barrier-free design,” “humane  
design,” “design for all,” “accessible design,” and, more recently,  
“universal design” have been employed to identify and describe this  
concept. In most instances the differences in terms have been essen-  
tially a question of semantics. In other instances the terms represent  
a strong, disciplined, and well-structured philosophical design  
approach, while in still other instances the terms have been used to  
identify a body of design standards that have been codified and made  
part of local and state legislation.  
It is the intent of this section, however, to deal exclusively with spe-  
cific federal legislation, including the ADA and its related design  
guidelines, directed to making buildings and products usable and  
accessible to the disabled.  
Accordingly, and in a more national context, the issue of accessible  
design had it origins as far back as 1961, at which time the American  
National Standards Institute \(ANSI\), formerly known as the Ameri-  
can Standards Association \(ASI\), issued A117.1, “Specifications for  
Making Buildings and Facilities Accessible and Usable by the Phys-  
ically Handicapped.” However, the first federal law to require so-  
called barrier-free design was the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968,  
which still requires that buildings and facilities be accessible if they  
are designed, built, or altered with certain federal funds, or leased for  
occupancy by federal agencies  
The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the precursor to the ADA, followed  
and became one of the most significant pieces of federal legislation  
requiring access to programs and facilities that are designed and built  
by recipients of federal funds. This act also created the Architectural  
and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board \(ATBCB\). The board,  
also known as the “Access Board,” is the federal agency that develops  
guidelines issued under the ADA, the Architectural Barriers Act of  
1968, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and Section 508 of the  
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended in 1998.  
While the Access Board has enforcement authority for the Architec-  
tural Barriers Act, four other federal agencies actually develop the  
enforceable standards, based on the Access Board’s Minimum  
Guidelines and requirements for Accessible Design. These agencies  
are the General Services Administration, the Department of Defense,  
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the U.S.  
Postal Service. The currently enforceable standards are the Uniform  
Federal Accessibility Standards \(UFAS\). These four federal standards-  
setting agencies may, on a case-by-case basis, waive or modify the  
standards.  
The two most recent pieces of legislation dealing with accessible  
design are the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the ADA.  
The former requires that all newly constructed multifamily housing  
be adaptable—not fully accessible but modifiable—by a tenant  
with a disability, to suit his or her individual accessibility require-  
ments. The latter is the most current legislation, the purpose of  
which is  
to prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Pro-  
hibited actions include, but are not limited to, failure to design and  
construct in compliance with federal standards for accessible  
design.  
The ADA is the most recent law affecting people with disabilities and  
is the most far-reaching. Of particular importance to designers are  
Titles II and III of the ADA. The Department of Justice \(DOJ\) and  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design 1579* Accessible Design/ADA  
INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW  
the Department of Transportation \(DOT\) have responsibility for  
enforcing Titles II and III. As part of that responsibility they must  
establish design standards with which covered entities must comply.  
The process by which the DOJ, DOT, and ADA standards for acces-  
sible design are developed involves two steps.  
First, the Access Board publishes the ADA Accessibility Guidelines  
\(ADAAG\) as a final rule. Then, the DOJ and the DOT independently  
adopt standards. Both the DOJ and the DOT are required under the  
statute to establish standards that are “consistent with” the ADAAG.  
Although both the DOJ and the DOT have adopted the ADAAG as  
their design standards, the standards must be read in the context of  
the applicable rule or title. While the Access Board from time to time  
supplements, refines, and otherwise modifies its original guidelines,  
they do not have the force of law until Titles II or III are modified to  
incorporate the changes in their standards.  
A designer wanting to plan ahead is cautioned that provisions may be  
modified in the ADAAG that have the effect of establishing a lesser  
or differing standard from the currently enforceable standard. Where  
ADAAG is changed, or proposed by the Access Board to be changed,  
designers should make certain that the guidelines used are the most  
current recognized by the enforcing authorities. If the Access  
Board’s changes go beyond the current requirements, it is prudent to  
consider using the more stringent standard, but no one is bound to  
use standards not yet recognized by the DOJ or the DOT  
The Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association \(EPVA\) offers the fol-  
lowing overviews of the four key pieces of federal accessibility leg-  
islation, while the chart on page 1581 provides comparative  
descriptions of the various federal accessibility legislation. Also  
included in this section are the complete Americans with Disabilities  
Act Accessibility Guidelines \(ADAAG\).  
# OVERVIEW OF THE ARCHITECTURAL BARRIERS ACT  
# OF 1968  
The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 was the first federal law to  
require barrier-free design. More than 30 years old, the law still  
applies where buildings are constructed, altered, leased, or financed  
in whole or part with federal funds.  
# OVERVIEW OF THE REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973  
The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and particularly Section 504 and its  
prohibition against discrimination against persons with disabilities,  
is the precursor of the Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\) of  
1990\. It still applies to public and private entities that receive federal  
funds and may impose on them barrier-free design requirements that  
are far stricter than the ADA’s mandates. For example, a two-story  
private school building is not required by the ADA to have an eleva-  
tor, but would be required to have an elevator if the school received  
federal funding. Religious colleges are exempt from all ADA acces-  
sibility requirements, but most are covered by the Rehabilitation Act  
mandates for barrier-free design. Also, federal departments and  
agencies are not covered by the ADA, but must provide access under  
the requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  
# OVERVIEW OF THE FAIR HOUSING AMENDMENTS ACT  
**OF 1988 \(42 USC 3600 *ET SEQ.*\)**  
The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 extends the nondiscrim-  
ination protections of the Fair Housing Act to persons with disabili-  
*1580*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
ties and persons with families.  
It should be noted that the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines are  
in fact *guidelines* only and have no force of law. The actual guide-  
lines are reprinted in Section 3 of the guideline material, and those  
alone are enforced by the Department of Housing and Urban Devel-  
opment \(HUD\) and the federal courts.  
Finally, though the guidelines are for “accessible/adaptable  
dwellings,” the level of accessibility afforded by the HUD criteria is  
significantly lower than that provided by either the Uniform Federal  
Accessibility Standards \(UFAS\) or CABO/ANSI A117, 1-1992 stan-  
dard. As of this writing, the latest edition of the accessibility standard,  
Icc/ANSI A117.1-1998 has technical requirements for “Type B  
dwelling units, meant to reflect the Fair Housing requirement, though  
the A117 Accredited Standard Committee makes clear that these  
dwelling units are not “accessible” in the traditional sense.  
# OVERVIEW OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES  
**ACT OF 1990 \(42 USC 12101 *ET SEQ.*\)**  
The Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\) of 1990 is the most com-  
prehensive law ever passed to protect the civil rights of individuals  
with disabilities. Its protections far exceed its requirements for bar-  
rier-free design, though its access requirements are all that are  
addressed in this publication. Please refer to EPVA’s publication,  
*Understanding the ADA,* for a general overview of the act.  
The ADA comprises five titles\: Title I—Employment, Title II—Pub-  
lic Services, Title III—Public Accommodations and Services by Pri-  
vate Entities, Title IV—Telecomunication Relay Services, Title  
V—Miscellaneous. While the requirements in Title I, to accommo-  
date a qualified employee with a disability, may involve structural  
alterations to the workplace, it is Title II and III that contain the  
major barrier-free requirements of the act. It is important to remem-  
ber that the accessibility requirements of the ADA apply *in addition*  
*to,* and not *instead of,* the accessibility requirements of state and local  
building codes. Where the latter are more restrictive than the ADA,  
they take precedence over the federal regulations  
As mentioned previously, Title II and Title III of the ADA deal with  
the major barrier-free issues. The applicability and design guidelines  
related to each are as follows.  
# TITLE II  
# Applicability  
Title II regulations apply to public services provided by state and  
local governments, including public school districts, throughway and  
port authorities, and other governmental units, whether or not they  
receive federal funds. In order to make the services offered accessi-  
ble to people with disabilities, new construction and alterations are  
required to incorporate barrier-free design. Moreover, program  
accessibility in existing buildings may necessitate alterations in order  
to enhance the present degree of accessibility.  
# Design Guidelines  
At present, Title II regulations allow the use of either the 1984 Uni-  
form Federal Accessibility Standards \(UFAS\) or the ADA Accessi- FEDERAL ACCESSIBILITY LEGISLATION

INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW  
bility Guide lines \(ADAAG\). However, the designer is cautioned of  
the following\:  
• Indications are that the UFAS may be phased out as a design cri-  
teria option and that a number of federal agencies have already  
revised their regulations to require compliance with the ADAAG  
but without the elevator exception.  
• If ADAAG design criteria are used, it should be noted that the  
elevator exception does not apply.  
• The ADAAG do not address residential construction or construc-  
tion of jails and correctional facilities. Under Title II, these types  
of facilities must be subject to UFAS guidelines.  
# TITLE III  
# Applicability  
Title III regulations apply primarily to commercial facilities. All  
newly constructed and altered commercial facilities are subject to the  
accessibility requirements of Title III. Existing public accommoda-  
tions may also be subject to additional access requirements through  
the barrier removal provisions of the law. In order to be considered a  
“public accommodation” covered under Title III, an entity must be  
private and must own, lease, lease to, or operate a place of public  
accommodation. Moreover, places of public accommodation must  
fall within at least one of the following 12 categories\:  
1. *Places of lodging\:* An inn, hotel, motel, or other place of lodg-  
ing, except for an establishment located within a building that  
contains no more than five rooms for rent or hire and that is actu-  
ally occupied by the proprieter of the establishment as the resi-  
dence of the proprieter.  
2. *Establishments serving food or drink\:* A restaurant, bar, or  
other establishment serving food or drink.  
3. *Places of exhibition or entertainment*  
4. *Places of public gathering\:* An auditorium, convention center,  
lecture hall, or other place of public gathering.  
5. *Sales or rental establishments\:* A bakery, grocery store, cloth-  
ing store, hardware store, shopping center, or other sales or rental  
establishment.  
6. *Service establishments\:* A laundromat, dry cleaner, bank, bar-  
ber shop, travel service, shoe repair service, funeral parlor, gas  
station, office of an accountant or lawyer, pharmacy, insurance  
office, professional office of a health care provider, hospital, or  
other service establishment.  
7. *Stations used for specified public transportation\:* A terminal,  
depot, or other station used for specified public transportation.  
8. *Places of public display or collection\:* A museum, library,  
gallery, or other place of public display or collection.  
9. *Places of recreation\:* A restaurant, bar, or other establishment  
serving food or drink.  
10. *Places of education*  
11. *Social service center establishments\:* A day care center, senior  
citizen center, homeless shelter, food bank, adoption agency, or  
other social service center establishment.  
12. *Places of exercise or recreation\:* A gymnasium, health spa,  
bowling alley, golf course, or other place of exercise or rec-  
reation.  
*1582*  
*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design*  
NOTE\: The 12 categories above constitute an exhaustive list. The  
examples given, however, are not, and are intended to apply as illus-  
trations. Accordingly, many of the categories listed could include  
many facilities other than those listed. For additional and more  
detailed information, the reader is referred to the Access Board web  
site \(www.access-board.gov\), from which ADAAG and other invalu-  
able information may be downloaded. The Access Board can also be  
contacted by e-mail \(info@access-board.gov\) or by fax \(202-272-  
5447\).  
# Design Guidelines  
The Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines  
\(ADAAG\) set the guidelines for accessibility to places of public  
accommodation and commercial facilities by individuals with dis-  
abilities. It should be noted that departures from these guidelines are  
permitted where the alternative designs will provide equivalent or  
greater access to the facility. The ADAAG also provide procedures  
for departure from the guidelines in the case of historic buildings  
when compliance with said guidelines would destroy or threaten the  
historic significance of the building.  
It is not possible to include in this publication the entire ADAAG  
text. The ADAAG graphics, however, are included on the following  
pages. The reader is cautioned that these graphics are frequently  
increased in quantity and subject matter. It is essential, therefore, that  
the designer ensure that he or she is working with the most current  
graphics available at the time.  
# National and State Building Codes  
Article 2.2 of the ADAAG allows for departures from particular  
scoping and technical requirements by use of other designs and tech-  
nologies “where the alternative designs and technologies used will  
provide substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of  
the facility.” Accordingly, if the accessibility requirements of certain  
national and state building codes do, in fact, provide such equivalent  
or greater access, they may be employed where required.  
Local and state governmental agencies having jurisdiction must sub-  
mit their building codes to the DOJ for review, to determine if they  
meet the same or comparable accessibility standards. Once the DOJ  
so certifies, a project that complies with that state or local code will  
be considered to comply with the ADA.  
Where the ADA \(or Fair Housing\) requirements are more restrictive,  
they take precedence over state or local codes. The reader is cau-  
tioned, however, that in many instances it may be difficult to deter-  
mine which requirements are more restrictive.  
While state or local authorities having jurisdiction may submit their  
codes to the DOJ for review, these jurisdictions are not mandated to  
have any accessibility requirements, much less requirements that  
meet or exceed the federal regulations. Far too many designers still  
assume that compliance with a local code constitutes compliance  
with federal law.  
In addition, HUD has no similar certification process for state and  
local codes vis-à-vis the Fair Housing requirements. However, HUD Accessible Design/ADA

INTRODUCTION  
# INTRODUCTION  
This section provides a variety of time-saving reference material in  
the form of tables, charts, formulas, and planning guidelines.  
Included are area requirements for the preliminary space planning of  
various building types and human factors data related to anthropo-  
metrics, space, and acoustics. Also included are a number of tables  
for determining carpet and wall covering yardage quantities. In addi-  
tion, a series of tables dealing with electrical data provides typical  
amperage ratings for office and electronic equipment and for resi-  
dential appliances. Still other tables and charts contain mathematical  
data relative to functions of numbers, metric system conversions, and  
areas of plane figures.

Area Requirements by Use  
The first portion of Table 1 shows some of the planning guidelines  
for several types of office use. Of course, usable areas per employee  
vary greatly depending on the type of work performed and types of  
support space and common areas required, such as file rooms, data  
processing, and conference rooms.

SPACE PLANNING  
Library Area Requirements  
Libraries represent a unique building type in that a majority of space  
is devoted to housing books and not people. The number of volumes  
to be housed, rather than numbers of people, becomes the primary  
planning parameter. For a detailed layout of book stacks, you can use  
the figures given in Table 3. For preliminary planning, the following  
general guidelines are useful.  
# Rules of Thumb  
*Public library\: Law library\:* 12 to 181⁄2 volumes per ft2  
5 to 7 volumes per ft2  
To stack space, add a configuration loss of from 6 to 20 percent, to  
account for inefficiencies in stack layout.  
*Minimum aisle between open stacks\: Staff spaces\:* 100 net ft2 per person  
*Reading room seating\:* configuration loss  
*Net/gross multiplier\:* 1.25  
Maximum of 15,000 to 20,000 ft2 per floor  
3 ft 0 in  
15 to 35 ft2 per person plus 6 percent  
**Example** A 100,000-volume public library is planned. How much  
space should be devoted to open stacks?  
Plan about 15 volumes per square foot \(100,000 ÷ 15 = 6667 ft2\). Add  
a configuration loss of 10 percent, to give a total area of 6667 + 667,  
or 7333 ft2 of stack space.

HUMAN FACTORS  
Anthropometrics  
# Appropriateness  
It is essential, because of the many variables involved, that the data  
selected be appropriate to the user of the space or furniture to be  
designed. It becomes necessary, therefore, for the intended user pop-  
ulation to be properly defined in terms of such factors as age, sex,  
occupation, and ethnicity. If the user is an individual or constitutes a  
very small group, it may, in certain situations, be feasible to develop  
your own primary anthropometric data by actually having individual  
body measurements taken. Surely, if one is prepared to take the time  
to be fitted for a dress or a suit, one should be willing to spend the  
time to be fitted for an interior environment or components of that  
Fig. 1 \(a\) People of smaller body dimensions and, correspondingly, the lower-range percentile data should be used  
to establish dimensions where reach is the determining factor. \(b\) Larger-size people and, correspondingly, the high  
percentile range data should be used in establishing clearance dimensions

far greater financial investment. The measurements, in the event that  
individual data are generated, should, however, be taken with proper  
instruments by a trained observer. In situations where specific body  
dimensions or other data for a particular user population are unavail-  
able, and both time and funds prevent undertaking sophisticated  
studies, an engineering anthropometrist can be consulted to discuss  
the statistical methods of obtaining the necessary information.  
# “Average Man” Fallacy  
As suggested previously, a very serious error in the application of  
data is to assume that the 50th-percentile dimensions represent the  
measurements of an average man and to create a design to accom-  
modate 50th-percentile data. The fallacy in such an assumption is  
that, by prior definition, 50 percent of the group may suffer. There  
simply is no average man. Depending on the nature of the design  
problem, the design should usually be conceived to accommodate the  
5th or the 95th percentile, so that the greatest portion of the popula-  
tion is served.  
Dr. H.T.E. Hertzberg, one of the country’s most distinguished  
research physical anthropologists, in discussing the so-called aver-  
age man, indicated, “there is really no such thing as an ‘average’ man  
or woman. There are men who are average in weight, or in stature, or  
in sitting height, but the men who are average in two dimensions con-  
stitute only about 7 percent of the population; those in three, only  
about 3 percent; those in four, less than 2 percent. There are no men  
average in as few as 10 dimensions. Therefore, the concept of the  
‘average’ man is fundamentally incorrect, because no such creature  
exists. Work places to be efficient should be designed according to  
the measured range of body size.”  
# Reach, Clearance, and Adjustability  
The selection of appropriate anthropometric data is based on the  
nature of the particular design problem under consideration. If the  
design requires the user to reach from a seated or standing position,  
the 5th-percentile data should be utilized. Such data for arm reach  
indicate that 5 percent of the population would have an arm reach of  
short \(or shorter\) dimension, while 95 percent of the population—the  
overwhelming majority—would have longer arm reaches. If the  
design in a reach situation can accommodate the user with the short-  
est arm reach, obviously it will function for the users with longer  
reaches as well; it is equally obvious that the opposite is not true, as  
shown in Fig. 1*a.*  
In designs where clearance is the primary consideration, the larger or  
95th-percentile data should be used. The logic is simple. If the design  
will allow adequate clearance for the users with the largest body size,  
it would also allow clearance for those users with smaller body size.  
Here, too, it can be seen from Fig. 1*b* that the opposite is not true.  
In other situations it may be desirable to provide the design with a  
built-in adjustment capability. Certain chair types, adjustable  
shelves, and so on, are examples of such. The range of adjustment  
should be based on the anthropometrics of the user, the nature of the  
task, and the physical or mechanical limitations involved. The range  
General Reference Data  
HUMAN FACTORS  
Anthropometrics  
should allow the design to accommodate at least 90 percent of the  
user population involved.  
It should be noted that the foregoing examples were used primarily to  
illustrate the basic logic underlying the selection of the body dimen-  
sions involved and the particular percentiles to be accommodated.  
Wherever possible, however, it is naturally more desirable to accom-  
modate the greatest percentage of the user population. In this regard,  
there is no substitute for common sense. If a shelf can just as easily  
be placed an inch or two lower, without significantly impacting on  
other design or cost factors, thereby accommodating 98 or 99 percent  
of the user population, obviously that is the correct design decision.  
The clearances shown in Fig. 3 are intended to introduce general  
guidelines for barrier-free design. While we have utilized the wheel-  
chair as our design subject, it does not represent the largest number of  
people with disabilities. However, it is usually the most demanding for  
which to design. To provide practical limits for this design, we have  
chosen to plot the range of reach for the short female to the tall male.  
The overlapping areas of ability for those with and without disabilities  
demonstrate the field of good design practice common to both.  
When planning for accessibility, it is important to consider the attitude  
at which the wheelchair approaches the object desired. Reach limits  
differ for frontal and side reach. Because of this, range of reach is  
plotted for each. The elevation targets represent the maximum height  
at which controls requiring manual dexterity should be located.  
Wheelchairs vary in size. They are fitted to their users in much the  
same manner as clothing is. A range of sizes is given, with the dimen-  
sions for the typical collapsible, manual chair indicated. Electrically  
powered wheelchairs require more space. Further, the wheelchair  
must be considered in its occupied state, as the user imparts addi-  
tional space requirements with arms and feet as well as basic maneu-  
vering space.  
We consider the basic space requirement for an occupied wheelchair  
to function to be 3 ft wide by 4 ft deep. This same space will accom-  
modate most people who use canes, crutches, and walkers. Blind  
people using the cane technique for perceiving obstacles can also be  
accommodated in this space. For a person in a wheelchair to make a  
complete turn, an area of approximately 5 ft by 5 ft is required. As the  
elevations of surrounding surfaces change, so do the space require-  
ments. The length of time that one is confronted by close quarters  
also affects the required clearance. An opening through a wall may  
be 2 ft 8 in clear, as it represents only a short time involvement. As  
travel distance and traffic increase, passage width must also.  
The complexity of space also affects minimum clearance. To make a  
simple 90° turn, adjoining passages 3 ft wide are required \(and 3 ft 6  
in preferred if a normal walking is to be maintained\). A 180° turn  
around a fixed partition requires more space.  
As clearances relate to general circulation requirements, space needs  
again increase with traffic speed and volume. Narrow corridors \(4 ft\)  
should be restricted to basically short, one-directional traffic pat-  
terns. Generally, maintain at least 5-ft clearances or more, as deter-  
mined by code.

# Clothing Increases for Men and Women  
Clothing must be taken into consideration when designing compart-  
ments and seating arrangements. If a condition exists that must accom-  
modate the 99th-percentile man and the 1st-percentile woman, add the  
heaviest clothing required to the large man and add the lightest cloth-  
ing to the small woman. Hats are important; include a 2-in clearance  
between the highest hat and the ceiling to allow for rising and falling  
during walking. Shoe heights are important to determine ceiling clear-  
ance and seat heights. Spacing between arm rests will depend on the  
sitting buttock width, with the bulkiest clothing anticipated.  
Gloves affect space requirements. A bare hand opening of 1.5 × 3.8  
in \(38 × 97 mm\) has to be increased, for heavy gloves, to 2 × 4.5 in  
\(51 × 114 mm\). Gloved hands are not as sensitive. A push-button  
travel of 0.1 in \(3 mm\) must be increased to 0.3 in \(8 mm\) for heavy  
gloves.  
Table 1 shows the increase required on each side for various types  
of clothing, is both for civilian increases for men and women, and  
for military men. Values are approximate, for styles of clothing  
change. Military and safety helmets are about 12 × 10.25 in \(305 ×  
260 mm\).

*Time-Saver Standards for Interior Design* **Types of Space**  
Besides needing enough space in order to move about and perform  
various tasks, people react to space in a variety of ways. Several  
researchers have defined the space surrounding the individual in  
terms of the limits within which people categorically respond \(see  
Figs. 7 and 8\). *Intimate space* is that area in which a person tends not  
to allow anyone to intrude unless intimate relationships are expected.  
*Personal space* is that area within which a person allows only  
selected friends or fellow workers with whom personal discussion is  
mandatory. *Social space* is that area within which the individual  
expects to make purely social contacts on a temporary basis. And,  
finally, *public space* is that area within which the individual does not  
expect to have direct contact with others. Obviously, the more inti-  
mate the spatial relationship becomes, the more people resist intru-  
sion by others. Personal space factors are important in establishing  
the privacy requirements for architectural design.

# Typical Subjective Responses to Selected Spatial Features  
Although few research data have been generated with regard to how  
people respond to specific spatial factors \(at least in terms of being  
able to prescribe precise, quantitative guidelines\), it is important for  
the designer to reflect on potentially negative reactions that often  
result when a given space is not made compatible with what the user  
expects in terms of the size, shape, organization, color, and illumina-  
tion of a particular space. The considerations listed in Table 3 are  
suggested as a checklist for the designer.  
Table 3  
*Space characteristic Probable response*  
Size \(generally, volume\) Shape \(generally, proportion\) Color and illumination Windows Space organization Furnishings If the space is too small for the number of people, furnishings, equipment, or other objects that occupy it, people  
will consider it to be crowded. Although they may accept a crowded condition on a temporary basis, they will ob-  
ject to living or working in such a space for extended periods of time. If the space is too large for the people, fur-  
nishings, equipment, or other objects that occupy it, people will consider it unfriendly, inconvenient, and/or overly  
demanding in terms of communicating, travel distance, maintenance, etc. Although they may accept the “barnlike”  
atmosphere for temporary periods, they will object to living or working in such a space for extended periods of  
time.  
If the space is out of proportion \(too narrow, wide, long, high, etc.\) for the intended use, people will consider it awk-  
ward and often distracting or oppressive. Although they may accept proportional distortion on a short-term basis  
\(i.e., as they pass through briefly\), they will object to living or working in such a space for extended periods of time.  
If the space contains such distortions as all curved surfaces, acute wall junctures, and too many projections or sur-  
face changes, people will consider it confusing and difficult to maneuver in and/or furnish. Although they may ac-  
cept such distortions \(or even consider them interesting\) on a temporary or one-time basis, they will object to living  
or working in such a space for extended periods of time. It should also be noted that blind people depend on the  
constant proportions of right-angle corners to aid them in negotiating a space; such individuals are easily confused  
by curved surfaces, walls that are not at right angles, and periodic projections that imply they may have reached a  
turning point. When a ceiling is extremely high relative to the lateral dimension of a space, people feel as though  
they are working in a pit and that the walls are closing in on them. When a ceiling is extremely low and the space in  
front of the observer is very long, people feel as though the room is “endless” or as if they will hit their heads unless  
they duck.  
If a space is dark \(unless this is required for a particular operation, such as a motion picture presentation\), people  
tend to become lethargic and less active, or they may feel anxious. As a rule, the less bright a room is, the less  
cheerful it seems. A small space will seem even smaller. If a space is too bright, people will feel overly exposed, or  
they will complain of glare or thermal discomfort \(even though actual glare in terms of accepted light levels or inap-  
propriate thermal conditions for comfort are not present\). If there are too many different colors, too large expanses  
of very saturated color, or too many and too “busy” patterns of color within a space, most people become irritated  
after more than a brief exposure to the space. If there is too little color, no visual pattern, or no other decorative  
break in the visual environment, people will find the space monotonous, boring, and eventually irritating to the  
point of wanting to escape. Although isolated points of highly reflective surface provide interest, all-metallic and  
highly reflective surface treatments create both subjective and directly objective interference for most people who  
have to work in the space.  
Generally, most people do not like to live and work in a space that is devoid of windows. First and foremost, peo-  
ple seem to need visual contact with the outside world. Too many windows, on the other hand, can cause the fol-  
lowing possible negative reactions\: too much glare, too much exposure \(fishbowl effect\), lack of protection from  
outside elements, true anxiety \(caused by floor-to-ceiling glass at high elevations\).  
The internal components within a space and the traffic corridors and entrance and exit locations will seem either  
well organized or badly organized. The furnishings, partitions, decorative objects, etc., will appear as being either  
organized or disorganized, depending on the observer’s ability to comprehend what things are and where they are  
with respect to his or her vantage point. Key behavioral response issues include apparent capability to find one’s  
way to specific locations, apparent ease for interacting and communicating with others with whom the individual  
must associate, and apparent privacy provisions necessary to perform individual tasks. Although these are some-  
times conflicting needs, the people who use a space will perform on the basis of how well each of these factors has  
been executed for *them,* not for the designer or the boss. The organization of internal space components obviously  
interacts with all the other space characteristics; i.e., the individual perceives and reacts to the combined effects of  
size, shape, color and illumination, windows, and organization simultaneously. A significant behavioral response  
will be an individual’s interpretation of whether sufficient options are available for local modification of his or her  
own portion of the space. Even though people may never require a modification, they react to their own space in  
terms of permanently established restrictions that eventually elicit the feeling that the space is too small, the wrong  
shape, too dark, or isolated from the rest of the world, for example.  
As a general rule, people are sensitive to improperly proportioned furniture, i.e., furniture that is too large, too  
small, or the wrong shape for the space in which it is placed. Although the designer normally tries to select fur-  
nishings that are properly proportioned for the space he or she has created, this may ultimately restrict the effi-  
ciency of the individual \(e.g., a desk or storage cabinet may be too small\). Thus, although the general visual  
proportions of furniture in relation to space must be taken into account to avoid negative observational responses,  
shortchanging the individual in terms of specific furniture and use requirements soon stimulates an even stronger  
negative response.

# Basic Single-Layer System, Treated Joints  
1\. Position all ends and edges of all gypsum fiber panels over fram-  
ing members, except when joints are at right angles to framing  
members, as in perpendicular application or when end joints are  
back-blocked.  
2\. Apply gypsum fiber panels first to the ceiling, then to the walls.  
Extend ceiling board into corners and make firm contact with top  
plate. To minimize end joints, use panels of maximum practical  
lengths. Fit ends and edges closely, but not forced together. Stag-  
ger end joints in successive courses with joints on opposite sides  
of a partition placed on different studs.  
3\. Attach panels to framing supports by standard single nailing  
method, double nailing method, or power-driven screws. Space  
fasteners not less than 3⁄8 in from edges and ends of panels and  
drive as recommended for specified fastening method. Drive fas-  
teners in field of panels first, working toward ends and edges.  
Hold panel in firm contact with framing while driving fasteners.  
Drive fastener heads slightly below surface of gypsum fiber pan-  
els in a uniform dimple.  
4\. For UL fire-rated partition designs, refer to the specific UL  
design for proper fastener spacing.  
5\. Install trim at all internal and external angles formed by the inter-  
section of either panel surfaces or other surfaces. Apply metal or  
paper-faced corner bead to all vertical or horizontal external cor-  
ners in accordance with manufacturer’s directions.

Strip Flooring  
# Estimating the Amount of Hardwood Strip Flooring Required  
An allowance for side matching, plus 5 percent for end matching and  
normal waste are incorporated into these percentages.  
Take the square footage and add the percentage below opposite the  
size of strip flooring to be used.  
When using3⁄4 × 11⁄2 in strip *add* 55%

Carpet Construction  
Carpets are manufactured in three different ways\: woven, knitted, or  
tufted.  
# Woven Carpet  
The surface pile and backing of woven carpet are interwoven at the  
same time, creating a single fabric. Due to the interweaving, which  
locks all of the yarns together in the single woven fabric, the pile  
yarns cannot be pulled out. Some carpet weaves presently available  
are velvet, wilton, and axminster. Velvet is best suited for solid-color  
carpet; however, tweeds, stripes, and salt-and-pepper effects can be  
produced on velvet looms. The usual velvet is a solid-color carpet  
with smooth surface and even pile. Sometimes the pile is cut to pro-  
duce a plushlike surface \(see Fig. 1*a*\). It may also be had in loop pile,  
or twist.  
Wilton weave comes in almost unlimited numbers of textures and  
sculptured effects, as well as patterns. The pile is sometimes cut,  
sometimes left uncut; a combination of cut and uncut may also be  
obtained. In multicolor wiltons, one color may be seen on the surface  
pile, while other colors are hidden in the body of the carpet.  
Embossed and sculptured effects are also made by the wilton looms,  
and cut and uncut pile can be combined with cut pile for the top level,  
with loops at other levels. Another variation is to have some pile yarn  
straight and others twisted \(see Fig. 1*b*\).  
In the axminster weave, which is similar in appearance to handweav-  
ing, we find a complete flexibility in the use of color. In this method,  
each tuft is inserted separately and, while solid-color carpets can be  
made by this method, it is nearly always used for multicolored pat-  
tern carpet such as orientals, or modern and geometric designs \(see  
Fig. 1*c*\).  
# Tufted Carpet  
In the tufted process, which was only recently perfected, the tufts are  
attached to a previously made backing, as compared with the meth-  
ods previously described, in which the backing and pile are integral.  
The tufts are held in place by a heavy coating of latex applied to the  
backing, which is usually cotton, jute, or kraft cord. By the use of this  
method, a wide variety of textures is possible. For example, the  
tufted pile can be made in several levels, it can be cut or uncut, and  
carved or striated effects can be obtained. The pile can be looped or  
plush. Tufted carpets are made in multicolor patterns with an increas-

'Some appliances — such as large copiers, coffee makers, or space heaters — require most of the current available on a 20-amp circuit. It is  
recommended that such devices be supplied with their own receptacle, directly from the building. This leaves the capacity of Series 9000 circuits available  
for the more dynamic requirements of the office occupants.

Wood Screws  
Wood screws are primarily used for joining wood to wood, the  
clamping force they provide creating an extremely strong joint that is  
easily dismantled. They are also used for attaching fittings such as  
hinges, locks and handles. Most screws are made of steel, which is  
sometimes case-hardened for extra strength. Brass screws are more  
decorative, and stainless-steel screws resist corrosion even outdoors.  
Both can be used in acidic woods such as oak that are stained by ordi-  
nary steel hardware. Steel screws may be zinc coated to prevent cor-  
rosion, and chrome plating and black japanning are used as  
decorative coatings. The common types shown here illustrate the  
principles. In addition, there are a number of other specialized head  
profiles and drive shapes, the square-recess Robertson pattern being  
just one example. The most widely known cross-head screw is  
Phillips, although there are several others.  
# Screw Sizes  
The specified length of a screw corresponds  
to the part of it that actually enters the wood,  
as shown in the drawing at left. This meas-  
urement can be anywhere from 1⁄4 to 6 in \(6 to  
150 mm\). Select a screw that is about three  
times as long as the thickness of the piece of  
wood or board it is to secure. Even if a screw  
is not long enough to burst through the back  
of a work piece, it will deform the wood  
fibers, creating a noticeable bulge in the wood, unless you make sure  
the  
point stops at least 1⁄8 in \(3 mm\) short of the surface.  
Screws are also specified by their nominal diameter, or *gauge.* This  
is never described using a precise measurement. Instead, screw  
gauges are specified by numbers from 0 to 20—the higher the num-  
ber, the larger the screw. A no. 5 screw, for example, is about 1⁄8 in \(3  
mm\) in diameter and a No. 14 screw is about 1⁄4 in \(6 mm\). For  
strength, select the largest possible gauge, though the nominal diam-  
eter of the screw should never exceed 1⁄10 of the width of wood into  
which it is to be inserted. The table of wood-screw sizes shows the  
lengths commonly available in the various gauges.  
*Conventional Wood Screws*  
About 60 percent of the overall length of a conventional wood screw  
is threaded. The plain cylindrical shank of a wood screw acts like a  
dowel and is surmounted by a wider head that holds the work piece  
or attachment in place.  
*Twin-Threaded Screws*  
A newer generation of wood screws is made with coarse twin threads  
that provide a strong hold even in chipboard or MDF. Compared with  
a conventional screw, more of the overall length is threaded and the

The method by which wood veneers are manufactured provides the  
designer with a great variety of results. The primary factors influenc-  
ing these results are the natural characteristics of the wood, including  
its grain, color, and texture. In addition, the location of the tree from  
which the veneer is cut and how it is cut will also influence the end  
result or the “figure” of the veneer.  
Generally speaking, the widest figured and longest wood veneers are  
cut from the main trunk of the tree. Other parts of a tree commonly  
used for veneers include the “stump” \(or “butt”\), the “burl” or  
\(“burr”\), and the “crotch”. Accordingly, commonly used terms  
describing these veneers include butt veneers, burl or burr veneers,  
crown-cut veneers, crotch veneers, freak-figured veneers, ray-  
figured veneers, and striped veneers. These descriptive terms refer to  
either the method of cutting or the portion of the tree from which the  
log and, ultimately,the veneer are cut. Section 3 of this book provides  
the designer with additional information on wood veneer matching  
patterns as related to the design of architectural woodwork paneling.  
The following color plates of wood veneers have been provided  
by B & B Rare Woods \(10946 W. Texas Avenue, Lakewood,  
CO 80232, 303-986-2585\).\(www.wood-veneers.com/veneer\)  
# MARBLE  
The use of stone as both a structural and decorative building mate-  
rial dates back thousands of years. It continues to be a material that  
is used today for the interiors and exteriors of all types of buildings.  
Natural stone materials used for architectural interiors are generally  
classified as igneous \(granite\), sedimentary \(sandstone, limestone,  
travertine, and slate\), and metamorphic \(marble\). Typically, these  
stones are removed from quarries in the form of large blocks or  
sheets. These blocks and sheets are then refined into smaller slabs,  
panels, and tiles.  
Marble is a metamorphic stone material that is formed as a result of  
the crystallization of limestone that has been subjected to intense  
heat and pressure. While considered to be a durable material, it is not  
as hard and is less strain resistant than granite. Accordingly, careful  
attention must be given to how one uses marble, especially when uti-  
lized on horizontal surfaces such as countertops and flooring. It can  
also be used for wall surfaces, tabletops, and fireplaces.  
Depending on the specific type and application of the marble, there  
are a variety of finishes available. These are some of the more com-  
mon types of finishes\:  
**Fine Rubbed\:** The marble surface receives a smooth finish  
free from scratches and without any sheen.  
**Honed\:** The marble receives a relatively smooth finish with a  
slight or somewhat dull sheen, generally producing no reflec-  
tions. It is produced by the use of polishing heads on sanded  
slabs.  
**Polished\:** The stone \(marble/granite\) receives a mirror gloss  
finish that produces relative sharp reflections.  
The following color plates show marble that is quarried in Greece;  
however, marbles with similar characteristics, color, and veining  
are available from many regions in the United States, and from  
many countries. The designer should realize that there is a far  
greater range of marbles than can be depicted in a book of this type.
