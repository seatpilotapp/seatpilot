# An Events Industry Takes Shape  
This timely book critically evaluates the factors which shape an events industry  
as it develops, with the aim of helping to narrow the disparate behaviours and  
practices of organisers within the global marketplace of international events.  
Stemming from an innovative qualitative research project, which included  
interviews with senior events organisers at landmark venues in both the UK and  
Poland, this volume provides an insight into both the emerging events industry in  
Poland and the developed events industry in the UK, highlighting cross-cultural  
risk and safety gaps that may impact organisers, clients, attendees, suppliers, and  
workers. The book highlights the importance of a unanimous global approach to  
events organisation, the creation of a professional community of practice, and  
ethos of self-learning within the events industry and the need for an international  
professional association for organisers involved with providing international  
events. The book explores the three themes of ‘Event Culture’, ‘Tourism and  
Events’, and ‘Risk Awareness at Events’, thus focusing on long-term factors of  
events industries.  
International in scope, this book will appeal to students on courses such as  
managing events, planning events, project management, and hospitality and  
tourism studies, as well as event organisers in locations where events is an  
emerging industry.

# 1.1 Purpose of This Book  
When a destination emerges into the global market for international events,  
the events industry in that country will have a different shape from a country  
which already has a long-established events industry. This is because a devel-  
oped events industry has matured over much time and has had many opportu-  
nities to evolve its regulations and practices in response to event experiences.  
A mature industry will also have evolved a socio-professional construct for  
event organisers to network for knowledge sharing, such as professional asso-  
ciations. However, a country which emerges into the global market for events  
is thrust into the marketplace without having evolved the shape of its events  
industry. The difference in shape between one events industry and another  
is important because clients, attendees, sponsors, and workers are exposed  
to gaps in quality, service, and safety, depending on which country an event  
happens to be taking place.  
An example of this is that one worker died during the build of the London  
2012 Olympics – which might be considered an isolated incident, yet still  
tragic – but ‘hundreds’ of construction workers died for the Sochi 2014 Olym-  
pics \(Shaw, Anin and Vdovii, 2015\), and 6,500 people died during construc-  
tion for the Qatar 2022 World Cup \(*The Guardian*, no date\). It can be seen  
in extremely serious terms, then, that there is a gap in the acceptance of risk  
between events held in the UK, Russia, and Qatar.  
Exacerbating this problem is that stakeholders of events are largely una-  
ware that there are gaps, what those gaps are, and what gaps are pertinent to  
which particular country. A worker at an event in Qatar, say, might unknow-  
ingly be closer to harm – or death – than if that worker were rigging an event  
in the UK.  
It is not only workers who are exposed to gaps. Most organisers of events  
\(clients\) book venues abroad but might not be aware of the gaps in the coun-  
try which they choose for their event. The gaps to which a client might be  
exposed could be in areas of quality, service, professionalism, knowledge,  
experience, or safety. And consumers who travel abroad to attend an event  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781032684161-1 2 *Introduction*  
\(event tourists\) are more prone to being unknowingly exposed to those gaps in  
quality, service, professionalism, knowledge, experience, or safety, depending  
upon where they choose to travel to attend an event.  
This being so, little is known about the nature of an events industry, how  
it evolves, what factors shape its evolvement, and what impacts are felt by  
stakeholders due to differences between the shape of a young events industry  
and one which has matured. That is what this book is about\: it reveals factors  
which influence the shape of an events industry as it develops and the causes  
of differences between an established shape and an emerging shape.  
There are many areas where gaps in events might occur. However, the  
three themes in this book – Culture of Events, Tourism and Events, and  
Risk Awareness at Events – are derived from the author’s insider knowledge  
as critical factors in shaping an events industry. These three key areas are  
central to managing events at international level, where it is crucial to be  
non-variable.  
**Event Culture** defines the socio-professional cultural construct of the events  
industry in the two destinations that are the focus of this book\: the UK and  
Poland.  
**Tourism and Events** are inseparable when managing international events for  
foreign clients and travelling consumers – ‘event tourists’.  
**Risk Awareness** is vital across the global market for international events  
where gaps would expose event tourists to risk and harm.  
There are other important elements of events that might have been considered  
such as technology or sustainability. But these are fast-changing and ever-  
moving in the marketplace and might not provide credible and consistent  
insights for the purpose of this book, which is to determine factors that shape  
an events industry. Technology, for instance, is variable depending upon the  
availability of equipment and specialist expertise, an event’s budget, the com-  
plexity of an event and the resources required to produce that event, and the  
technical resources *in situ* at venues. Sustainability is becoming widespread  
but is a variable component dependent upon local laws as the driver, social  
attitudes, trends, and consumer-driven demand. This means elements such as  
technology and sustainability are unstable factors, whereas this book is con-  
cerned with factors of an events industry which must not be unstable, must  
not be variable, and must not have gaps. For it is the purpose of this book  
to highlight disparities in the global market for international events so that  
the gaps might get identified, recognised, understood, studied and researched,  
and, ultimately, narrowed.  
The author has lived and worked in both the UK and Poland events indus-  
tries for ten years, respectively. The events industry in Poland is in develop-  
ment, which is a stage of growth the UK events industry has already been *Introduction* 3  
through and emerged from. The different stages of development of events  
industries in different locations are why gaps appear within the global market-  
place for international events. This is problematic because events management  
is an increasingly global phenomenon reaching emerging locations, which is  
evidenced by mega-events such as the Rio Olympics in 2016 \(Davies, 2017\),  
the 2014 World Cup in Rio De Janeiro \(FIFA, 2014\), and the 2012 Union of  
European Football Associations \(UEFA\) European football championship in  
Poland and Ukraine \(UEFA, 2016\).  
The orientation for this book is in sociology – in particular, the socio-  
professional structure and social positioning of the events industry in the UK  
and in Poland – to understand the behaviours, approaches, and practices of  
event organisers in these two locations.  
# 1.2 Book Structure  
Chapter 1 underpins why the book and its outcomes have credibility because  
of the author’s authority as a former producer of prestigious events in all gen-  
res for royalty, corporates, and global music stars. The author is now an aca-  
demic with a PhD, a researcher, and textbook author.  
Chapter 2 concerns the theme of ‘Event Culture’ to determine the socio-  
professional cultural construct of a developed events industry \(the UK\),  
and a developing events industry \(Poland\). The chapter contextualises fac-  
tors which shape an events industry into a socio-professional construct of  
professional associations, events as a profession, formal qualifications, and  
operations such as after-event evaluation procedures, and setting objectives  
for every event, every time. At the conclusion of the chapter, the reader will  
understand why the shape of the socio-professional structure has influence on  
how organisers do their job, and the impacts upon their clients and attendees.  
Of note is how an events industry can manipulate its shape to narrow the  
gaps across the global marketplace of international events by constructing an  
environment where organisers learn from each other, their foreign clients, and  
their international attendees. Organisers in an emerging construct can learn  
from what has already happened in a developed construct which has been  
through experiences that have influenced its shape. Because of this, there is a  
role for tragedy in preventing an emerging industry from having to experience  
pain for themselves. Another factor of note is the need for organisers to be  
led to recognise their need to create for themselves an environment of self-  
learning where they interact with the socio-professional construct for accul-  
turation learning in areas such as best practice, safety, training, accreditation,  
and learning about new legislations.  
Chapter 3 presents the second theme of ‘Tourism and Events’, which is  
an essential component of international events at landmark venues in capi-  
tal cities, which, in this book, is London and Warsaw. The chapter explores 4 *Introduction*  
event tourism, the trend of tourism, penetrating foreign markets, the inter-  
nationalisation of events, and the experience economy. Of note is the differ-  
ence between the developed and the emerging construct in their approaches  
to foreign business. The former is dynamic and proactive with a plurality of  
approaches to win foreign business; the latter is passive, non-interventionalist  
and waits for foreign business to arrive. Also covered in the chapter is the  
impact on events in hotels when an events industry takes shape, and why  
hotels lose events business. This leads to a section on gaps in service quality  
being accepted as a lower tier of event quality and safety because of practices  
becoming embedded in the socio-professional culture at that location.  
Chapter 4 examines the theme of ‘Risk Awareness at Events’, which is an  
essential theme for every event organiser, everywhere. The chapter addresses  
the management of risk at events, how organisers are learning about risk,  
variances in levels of accepting risk, organisers’ attitude to risk, learning from  
experience, the self-learning environment, and considering the risks to con-  
sumers \(consumer risk perspective\). Although it is identified in the chapter  
that there are omissions in risk control procedures by organisers in both the  
developed and developing constructs, the reader will understand why organ-  
isers fail to manage risk, why organisers in different locations have variant  
levels of risk acceptance, and why clients and attendees are closer to harm at  
an event happening in one location over another.  
Lastly, there are notes from the author on the outcomes of this book.  
# 1.3 Context of This Book  
This book stems from an original research project described by Dr Nicole  
Ferdinand of Oxford Brookes University as ‘one of the extremely rare cross-  
cultural studies of the event industry’ and ‘a worthwhile contribution to  
\[the\] field’. Dr Gary Armstrong of City, University of London, defined the  
original study as a ‘most unusual topic \[which\] provides for a much-needed  
insight into how various large-scale leisure events are both considered and  
delivered’.  
The UK is selected as representative of an events industry at an established  
stage because it is one of the world’s most developed event industries in terms  
of destination infrastructures, venues, and service suppliers, with 1.3 million  
events in 2017 in the ‘business’ sector alone. The Business Visits and Events  
Partnership \(BVEP\) \(Business Visits and Events Partnership, 2020\) estimates  
that the UK events industry is worth £70 billion and accounts for over 50  
percent of the UK visitor economy. The UK events industry employs over  
700,000 people in the sector \(BVEP, 2020\) and is ranked fifth in the top 20  
cities ranked by the number of meetings organised in 2017 \(Conference &  
Incentive Travel, 2018\), after Barcelona, Paris, Vienna, and Berlin. Selec-  
tion of the UK as a developed construct is further justified by the turnover *Introduction* 5  
of £340.1 million by the top ten UK event agencies \(Conference & Incen-  
tive Travel, 2018\) and the rise in applications for event management courses  
\(AEME, 2008, cited in Goldblatt, 2014\). London was ranked as the top EMEA  
\(Europe, Middle East, Africa\) destination for meetings and event planners in  
2018 \(*Conference News*, 2019\). Still, the UK events potential is continuing to  
evolve and is not stagnant, which is indicated by a submitted planning appli-  
cation to construct a £200 million global event campus in the Glasgow area  
\(Wood, 2018\). Within the UK events industry construct, this book focuses on  
London as the comparative capital city to Warsaw.  
Poland is selected as representative of an emerging and developing  
events industry with the meetings industry contributing an estimated 1.5 per-  
cent to gross domestic product, employing 220,000 in the meetings sector,  
and 2,031,589 consumers attending events \(Buczak *et al*., 2020\). The Poland  
events industry is in rapid growth stage, with the International Congress and  
Convention Association reporting an increase in the number of meetings  
held in Poland \(with the criteria of lasting at least three days and with at  
least 300 consumers of which at least 40 percent are foreign\) as increasing  
from 150 in 2009 to 230 in 2019 \(Buczak *et al*., 2020\). The Poland Conven-  
tion Bureau reports that just 15 percent of corporate events in Poland are  
of foreign group origin compared to 85 percent domestic, and 9 percent of  
events are hosted in congress centres and 16 percent in event venues, com-  
pared to 65 percent hosted in hotels \(Buczak *et al*., 2020\). The same report  
shows that trade exhibitions are just 7 percent from foreign origin compared  
to 93 percent domestic, demonstrating how Poland is not yet penetrating  
foreign markets for international event clients and events which attract for-  
eign event consumers. Although Poland has already emerged into the global  
marketplace for international events, the ‘origin’ \(Buczak *et al*., 2020\) statis-  
tics demonstrate that Poland has yet to increase the level of events business  
available to draw from foreign markets. Warsaw makes for a comparative  
capital city to London.  
# 1.3.1 Acknowledging Poland’s Post-Communist Society  
While this book is focused on the socio-professional cultural construct of an  
events industry taking shape, it must be acknowledged that the events industry  
in Poland exists in the cultural and societal contexts of a communist legacy,  
in contrast with the UK events industry having evolved in a long-standing  
democratic society. This does impact the shape of the two comparative event  
industries but not in a way that is detrimental to the outcomes presented in  
this book. In fact, this difference strengthens the need for understanding  
the causes of gaps in all locations across the global market for international  
events. Poland is one of the fastest-growing economies worldwide and the  
fastest-growing economy in Europe and was the only country in the European 6 *Introduction*  
Union \(EU\) to avoid recession during the financial crisis of 2008 \(Bogdan  
*et al*., 2015\). Since the 1990s there has been enhanced competitiveness of  
Polish industry and narrowing of the gap between Poland and the EU, which  
is driving Poland closer to the standards and structures of other EU countries  
\(Domański, 2003\). These factors fit well with the cross-cultural comparative  
study of an emerging events industry and a developed events industry, identi-  
fying differences in the behaviour and practices of the two sectors, and what  
gaps exist and how they might be narrowed.  
In 1989, Poland was the first country to leave communism peacefully and  
form the world’s first post-communist government \(Kemp-Welch, 2008\). The  
fall of socialist ideology brought rapid and profound social change and devel-  
opment, which continues to have long-lasting impacts on social class, social  
change, modernity, globalisation, and identity \(Outhwaite and Ray, 2005\).  
The evolution of a post-communist society has been described as democrati-  
sation backwards, suggesting the search to identify with democratic alliances  
such as the EU, which Poland joined in 2004 \(Lane and Wolanski, 2009\).  
This is further reason why planned events provide a suitable and appropriate  
framework for this book, because it is a visible and obvious evolution of an  
industry identifying with the global market. In doing so, Poland has rapidly  
emerged onto the world stage for international events by hosting significant  
international events, including the UEFA European Football Championship  
in 2012 and the COP24 United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2018,  
but also in promoting Poland as a destination for event tourist clients and  
consumers.  
The disparity in the fabric of society between the UK and Poland will  
have bearing upon the outcomes presented in this book. For one thing, How-  
ard \(2006\) observes that the Polish state had not provided the resources and  
support for the organisation of a civil society, which contrasts with the UK.  
But in modern Poland there are resemblances to a constitutional system,  
because the cornerstone of reform in Poland was the Local Self-Government  
Act, which drew heavily on the Council of Europe’s European Charter for  
Local Self-Government \(Howard, 2006\).  
Communist versus democratic societal differences aside, this book does  
squarely meet its objective of identifying how emerging event industries take  
shape in the context of the global market for international events. It is the socio-  
professional cultural construct of an events industry in the context of its  
location which is the focus of this book, not the wider sociological or cul-  
tural implications of any particular society. Every location will have its  
peculiarities and idiosyncrasies fashioned from its society, history, and cul-  
tural development, regardless of whether that location is post-communist or  
not, which is why the outcomes presented in this book relate to any emerg-  
ing industry, anywhere. *Introduction* 7  
# 1.4 Background of the Original Study  
This book is based on an original study by the author to determine factors  
which shape the development of an events industry by identifying differences  
in the behaviours and practices of organisers in an emerging events industry  
with one that is already established.  
The study objective was to research event organisers in both the UK and  
Poland within the socio-professional context of the events industry in which  
they live and work.  
Researchers agree that the global events market is a transient joined-up  
sociocultural community. But there is a void of cross-cultural research into  
the disparities between event locations at different stages of development.  
The differences not only are cultural but raise sociological implications in the  
management of events in different locations and the variance of exposure to  
which stakeholders \(clients, consumers, suppliers, sponsors, and workers\) are  
exposed.  
# 1.5 Credibility of This Book  
Twenty-four organisers were interviewed and observed as actors in their  
respective events industry and it is important to interpret the way they act  
in the UK and in Poland to draw similarities and/or differences. The original  
study utilises empiricism, which demands the capture of tangible evidence to  
substantiate interpretations and assumptions to acquire knowledge from the  
collection of observational data, and so it is fact-based rather than personal  
opinion or speculative imaginings \(King and Horrocks, 2012\). Empiricism  
facilitates reliance on the stories the interviewees are telling, which, although  
may be partial, is adequate for purpose \(Becker, 2007\). This means that the  
interpretations of the data are not derived from perspective but are grounded  
in the responses of 24 interviewees.  
It is not easy to separate interpretations from fact \(Becker, 2007\), and  
a fact in its social context implies and invites interpretation. It is therefore  
important to adopt interpretivism to interpret the stories being told during  
the interviews and to support autoethnographic insights. Veal \(2011\) points  
out that interpretivism involves participants providing their explanations  
of their situations or behaviours for the researcher to see the world from  
their point of view, which is the intention to subdue any presuppositions.  
Being an insider on the subject and knowing industry practices, jargon,  
and behaviours is helpful to interpret the actors’ storytelling during the  
in-depth interviews, led by the responses of the interviewees which in  
fact determines repetitive patterns of behaviours and practices across the  
population. 8 *Introduction*  
# 1.5.1 Interviews  
Twenty-four in-depth interviews are conducted with senior-level organis-  
ers at some of the best landmark venues in the UK and Poland. Seven-  
teen interviews are with UK organisers, and seven with Poland organisers,  
which elicits valuable and credible data and fulfils the requirements and  
objectives for the basis of this book. The data from the interviews show  
signs of repetition and saturation, leading to identifying patterns for data  
interpretation.  
Mason \(2014\) acknowledges that while qualitative interviewing involves  
what may seem to be a relatively small sample, it is made up for in the  
very rich data gathered. It is relevant to retain quality research over quan-  
tity research, which is underpinned by Muncey \(2010\) confirming that in  
the social sciences a large sample without rigorous control of variables  
produces inferior quality evidence. The interviews are further supported  
and underpinned with observations and autoethnography, which is a justi-  
fied research approach when the sample involves small numbers of people  
\(Muncey, 2010\).  
Semi-structured questions are used in the interviews to follow a set theme  
with each participant for consistency of analysis and comparison, but with the  
flexibility to vary the order of questions and ask further questions \(Saunders,  
Lewis and Thornhill, 2016\). Structured questions would restrict participants  
from exploring the themes being presented to them. Unstructured questions  
would not work either, because of the predetermined list of questions for com-  
parison and consistency \(Saunders, Lewis and Thornhill, 2016; Mason, 2014\)  
across the two locations of the UK and Poland.  
Interviews are recognised by Qu and Dumay \(2011\) as a way for  
researchers to learn about the world of others, which is the aim of the pri-  
mary research activity for this project. Insider knowledge of the events  
industry is helpful for quickly establishing a rapport with each interviewee.  
None of the interviewed organisers are familiar with providing their insights  
for a book and so could hold some trepidation of what is expected from  
them, what would happen, how the information they offer would be used,  
and would what they say be usable. Each interview does, in fact, provide  
rich and usable data.  
Knowledge of the Poland language allows the interviewer to insert Polish  
words to bond with the interviewee. Use of the language also allows inter-  
pretations on the intonations and phraseology when Poland interviewees are  
speaking English, and there are no identified barriers or misinterpretations due  
to language differences.  
The 24 senior-level event organisers at landmark venues in the UK and  
Poland can be considered as ‘representations of society’ \(Becker, 2007, p. 5\). *Introduction* 9  
There are classical definitions of what constitutes a landmark, including this  
from *Merriam-Webster* \(2021\)\: *A conspicuous object on land that marks a*  
*locality, or a structure such as a building of unusual historical and usually*  
*aesthetic interest, especially one that is officially designated and set aside for*  
*preservation*.  
Closer to the recognition of a landmark venue for the purpose of hosting an  
event can be found in the *Cambridge English Dictionary* \(2024\)\: *\[A\] building*  
*or place that is easily recognised, especially one that you can use to judge*  
*where you are*.  
These definitions help underpin justification that the venues identified for  
this project could be categorised as landmark. This is important for the use of  
like-for-like venues in both the UK and Poland, and by doing so, it defines the  
type of interviewee, their types of consumers, and their clients because typi-  
cally a landmark venue is in a prominent location, it is large, it is expensive to  
hire, and it will be known to consumers and clients.  
Although each landmark venue owns unique peculiarities \(Tonnelat,  
2009\) – which is what makes it a ‘landmark’ venue because it is not repli-  
cated anywhere else – the selecting of the right type of venue needs to fit with  
the three themes of this book \(Event Culture, Tourism and Events, and Risk  
Awareness at Events\).  
However, there are no definitions, classifications, or categorisations  
of landmark venues in current and available event literature, so a set of  
criteria for target venues is created and adopted. First, to determine what  
constitutes a ‘venue’ reflects the social practices of attending an event  
because the interpretation of what is a venue resides in social practice and  
not just ‘in the heads of individuals’ \(Dey, 1993, p. 11\). For those attend-  
ing a venue, they require further social practices such as getting to the  
venue, buying a ticket, and audience behaviour \(Sayer, 1992, cited in Dey,  
1993\). The culmination of the social practices and social construction in  
putting on an event for people to attend happens at the place where there  
is a live happening\: the venue \(Berners, 2013, 2017, 2019\). Thus, the set  
of characteristics for the sample of venues that would meet the project  
requirements is  
\[a\] building of significance that is known for hosting events \(is an event  
venue\); is built for the purpose of hosting events; is widely recognised in  
its location and is therefore easy to locate; and has a reputation for hosting  
large events \(capacity upwards of 200 attendees\).  
In London, this includes *Olympia* exhibition centre, which hosts over 200  
events each year with a maximum capacity of 7,000 consumers \(*Olympia* 10 *Introduction*  
*London*, 2018\); *ExCeL* convention centre, with over 400 events each year  
and over 4 million consumers annually \(*Visiting ExCeL*, 2021\); and The *o2*  
*Arena* hosting over 260 events each year, with a capacity of 20,000 \(*The o2*,  
2021\). In Warsaw, it includes the *National Stadium of Poland* \(*Stadion Naro-*  
*dowy*\), with a capacity of over 58,000 \(*PGE Narodowy – Warsaw National*  
*Stadium – The Stadium Guide*, no date\); the *Palace of Culture and Science*  
\(*Palac Kultury i Nauki/*PKiN\), which is an iconic 44-storey building in cen-  
tral Warsaw with ballroom, congress, and banqueting facilities and a capac-  
ity of 4,500 \(*Pałac Kultury i Nauki*, 2021\); and *The Royal Castle* \(*Zamek*  
*Krolewski*\) in Warsaw Old Town, which is a former royal residence of signifi-  
cant historical importance dating to 1598 and hosting a range of events from  
banquets, dinners, fashion events, and hosting dignitaries \(*zamek-krolewski.*  
*pl*, 2021\).  
Although all 24 interviewed organisers are white \(13 male/11 female\),  
which raises a socio-demographic question, the selection grounds the objec-  
tive to identify gaps between the UK and Poland events industries. Identifying  
interviewees is driven by, first, the criteria of the venue meeting the set criteria  
outlined earlier. Once the venue is identified as representative, it is the venue  
which leads, second, to the organiser at that venue. This two-step approach  
reinforces that the interviewee is legitimate for the purpose of the study and  
indeed employed at a high level of organising events and in a landmark venue.  
For anonymity purposes, there is a code for each of the interviewees. The  
anonymity code depicts within brackets the country of the interviewee, fol-  
lowed by the number of the participant, and a generic description of their type  
of venue. So, the label for Participant One in the UK who is an organiser at  
The o2 Arena is\: ‘\(UK1 – landmark arena venue\)’. Where a participant is not  
venue-based, the generic description is of their role, so the label for Partici-  
pant Four in Poland who is an organiser of charity events is\: ‘\(PL4 – organiser  
of charity events\)’.  
# 1.5.2 Observation  
Observation is a hallmark social research method for capturing unstructured  
qualitative data which, for this project, is not for observing the job of organisers  
and what they are doing but to substantiate the story they are telling \(Dey, 1993\).  
Plummer \(2019\) acknowledges that stories are weaved and interconnected with  
truth and fiction as determined by the storyteller. Observation is a tool for when  
each interview is concluded, to view the venue, for one, and extend the oppor-  
tunity for data capture in a more social and free setting. Besides, most organis-  
ers enjoy every opportunity to show their venue to a visitor.  
Governmental travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic halted  
in-person interviews and the observation of venues. So, video-call inter-  
views are used and ‘retro-observation’ drawing on recollections of each *Introduction* 11  
venue from when the author was an event practitioner in both the UK and  
Poland.  
The rationale for applying observation to corroborate what is being told  
in the interviews proves justified. For example, PL1 provides ‘straight A’  
answers which indicate their venue is excellent and without faults. However,  
observing a significant concert at that venue – which was the Warsaw leg of a  
worldwide tour – revealed unused chairs stacked in an emergency evacuation  
route, which is a fundamental error and breach of fire precaution laws.  
# 1.5.3 Autoethnography  
Autoethnography is a method which facilitates the use of studying the expe-  
riences in one’s own life as a means of illuminating more general social pro-  
cesses \(Hammersley and Atkinson, 2007\). Chang \(2008, p. 13\) describes the  
concept of culture as a ‘web of self and others’ and that the autoethnography  
research method utilises the researchers’ autobiographical data to analyse  
and interpret their cultural assumptions. Adopting autoethnography, then,  
utilises the author’s significant wealth of knowledge from a time when in  
the field.  
It should be noted that autoethnography is a method personal to the  
researcher\: autoethnography or ‘personal ethnography’ is a ‘first-person  
method’ of research \(Desjardins *et al*., 2021, p. 37\:4\), where the research-  
er’s first-hand experience is the starting point of knowledge production  
and can involve observing one’s own experience with a particular group  
or subculture. This is a first-hand study of society and culture in action  
\(Murchison, 2010\) but with the application of a biographical research  
method \(Chang, 2008\). Desjardins *et al*. \(2021\) point out that simply  
going into the field to write about it and the people being observed can  
be a distanced perspective, whereas employing autoethnography allows the  
researcher to input their own voice in their writing and provide an authorial  
voice in describing patterns.  
This book, then, is written from perspective and experiences which  
would be different from somebody with a different ethnicity, gender, and  
career profile. This bears influence on the outcomes, but they remain valid  
and representative because of the organisers and their perspectives, and  
because the interpretations are grounded with existing literature as well as  
empirical data.  
# 1.5.4 Validity and Reliability  
From an epistemological viewpoint, interpretation of the stories being told  
\(Becker, 2007\) during each interview could lead to subjectiveness. How-  
ever, Dey \(1993\) attributes that the difference between interpretation and 12 *Introduction*  
misinterpretation is in the reluctance to admit the possibility of misinterpret-  
ing data. Lakshmi and Mohideen \(2012\) point out that validity in research  
requires multiple sources of evidence which act as a representative sample,  
and that reliability is the degree of consistency in the measurement procedures  
leading to results. To meet these criteria, an acceptable level of interviews  
is conducted and triangulated with retrospective observation technique and  
autoethnography to identify patterns from the data and interpret valid and  
reliable findings to present the outcomes. **2 Event Culture**  
This chapter defines the socio-professional cultural construct of the events  
industry in the UK and in Poland. This is important in positioning where  
events sit in both a social and a cultural context of professional society in the  
two locations.  
The UK is further ahead with events than Poland, so the aim is to under-  
stand what factors influenced the UK events industry as it took shape and  
whether this is potentially helpful to shape the emergent Poland events indus-  
try. To be explicit, this book is not exploring or analysing wider cultural com-  
plexities outside the socio-professional construct of the events profession,  
such as religion, gender, clientelism, command cultures, or long-time demo-  
cratic versus post-communist nations.  
# 2.1 Cultural Context  
# 2.1.1 Professional Associations  
The socio-professional construct of the UK events industry is overcrowded  
with 42 industry associations \(Bowdin *et al*., 2011, p. 31\), which has the  
effect of causing confusion, such as which is the best association, why is one  
association different to another, and which association is a credible accredi-  
tation for its members. An events practitioner in the UK will find it difficult  
to know which or how many professional associations to join, or why they  
should join any. It is easier not to join and get on with the job of organising  
events to the best of their ability using the practical knowledge and expe-  
rience they gain along the way. The existence of many associations frag-  
ments the unity of collaboration, which is counterproductive to the purpose  
of industry associations. It is a point realised by Bowdin *et al*. \(2011\), who  
note the need for consolidation to happen for the industry to move forward. It  
seems, then, that as the events industry in the UK developed, it has impeded  
itself.  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781032684161-2 14 *Event Culture*  
Nonetheless, UK organisers are benefitting from participating with profes-  
sional associations. They gain training, knowledge of industry best practices,  
networking opportunities, and knowledge sharing. They also gain accredita-  
tion and compliance from some of the industry bodies such as National Exam-  
ination Board in Occupational Safety and Health \(NEBOSH\) and PRojects IN  
Controlled Environments \(PRINCE2\).  
The problem is that there are so many professional associations in the UK  
for an organiser to participate – they will not know them all and cannot par-  
ticipate with each. It thus becomes a lottery of knowing which to join, if any,  
and is off-putting.  
In contrast, with the few associations already emerging in Poland, such  
as the Poland Convention Bureau, and Poland Meetings, Incentives, Con-  
ferences, Exhibitions \(MICE\), organisers in Poland are blissfully not being  
bombarded with professional associations vying for membership sign-up with  
promises of benefits and teaching the right way of doing things. It is easier for  
organisers in Poland to navigate their way to belonging to industry bodies and  
can thus bind the industry. If the few associations are wise, they will absorb  
more organiser-members as the industry expands and professionalises, rather  
than establish more associations. This is certainly good for the associations  
and will continue holding the industry together for knowledge sharing and  
networking within the few industry networks.  
While their events industry forms its shape, Poland can learn from the  
glut of professional associations in the UK events industry. In its develop-  
mental stages, Poland could learn that if the number of associations grows  
with the growth of the industry, it will splinter the cohesion of the events  
industry as has happened in the UK. But it will prove difficult for Poland  
to curtail the growth of associations. First, it would require legislation to  
restrict associations from springing up, which is unlikely to happen because  
it cannot be considered a legal problem requiring the protection of law. Also,  
restrictions by the State on what would be considered as the growth of an  
industry will be unpopular and would recall the former state of commu-  
nism. Second, growth is organic and changeable, so who is to determine  
how many associations should there be to support the industry, and how  
many is enough, and how many is too many. Poland, therefore, is unlikely to  
avoid the disadvantages of oversaturation of professional associations in the  
socio-professional construct of their events industry until it becomes unsus-  
tainable and hinders the cohesion of their events industry. By this time it is  
impossible to reverse.  
In the meantime, before Poland reaches that level of overabundance of  
professional associations, there are too few and their events industry is taking  
shape without a socio-professional construct of support, learning, and knowl-  
edge transfer and is driving an autonomous culture in the Poland profession  
of organising events. *Event Culture* 15  
What is required is a balance between just enough associations to cohere  
and professionalise the profession but not too many that will confuse and frag-  
ment the industry to the point of anti-coherence which is the antithesis of the  
objective of professional associations. The problem is that the development of  
an industry is organic and ever-changing so will always be difficult to measure  
the ‘right’ level of professional associations. Nevertheless, it is helpful to be  
aware of the implications of oversaturation.  
Regardless of the above arguments as to how many professional associa-  
tions should there be, they will serve some purpose to organisers of events.  
Even though the UK events industry has reached the point of being awash  
with associations, UK organisers evidence benefits from engaging with some  
of the range of industry bodies available to them\:  
*The typical ones for us would be the Association of Event Venues* \[AEV\]  
*and the Association of Event Organisers* \[AEO\] . . . *Sharing best practice*  
*and helping to elevate the standards of our industry. We’d be in competi-*  
*tion with other venues but actually the other side of it as a group of venues*  
*across the country it’s our job is to collectively improve our standards and*  
*offer our customers the best that they can possibly get*.  
\(UK4 – landmark convention centre\)  
This organiser recognises the value of collaboration, with the goal of furthering  
industry best practice. They place value in collaboration above the perceived  
threat or fear of competition. Socialising with like-minded professionals has  
the effect to dissipate the fear of competition because organisers will realise  
there is enough business to go around and that other organisers actually pursue  
a wide range of event genres from other sources and other markets.  
Even when organisers are in direct competition – such as within the lim-  
ited socio-professional construct of an emerging location – they can learn  
from each other and get better \(the self-learning paradigm\) through competi-  
tive advantage, and this should be encouraged to happen. So, the threat or fear  
of competition is outweighed by the need to self-develop through participat-  
ing in the socio-professional construct of the events industry whether it is  
developed or emerging.  
The impetus for education and professionalism in an events industry is  
driven by an individual organiser’s recognition for self-improvement of their  
performance, rather than by the demands of consumers, or even the insurance  
industry responding to past tragedies. However, the need to comply with leg-  
islation must be a motivating factor for the individual organiser or the com-  
pany they work for, so it is reasonable to state that the law is in fact the key  
driver for professionalism. This is unsurprising because, so far, the events  
industry has abstained from requiring or even acknowledging the merits of  
professional education or qualifications. 16 *Event Culture*  
Until events management as an education discipline evolved in the UK,  
nobody in the events industry was interested in an organiser’s education or  
qualifications. This is why some firms and individuals are trusted implicitly in  
this industry because of their reputation. Experience builds knowledge, and so  
an organiser becomes trusted based on what they have done before. The quality  
and profile of events which an organiser has produced, or the reputation of their  
venue, outweigh any qualifications. In an emerging events industry – as is the  
case in Poland – specialist formal education is not valued.  
The previous excerpt from an interviewee shows that this organiser is keen  
to share best practice and participate with elevating the standards of their  
industry. This is important because knowledge, and how knowledge is identi-  
fied, collated, and shared, is at the centre of events management \(Brown and  
Stokes, 2021\). This organiser does not want to work autonomously within the  
limited parameters of their own venue but takes a holistic view of the industry  
to which they belong.  
Events in the UK is a fiercely competitive industry to win clients, because  
there are many players in the market, and venues are in direct competition  
with each other – particularly in London where there is a greater range of  
landmark venues from which to choose. It is surprising, therefore, that an  
organiser in London would not be concerned about competition but show  
their willingness to work as a wider collective in order to maintain and  
enhance industry knowledge and best practice. This might be true of an  
organiser at a secure landmark venue which enjoys high-volume and high-  
spend business levels. An organiser at a smaller or independent venue might  
not be as open to sharing in the competitive marketplace. This is a barrier to  
networking within the socio-professional structure of both a developed and  
an emerging industry.  
Nevertheless, there is evidence in the UK events industry of a community  
of practice \(Brown and Stokes, 2021\) in action which connects event profes-  
sionals to a community with modes of working, shared values, and practices.  
This helps in amalgamating the industry and will go some way to forming  
standardised practices albeit at a local \(domestic\) level. Becker \(1984\) cat-  
egorises such communities of collaboration as an ‘art world’ consisting of  
people whose activities are needed for the production of art, and that these  
same people would co-operate as an established network of links among those  
engaging within the field for benefits such as networking and knowledge shar-  
ing\: ‘If everyone whose work contributes to the finished artwork does not do  
his part, the work will come out differently’ \(Becker, 1984, p. xxiv\).  
All organisers rely on an art world because the nature of organising events  
requires the procurement of resources from a diverse range of specialisms  
such as technical, catering, floristry, decoration, safety, and security. Even a  
highly experienced organiser who is proficient in their role cannot be a spe-  
cialist in all areas nor perform them all. But it is their role to bring all the ele-  
ments together and oversee them for the purpose of a successful event. *Event Culture* 17  
Poland has not yet evolved a socio-professional network of industry-related  
professional associations important for supporting event organisers and pro-  
viding a culture of collaboration instead of competition. This difference is not  
surprising between a developed industry and one that is in its forming stages.  
However, it reveals a gap in the wider global market for international events  
because the absence of the opportunity for organisers to network within a  
supportive and collaborative environment leaves them at a disadvantage and  
behind a developed event industry\:  
*On all these forums they arrange staff training days* . . . *the advice is free*  
*and you can share the issues. When you look at a problem you’ve got,*  
*you’re probably not the first person to have that problem and other people*  
*will have experience of it. I think it’s learning from the best practice of oth-*  
*ers, having benchmarking groups where you can share information, and*  
*learning from others’ successes and failures*.  
\(UK5 – organiser of local authority events\)  
This statement is spoken from the perspective of an organiser who is already  
participating with professional associations and reflecting on the benefits they  
are receiving. Poland organisers are not receiving such benefits because of  
the absence of professional associations in the limited socio-professional con-  
struct at that location.  
It raises the implication of how organisers in an emerging industry are  
developing their way of organising events if they are doing so naively and  
autonomously. The previously mentioned point about competition is likely a  
factor because there are fewer landmark venues in the location of the emerg-  
ing market. Thus, competition is fierce and organisers will be less willing to  
engage with a wider socio-professional network, even if it were available to  
them. Perceived competition is a barrier which could be mitigated through  
closer-aligned working relationships across the socio-professional construct,  
which professional associations do facilitate.  
Poland organisers are not exempt from rapid cultural changes, and they  
do need to be part of a socio-professional network to identify and understand  
trends and changes in the events marketplace. In both the UK and Poland,  
the uptake of social media, updated regulations and legislations, advances in  
technology, and new trends such as sustainability and dietary awareness are  
driving consumer demand\:  
*People are much more aware of sustainability and also wellbeing. Wellbe-*  
*ing and sustainability are the two key things that people keep asking for*  
*at the moment. In terms of how events have changed, that comes into it*  
*because people are looking at sustainability so that they don’t have to fly*  
*thousands of miles to get groups of people over from one end of the thing*  
*to the other* . . . *That’s what the industry basically says as well in terms* 18 *Event Culture*  
*of a lot of the people I’ve spoken to over the last six months or so*. . . .  
*Current trends are sustainability. We have a lot of CSR policies as well*  
*in place so that we can show people we do community engagement and*  
*charity work, as well. In addition to that, wellbeing is a huge talking point*  
*at the moment. We have an entire floor of the hotel, level 4, dedicated to*  
*wellbeing. Previous to that it was all about rooftop gardens and private*  
*dining rooms. They still come up but the two key trends are sustainability*  
*and wellbeing*.  
\(UK13 – sales account director\)  
It can be seen from this organiser how important it is to win business by  
promoting trends as added-value amenities. It requires organisers having  
to very quickly and constantly adapt their offer to meet changing client and  
consumer trends, which are recognised from networking in the industry.  
Lenski, Nolan and Lenski \(2014\) refer to change as ‘socio-cultural evolu-  
tion’ resulting from a society gaining new information and new technology.  
Organisers in an emerging environment must anticipate trends or identify  
them but this will be difficult if performing in a shape without a socio-  
professional construct. Reacting to trends already taking place is too late  
because it takes time to pivot services and the trend could already have  
changed. This means that an emerging events industry will always be try-  
ing to catch up or, worse, always be behind the curve of trends. Besides, a  
newly shaping events industry needs to remain sustainable and continue to  
emerge until stable and, eventually, developed. Thus, competition cannot be  
considered as a barrier to socio-professional networks and engagement but  
should instead be seen as a supportive and collaborative art world or com-  
munity of practice for the collective events industry, and the actors within  
it, to win business.  
There are benefits from engaging with industry associations and the  
socio-professional network because it influences the way organisers do their  
job if they are exposed to professional elements such as knowledge sharing  
and knowledge transfer. Hanquinet and Savage \(2016\) see this as infusing  
social actions with culture through representations, narratives, and structures  
informing, regulating, and shaping social actions. Organisers in a young  
events industry are bereft of this influence but it can be seen in action in the  
developed community of practice in the UK with organisers benefitting from  
networking, communication and liaison, training, codes of ethical practice,  
and lobbying on behalf of their members \(Bowdin *et al*., 2011\)\:  
*Being part of international associations we have exposure to meetings,*  
*conferences, seminars* . . . *we do a lot of work with the AEV* \[Association  
of Event Venues\]*, I chair the event management committee of that associa-*  
*tion and we talk a lot about working with international clients and how we* *Event Culture* 19  
*as UK venues set best practice, especially safety, how we set standards of*  
*best practice*.  
\(UK6 – landmark convention centre\)  
This raises another dimension for participating with industry associations  
because some organisers view it as important to be associated with profes-  
sional associations for reasons other than networking and knowledge shar-  
ing, but for accreditation purposes. This seems particularly true with Poland  
organisers in the shaping industry who seek accreditation from belonging to  
the few industry-related associations that do exist such as the Poland Con-  
vention Bureau \(*Poland Convention Bureau*, 2020\) and Polish MICE \(*MICE*  
*Meetings Incentives Conferences Events Incoming Tour Operator*, 2018\).  
Poland organisers seek to belong to the narrow range of professional asso-  
ciations for accreditation of their services to be recognised as bona fide. It is  
accreditation, rather than seeking a learning environment, which is driving  
organisers in Poland to join a professional association. Although, learning is  
a benefit which may become realised after joining. The motivation to join a  
professional association in the Poland events industry, then, is foremost for  
accreditation and/or marketing purposes.  
This is helpful with the professionalisation of the emerging industry  
because organisers who participate with professional bodies – for whatever  
reason – will learn the regulations and legislations to which they must comply.  
Such regulations and legislations are brought about from previous disasters at  
events, so the industry is in fact shaping itself around the learning from previ-  
ous mistakes. It is the law, then, which drives organisers to professionalise  
their behaviours and practices.  
The problem with accreditation is that it does not mean much to anybody  
outside the industry’s socio-professional network, such as consumers and per-  
sonal clients who likely do not know what the accreditation body is or does.  
Although it is true that corporate clients and MICE clients will be aware of  
some of the accreditation bodies, so if that is the organiser’s client base, it  
would be helpful to display those accreditations. In general, however, most  
attendees and many clients will not understand why the organiser is accred-  
ited, and it is not a qualification or membership of a required institution such  
as a university teacher being accredited by the Higher Education Academy,  
say, so it carries limited value.  
There are benefits for organisers being accredited to some of the indus-  
try affiliations and doing so might mean personal and professional devel-  
opment and a requirement to uphold a level of standards, which is a good  
thing. But when observing the developing Poland events industry, affiliated  
accreditations tend to be primarily for marketing purposes, rather than for  
the purpose of knowledge gain and transfer. In this case, they will not make  
much headway in bringing Poland organisers closer to the standardisation of 20 *Event Culture*  
event management practices or narrow the gaps between events in Poland  
and other locations within the international events community, which is a lost  
opportunity.  
Reflecting towards the hospitality sector – which remains a closely related  
sector to events – there are accreditations which have reached recognition by  
consumers\: for example, the Michelin Star or the AA quality rating systems.  
The global events industry could achieve this as well if it managed to estab-  
lish an international accreditation not only for industry professionals but also  
for consumers \(clients and attendees\) to recognise excellence in areas such  
as qualifications, training, experience, safety, quality, service, and standards.  
# 2.1.2 Events as a Profession  
The presence of industry associations professionalises an industry, although  
Klegon \(1978\) questions the definitional criteria by which professions can be  
distinguished from non-professions. Macionis and Plummer \(1998, p. 435\)  
categorise ‘profession’ as ‘work based on theoretical knowledge, occupa-  
tional autonomy, authority over clients and a claim to serving the community’.  
But Klegon \(1978\) persists that for this approach to be viable a consistent set  
of traits of professions need applying with limited ambiguity. Perhaps this is  
why Pierre Bourdieu uses the concept of a ‘field of forces’ \(Harker, Mahar  
and Wilkes, 1990, p. 8\), which he developed after personal experiences ‘in the  
field’ in order to examine the social space in which interactions, transactions,  
and events occur \(Grenfell, 2012\).  
The discourse, however, has moved from the ‘sociology of professions’ to  
the ‘sociology of professional knowledge’ because of the need to distinguish  
professions from other occupations and the need to deploy expert knowl-  
edge in minor occupations and semi-professions \(Young and Muller, 2014\).  
Yet Eyal and Pok \(no date\) argue the case for the ‘sociology of expertise’  
because profession is about fields and jurisdictions whereas expertise con-  
siders spaces between fields. Whatever it gets called, each recognises how  
expert knowledge distinguishes professions from other occupations and that  
all professions involve some practical expertise, which leads to considering  
knowledge as a qualifier of expert occupations. Applying this to the culture  
of the events industry in the UK identifies that the UK does have a profes-  
sional industry, and so does Poland – it is just that each are at different stages  
of development\:  
*Developed through knowledge and experience*.  
\(UK7 – landmark conference centre\)  
\[No qualifications\] *but practical experience*.  
\(PL2 – landmark venue\) *Event Culture* 21  
\[My\] *formal education was within the process of preparing for Euro2012*  
*because within the company policy we had some project management – it*  
*wasn’t event management but project management. Apart from this it was*  
*through experience mainly. More experience and less formal education*.  
\(PL6 – landmark convention centre\)  
These excerpts, and others from the interviewed organisers, demonstrate  
how organisers in both the developed and developing constructs value their  
knowledge above their need to study for an events qualification. This mind-  
set determines the direction of how the culture of an event industry takes  
shape without the presence of a community of practice to evolve the learn-  
ing of how to do the job, which then becomes embedded as the normal way  
of doing things.  
It is characteristic of Bourdieu’s ‘habitus’ concept \(Grenfell, 2012\),  
whereby social practices are characterised by the occurrence of regularities  
without the presence of rules to dictate practices. This was observed by Mar-  
ciszewska \(no date, cited in Smith and Robinson, 2009\) that a knowledge-  
based economy is emerging in Poland to replace the previously dominant  
national culture, which she attributes to the impact of intense competition  
brought about by globalisation in the sectors of culture and tourism. Douglas  
and Wildavsky \(1982\) alluded to this as well by informing that we owe our  
current perspective to modernisation.  
The concern is that if knowledge has developed through Poland’s way  
of doing things, it does not make it the right way of doing things, although  
Foucault recognises that strange practices are actually governed by structural  
codes of knowledge \(Carrabine, 2007\). Perhaps it is just different knowledge  
and might even be skewed by sociocultural factors such as emerging from a  
communist regime.  
As an industry professionalises, it requires a culture of regulation and edu-  
cation in both the ‘*re*-production’ of knowledge and experience from one gen-  
eration to the next and ‘*pro*-duction’ through the generation of new knowledge  
\(Bourdieu, 1973, cited in Harker, Mahar and Wilkes, 1990\). Until recently,  
however, the events industry in the UK has eschewed formal education or  
qualifications in events management. This is mainly due to the relative new-  
ness of the discipline, because until recently there was no provision of univer-  
sity courses in events management.  
The recognition of professionalism for an organiser, then, has been driven  
by testimonials, reputation, networking, client portfolios, and job history –  
not by their education or qualifications. In fact, this is why some firms and  
individuals are trusted implicitly and their word and abilities are considered  
as more significant than any qualifications.  
Trust is all-powerful in winning event jobs because a client is making the  
decision to place the success of their event in the hands of an organiser. A client 22 *Event Culture*  
will not place their trust in qualifications but in the demonstrable experience  
and knowledge of the organiser. Likewise, an organiser cannot convey trust  
to a potential client by qualifications alone but will need to demonstrate their  
portfolio of clients and successes. This is where accreditation from profes-  
sional associations plays its part because clients might be impressed \(at least,  
in part\) with an organiser’s membership of ‘authoritative’ bodies.  
# 2.1.3 Qualifications  
There is a noticeable shift in the developed industry’s recognition of qualifica-  
tions since universities in the UK started providing degrees in events manage-  
ment. Recruiters are now requiring a relevant qualification when advertising  
their job vacancies. This in turn requires applicants to meet that requirement.  
Thus, entrants to the industry need to be more employable and are seeking  
knowledge of organising events while gaining a recognised qualification.  
There is a plurality of learning needs here, with entrants in the developed  
industry requiring both practical skills and theoretical knowledge. Students of  
events management instinctively recognise these two needs, but Higher Edu-  
cation Institutions \(HEIs\) are slow to respond. In fact, HEIs have moved from  
providing practical skills because it is not considered ‘academic’. Although  
work placements in industry during an events course are somewhat fulfilling  
the need for practical experience alongside an academic qualification, where  
an HEI does facilitate practical skills, the institution will be serving the needs  
of students and the industry which employs their graduates.  
While junior entrants in the developed industry can reproduce knowledge  
from current senior organisers, it will not be knowledge gained from the  
source of formal education because it was not available to senior organis-  
ers at the time when they set out to organise events. Because of this, junior  
entrants might learn poor practices or omissions of certain procedures from  
their managers.  
The same is true in the emerging industry because senior-level organisers  
will not have had access to formal education, so junior entrants will reproduce  
knowledge from the way senior-level organisers are doing things. However,  
the new generation of organisers in the UK who are graduating with qualifica-  
tions in the art of managing events will produce new knowledge to implement  
with their future roles and transfer it to their senior organisers, thus importing  
formal knowledge to the industry\:  
*One of them has a degree in event management – one of my event plan-*  
*ners in my ops* \[operations\] *team has a degree in event management from*  
*Bournemouth*. . . . *I have worked with people who have got an event man-*  
*agement degree though in various different roles*.  
\(UK14 – portfolio of royal museum venues\) *Event Culture* 23  
This organiser presents evidence of knowledge transfer from a team member  
who brings formal education in event specialism to the team. This is a key  
factor for positively manipulating the shape of an events industry by edu-  
cating junior entrants in the specialisms of managing events, who then enter  
the industry and transfer their education to other practitioner organisers and  
senior organisers who are organising events with knowledge only. This dem-  
onstrates how the developed industry shifted shape from a previous stance of  
abstaining from formal education and professional qualifications. An emerg-  
ing and developing industry will organically develop in the same way, but it  
would be helpful if this were known so that the shape could be consciously  
steered this way. It would be a quicker transition to providing courses to junior  
entrants who will import their formal education to current organisers.  
The following excerpt is an even clearer example of junior entrants import-  
ing their formal education to the UK events industry to influence senior-level  
organisers\:  
*We’re quite an old department – except for one person we’re all over*  
*50 and that means our education is a mix of formal and operational*  
*experience – but formal in hotels rather than events. The reason for that*  
*is that when I went into education, as far as I remember there were only*  
*two universities that did formal degrees in events – and the whole events*  
*education format has just absolutely mushroomed and now there are a*  
*huge number of people who go and do events in universities all over the*  
*place. One of the challenges that we find is the dynamic between us as*  
*older people and the type of organiser-client we are encountering and*  
*providing service for. They are half our age and come from a very differ-*  
*ent background of A-levels straight into a university events degree. It’s a*  
*very interesting dynamic between a 22 or 23-year-old who has the title*  
*‘event manager’ and myself who is 58 who has the title ‘event manager’*  
*and we are two entirely different people. You have to be quite careful with*  
*your language when dealing with a client who is half my age in that you*  
*can’t be demeaning in any way shape or form because they very much take*  
*exception. Strangely, you are managing the relationship before you are*  
*managing the function*.  
\(UK15 – landmark event hotel\)  
This organiser recognises being taught by new entrants who are *organiser-clients*  
bringing their events business to the hotel. It demonstrates a plural-  
ity of learning because the former organiser was learning from educated  
team members, whereas this organiser is learning from educated clients.  
Because clients are now educated in events management, there has had to be a  
re-evaluation of the organiser/client relationship. This is about having to  
adjust to doing the job in a new way, led by junior entrants to the industry. 24 *Event Culture*  
So, there is a culture shift in the UK events industry brought about by for-  
mally educated entrants interacting with current senior organisers and altering  
how they had previously learnt to do their job.  
Poland can, to a certain extent, reproduce knowledge from current senior  
organisers, but again it will not be knowledge gained from formal education.  
More problematic for the Poland events industry is the lack of production of  
new knowledge because there are no graduates with events specialisms to  
import to senior-level organisers\:  
*Actually, when I came to you – when we met in Warsaw – this was a good*  
*opportunity for me to actually see it from the other side – not from the*  
*amateurs’ side but from the professional side, which was very good for*  
*me. So, now I’m in the business, so to speak, as far as our events are*  
*concerned*.  
\(PL4 – organiser of charity events\)  
This organiser confirms their gaining of knowledge from a professional,  
which otherwise would not have been available to import to their role as an  
organiser of events. Even though this organiser was already in the business  
of organising events, they self-identify as being on the *amateurs’ side* and  
viewing the other *professional side*. If this organiser did not have the oppor-  
tunity to work alongside an event *professional*, as many other organisers in a  
developing industry will not either, their role of organising events would not  
have been seen from the professional side. This reveals the gap to fill with  
educating organisers working in an emerging and developing events industry.  
Another gap in knowledge is that Poland organisers tend not to enter  
the industry with experience in a related field. Organisers in the UK at least  
import transferrable knowledge from their experience in related fields, such  
as hospitality\:  
*I went to Ealing* \[Ealing College of Higher Education, now the University  
of West London\] *for my HND, HCIM* \[Higher National Diploma in Hotel,  
Catering & Institutional Management\]*. I did my placement at the Grand*  
\[Hotel\]*, Eastbourne. I was a chef at Country Inns for 18 months, was at*  
*the QEII* \[conference centre, London\] *for two and a half years, a restau-*  
*rant manager with Hilton for two years, and have now been with P&G*  
\[Payne & Gunther catering\] *for 22 years*.  
\(UK1 – landmark arena venue\)  
This organiser has a typical entry route for senior-level organisers in the UK,  
because events management at that time was not a defined discipline but was  
closely associated with hotels, hospitality, tourism, and leisure management.  
Recently, however, there has been a refined and focused growth in events  
education to meet the rising demand for events professionals \(Getz and *Event Culture* 25  
Page, 2016\). Events management is now accepted as a quasi-profession in  
the developed construct because of the increasing number of graduates from  
educational programmes as well as holders of accreditations from profes-  
sional associations \(Getz and Page, 2016\). When in the turn of time gradu-  
ates elevate to senior roles, carrying with them their formal education and  
knowledge in organising events, the developed events industry will organi-  
cally self-professionalise as an occupation based on advanced complex  
knowledge \(Macdonald, 1999\). It is clear, then, that the tension between  
academic qualifications and experience has diminished in the developed  
industry.  
Macdonald \(1999\) further makes the point that professions are possible  
only when knowledge emerges as a sociocultural entity in its own right,  
which is evident with the UK events industry in recent years. This is why  
some firms and individuals have become trusted and their word and abili-  
ties are considered more significant than qualifications because they can  
demonstrate knowledge, experience, and successes. Still, having an educa-  
tion in a related field, but not in events, is not a disadvantage in the ability  
to manage events. The skillset of a hospitality professional closely matches  
that of an events professional such as flexibility, adaptability, communica-  
tion, social and human skills, and decision-making \(Bowdin *et al*., 2011\).  
Bowdin *et al*. further identify project management skills as being key to the  
role, including developing and working in a team and providing leadership,  
integrating the project plan, presentation, negotiation, and defining client  
requirements.  
Project management is defined by The Project Management Institute as  
‘the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities  
to meet project requirements’ \(PMI, 2013, cited in Haniff and Salama, 2016,  
p. 12\). And the career path of the following organiser demonstrates that pro-  
ject management is closely related to venue management\:  
*I didn’t study event management. I was working part-time at the college*  
*and just got more and more involved in that, really. I was asked to step in*  
*on a full-time basis very much as a coordination position and then just*  
*worked from there. I had the opportunity to work as the event manager at*  
*Alexandra Palace for just under 4 years. I then joined Earl’s Court as an*  
*event manager. At Earl’s Court I slowly progressed through the ranks of*  
*management – soft-services management, that kind of thing. Then I was*  
*asked to be head of events at Earl’s Court during the Olympics until we*  
*closed the venue. When Earl’s Court closed, there was already a head of*  
*events at* \[name of venue\] *so a new role was created as deputy director for*  
*operations looking after all core services interacting with events, looking*  
*after everything from catering, security, traffic and logistics, car-parking,*  
*media*.  
\(UK10 – landmark exhibition centre\) 26 *Event Culture*  
This organiser can be considered a project manager rather than an event  
organiser but the transferable skills are identifiable across those two roles  
anyhow. More pertinent is their knowledge in the sector of managing events  
and venues.  
There is acceptance both in existing event literature and in the events  
industry that a formal education in a related field such as hospitality or tour-  
ism is relatable to managing events. Bourdieu \(Grenfell, 2012, p. 103\) refers  
to this as ‘institutionalised education’ in an attempt to develop a habitus where  
people know the ‘rules of the game’. This dissolves tensions between experi-  
ence and academic qualifications as an events industry pivots towards profes-  
sionalisation. However, hotel management is not events management, which  
raises a concern with what rules of the game of managing events might be  
unknown if an organiser is not educated in how to play it – if they have studied  
hotel management, say\:  
*No. I don’t* \[have any formal specialist training or education in managing  
events\]*. No, I don’t think* \[my team\] *do. I’m sure it’s not the answer you’re*  
*wanting to hear. Certainly, the two most senior people in that department*  
*have years of experience* \[pause\] *in events*.  
\(UK11 – country house hotel\)  
This organiser accepts that there is a shortfall in their venue because nobody  
within the events department has specialist training or education in manag-  
ing events. The interviewee feels conscious of the underqualified person-  
nel in the events department at their hotel. But by recognising the need for  
academic qualifications alongside experience, this organiser is evidence of  
the shift in the industry from abstaining from professional qualifications in  
organising events. This is in fact a glaring admission because events are a  
third of all businesses in this hotel \(the other two-thirds are accommodation  
and food and beverage\). Having stated that the two most senior people in the  
events department have *years of experience in events* is empirical evidence  
of trusting individuals, their word, and their abilities more significantly than  
any qualifications.  
However, experience still is not a substitute for having formal education  
in the specialisms of managing events because the years of experience may  
not be the best way of doing things. Plus, there will exist the lack of theo-  
retical understanding in factors such as consumer psychology and marketing  
behaviours, as well as self-recognition of the need for setting event objectives,  
the value in conducting after-event evaluation procedures, and enacting risk  
management protocols\: every time.  
The next interviewed organiser is at another hotel property, which hosts  
around 300 events each year and considers its hotel and events operations to  
be *two separate businesses, each with its own entrance*, yet this organiser also  
demonstrates their lack of specialist education\: *Event Culture* 27  
*Not really. At college and various other times I’ve done a lot of casual*  
*work on events – bar work, plated service, silver service back in the day –*  
*all those sorts of things*. . . . *Just a lot of operational experience. So, no,*  
*I don’t have any qualifications, but I do have a lot of common sense and*  
*practical experience, which is the best thing anyway. You need that, you*  
*know. Learning on the job and also seeing a lot of events happen when*  
*I was at college – the flow of things and just through experience of doing*  
*bigger and bigger events in venues, you learn what works, what doesn’t*  
*work. A couple of* \[my team\] *do* \[have qualifications\] – *a couple of them*  
*have degrees in event management*.  
\(UK12 – landmark event hotel\)  
This is a landmark hotel in central London where catering revenue from  
events is higher than total rooms’ revenue. This is an events-led hotel because  
room occupancy is low without events. Events are a significant contribution to  
the profitability and sustainability of this hotel business, yet this senior-level  
organiser has no specialist training or education in managing events.  
It might seem odd that people without an education in organising events can  
lead an events department which has significant contribution to the business,  
but this is typical of an events industry at any stage of development. It only  
demonstrates how the organiser has reached their position because of experi-  
ence, not qualifications. This is another factual of the industry reinforcing the  
trust in an organiser’s abilities more significantly than any qualifications.  
Leaders in events might feel inadequate within their changing socio-  
professional culture that is now recruiting graduates in events management.  
However, senior organisers welcome imported specialisms with graduates  
and there is no evidence of resistance due to change, insecurity, or vanity.  
This is because senior organisers are embedded in their seniority and feel  
comfortable and secure in performing their role – again, through recognition  
of their experience and continued successes and not for qualifications. Senior  
organisers, then, recognise the value of their self-learning environment and  
accept they can develop and adapt to the changing culture of their events  
industry by learning from qualified new entrants.  
In the events industry taking shape in Poland there is no access to for-  
mal institutionalised education in events management, thus no habitus has yet  
evolved where people know the ‘rules of the game’ \(Grenfell, 2012, p. 103\).  
In fact, Poland is at the stage where the UK used to be in eschewing any for-  
mal education or qualification in events management, driven by a belief that if  
specialist education is not available, it cannot be needed. It does make sense,  
then, for the events industry in Poland to place trust in the word and abilities  
of firms and individuals more significantly than any qualifications which are  
not yet available, anyhow. The ones who are trusted are those with a portfolio  
of clients, testimonials, demonstrable experience, and a track record of previ-  
ous successful events. 28 *Event Culture*  
This means that organisers in a developing culture must design their own  
‘rules of the game’ and play it their way. This creates an obvious disparity  
between the game they are playing in the emerging location, and the game the  
rest of the international events industry may be playing. In other words, there  
is a different set of rules and a second tier of standards of events within the one  
global market for international events.  
The gap here is caused by the progressing stage of the events industry in  
the emerging location, which is why, in Poland, experience from any field  
is valued above specific experience, or even experience from a related field\:  
*Well, I started working for the sports and international sports cooperation*  
*department within the local community town hall which used to have the*  
*only big stadium in Poland for a long, long time before Euro2012 arrived*  
*in Poland and gave the boost to the construction of many other modern*  
*arenas. I dealt with lots of cultural events, international events with our*  
*partner cities – obviously it was a smaller local scale but still it was the*  
*whole logistics and the whole schedule and preparation process of the*  
*events. Later on, I went on to a higher-level regional administration level*  
*where I was the head of the Euro2012 preparation team for a year. After*  
*that year, I went on to Warsaw to the Polish Ministry of Sport responsible*  
*for preparing infrastructure for Euro2012. We had the project manage-*  
*ment infrastructure for highways and mainly for the construction of the*  
*new stadiums* \[*sic*\] *for Euro2012. We had realised the project of Euro2012*  
*in Poland was not only about having fun and enjoying 3 weeks of tourna-*  
*ment, but it was about giving a boost to the economy, new roads, new sta-*  
*diums* \[*sic*\]*, hotels, huge impact on Polish development and growth which*  
*was the main aim, apart from having fun watching football. After that for*  
*two years I worked at the National Stadium in Warsaw responsible for*  
*event management and deputy head of the sales department. After that*  
*I moved to Katowice because a brand new international congress cen-*  
*tre was commissioned and they were looking for the operator so I started*  
*working for the company that won procurement responsible for that com-*  
*pany operating events*.  
\(PL6 – landmark convention centre\)  
Like the pathway of current UK senior-level organisers, this Poland organ-  
iser demonstrates how they entered events without specialist education  
in managing events but had *started working for the sports and interna-*  
*tional sports cooperation department within the local community town*  
*hall*, which brought them close to events. This exposes another reason  
why the industry eschews any formal education or academic qualifications  
in events management\: because senior organisers themselves have suc-  
ceeded to their position without the need to be educated or qualified in *Event Culture* 29  
the discipline. They are wont, therefore, to reject the need for others to be  
formally educated or qualified.  
The above organiser found themselves to be *the head of the Euro2012*  
*preparation team for a year*, which is a significant leadership role in the field  
of events management. Then, they talk about the *project management infra-*  
*structure for highways and mainly for the construction of the new stadiums*  
\[*sic*\] *for Euro2012*. Analysing the career trajectory of this organiser shows  
that they are less an event organiser and more an infrastructure project man-  
ager for events. There is nothing wrong with that, because events do require  
infrastructure project specialisms in their art world. But the point is that this  
organiser does not have the education in events management to make those  
infrastructure decisions that will impact an event.  
In the above excerpt, the organiser acknowledges the economic and  
infrastructure benefits for Poland from hosting the UEFA Euro2012 football  
championship due to which they gained learning in project management. This  
highlights the point that the production and reproduction of knowledge can  
get going where cultures provide opportunity for policy transfer to learn from  
each other. However, it also indicates that the value of events education as a  
discipline is not yet recognised in Poland.  
All is not lost, though. The events industry in Poland is still taking shape,  
and the beginnings of courses in events management are now being offered at  
both the University of Warsaw and the University of Commerce\:  
\[Talking about universities\] *A new thing which has just been created and*  
*we have no idea whether it is any good*.  
\(PL4 – organiser of charity events\)  
Poland getting going with a culture of knowledge reproduction and produc-  
tion \(Bourdieu, 1973, cited in Harker, Mahar and Wilkes, 1990\) is a sign of  
the opportunity to begin reducing the knowledge gap in the emerging industry  
with other players in the global market for international events whose socio-  
professional habitus has already taken shape and is producing graduates to  
import specialisms into their events industry.  
Still, the above interviewee is a current organiser in a capital city, and who  
said they have *no idea whether* \[the events course\] *is any good*. Clearly, they  
have heard of the new events course but have not taken any effort or interest  
to find out about it or if it *is any good*. This indicates that, first, the organiser  
is not fully immersed in the socio-professional construct of their profession  
to find out more about the new course. Second, they feel no need to take the  
new course that might now teach them how to do the job. Third, they have no  
recognition of their need to create for themselves a self-learning environment.  
This Poland organiser, then, is eschewing any formal education or qualifica-  
tion in events management. 30 *Event Culture*  
Here is another indication that the emerging construct is already shaping a  
fragmented autonomous approach to delivering events\:  
*This industry over the past years has not been integrated because the num-*  
*ber of the big arenas and congress centres like mine has increased over*  
*the last 5 years. Before that there was a shortage of them. Within those*  
*past 5 years the industry has not been able to integrate yet to lobby on*  
*government level for new laws to support the situation. But I think it was*  
*last year the organisers of concerts, gigs, entertainment shows and big*  
*festivals such as the Warsaw Orange Festival have come together and they*  
*set up an organisation in order to exchange knowledge and in order to*  
*operate or to work out some common policies towards venues, clients and*  
*government*.  
\(PL6 – landmark convention centre\)  
This organiser confirms what the previous organiser indicated\: that the indus-  
try *has not been integrated* and *the industry has not been able to integrate yet*.  
But it does show that the emerging industry is moving towards collaboration  
and there is a sociocultural shift towards a community of practice happen-  
ing, with all the benefits this brings through socio-professional networking.  
In this case, it was the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic which caused a  
crisis in the events industry and triggered the need for organisers to collabo-  
rate because of the sudden and urgent reliance on cooperation from others  
\(Becker, 2008\)\:  
*What we have seen because of the COVID-19 situation* . . . *pushed us to*  
*exchange knowledge on our situation and how we can influence decisions*  
*the government is going to take to support our industry. It was probably*  
*the first time that I had the chance to come together to talk with the main*  
*arenas and congress centres because we wanted to support and give some*  
*input to people representing different entertainment and sport associations*  
*to talk on our behalf to our government to work out best solutions in these*  
*difficult times. It was the first time we were exchanging knowledge and we*  
*working on documents to propose to our government and was also the time*  
*we realised how important this type of cooperation was*. . . . *I think this is*  
*something that will lead in the future to set up a body that would assemble*  
*representatives of venues which would be helpful*.  
\(PL6 – landmark convention centre\)  
The COVID-19 pandemic forcibly advanced the events industry in Poland  
into developing a culture of knowledge sharing, although there are indications  
this was happening anyway. The organiser above frames the dramatic changes  
caused by the arrival of the pandemic as the catalyst for collaboration and that  
they found it both necessary and helpful to network with other venues which *Event Culture* 31  
would have been treated as hostile competitors prior\: *It was probably the first*  
*time that I had the chance to come together to talk with the main arenas and*  
*congress centres*. This reaffirms that competition is healthy and should not be  
held as a barrier to collaboration within the community of practice. Smaho  
\(2012\) states that knowledge sharing is a consequence of and influenced by  
dramatic changes in economic and social conditions, as well as changing con-  
sumer demands and requirements, which can certainly be applied to Poland  
since the collapse of communism in 1989 and then its integration to the EU in  
2004 but also by the sudden impacts of COVID-19.  
The pandemic may have been the driver to speed collaboration in the  
Poland events industry, but organisers in an emergent location will need to  
maintain that urgent momentum to move rapidly in catching up with the  
advanced state of developed locations in the global events industry. Frankel  
\(1979, p. 9\) calls this ‘orientation towards participation in the international  
system’, which is the core objective of the potential for an emerging events  
industry to orientate towards participating in the global marketplace for inter-  
national events.  
However, it does not always work like that in real terms – that it is an  
‘orientation towards participation in the international system’. That is because  
emerging locations tend to happen suddenly and quickly, which is one of  
the factors that cause the gaps within the one marketplace. Qatar hosting the  
2022 World Cup, or when Poland and Ukraine hosted the EURO2012 football  
championship – these locations found themselves thrust into the market for  
international events rather than oriented towards participation in the inter-  
national system. There is not always, then, the luxury of orientation before  
events in an emerging location are already taking place – it is this which  
defines it as being an emerging location in most cases. Rather, it is orienta-  
tion towards participation in the international system *after* a location emerges  
into the market for international events\: this is wherein the opportunity for  
orientation arises.  
For this, organisers in the emerging location need to recognise their need  
for collaboration with foreign sources in order to take advantage of differences  
in expertise and to access markets around the world \(Argote *et al*., 2000\).  
Bourdieu \(Grenfell, 2012\) explains that this can happen in terms of competi-  
tion for capital advantage in social spaces or ‘fields’ such as economic capital,  
cultural capital, knowledge capital, and social capital. With both willingness  
and the recognition of the need, the emerging industry can adopt legislations  
from the developed industry because the younger events industry is at the  
point of opportunity to advance to professionalisation.  
Domański \(2003\) highlights that Poland is pushing closer to the stand-  
ards and structures of other EU countries, because progress in organisation  
and management is driven by greater competitiveness, so the motivation is  
already here. There are, however, embedded societal and cultural character-  
istics in Poland which are barriers to the rapid development of the Poland 32 *Event Culture*  
events industry through collaboration. Rojek \(2013, p. 10\) mentions ‘social  
ordering’ where there is a process of conditioning social behaviour through  
formal \(education; law\) and informal \(understandings; can-do attitude\) pro-  
cesses. This is observed in Poland with advice being rejected because ‘you  
might do it that way in London, but it won’t work here’, or ‘that’s not the way  
we do things here’.  
This factual appears at odds that there is trust in the word and abilities  
of an organiser. However, this is a sociocultural difference rather than about  
the significance of qualifications\: the two are very different. Beckford \(2017\)  
states that expressions such as ‘We’ve always done it like that’ is an indica-  
tion of systems and procedures becoming fixed or frozen and the pressure for  
change meeting high resistance. Although this type of resistance is not limited  
to Poland, it is a sociocultural attitude influenced by Poland’s communist past  
and is reflected in research undertaken by Dobosz-Bourne \(2004\) into the dif-  
ferent processes of *Opel Polska* and *Vauxhall Luton*. It showed that the same  
set of practices can become the norm and a source of power in one location  
or be rejected as a negative practice in another location. Even so, Lipton *et al*.  
\(1990\) found that there is an intense desire in Poland to rejoin the economies  
of Western Europe for the obvious achievements as well as a race to distance  
the failures of communism, making it the first country to enact fundamental  
market reform under a non-communist government.  
In Poland, there is a cultural distrust of foreign intervention\: cultural pride  
to reject collaboration with an outsider’s way of doing things. Giddens \(2012\)  
concurs mistrust as being an actively negative attitude towards the claims  
to expertise, and Mishler and Rose \(1997\) identify distrust as the legacy in  
post-communist Europe as a cause of resistance to outside interference, which  
seems to be the case with the rejection of professional expertise.  
This aside, the frankness of Poland organisers is helpful, which is under-  
pinned in this response to the question, ‘how do you know you have done a  
good job’\:  
*You are the event organiser so you know when an event has worked. You*  
*know immediately after this. We have feedback from clients. Usually they*  
*are pleased, I must say, with our work. But the Polish companies say,*  
*‘Thank you, goodbye’*.  
\(PL5 – landmark historic venue\)  
This interviewee, and others, demonstrates a pattern for organisers consider-  
ing themselves to be the best judge of doing a good job. This is without con-  
ducting structured after-event evaluation procedures which would inform an  
organiser from stakeholder feedback and performance measures.  
Organisers place trust in themselves because of their own experience and  
abilities, rather than placing trust in the learning they would achieve if they  
were conducting after-event procedures, feedback, and measures against *Event Culture* 33  
objectives. It is evident that the above organiser does not recognise, for  
instance, the value of conducting after-event evaluation; otherwise they would  
be doing so. In this case, they would not rest on the feelings they get to inform  
if they have done a good job.  
None of the interviewed Poland organisers conduct after-event evaluation  
but this is not a socio-professional or cultural difference from the UK because  
most of the UK organisers do not do so either. Some of them do, however, so  
there is more after-event evaluation happening in the UK than in Poland. But  
this is not because of socio-professional or cultural differences, or because of  
learning from formal education. Those UK organisers who are performing  
after-event evaluation do so for reporting purposes and because UK organis-  
ers have experience of conducting after-event procedures and so it becomes  
embedded in their practice.  
# 2.1.4 After-Event Evaluation  
In the previous excerpt, the organiser said, *We have feedback from clients*.  
. . . *But the Polish companies say, Thank you, goodbye*. This reveals Western  
clients from the developed industry expect to give their feedback but Polish  
clients in the developing industry just walk away at the end of an event. This  
is because Western clients are routinely being asked for feedback and are used  
to giving it, so they do so when in Poland as well.  
Poland organisers should be learning from the differences of their clients  
from a developed marketplace. But even not obtaining feedback from their  
domestic Poland clients is a concern because the organiser has no measure of  
their performance from the domestic marketplace to determine whether they  
are doing a good job.  
This reveals complacency with obtaining feedback because this organiser  
happens to receive it from Western clients only because it is offered, not by  
routinely conducting procedures with all clients to obtain it. This is where the  
value of after-event procedures is not being recognised because understand-  
ing the value of doing so means it cannot be overlooked and must be carried  
out as a routine procedure at every event, every time. It is what is referred  
to in Berners \(2017, pp. 149–150; 2019, p. 188\) as performing the job of an  
event organiser in its entirety whereby pre-event planning is 95 percent of  
the job, the onsite logistics is 3 percent, and the after-event procedures are  
2 percent – but if the after-event procedures are not performed, the job is only  
98 percent complete.  
Entrants to the UK industry who have an education in events management  
\(because of its developed shape\) are being taught to recognise the value of  
after-event evaluation and feedback. So, there is change happening in this  
socio-professional practice of managing events. Poland demonstrates this is  
not yet happening in the shaping stage. This is confirmed by another organiser  
who measures their performance from a reactive and subjective viewpoint by 34 *Event Culture*  
interpreting positive but informal feedback as affirmation that they are doing  
a good job\:  
*If our clients are pleased with what we do, if they are really pleased with*  
*that, that means we think we have done a very good job*.  
\(PL4 – organiser of charity events\)  
For this organiser, to *think* they have done a good job is not the same as  
knowing it to be factual. If they were conducting post-event evaluation and  
feedback, they would not use the word *think* but would have full confi-  
dence in the fact and would have wanted this to come across in a research  
interview.  
There is further ambiguity revealed in this short excerpt with their use of  
the word *if* in *if our clients are pleased with what we do*, which indicates that  
their clients are not always pleased with what they do or that it is not known  
in every circumstance at every event. Underpinning this interpretation is the  
certain knowledge that this organiser does not conduct structured evaluation  
procedures.  
There is further evidence of organisers trusting in the ‘feeling’ of doing a  
good job, which appears important to organisers in the developing industry  
and is again based on informal feedback with no structured after-event evalu-  
ation processes taking place\:  
\[Sigh\] *How I measure it? I think basing feedback is from the client and*  
*internally – both ways. I’ve done a good job because I haven’t had com-*  
*plaints. Everything was ready on time. Um, the client wants to come back*  
*next time. The area that I was responsible for worked effectively and this*  
*is how I feel*.  
\(PL6 – landmark convention centre\)  
The sigh at the outset of this excerpt could be interpreted as a delay tactic,  
whereas if structured post-event evaluation were being conducted by this  
organiser, they would perhaps respond without hesitation. This interpretation  
might further be underscored by the interviewee repeating part of the ques-  
tion, *How I measure it?*  
This organiser assumes that they have done a good job if no complaints  
were received, which is counter-intuitive to having done a good job because  
there would not be any complaints, anyhow. The purpose of doing a good  
job, after all, is to receive no complaints, to pre-empt potential complaints,  
and to take preventive and corrective measures before it is too late\: before  
complaints become complaints \(Berners and Martin, 2022\).  
Receiving complaints as a measure of performance is not the same as con-  
ducting the after-event procedures of feedback and evaluation to confirm to  
the organiser that they have done a good job. For one thing, not everybody *Event Culture* 35  
will complain\: there are many reasons why people do not complain. Also,  
people might not complain to the event organiser \(or even be aware of who  
*is* the organiser\) but might raise their concerns to somebody else within the  
organisation or outside, so the organiser would not get to hear about it. Fur-  
thermore, the purpose of planned structured feedback is to penetrate all stake-  
holder groups – so the organiser might not receive a complaint from a client,  
say, and thus feels a good job has been done, but this does not account for  
consumers, sponsors, suppliers, and staff.  
But the overriding value of post-event evaluation and feedback is to  
learn whether the job was done well because the event has met its objectives  
and to learn what could be improved – it is not about waiting to learn from  
complaints.  
These excerpts from the interviews confirm that organisers in the emerg-  
ing industry are not planning to meet objectives such as client satisfaction,  
delivering to consumer expectations, or achieving repeat business. If a client  
or consumers were not happy with an event, or did not wish to return, there is  
a real risk that the organiser will not know about it.  
One problem is that audit practices such as evaluation can be seen as mun-  
dane, but they create the larger picture which takes on contours and identifies  
patterns \(Strathern, 2000\). Beckford \(2017\) highlights that learning results  
from a systematic cycle of planning, experimentation, reflection, and consoli-  
dation, which supports the structured approaches that UK organisers describe  
in the developed industry\:  
*I’ll answer it in two ways. From a commercial point of view has it deliv-*  
*ered to its commercial objectives. Yes or no. The second way, we send out*  
*a survey after each show to get feedback from our organisers. If they’re*  
*not happy they’ll tell you. The other thing is I spend time with my clients*  
*and we’ll have non-commercial meetings – we’ll leave the contracts and*  
*money and have a qualitative meeting and say right let’s forget the money*  
*side of it, where are you with your event? What do you want to do? How*  
*was the last event? If it didn’t go well what can we do to help you to get*  
*it better – is it something we can do; is it a connection we can help you*  
*with; is it a bit of knowledge; is it someone in the industry who might be*  
*able to help?*  
\(UK4 – landmark convention centre\)  
This organiser conducts non-commercial meetings with clients before an event  
which demonstrates learning in and between projects to develop competence  
in ordinary activities \(Clegg, Skyttermoen and Vaagaasar, 2021\). This organ-  
iser is clear about the importance of meeting commercial objectives but sepa-  
rates the non-commercial objectives to allow for the understanding of how an  
event can be successful in other key areas. This approach is in line with the  
opinion by Getz \(2018\) that event managers need to implement continuous 36 *Event Culture*  
evaluation to become learning organisations, achieve their goals, and meet the  
standards expected of a profession that provides services to society.  
Most of the interviewed UK organisers undertake after-event evaluation  
in some form, compared to none of the Poland organisers, which confirms  
that in the emerging market there is wider non-understanding in the value of  
evaluation. It also reveals that there is a failure in recognising ‘evaluation’ as  
industry best practice which exposes this gap is due to the stage of evolution  
of an events industry.  
Collaboration within a developed socio-professional structure \(Becker,  
1984\) would redress this, as is already apparent in the UK. There is no evi-  
dence to show that this gap is caused by cultural or social differences, it  
is only about organisers learning the value of conducting after-event evalu-  
ation, in which the UK respondents are more aware is a measurement of  
performance\:  
*Obviously there are the financial ones* \[KPIs\]*. And then what we do pore*  
*over are the Net Promoter Scores – we just refer to them as NPS. It is very*  
*much a tool used by a number of media-type people. If you can imagine*  
*that you’re asked the question after an event, ‘how would you rate the*  
*event and would you come back’ if you score \(out of 10\) between 9 or 10*  
*that’s a plus. If you score less than 5 it’s a minus. Between 5 and 8 is con-*  
*sidered to be neutral. We have a vast database and we send this question*  
*out to hundreds, if not thousands, of people saying ‘would you recommend*  
*to come back next year’. Then we collate what all the scores are. You get*  
*a NPS whereby you’ve got all the 9s and 10s and you deduct all the 5s or*  
*less, and you’ll come up with a plus or minus. And that’s the key thing we*  
*use as a KPI going forward*.  
\(UK3 – landmark sports venue\)  
This organiser puts reliance on Net Promoter Scores \(NPS\) as a tool to evalu-  
ate and measure consumer feedback responses. This approach concurs with  
Goldblatt \(2011\) asserting that evaluation is connected to setting Key Perfor-  
mance Indicators \(KPIs\) for an event. Badawy *et al*. \(2016\) explain that KPIs  
are mostly quantitative information important for planning and controlling,  
creating transparency, and supporting management decision-makers. Measur-  
ing performance through KPIs and evaluation leans towards an audit culture  
which has shifted from finance and accounting to all kinds of reckonings,  
evaluations, measurements, and accountabilities \(Strathern, 2000\) and has  
social consequences in locking up time, personnel, and resources. This is a  
barrier for organisers who want to conduct post-event procedures because of  
the anti-climax effect once an event has gone, plus the drive to move on to the  
next event for commercial reasons.  
Strathern \(2000\) points out that an audit culture creates problems with  
checking and evaluating, such as the requirement of trust in the measures *Event Culture* 37  
used and the sources of information. In this respect, NPS can be negatively  
impacted even by the weather because if it is raining on the day of an event,  
the consumer experience will be compromised and the NPS would be lower\:  
*What we’ve learned for example is that Net Promoter Scores are governed*  
*by the weather. In an event that’s predominantly an outside event, however*  
*good your food and beverage service might me, however good the actual*  
*event is, if it’s the British summertime and it is pouring down, then your*  
*NPS drops. So, when we review our annual NPS we actually have above*  
*it ‘good weather, bad weather’. But we are always looking for high plus*  
*scores*. . . . *You will get companies – some budget airlines for example –*  
*they have got an NPS score that is about minus 70 or whatever, so we’re*  
*always looking for a high plus score*.  
\(UK3 – landmark sports venue\)  
The audit culture in the advanced UK events industry is especially pro-  
nounced, whereas in the Poland socio-professional culture of events, which  
is still forming, it is largely non-interventionist. This means that an event  
happening in the UK faces stringent audit culture processes which add time,  
logistics, and money to comply with, yet events in Poland might not require  
such resources to be applied to be compliant.  
# 2.1.5 Event Objectives  
Allen *et al*. \(2010\) consider evaluation as a critical step in the planning pro-  
cess of an event where objectives set at the outset become the benchmarks  
to determine its final outcomes and success in delivering a service to clients  
and consumers. Not all UK respondents recognise this because some evaluate  
their events without setting or using objectives to measure success\:  
*Not measurable objectives, no. Every event has a detailed schedule – if*  
*this is met, we know we’ve done a good job*.  
\(UK1 – landmark arena venue\)  
This organiser is confused with what an objective is because an objective  
must be measurable by definition. The *detailed schedule* to which this organ-  
iser refers is otherwise known as an ‘Event Management Plan’ \(EMP\), ‘func-  
tion sheet’, or ‘running order’ but is not produced for measuring objectives.  
An EMP is a logistics document used for communicating the schedule of an  
event to interested parties and, yes, for that reason it does help in ensuring the  
objectives of an event do get met, but that is not its purpose. Besides, meet-  
ing the content of a schedule might mean the event ran smoothly but does not  
necessarily mean a good job was done because this will only be determined  
from the after-event evaluation and feedback audit procedures. 38 *Event Culture*  
Another organiser stumbled over the question of setting objectives\:  
*No; no formal objectives. It sounds weird but I suppose we just know what*  
*a good event looks and feels like, and what needs to be done, and what we*  
*need to achieve but nothing formal, so nothing written down in an event*  
*plan*. . . . *No. It’s a good question*.  
\(UK2 – organiser at an institution\)  
This response again introduces confusion and ambiguity, yet the question,  
‘Do you set event objectives for every event?’ is clear and simply worded. In  
this case, a follow-up question seeks clarity by asking, ‘If you are not setting  
formal objectives, how do you know the event was a success?’\:  
*Hmm*. \[Long hesitation\] *That’s interesting, isn’t it? And it’s different for*  
*different events*. \[Long pause\] *That’s, that’s really interesting*.  
\(UK2 – organiser at an institution\)  
The statement, *It’s different for different events*, is acknowledgement that  
objectives need to be set for each event as a routine procedure, but this organ-  
iser does not do this. This organiser then went on to list a range of potential  
audits for the different events they organise, including\:  
*Good levels of attendance; no technical problems; people stayed for the*  
*drinks reception afterwards; do people look happy after the event; eve-*  
*rybody is mentioned in the speech; the right people are in the front row*.  
The organiser could easily have answered ‘No, I don’t set objectives’, but  
their floundering, hesitation, and reaching for a list of possible factors, which  
could be used as measures, indicate their recognition of their failure in not  
setting objectives.  
Poland is not dissimilar to the UK, where organisers know it can be impor-  
tant to set objectives, but fail to do so\:  
\[Hesitates\] *Well, yes but not always on paper. In Poland the majority*  
*happens during conversation*. \[We\] *set objectives verbally. Objectives*  
*are less visible than they should be, not necessarily put in writing. That’s*  
*how it works, if you know what I mean. I don’t believe anybody in Poland*  
*does such a thing. Honestly, in Poland we don’t do it, we don’t measure it*  
*because there is never time after an event*.  
\(PL7 – organiser of events\)  
This leads again to the conclusion that not conducting strategic man-  
agement practices is not an omission caused by cultural or educational *Event Culture* 39  
differences between the emerged and the emerging industries. It is purely non-  
understanding of what an objective is and what it is for.  
This organiser states they do not *believe anybody in Poland does such a*  
*thing*, and *Honestly, in Poland we don’t do it*, suggesting that just because this  
organiser does not set objectives, they perceive nobody else does. This con-  
firms how organisers assume that the way they do things is *the* way of doing  
things, but it might not be the best or safest way.  
This organiser also says, *we don’t measure it because there is never*  
*time after an event*, which is the truth reveal. Organisers in both the devel-  
oped and developing industries blame lack of time after an event for not  
conducting post-event procedures \(see also Section 4.6, ‘The Self-Learn-  
ing Environment’\). Lack of time is the reason proffered by organisers to  
explain why evaluation is the neglected part of the event cycle \(Quick,  
2020\), so this research underpins what is factual in the industry. However,  
there is always time for strategic management practices – it is part of the  
job.  
Lack of time is not a legitimate reason because although evaluation activi-  
ties take place after an event, they are planned before an event – in the plan-  
ning stage. It does not require time from the organiser after an event to plan  
after-event activities nor does it take time to act on them – the consumer does  
that\: it is the customer who sits down to complete an evaluation questionnaire.  
It is pointed out in Berners and Martin \(2022, p. 53\) that ‘time does not pre-  
vent feedback and evaluation – poor planning does that’.  
The interviews with organisers reflect a *laissez-faire* culture exists within  
the events industry in both the UK and Poland. This reveals itself in strategic  
events management but is also visible in both the Event Tourism and Risk  
Awareness sections of this book. This is more prominent in Poland than the  
UK\:  
*Of course* \[I set objectives\] *when I am the organiser because sometimes*  
*the* \[venue name\] *is not only the venue it’s the organiser or co-organiser of*  
*the events. But when the* \[venue name\] *is a venue, it depends on the client,*  
*that’s their job to set the objectives*.  
\(PL5 – landmark historic venue\)  
This organiser sets objectives when organising events in their venue and, by  
using the term *of course* at the outset indicates they attach value to setting  
objectives and understands it is an essential part of the event management  
procedures. Even so, this organiser is displaying the *laissez-faire* characteris-  
tics by foregoing the need to set objectives in situations where clients organise  
an event in the venue \(known as ‘dry hire’\). This reinforces how organisers  
in both the developed and developing industries do go some way to setting  
objectives and conducting evaluation but do not fully recognise the value of 40 *Event Culture*  
doing so, otherwise these activities would not be foregone in any instance  
or for any event. Neither do organisers appreciate the relationship between  
objectives, KPIs, and evaluation as metrics of their performance \(Jeston,  
2018\) to inform whether they have done a good job.  
# 2.2 Socio-Professional Culture  
Berners \(2017, p. 3\) categorises the complex socio-professional culture of the  
event industry in developed markets such as the UK as ‘an industry in itself’.  
This is because the structure of the event industry in the UK is multi-layered  
with event management agencies, production companies, freelancers, and the  
many services which support a developed event industry, from marquee sup-  
pliers to power supply companies, temporary trackways, perimeter fencing,  
and crowd barriers. In essence, the size and structure of the socio-professional  
network which has evolved to support an events industry are what determine  
the shape of that industry and where it is positioned on the journey from  
emerging to developed.  
The events industry in a developing market is a different shape\: it has less  
need to develop support from a socio-professional network and so has fewer  
layers which make it a simpler and ‘noticeably flat’ \(Berners, 2017, p. 5\)  
shape. This is certainly what is observed in Poland because it can be difficult  
to source creative resources, there is limited choice of support services such as  
technical companies, and there is no existence of professional associations to  
network with suppliers. In fact, in Poland there are few ‘event organisers’, but  
events are being organised by people and companies involved in marketing,  
public relations, and media.  
There are voids in event specialism in both Poland and the UK which  
get filled by organisers with limited or no specialist experience. Organisers  
without specialism can be devoid of the event management skills required of  
the event life cycle \(Holmes and Ali-Knight, 2017\) which includes planning  
events, setting event objectives, marketing events, optimisation and growth of  
events, safety protocols at events, and after-event evaluation.  
# 2.2.1 Void of Organisers  
Although it is rapidly evolving in Poland as the events industry takes shape,  
and there are now event agencies which are shaping structured levels to the  
Poland events industry, in an emerging events industry there is a void of spe-  
cialist event professionals. This causes gaps in the specialism of organising  
events that get filled by non-specialist personnel working in related media-  
centric professions offering themselves as bona fide event organisers\:  
*I worked for 15 years in the mobile telecommunications sector. I did some*  
*marketing there and that’s why I’m here at* \[venue name\] *to somehow* *Event Culture* 41  
*support marketing and to organise events. But most of my career was in*  
*a different place and different sector. I do not have any theoretical back-*  
*ground but rather I could say practical. Please bear in mind this is not*  
*a commercial company. The municipality makes all the decisions here*  
*because we have to ask if we can host the events in this* \[venue name\] *so*  
*most of the decisions are on the side of the municipality*.  
\(PL2 – landmark venue\)  
This organiser confirms that in the developing industry there is deficiency in  
the specialist knowledge of managing events. That is why this organiser was  
awarded their position – because of their marketing background, which was  
perceived to be related and therefore sufficient to lead events at a capital city  
landmark venue.  
Venues such as this attract big events, international clients, significant  
budgets, and sometimes complex logistics. Importantly, this type of venue  
has a public profile and needs its reputation to be protected. In an emerging  
industry it would be difficult for this organiser’s employer to find a candidate  
with specialist event or venue management experience, anyhow. Best to go,  
then, for a near-related career and hope there is cross-skilling.  
Their comment that *most of the decisions are on the side of the municipal-*  
*ity* must limit the ability and authority of this organiser as a venue manager.  
If they did, however, have specialist experience in events and venue manage-  
ment to give them confidence and authority, they might feel empowered to  
take decisions in their capacity as the venue manager.  
From this perspective – the perspective of organisers – there is similar cul-  
tural structure in both the developed and developing industries, as the follow-  
ing two excerpts from a UK organiser and then a Poland organiser describe\:  
*It was a little bit accidental. I was actually studying a double degree in*  
*marketing and politics. I was working in a hotel whilst at university and*  
*I got offered the position of being the events manager at the hotel and*  
*I really liked it. That’s basically how I got into that. And then I volunteered*  
*in India for a little while with underprivileged children. I was told I had no*  
*London experience*. . . . *\[T\]hey wanted London experience in particular.*  
*So I started off at the very bottom at* \[hotel name\] *working on reactive*  
*sales and planning of events as well. Then I went into proactive sales, my*  
*remit currently is basically ensuring I have event management agencies*  
*and corporates coming into our hotel. My remit is the globe, US market,*  
*Asian market, Europe market, as well as the UK market knowing about*  
\[venue name\].  
\(UK13 – sales account director\)  
*Many, many years ago when the idea of the* \[event\] *came to my mind, I had*  
*no way out. I had to start organising events. So, it came naturally. I didn’t* 42 *Event Culture*  
*study anything which involves organising events, so it came just naturally*  
*from the bottom of my heart and my head*.  
\(PL3 – organiser of charity events\)  
Both these organisers demonstrate their similar accidental pathway into events  
management because the events socio-professional status in both countries –  
and at different stages of development – makes no demand for relevant aca-  
demic qualifications, training, experience, or specialisms. This provides a  
snapshot of an events industry, wherever it is, filled with professionals who  
have learnt to do the job but may not be doing it right or safely. In such cases,  
the organisers shift from ‘dedicated and resourceful amateurs’ to ‘trained and  
skilled professionals’ \(Bowdin *et al*., 2011, p. xxviii\) because of the experi-  
ence they are gaining and their social practices become characterised by the  
presence of rules to dictate good practice \(Bourdieu, no date, cited in Grenfell,  
2012\) which is explained here\:  
*We gained experience whilst organising things because we always had to*  
*deal with these problems and we always had to see to it that everything*  
*was tip-top. There would be no problems during the event. One of the*  
*events that we organise is really huge therefore we had to see to every-*  
*thing. And have professionals deal with the problems, we didn’t do it on*  
*our own. We had firefighters, security, medical people, special guards from*  
*the* \[venue name\].  
\(PL4 – organiser of charity events\)  
This organiser, like most, has evolved their own mini-culture for organising  
events which might not be the right way, or the safe way, or the optimum  
way. This organiser relies on what they label *professionals* collaborating to  
ensure a successful event, so there is evidence of the use of a wider art world  
supporting their mini-culture. Becker \(2008\) recognises that all human activ-  
ity involves the joint contributions of a number of people and suggests that  
pattern of collective activity is a sociological approach. This organiser does  
therefore have a sociological approach, albeit unintended.  
Reliance on other people is usual in events socio-professional culture  
because there is an acceptance that events are run by people who refer to  
themselves as organisers but without attaching any professional merits such  
as specialist education or experience to qualify them as such. In an emerg-  
ing industry this is because organisations are reacting to newly emerging free  
trade, bringing competition from the rest of the world \(Lipton *et al*., 1990\).  
For example, Domański \(2003\) recognises Poland firms must adapt to unprec-  
edented competition in a sudden environment of catching up to new demand  
outpacing the labour resource of organisers who are experienced or educated  
in managing events. *Event Culture* 43  
As an events industry begins to take shape, a culture develops which  
impedes rapid catch up with developed industries in the global market for  
international events. This is because there is no access to formal education in  
events specialisms in a location with a young events industry. Until the indus-  
try matures to a point where providers of education respond to a demand for  
courses in events management, organisers will be recruited into the industry  
for reasons other than industry-related qualifications – usually it is by chance.  
Nor are they being offered event jobs because of their track history in organis-  
ing events – they do not have one\:  
*Huh, I worked for 15 years in mobile telecommunications sector. I did*  
*some marketing there and that’s why I’m here at* \[venue\] *to somehow sup-*  
*port marketing and to organise events. But most of my career was in a*  
*different place and a different sector*.  
\(PL2 – landmark venue\)  
It is fortunate, then, that such organisers are supported by the wider socio-  
professional habitus, which includes other industries that can dampen their  
deficiencies of knowledge and expertise. They can rely on the expertise of  
other skilled operatives such as specialist caterers, venue managers, risk and  
safety experts, trained security, technical specialists, and agency casual staff  
such as waiters. It is a structure which works to cover the gaps within the  
industry which should be led by event organisers, but in many cases is led by  
other people with specialist other skills.  
This will not be happening to the same extent in a location such as Poland,  
where the industry has not yet evolved that wider socio-professional struc-  
ture. In Poland, the industry is developing a culture that is highly autonomous  
of managerial control and largely immune to formal management regimes  
\(Thiel, 2012, p. 4\), because there is no community of practice to cohere or  
align organisers and narrow the gaps between them.  
There is a further widening gap between the UK and Poland culture of  
events management, due to the correlation between educational investment  
and income \(Domanski, 1999\). Domanski asserts that education and job com-  
plexity are the indications of social role and status when converting invest-  
ment in oneself into reward. This is a point that is explored by Kuhlmann  
\(2013\) in locations of fundamentally changed concepts of welfare state and  
the governance of professions. The social and professional approaches to a  
career in events industry has changed since then, with events in the UK now  
seen as an industry in its own right \(Getz and Page, 2016\), which is why this  
gap is widening.  
In Poland there still are very limited opportunities to invest in one’s own  
education as an event organiser \(or opportunities to employ educated event  
organisers for that matter\), so qualifications are being sourced from other 44 *Event Culture*  
disciplines. This is indeed the case with the following organiser who is a *his-*  
*torian and an educator* and is now the director of education and events at a  
landmark historic capital city-centre venue\:  
*I am a historian and I was an educator in* \[venue name\] *which has its*  
*educational department. It started with art history students, etc. and we*  
*are doing lessons for students attending these lessons. Because of the*  
*head of this branch of the education department – she is also the head*  
*of the events department – she knows me and when there was a need*  
*because the former events director was retiring, she asked me to replace*  
*him and jump in*.  
\(PL5 – landmark historic venue\)  
This organiser describes a natural and organic progression within the inter-  
nal culture of their venue, *when there was a need because the former events*  
*director was retiring, she asked me to replace him*. Even though this was an  
appointment of convenience and organic progression, the process neglected  
the potential to recruit somebody with event specialisms. This organiser freely  
accepts they were teaching *art history students, etc*., which does not make  
them an organiser of events. But the woman who was *the head of this branch*  
*of the education department* would not recognise this or know the need for the  
job to require events specialisms – she just happened to be *also the head of the*  
*events department* and there was an opening which this ‘organiser’ was there  
to fill. It is unlikely in Poland that an events specialist would be found for this  
position, anyhow, so why bother looking.  
So, the emerging industry eschews any formal education or academic  
qualification in events management. But until Poland develops their events  
industry to be a socio-professional culture that provides investment in oneself  
through education, it will not begin to narrow the gap between itself, the UK,  
and other developed locations already operating in the marketplace for inter-  
national events.  
It is not only the impact on organisers themselves which is affected by the  
socio-professional culture being created. The way an events industry takes  
shape will have impacts in other areas for organisers managing events such  
as how successfully they penetrate foreign markets to attract event tourists  
and how well they meet the service and quality expectations of international  
clients and consumers. It is documented by de Kadt and Williams \(1976\) that  
old perspectives linger in underdeveloped countries which has implications in  
modern society where knowledge-based occupations are integral to modern  
social formation \(Macdonald, 1999\). This is a consideration for the develop-  
ment of the events industry in Poland, particularly with its hangover legacy  
from communism. *Event Culture* 45  
# 2.3 Summary and Conclusions – Event Culture  
Exploring the culture of the events industry in both the UK and Poland has  
identified the characteristics of a developed industry and one that is emerg-  
ing. Although the two locations differ, in that the UK is a long-time demo-  
cratic society versus the post-communist nation of Poland, this book is not  
concerned with such wider cultural complexities, including those of gender,  
religion, or command cultures. This book therefore limits its focus to the cul-  
ture of the socio-professional construct of the events industry in both target  
locations.  
The evolved community of practice in the UK events industry has shaped  
a socio-professional construct to support organisers through networking and  
activities, professional associations, and accreditation bodies. This is impor-  
tant in professionalising the industry because it provides opportunities for  
organisers to share best practice and gain knowledge from other professionals  
within the same industry.  
Of particular importance for an events industry construct is to shape a  
culture of learning, and learning from each other. Organisers should be led  
to recognise their need for active self-learning in an environment where they  
learn from sources outside the limitations of their own experience.  
As an events industry takes shape, it pivots from eschewing any formal  
education or academic qualifications in events management. This is because in  
the developing stages, there is no access to specialist courses which fosters the  
belief that if qualifications in events management are not available, they are  
not needed to do the job of organising events. The consequence of this is that  
experience is valued above qualifications and trust is awarded to the word and  
abilities of some firms and individuals because of their experience, not for any  
qualifications.  
Trust, then, is based upon an organiser’s client portfolio, reputation, expe-  
rience of events in the genre, testimonials, and track record of delivering suc-  
cessful events. After all, qualifications alone do not convey trust in an event  
organiser.  
Tensions between academic qualifications and experience arise where  
experienced organisers, who feel they know how to do the job, devalue quali-  
fications and reject qualified entrants who have academic qualifications but  
lack experience. The industry itself, then, is not leading organisers to be quali-  
fied which is why actors in the industry place significance on experience. Once  
courses become available, entrants to the industry seek academic qualification  
to make themselves more employable. Recruiters respond by requiring quali-  
fied candidates to apply for advertised job roles. Still, this shift to accepting  
qualifications is led by individuals rather than the industry.  
In both the UK and Poland there is a lack of formal education because  
although the UK is further advanced with its provision of events courses at 46 *Event Culture*  
HEIs \(Higher Education Institutions \(universities\)\), it is still too recent to  
show much impact at senior levels. Formal education is impacting entrants at  
junior level, but current senior organisers did not have access to formal educa-  
tion in events management when they entered the industry. However, there is  
evidence of entrants importing their formal education to the industry which is  
reshaping the behaviours and practices of senior-level organisers.  
Other than learning from graduates, current senior-level organisers in the  
UK rely on their formal education in related fields such as hospitality, cater-  
ing, and hotel management. This means events in the UK developed construct  
are being organised by people who already possess transferrable learning  
and competences to draw upon, such as communication, cooperation, people  
skills, taking care of others, working collaboratively, teamwork, and verbal  
reasoning \(Schulz, 2008; Cserháti and Szabó, 2014; Pielichaty *et al*., 2017;  
Clegg, Skyttermoen and Vaagaasar, 2021\). A gap appears here because organ-  
isers in Poland are not entering the events industry from related fields. In the  
Poland emerging construct, organisers of events most likely do not possess  
those attributes because they have landed in events management from unre-  
lated professions.  
This is not to suggest that there is disparity in professionalism between  
organisers in the UK and Poland. Rather that although professionalism may  
be present in the social construct of both industries, in a developing indus-  
try it is professionalism gained from an irrelevant profession. Usually, the  
‘organiser’, as they become, has arrived at events management by chance or  
convenience. However, this gap does mean that organisers in an emerging  
industry are less attuned to meeting the needs of the global market for interna-  
tional events, than an organiser in a developed construct who brings relevant  
transferrable competencies.  
Without experience in related fields, and the absence of the socio-  
professional culture from which UK organisers benefit, organisers in an  
emerging industry evolve their learning of how to do the job in an environment  
which is both informal and autonomous. This is characteristic with Bourdieu’s  
habitus concept \(Grenfell, 2012\) where social practices occur as regularities  
without the presence of rules to dictate practice. Although Foucault \(Carra-  
bine, 2007\) recognises that strange practices are governed by structural codes  
of knowledge, observation in the Poland field has shown learning has devel-  
oped through the way of doing things which does not make it the best way of  
doing things, or the safest way of doing things.  
Although Poland organisers can learn from sources other than formal edu-  
cation or years of background in events – such as from their foreign clients,  
international consumers, and other organisers’ events – there are three barri-  
ers to do with sociological behavioural traits that exist because of the legacy  
of communism. The first is how Poland society needed to turn their hand to  
whatever needed to be done, which Rojek \(2013, p. 10\) recognises as informal *Event Culture* 47  
‘social ordering’. The legacy impact is that it is embedded in Poland society  
that they can do anything, that everything they do is the right way, and there  
is no better way of doing it.  
The second barrier to embracing outside expertise is the mistrust in one’s  
neighbours. Mishler and Rose \(1997\) identify distrust as the legacy in post-  
communist Europe, too. At this level of embedment in society, to ask for trust  
in the expertise from a foreign source is incomprehensible.  
The third barrier is the slowness of societal behaviour change, which con-  
tinues to make it difficult for Poland organisers to accept foreign expertise.  
This slowness is because the long reach of communism across the genera-  
tions repeats communistic cultural patterns and societal behaviours. Although  
Poland is a post-communist society since 1989, the grandparents who lived  
under the communist regime taught today’s parents, who teach today’s chil-  
dren, who will be teaching tomorrow’s children. The impact is that changing  
the informal authority of societal norms is incredibly slow and resistant to  
change. However, change from the formal authority of education would enact  
quicker change and with less resistance.  
These are cultural barriers in shaping the events industry in Poland to align  
with the global marketplace for international events and meet the expectations  
of event tourist clients and consumers. This is problematic because Poland is  
already a key player in the global events marketplace, having hosted signifi-  
cant international events such as Euro2012 and COP24.  
To narrow the gaps between an emerging industry and one which is  
developed will require a socio-professional culture change across the con-  
struct of the global market for international events. This could be accom-  
plished with the creation of an international accreditation association to lead  
emerging events industries in shaping their socio-professional construct to  
the same pattern as those which are already established. This would both  
lead organisers and provide them with the understanding of their need to  
engage with support structures to facilitate networking, knowledge sharing,  
formal education, and best practice across the one global marketplace for  
international events.  
In fact, the importance of a self-learning environment, whereby organis-  
ers develop a culture of learning from each other, is a finding that is of key  
importance in the shaping of an emerging industry, which has yet to establish  
a socio-professional construct. However, self-learning is a trait which current  
organisers adopt naturally and organically or else fail to recognise.  
Currently, then, it will go against the grain for the industry to actively lead  
organisers to develop their own self-learning environment. It is the individual  
or the company they work for, which tends to identify the need for learning,  
development, progression, or training in order to comply with the law. It is the  
law which is driving learning, rather than any pressure from consumers or the  
insurance industry responding to past tragedies at events. 48 *Event Culture*  
Because individuals or the company they work for is driving the impetus  
for education and professionalism in the industry, there is an autonomous and  
fragmented approach to self-learning. This has impacts for elements such as  
setting industry KPIs and raising the need for the production and reproduction  
of knowledge in the industry without an international professional association  
leading the way for organisers to align their behaviours and practices across  
the marketplace for international events. **3 Tourism and Events**  
This chapter is concerned with how event organisers in the developed and  
developing constructs approach the tourist sector of international events.  
‘Event tourists’ incorporates international clients who book venues abroad,  
and foreign consumers who travel to attend an event. The theme of tourism  
and events, therefore, is a core element in the context of gaps within the global  
marketplace for international events.  
The organisers who were interviewed each find themselves in direct  
engagement with event tourists by organising events which attract interna-  
tional consumers \(Ferdinand and Kitchin, 2017\) whether clients or attendees.  
This is because they are organisers at landmark capital city venues which of  
course attract international events.  
It is recognised by Getz and Page \(2016\) that tourism is closely related with  
events because of the importance of planned events as ‘products’ or ‘attrac-  
tions’ and that events are consumed in the leisure time of tourists. Ferdinand  
and Kitchin \(2017\) agree by describing the international approach to events  
management as sharing a focus on other international activities such as tour-  
ism and are concerned with differences between cultures and countries. They  
argue that an international approach to events management requires engage-  
ment with international activities, cultural differences, and global issues. So,  
tourism in events is not only about clients and consumers, but it can also be  
about organisers travelling in their job role\:  
*I moved to New Zealand to work on the America’s Cup, then I came back*  
*to work on the Olympics in Athens. Then I worked for Ellen MacArthur*  
*around China. Then I moved out of sport because I got stuck in a rut. Then,*  
*I went back for the 2012 Olympics*.  
\(UK9 – organiser at an institution\)  
This excerpt demonstrates the existence of a dual approach to event tourism  
where this organiser performs the role of a tourist searching for new expe-  
riences, for something different \(O’Donnell, 1997\), while undertaking their  
job organising events at those host locations and experiencing the needs and  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781032684161-3 50 *Tourism and Events*  
expectations of leisure tourists, and what attracts tourists to unique events  
\(Gelder and Robinson, 2009\). The internationalisation of events allows this to  
happen and is indeed one of the motivators for people choosing to enter the  
events industry, as has long been with the closely related industries of hotel,  
tourism, and aviation offering travel opportunities, international experience,  
and worldwide networking.  
Event organisers, like most people, would claim they know what it is like  
to be a tourist, because of their experiences of travel in their leisure time. But  
the above organiser is highlighting the potential to place oneself in the position  
of gaining experience as a ‘working tourist’ and gain experience of organising  
events for tourists, while being a tourist. Many young people achieve similar by  
taking a working ‘gap year’ and can bring their international experiences into  
their early career. This type of tourism is helpful in narrowing gaps between  
developed events industries and those which are emerging, because travelling  
organisers will export and import knowledge, experience, and practices.  
However, outside expertise is observed to be routinely rejected in the  
emerging events industry in Poland. This fact draws a distinction between  
leisure tourists who are visiting only for pleasure and are welcomed purely  
for their spend, and professional tourists who bring with them their own ide-  
als drawn from experience and expertise, which is not welcome in a socio-  
professional environment that is already practising its own way of doing  
things, rightly or wrongly. The rejection of expertise from abroad due to  
sociocultural differences is a factor that will impede the advancement of a  
developing events industry and slow the opportunity for narrowing gaps in the  
marketplace for international events.  
# 3.1 Event Tourism  
For economic benefits and job creation, governments have turned to tourism  
as a growth industry, with events seen as image-makers and creating positive  
profile of a destination. It is recognised that event-goers will spend on travel,  
accommodation, and other goods and services in the host city \(Bowdin *et al*.,  
2011\). Destinations have realised this impact from events and are develop-  
ing and implementing strategies to increase visitation \(Bowdin *et al*., 2011\).  
Locations are spearheading event tourism as a social phenomenon by devel-  
oping events and the infrastructure for events to attract consumers who would  
be motivated to travel to an event.  
According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, tourism is the largest  
industry in the world and is growing at an extremely rapid rate \(O’Donnell,  
1997\). So the value of tourism and its growth is not disputed. Event tourism  
can be considered a hybrid genre of events designed to attract consumers to  
travel to an event in ‘the development and marketing of events for tourism and  
economic development purposes’ \(Getz, 2008, p. 406, cited in Ferdinand and  
Kitchin, 2017, p. 318\). *Tourism and Events* 51  
Hays, Page and Buhalis \(2013\) identify social media as the tool to reach a  
global audience with limited resources in a rapidly changing culture because  
it reaches people at a scale and speed larger and more quickly than previous  
communication channels. To contextualise the growth in usage of social media,  
Qualman \(2009, cited in Hays, Page and Buhalis, 2013, p. 230\) reports that if  
Facebook were a country it would be the fourth most populous in the world.  
In recent years there has been growth in places to where consumers travel  
to experience certain features, characteristics, or a perceived attraction of some  
sort \(Buhalis, 2000\). In Poland, cultural consumption is shifting from high cul-  
ture \(museums, art galleries, religious sites, historical landmarks\) to popular  
culture \(festivals, sport events, performing arts attractions\) \(Marciszewska, no  
date, cited in Smith and Robinson, 2009\). It is therefore important for event  
organisers in city centre and capital city locations to reach and penetrate the  
foreign event tourism market by developing integrated services to meet the  
needs of tourists and remain competitive \(McCabe, Sharples and Foster, 2012\)\:  
*American clients demand a quick response – four hours is a typical turna-*  
*round for a proposal. I use Microsoft Teams and a show-round app to*  
\[convey\] *visuals. I visit countries to see their culture and build relation-*  
*ships with long-term planners*.  
\(UK7 – landmark conference centre\)  
This organiser employs technology to facilitate the process and enact speed  
to foreign clients who *demand a quick response*. Driven by their astuteness  
of proactive commercial acumen, such as using *a show-round app to* \[con-  
vey\] *visuals*, it is reasonable to accept that this organiser is driven by broader  
social, cultural, and economic changes in the event tourism sector.  
# 3.2 The Trend of Tourism  
Industrialisation and increasing commodification in the tourism sector brought  
about the desire for escape and distraction, explain Wearing, Stevenson and  
Young \(2010\). They correlate industrialisation with the administration of  
time, because more precise clocks drove the measurement of time through  
timesheets, overtime, timekeeping, and time-off. This led to leisure being  
taken in commodified time or ‘sacred’ time \(Wearing, Stevenson and Young,  
2010, p. 37\), because leisure time is a space for gaining social capital which is  
sacramental to human existence \(Kielbasiewicz-Drozdowska, 2005\).  
Poland is not immune to changes in the leisure tourism sector and the  
opportunities this offers. According to Kielbasiewicz-Drozdowska \(2005\),  
social changes in Poland have been strongly connected with political and  
economic transformations and with changing social awareness. She recog-  
nises that profound changes in the workplace have led to re-evaluation of  
the way in which leisure time and work time are understood. This cements 52 *Tourism and Events*  
the global impact which international travel has on all locations. But event  
organisers in emergent Poland are not yet capitalising on capturing the event  
tourism market and can learn from the proactive, immersive, and technologi-  
cal approaches adopted by organisers in the developed UK industry.  
Buhalis \(2000\) recognises destination marketing is increasingly competi-  
tive worldwide and requires taking advantage of new technologies to enable  
destinations to increase their visibility. Further reinforcement of this point  
is provided by Salameh \(2019\), who writes that the FIFA World Cup and  
the Summer Olympics has been the single most important way to reposition  
the international profile for Brazil, and Giulianotti *et al*. \(2015, p. 99\) refer  
to the London 2012 Olympics as the opportunity for ‘festival capitalism’.  
Gillespie and Hennessey \(2016\) concur that competitiveness moves across  
national borders at an alarmingly fast rate.  
The fast approach reflects the recognition by Hospers \(2004\) that Euro-  
pean regions are increasingly competing to attract consumers through soft fac-  
tors such as a location’s image, referred to as ‘place marketing’. Warnaby and  
Medway \(2013, p. 345\) describe this as ‘the marketing of towns and cities . . .  
to gain advantage for their particular place in an increasingly competitive spa-  
tial environment’. They further categorise place marketing as creating offers  
commodified and marketed to target consumers through the attraction of tour-  
ism and a sense of place-attachment.  
# 3.3 Penetrating Foreign Markets  
UK organisers are bidding for events from large foreign clientele to land-  
mark venues in London’s intensely competitive marketplace with its range  
of large conferencing venues making it a bidding market at the stage where  
the competitive contract to run an event is won or lost \(Berridge, 2010, cited  
in Berridge, 2010\). Quinn \(2013, p. 8\) describes this as a ‘very risky activ-  
ity’. Conference News \(2019\) confirms that London continues to be a hotspot  
for North American meeting and events planners with bookings in 2018 up  
20 percent on the previous year. Large international clients will place their  
enquiry to several London-centric venues and the winner could be the venue  
which responds quickest. To meet this demand, the following organiser not  
only waits for inbound enquiries but makes business trips to their client loca-  
tions in the United States\:  
*I attend the PCMA\* which is an event for event professionals. There*  
*are 4,000 delegates for educational, networking, sales and sharing best*  
*practices*.  
\(UK7 – landmark conference centre\)  
\*  
The PCMA \(Professional Convention Management Association\) \(2020\) describes itself as a pro-  
fessional resource for leaders in the meetings, conventions, events and trade show industries with  
over 6,000 members to facilitate connections. *Tourism and Events* 53  
Attending stateside conventions for networking in the home market of target  
clientele is a proactive approach whereby the organiser is travelling abroad  
to secure foreign business and counteracting the very risky \(Quinn, 2013\)  
bidding process. This demonstrates a plurality of approaches to destination  
marketing\: the location contriving an image to attract visitors from foreign  
markets, and a marketeer reaching into foreign markets to draw visitors to the  
destination.  
Proactive engagement activities with foreign markets such as place  
marketing \(Warnaby and Medway, 2013\) and place branding \(Kavaratzis,  
2004\) contradict observations of Poland organisers in the emerging indus-  
try. Whereas UK organisers invest time and financial resources to travel  
abroad to client destinations to secure international business, there is a gap  
because Poland organisers demonstrate a reactive or non-interventionist  
approach\:  
*They* \[the Polish Convention Bureau\] *are sending us some requests for*  
*venue leasing, and somehow they are promoting us as a place amongst for-*  
*eign customers. I would say they do marketing, mainly marketing. We have*  
*got some associations – MICE associations mainly hotels and that kind of*  
*venues we’re working with them – somehow they promote us amongst their*  
*international customers, somehow*.  
\(PL2 – landmark venue\)  
In this excerpt, the interviewed organiser wavers and uses phrases such as  
*somehow* and *how to say this diplomatically*, which indicates they do not  
fully understand how the Polish Convention Bureau operates and how they  
should be engaging with them to promote their prominent landmark venue  
to foreign clients. This organiser instead waits for foreign business to arrive,  
should it happen, without being actively engaged in pursuing or securing for-  
eign business for the venue. This contrasts with organisers in London where  
the competition is fierce, and they are driven to actively penetrate foreign  
markets. This factual is not to identify complacency but to highlight this gap  
in the socio-professional behaviours between the developed and developing  
industries.  
For sure, Poland organisers do possess the will to drive their events busi-  
ness into the global market for international events\:  
*Huh* . . . *I would say that I would wish myself to be able to put more*  
*attention to promote the building and to promote the support internation-*  
*ally. I would say that it is underestimated – our uniqueness of the build-*  
*ing. But I am also aware that there are so many challenges organising an*  
*event here. So, I would say that firstly we should fix those technical and*  
*regular issues and make things more commercially competitive to be able*  
*to promote the building internationally and to have more international* 54 *Tourism and Events*  
*customers. I would say that we should put more attention to that. Yeah.*  
*And I would say this should be our priority as event managers. Not only*  
*do our daily job to focus on technical issues and signing contracts, but to*  
*do more PR and marketing internationally*.  
\(PL2 – landmark venue\)  
This is encouraging because although it does show the lack of know-how –  
which is symptomatic of the limited community of practice in the shape of an  
emerging events industry – know-how can be gained from international net-  
working and knowledge transfer and addressing the gaps which exist between  
the developed industry and the emerging industry.  
However, the above organiser is at a state-owned property and feels  
unsupported in their ability to reach international markets. It is a situa-  
tion which resonates with the finding by Wong, Mistilis and Dwyer \(2011,  
cited in McCabe, Sharples and Foster, 2012\) that barriers to collaboration  
include a lack of coordination among government departments. This is evi-  
dent with this organiser who is responsible for the day-to-day running of a  
state-owned venue, such as dealing with *technical issues and signing con-*  
*tracts* but recognises there is no strategic forethought to win business from  
foreign markets. The Chartered Institute of Marketing defines this as ‘the  
management process responsible for identifying, anticipating and satisfying  
customer requirements profitably’ \(*Chartered Institute of Marketing* *|* *CIM,*  
*2021*\).  
This organiser is in a situation identified by Welch, Benito and Petersen  
\(2018\) that international managers rarely face foreign market entry decisions  
because of the daily concerns of their job such as growing the business, reor-  
ganising, and developing existing operations. That is the limitation described  
by the above organiser\: *I would wish myself to be able to put more attention*  
*to promote the building and to promote the support internationally*. It is a  
restriction for them in reaching out to foreign markets because they are kept  
busy with the operational demands of running a landmark venue. It is not a  
situation relevant only to Poland because this UK organiser exhibits the same  
focus on daily operations\:  
*My main role is to facilitate our organisers’ needs to get as close to what*  
*people want. We’ll always try and help* . . . *to achieve all of this. That’s*  
*our main function, really. We take good money off clients, so we have to*  
*give them good customer service. I get very annoyed when we don’t deliver*  
*good customer service. I think keeping continuity and a sustainable busi-*  
*ness arm running – we try and run an efficient and lean team and try to*  
*be a bit more streamlined, I suppose, but very much keeping an eye on*  
*efficiency levels making sure we are doing all we can. We’ve spent a lot of*  
*time and money on training staff for the purposes of serving the business* *Tourism and Events* 55  
*as opposed to personal development. It’s always been very much based on*  
*what our output is*.  
\(UK10 – landmark exhibition centre\)  
The focus of this organiser is firmly on business objectives and the sus-  
tainability of the business rather than on consumer objectives and meeting  
expectations of consumers. Saying *we’ve spent a lot of time and money*  
*on training staff for the purposes of serving the business as opposed to*  
*personal development* shows their focus is not on developing people but  
enabling them to do better purely for the needs of the business. This is a  
business-centric approach at the expense of people development or even  
recognition of consumer needs and expectations. Conversely, the following  
organiser does focus on consumers, but this is still for the purpose to serve  
the business’s objectives\:  
*People would like more value for money. I feel that the spend per head*  
*has increased but they’re expecting a lot more with that. I feel that they*  
*are using the* \[venue name\] *for special occasions. Predominantly, a lot of*  
*guests here it’s potentially their first time here at* \[venue name\] *and it’s*  
*normally a special occasion – it might be their favourite act that they’ve*  
*waited their whole life to see. We’ve noticed that it’s not just becoming one*  
*event per year, a lot of people do return to see different events. I think it*  
*varies between people who come to* \[venue name\] *to see a lot of acts and*  
*some that still come when* \[artist name\] *decides to do a show here and*  
*they’ve waited their whole life to see her and now they’re coming to see*  
*her for the first time. But I think everyone has that idea that they spend*  
*more now*.  
\(UK17 – landmark arena venue\)  
These excerpts reveal that it is not the type of objectives an organiser focuses  
on, which is going to impact their reach to event tourists \(whether they are  
foreign clients or foreign consumers\) but whether they are focused on opera-  
tional level or strategic objectives. Both the above organisers focus on differ-  
ent operational factors, and the former organiser is stuck on them, and each is  
not going to attract event tourism this way.  
There is a difference between the UK and Poland in that UK organisers  
have the freedom to refocus their objectives, but Poland organisers do not.  
Yet it is the Poland organisers who want to refocus their objectives from daily  
operational issues to strategic marketing to reach foreign markets.  
There exists an assumption that organisers in the developed industry  
would be better equipped to reach foreign markets because theirs is a multi-  
layered collaborative structure of organisers, marketing managers, and public  
relations people, whereas in the emerging industry, organisers are likely to do 56 *Tourism and Events*  
everything themselves \(which they cannot do\) because it is a flatter, less struc-  
tured industry. However, this problem exists in both territories. Thus, unique  
landmark venues in any capital city should be positioned for bidding in the  
global marketplace for international events to attract international clients and  
foreign consumers to that destination.  
Although Buhalis \(2000\) views destinations as amalgams of tourism prod-  
ucts offering an integrated experience to consumers, the following organiser  
reveals how landmark venues are not attempting to win individual tourists,  
but those clients who bring the tourists\:  
*At least 85% of the time business comes from event management agen-*  
*cies or venue finding businesses. Most of the big companies are man-*  
*dated to use event management agencies or venue finding businesses.*  
*With that in mind, you need to ensure that you don’t just have the rela-*  
*tionship with the end client, you must have the relationship with those*  
*third parties as well*.  
\(UK13 – sales account director\)  
Event agencies and venue finders are less abundant than individual tourists,  
so there is a narrowing to the shape of the structure which means the competi-  
tion to win that business gets fiercer. Wong, Mistilis and Dwyer \(2011\) note  
the conflict between cooperation and competition, but there is a lack of com-  
petitiveness in the Warsaw marketplace because it is an emerging location  
with less demand than London. This is working against venues in Warsaw  
making efforts to win foreign business and promote themselves and the des-  
tination to the global market for international events – because they do not  
have to.  
Venues in locations with intense competition are driving organisers to  
reach foreign markets for business and promote the destination. Gillespie  
and Hennessey \(2016\) identify developed economies like the UK account  
for a disproportionately large share of world gross national product. As  
a result, UK organisers need to attract many companies into their market  
environment\:  
*The credit crunch hit in the backend of 2008, and this is where the type of*  
*venue is very important*. \[Venue name\] *had an incredible level of reoffer*  
*business. What that means is that a function will happen on the same day*  
*every single year, notwithstanding – insurance awards, banking awards,*  
*actuary awards will happen on the same day every single year. What*  
*people did with the credit crunch is they said, ‘we’re not going ahead*  
*with our function, but we will retain the date and we will pay you not to*  
*sell that date and we will recoup it the next year’. So, we went into nego-*  
*tiation with several clients and were charging somewhere around 60%* *Tourism and Events* 57  
*cancellation fees and that represented the profit we would have made on*  
*their function*.  
\(UK15 – landmark event hotel\)  
# 3.3.1 Response to Trends  
The above excerpt shows how events can adapt to reap a competitive  
advantage. Not many industries have this ability to be flexible so rap-  
idly. Hotel bedrooms, for example, cannot respond easily and quickly to  
trends or financial climates. This is important because events generate  
income particularly in times of uncertainty when competition for business  
intensifies – such as happened with the critical impacts of the COVID-19  
pandemic\:  
*The budgets had decreased pre-COVID which has actually changed quite*  
*dramatically post-COVID. Whereas now I think there are far less events, but*  
*the budgets are far higher, I think prior to COVID it was just more and more*  
*and more events and the budgets were smaller and smaller and smaller. In*  
*the UK you get a tax break on your Christmas party per person and we were*  
*seeing a massive shift in companies splitting that budget down the middle*  
*and using half of it for a summer party and half of it for a Christmas party*  
*which was only really, I would say, since about 2015 when we started to*  
*get better summers but prior to then when we didn’t have any nice weather*  
*there wasn’t any point. I would say the early 2000s budgets were far higher*  
*for events because nobody was really checking. And then 2010 onwards*  
*there was a bit more of a check on those budgets but there was* \[*sic*\] *more*  
*events and then, yeah, we’ve kind of come out of COVID in a slightly differ-*  
*ent direction again. And whenever something new comes out – a new style*  
*of event – like when molecular food came out and like you know fancy fine*  
*dining that was a different burst and like I say about summer parties that*  
*was a different sort of style of thing now obviously we’re seeing hybrid and*  
*virtual events sort of taking off in a way that I would never have imagined*.  
\(UK14 – portfolio of royal museum venues\)  
This organiser affirms that events are adaptable to sudden changes by saying  
*it has gone up and down in different ways with different themes*. It is this rapid  
adaptability which organisers need to exploit with their event offering and it  
seems organisers in the developed structure are aware of this and do adjust.  
This is an essential trait for the sustainability of an events business in a culture  
of an unstable financial climate, rapid social and technological changes, and  
in times of uncertainty.  
Organisers in the shaping structure are slower to identify trends and less  
likely to adjust their event offering. This is because they are still in the learning 58 *Tourism and Events*  
phase and will be focused on other areas of learning, and they are working in a  
less joined-up structure to learn trends. There is a gap between UK and Poland  
organisers in recognising that events have the specific characteristics to be  
able to rapidly adapt to change and win business from competitors in the mar-  
ketplace. This puts the Poland events industry at a disadvantage to capitalise  
on growth from the wider global marketplace\:  
\[Events\] *are hugely important. Especially for here at* \[venue name\] *our*  
*fine dining restaurant is quite expensive to run, so without bringing in the*  
*money that events brings in, it would run but it wouldn’t have as strong a*  
*staff and team because, you know, whatever we bring in through the events*  
*comes through* \[venue name\] *as well so it’s really important for bringing*  
*that huge amounts of money for the business*.  
\(UK16 – multi-purpose venues\)  
This organiser in the developed industry shows their understanding that events  
are the leader in their business, and the revenue contribution from events  
allows other areas of the business to keep going – areas which may be more  
costly to operate or achieve less profit in proportion to costs. It is important for  
venues to win events business from competitors to support other areas such  
as maintenance and upkeep, marketing, penetration into foreign markets, and  
investment in technology. This is especially important for a diverse business  
but reinforces the significance of events for any business\:  
\[Events\] *sits very high up. If events are busy it will have a dramatic impact*  
*on the accommodation level of occupancy. If events are dead, the occu-*  
*pancy of the hotel will stem anywhere between 30% and 50%. In Septem-*  
*ber, October, November and the first half of December we* \[events\] *were*  
*chipping that up to around 80% to 100% so we have a dramatic impact on*  
*the level of business the hotel takes*.  
\(UK15 – landmark event hotel\)  
This organiser relies on events business to raise and sustain other areas of  
operation – in this case, the accommodation occupancy levels. One might  
have believed that a landmark hotel in central London would be full of guests  
and its primary source of income would be from bedrooms. But in fact the  
accommodation side of this business is sustained by events – the occupancy  
levels are wholly influenced by events business in this hotel.  
UK organisers recognise the importance of events in a competitive mar-  
ketplace. Ohmae \(1985, cited in Gillespie and Hennessey, 2016\) highlights  
the importance of developing a competitive position in major developed  
markets – in particular to compete in the United States, Europe, and Japan,  
where ‘real global competitors are advised to have strong positions in all three  
areas’ \(Gillespie and Hennessey, 2016, p. 249\). But Poland organisers are not *Tourism and Events* 59  
attuned to competing in the global marketplace of international events or spot-  
ting global market trends.  
The growth effect of an industry is to first evolve the domestic market  
before reaching abroad to overseas markets. In an evolving market, organisers  
are occupied with learning the craft of managing events, let alone reaching for  
foreign clients and attendees – or knowing how to do so.  
Another difference observed in the developed industry is that UK organis-  
ers are not only active in reaching foreign markets, but they are also attracting  
event tourism business in more than one way. Organisers do not necessarily  
need to visit foreign markets to attract clients and attendees but can participate  
with events taking place abroad\:  
*We did* Global Rhythms *working with the Trinidad and Tobago Commission –*  
*they very much wanted to profile their location and their country for tourism.*  
*It was working with the tourist board bringing a little bit of Trinidad and*  
*Tobago to England and we managed to bring across a number of high-pro-*  
*file artists but the challenges around that was the expectation once they’re*  
*here. Dealing with an international artist who may have a rider\* who is*  
*an A-list celebrity in their own right in their own country, bring them over*  
*here in terms of having a rider which is suitable to all was quite a chal-*  
*lenge as to what their expectations were and how their fees are and when*  
*and how those fees should be paid. A lot of international artists work on*  
*the proviso that they get paid when they’re here rather than having a pre-*  
*payment. That was an attendance of close-on 8,000 to an event like that.*  
*We also had the Commissioner from Trinidad and Tobago coming to the*  
*event, and high-profile UK celebrities*.  
\(UK5 – organiser of local authority events\)  
What this organiser describes is different from the usual promotion activities of  
a destination putting on events to attract foreign consumers to attend at the host  
destination which serves to promote and enhance that location and enjoy addi-  
tional benefits such as tourist spend. Here, this organiser demonstrates how a  
destination can export its location through an event taking place at a foreign loca-  
tion. In this case, instead of Trinidad and Tobago attempting to host events that  
would attract tourists to travel to attend on Trinidad and Tobago, they brought  
*a little bit of Trinidad and Tobago to England* to showcase their location. Urry  
\(2002a\) identifies this as object travel, which is the object of attention that draws  
the tourist – in this case it is whatever Trinidad and Tobago are promoting such  
as culture; lifestyle; or simply sand, sun, and sea \(Urry, 2002b, p. 51\).  
It raises the question whether an organiser in an emerging market will  
recognise that they could promote their location and their venue by exporting  
*\**  
A ‘rider’ lists the contractual requirements of an artist or a performer and can be technical  
requirements for their performance, or hospitality requirements for their comfort. 60 *Tourism and Events*  
it to an event taking place in a foreign location. Such an event might be a  
tourism exhibition or an international venue convention such as International  
Confex at the ExCeL, London \(*International Confex – Where the events*  
*industry meets*, 2021\).  
However, Welch, Benito and Petersen \(2018\) caution that reaching foreign  
markets is not the end of it and there is life after entry. Their view is that  
initial entry to a foreign market is a basis for building business and will need  
to evolve with changes of operation. This type of engaging with an industry  
abroad is an opportunity to win business, promote the venue, facilitate knowl-  
edge exchange, and understand cultural differences and the feeling of industry  
inclusion.  
The developed stage of the UK events industry means that there are more  
opportunities for organisers to reach foreign markets because international  
associations with affiliated groups in the UK \(Bowdin *et al*., 2011\) provide a  
route of entry and exposure\:  
*I went to the AIPC* \[International Association of Convention Centres\] *out*  
*to Brussels for a week and we discussed things such as international del-*  
*egates coming to our venue and international clients coming to our venue.*  
*Being part of international associations, we have exposure to meetings,*  
*conferences and seminars. We talk a lot about working with international*  
*clients and how we as UK venues set best practice and how they work*  
*across Europe or the Middle East or North America*.  
\(UK6 – landmark convention centre\)  
Clients, event agents, and venue finders abroad are the core target market  
for this organiser because of the significant size and central London loca-  
tion of their venue. Here, the organiser demonstrates their activities in foreign  
markets and international collaborations with the objective to draw foreign  
business to their venue and, in this case, develop an understanding of the  
expectations of *international clients coming to our venue*. There is a clear  
distinction being identified here between the shape of the socio-professional  
UK habitus and that of emergent Poland\: the difference of active penetration  
into foreign markets versus the non-interventionist.  
Placing oneself into an unfamiliar field \(or ‘habitus’\) takes time and adjust-  
ment to fulfil what Bourdieu \(no date, cited in Grenfell, 2012\) identifies as the  
need to match the habitus with a social context so as to feel comfortable and  
not avoid or resist participation in that social context. It is about acceptance  
because an outsider will not sit comfortably in the habitus until they accept,  
and be accepted, as existing in that social environment.  
Bourdieu describes fitting-in with the habitus as ‘practical mastery’ or  
‘feel for the game’ \(Grenfell, 2012, p. 57\) \(but might otherwise be described  
as ‘engaging with industry networks’\) to understand what is reasonable and *Tourism and Events* 61  
unreasonable, likely and unlikely, and natural ways of taking actions as a  
mediated form of arbitrary social structure.  
# 3.3.2 Internationalisation  
Event tourism is not limited to clients and attendees. It extends to organis-  
ers themselves who can be attracted to foreign destinations to place their  
event\:  
*Some institutions in Poland are absolutely on the international level and*  
*they are highly professional people. But on the whole if you visit a smaller*  
*event somewhere they do adhere to all the regulations set up by the EU.*  
*I think joining the EU was a very, very good thing because you have certain*  
*regulations which absolutely have to be seen to. But sometimes I do come*  
*across things which for us would be unthinkable; poorly managed; poorly*  
*organised. But some are absolutely on the international level, I would say*.  
\(PL4 – organiser of charity events\)  
This organiser places their events in Vienna and is discussing standards in  
Poland in the context of comparing the two locations. By doing so, the organ-  
iser demonstrates the acquisition of knowledge from their wider experience  
of international standards and practices. But the point made about EU regula-  
tions is pertinent\: *I think joining the EU was a very, very good thing because*  
*you have certain regulations which absolutely have to be seen to*. An emerging  
event industry will evolve and take shape in its own manner according to its  
cultural and societal environment. But when Poland joined the European bloc  
in 2004, it adopted EU-wide legislations and regulations which continued the  
drive for Poland to align with the standards and structures of other European  
countries \(Domański, 2003\). Poland’s accession to Europe pivoted the Poland  
events industry to fall in line with international standards and expectations  
in catching up to the advanced economies and competing successfully in the  
global market \(Bogdan *et al*., 2015\).  
Observations concur that domestic events in Poland can be substand-  
ard because of the lack of local professional expertise in the management  
of events. Emerging locations win ‘mega-events’, which bring with them  
infrastructure, guidance, and outside expertise. Thereafter, that location has  
‘emerged’ into the space for international events, albeit without local exper-  
tise after the mega-event has ended.  
But the above organiser is identifying how European regulations are  
improving standards of events in Poland. Indeed, Gillespie and Hennessey  
\(2016\) note that there are moves to internationalise laws, with the Hague Con-  
ference on International Private Law considering a global treaty for enforc-  
ing legal judgements. This would be a significant move in the direction of 62 *Tourism and Events*  
standardisation and would help destinations to become associated with desir-  
able qualities perceived by target audiences \(Kavaratzis, 2004\).  
It is an argument for homogenisation, which would narrow some gaps that  
exist from location to location. It would no longer be the haphazard shaping  
of an event industry according to its own socio-professional environment but  
a standardised homogenous international event industry led by those countries  
which are already shaped and developed into a socio-professional structure  
with all it entails. A move such as this would recognise the theory advanced  
by Mary Douglas \(Anfara and Mertz, 2011\) in identifying four prototypes  
of social environments which influence the entire cultural environment.  
These are individualist \(individuals not constrained by rules or traditions\),  
bureaucratic \(hierarchical with low levels of autonomy\), corporate \(individual  
behaviour is exercised in the name of the group\), and collectivist \(the perpetu-  
ation of group goals and survival is highly valued\).  
Bogdan *et al*. \(2015\) appraise that the initiative which the Polish people have  
shown indicates that they aspire to become competitive on a global scale. The  
above organiser is evidence of this appraisal because they are in the process of  
comparing domestic standards in Poland with standards encountered in Vienna.  
This organiser is gaining learning of international standards which makes them  
a better organiser. If this were upscaled and became embedded in the socio-  
professional behaviour of organisers across the events industry in Poland – if  
other organisers in Poland achieved learning through international experience –  
Poland would narrow their gaps in the global market for international events.  
The following organiser reinforces this potential by their comparisons of  
different locations drawn from experience in the Middle East and Malaysia\:  
*Certainly, when I was overseas you wouldn’t really bring up deposits and*  
*payments and schedules and that sort of stuff if you were dealing with*  
*Middle Eastern clients – it was considered to be uncouth. In Malaysia*  
*I remember taking an enquiry for a French event management company*  
*and they expected us to be quite European in our attitude and I had to tell*  
*them upfront that things didn’t happen perhaps the way it would happen*  
*if you were in Western Europe, out in Malaysia. If you’ve got a Western*  
*European or American agent wanting to bring a piece of business, they*  
*want reassurance that things are going to happen to time and to budget*  
*and all those normal things you’d expect. But you also have to share the*  
*realities of the part of the world you are in*.  
\(UK3 – landmark sports venue\)  
It can be seen from both these organisers how international experience is a  
valuable contribution to the profession in both the developed and develop-  
ing event industries. The latter organiser understands that it is cultural differ-  
ences which shape the way things are done and not only about knowing how  
to organise events. In fact, they are suggesting that knowledge in organising *Tourism and Events* 63  
events is secondary to getting the cultural customs correct by saying, *you also*  
*have to share the realities of the part of the world you are in*. This understand-  
ing was learnt from their interactions in foreign fields which otherwise might  
not have been understood.  
Gaining such understandings fits with the four characteristics of profes-  
sion identified by Ritzer and Walczak \(1986\) as theoretical knowledge, self-  
regulated training and practice, authority over clients, and orientation to  
community rather than self-identify. Theoretical knowledge can be obtained  
through regular interaction with peers, and authority over clients provides  
organisers with knowledge their clients lack, which allows them to provide  
direction and advice when responding to clients’ demands. This is made clear  
by Berners \(2019, p. 67\), who states that ‘above anything else a client is looking  
for guidance and support – otherwise they would be doing the job themselves’.  
Clients rely on guidance from specialists, and the specialists rely on guid-  
ance from other specialists – otherwise the system fails \(Berners, 2019\). The  
basis of being an event organiser is to advise others – a concept referred  
to as the ‘real’ event manager \(Berners, 2017, pp. 19–21\). The ‘real event  
manager’ concept is compatible with Foucault’s power-knowledge theory  
\(Gutting, 2005, p. 96\), investigating the traits of seriousness and credibility\:  
‘who was authorised to speak seriously, and what questions and procedures  
were relevant to assess the credibility of those statements that were taken  
seriously’.  
So, organisers in the UK events industry benefit from their penetration into  
foreign markets which is supported at local and national government levels  
because of the significant contribution events provide to the economy. Events  
in Poland are not yet recognised with that same level of seriousness and Poland  
organisers are not supported in their reach and penetration of the foreign event  
tourism market. By not doing so, organisers in the emerging industry are not  
gaining the knowledge transfer brought about with international engagement  
and relations, they are not spotting and meeting global trends and demands  
in events, and they are not being driven to operate at the level of standards  
recognised in the global market for international events.  
# 3.4 The Experience Economy  
This book is concerned with the shape of two events industries within the  
global market for international events, so it is important to address the experi-  
ence economy because events are live experiences designed to attract con-  
sumers and clients in the global market of event tourism.  
The experience economy is about making money out of experiences  
\(Boswijk, Thijssen and Peelen, 2007\). Pine and Gilmore \(2011\) provide the  
example of a coffee bean to explain how the cost of a service can be inflated  
by the experience it delivers to the consumer. The cost of producing coffee  
from a coffee bean is far less than the purchase price of a coffee in a coffee 64 *Tourism and Events*  
shop. A consumer can choose to further inflate the purchase price for their  
coffee if they decide to purchase it in, say, Harrods or The Ritz. They will  
select to pay a higher inflated price just for the experience of consuming a  
coffee in that environment, which is how the experience economy works. Ger-  
ritsen and Van Olderen \(2014\) consider events to be typical of the experience  
economy because they meet the demand for unique, personalised, and memo-  
rable experiences and provide social cohesion in communities. Consumers  
will pay a premium to attend an event for the experience it will give them  
which they will not get anywhere else or if they do not pay to attend that  
event. Thus, creative events are typical of the experience economy\:  
*For me it’s always about people leaving in a happy fashion, you know,*  
*they’ve achieved what they needed to do. You see people leaving – you*  
*only need to hang around in an exit area looking kind-of official and peo-*  
*ple are very quick to tell you how they feel and think. I’ve worked with*  
*other stakeholders and done lots of concerts and music events with 20,000*  
*people piling out all at once from* \[name of venue\] *and you get the Tube*  
*station manager saying, ‘thanks very much it went really well’ and police*  
*officers saying, ‘thanks very much it all went well’. And job-well-done*  
*really – that’s what we’re there for; we’re there to make our partners’ lives*  
*easier so they’re doing their jobs safely and efficiently and very much with*  
*a customer focus, visitor focus in mind*.  
\(UK10 – landmark exhibition centre\)  
This organiser describes the experience economy\: creating an experience for  
the consumer who has decided to participate by paying to attend. For this  
organiser, their job is to provide the experience their consumers have paid for  
and expect to receive – this is how the organiser measures the *job-well-done*.  
This organiser is passionate about their job of delivering an experience to the  
consumer. By doing so, the consumer will receive a transcendent experience  
that would otherwise not be achievable \(Rojek, 2013\).  
It is therefore important for event organisers to understand the motiva-  
tions of consumers which, for events, is socialisation, a fun atmosphere which  
offers ample opportunity to socialise, and to have new experiences \(Gelder  
and Robinson, 2009\).  
If the potential consumer decides not to participate, they risk missing the  
opportunity of receiving the experience because the event will be gone. This  
is what makes events a perishable service \(Bowdin *et al*., 2011\) because when  
the date of the event passes, it cannot rehappen or be resold. Organisers in the  
developed UK events industry recognise they exist within the culture of an  
experience economy\:  
*There is far greater emphasis on an experience, which works very, very*  
*well where I currently work but less well for people who don’t have an* *Tourism and Events* 65  
*experience to offer. So, I think clients want to have something that they can*  
*take a picture of and something that they can remember. So, for example*  
*the museums, I can offer things like a telescope viewing or a planetarium*  
*show, or a gallery tour, or all of these other sort of added value things*  
*which a hotel can’t because it’s a hotel. So, you know, anything that you*  
*can do to make it seem a little bit ‘sparklier’ a lot of clients are asking for*  
*sort of what else can we do to enhance people, potentially because there’s*  
*more events for people to go to, they want people to come to theirs*.  
\(UK14 – portfolio of royal museum venues\)  
This excerpt highlights the experience economy in the developed events  
industry has already elevated to an ever-upward requirement for experiences.  
Driven by demand for more exciting events and creativity, experiential events  
have shaped the events industry in the UK, because at one time creating an  
experience used to be an additive to an event, but now experiences *are* the  
event.  
The above organiser recognises the demand for event experiences and  
understands the competitive advantage of their venues meeting that market.  
In fact, this organiser mentions hotels in almost a derisory fashion\: *\[A\] hotel*  
*can’t because it’s a hotel*.  
# 3.4.1 Hotels’ Loss of Events Business  
Creativity for an event can be a challenge if it is in a hotel ballroom, which  
is typically ‘designed to be generic’ and ‘do not allow for the creativity of  
events’ \(Berners, 2019, pp. 11–12\). There are exceptions where a hotel event  
space is architecturally impressive, or where the hotel ballroom is exception-  
ally large such as the Grosvenor House Hotel on London’s Park Lane which  
can seat 2,000 guests for a sit-down banquet, or when the event requires over-  
night accommodation for guests, in which case it must be a hotel.  
Hotels in the developed events industry have lost significant share of events  
business as the industry expanded to other venues that became competitors in  
the events marketplace and are more exciting, unusual, and different – and  
better aligned to fit the experience economy. As the demand for events grows  
in a location, it demands ever more creativity, excitement, and experiences.  
This causes events to ‘leak’ from happening only in hotels to events being  
staged in all manner of venues, from art galleries and museums to disused  
warehouses. This has a cause-and-effect impact because when events move  
from hotels, they are more complex and require specialist expertise, knowl-  
edge, and resources. In turn, organisers need professionalisation, skills, and  
experience. And, it can be charged for, so it means higher event budgets and  
larger profits.  
Observing the emerging industry shows that events are more inclined  
to take place in hotels, underpinned by Buczak *et al*. \(2020\) reporting just 66 *Tourism and Events*  
9 percent of events in Poland are hosted in congress centres and only 16 percent  
in event venues, compared to 65 percent hosted in hotels. Events in hotels  
are less risky because they have resources *in situ*, including knowledge and  
skills in hotel management as a related discipline. Still, the events industry  
in Poland is not as confined to hotels to the extent the UK events industry  
was when it was evolving. At one time in the UK, events were ‘hidden’ in  
hotels and visible mainly to hotel workers. This restrictive factor influenced  
the shape of the UK events industry as it is today because current senior-level  
organisers crossed into events from their roles in hotels, such as event sales  
or conference and banqueting. Nowadays, organisers do not need to work in  
hotels to work in events, which has helped events management to identify as a  
stand-alone discipline. It has also driven the rise in formal education in events  
management because it is no longer seen as an offshoot of the hotel discipline  
and managing a hotel department.  
The reason the emerging industry is not as confined to hotels is due to  
the cross-cultural and global context of events which were less so at the time  
when the UK industry was evolving. Event clients and consumers are more  
widely travelled and have wider experiences of events at home and abroad –  
especially as event tourists. The events industry in Poland, therefore, has leap-  
frogged the years of events being confined to hotels.  
There are two further factors why hotels have lost events business. The  
first is the nondescript design of function suites designed to appeal to any  
types of events from formal conferences to creative parties. In many cases,  
such function suites in hotels have low ceilings because of cost restraints dur-  
ing construction and architects being ignorant of the needs of events. Events  
require high ceilings for the creative elements \(Berners, 2019\) and it is dif-  
ficult for an organiser to insert creative elements without generous ceiling  
height. Organisers and event suppliers \(and clients, actually\) are judged on the  
creative experience of their events – including feedback from attendees – so  
an event must be creative. Plus, organisers and suppliers make money from  
providing the creative elements to enhance the event experience. So, if there  
is no height in the venue for creative enhancements, organisers and suppliers  
will place their clients elsewhere into venues with higher ceilings.  
Second, there is a perception in the UK events industry that hotels are  
for low-budget events. This has come about because hotels provide most  
resources *in situ*, including catering, staff, and notably technical apparatus  
which is less complex and less costly. So, if an event budget is not gener-  
ous, a hotel would be the best place for that event. This has resulted in nega-  
tive connotations for clients in the developed industry who have reached the  
understanding that if their event takes place in a hotel, it might be seen as a  
low-budget event.  
This shift is still happening and relevant because, as the above organiser  
states, their venues are unusual, interesting, and creative, which allows for *Tourism and Events* 67  
events held there to be individual and memorable\: *There is far greater empha-*  
*sis on an experience, which works very, very well where I currently work*.  
This is an important competitive advantage to win business from hotels in an  
experience economy because the events offering is unique and can be tailored  
to clients looking for evermore creative experiences and *anything that you can*  
*do to make it seem a little bit sparklier*.  
The upward demand for creativity and uniqueness is driving UK venues  
to adapt their events offering to capture clients in the experience economy  
marketplace. In fact, the following organiser speaks of the need for their hotel  
to pivot from corporate events and move into the creative events space purely  
to align with the experience economy\:  
*It involves change and the growth of our business. We, as an industry have*  
*to adapt. We, as a business – one of the plans for our 10-year anniversary*  
*is to look at expanding the function space and changing that. We have to*  
*develop it as an event venue as opposed to a meeting venue – it’s very corpo-*  
*rate at the moment. It’s very functional – it’s very adaptable, actually – but*  
*we have to lean more towards events than meetings when we develop that*  
*area. We need to expand the space because we need bigger numbers* . . .  
*and in terms of the interior design of it needs to be more in keeping with*  
*events, including weddings, than a board meeting or a conference*.  
\(UK11 – country house hotel\)  
This organiser underpins the problem with generic hotel function suites by  
saying, *It’s very functional – it’s very adaptable, actually*. It sounds a strength,  
but it is no longer enough for an event space to be functional and adaptable  
when the demand is for unique creative experiences. This is a significant shift  
of this hotel’s business mix from the existing corporate events offering to that  
of creative events. This reaffirms the shift of the UK events industry and con-  
firms that venues are realigning in response to the experience economy.  
Poland organisers also appear to be recognising the experience economy\:  
*Most of our customers, they come back. Most of them. But, I’m aware*  
*that not because of the quality of our job but because of the building – it’s*  
*unique. That’s the reason. It’s a really good spot for B2C* \[Business-to-  
Consumer\] *events, for fairs and exhibitions to the B2C market. The best one,*  
*I would say here in Warsaw. That’s why customers come back to us – not*  
*because of the quality of our service, yeah our uniqueness makes the job*.  
\(PL2 – landmark venue\)  
This statement is clear indication of awareness in the emerging construct for  
the need to provide an event experience. The above organiser demonstrates  
that event consumers in Poland are looking for uniqueness, just as in the UK. 68 *Tourism and Events*  
However, unlike the UK, organisers in Poland have not yet begun strategically  
aligning to the experience economy.  
Poland, therefore, again demonstrates a non-interventionalist standpoint,  
as with their penetration into foreign event tourist markets. Moreover, the  
above organiser is candid about consumers not choosing this venue because of  
the quality of service they will receive but because it is a venue which offers  
a unique event experience. This organiser, then, is banking on winning event  
business for the uniqueness of the venue, rather than having to provide a qual-  
ity service to win that market sector.  
This exposes a gap between the UK and Poland in meeting the experience  
economy because while both locations recognise the value of providing an  
experience for event consumers, organisers in the UK are actively aligning to  
that market sector. Poland organisers, however, are content to let that market  
arrive to them without making efforts to win that sector through market reach  
and penetration, or even to meet the service needs and expectations of that  
market once it has landed.  
# 3.5 Gap in Service Quality  
When the above organiser states, *I’m aware that not because of the qual-*  
*ity of our job but because of the building – it’s unique*, they are accepting  
their shortfall in providing quality service. This is another indication of an  
experience economy in Poland because it reveals clients are placing qual-  
ity of experience above the need for quality of service. The problem is that  
it exposes a gap in delivering a quality event service in line with the event  
experience. Service quality is defined by Donthu and Yoo \(1998\) as the dif-  
ference between perceived service performance and expected service level\:  
the difference is the gap.  
This *laissez-faire* approach is not observable at landmark venues in the  
developed UK events industry. In a location with a highly competitive market,  
good reputation is the priority for attracting clients \(and more pertinently, to  
achieving return clients\) in the experience economy. Even so, in the UK as  
well, most event organisers are not trained in meeting consumer needs and  
expectations\:  
*Never had any training on that to be honest with you. It’s not some-*  
*thing that I’ve needed, I don’t think. I think the industry, yes you need*  
*to have that. There’s lots of personal attributes you need to have to work*  
*in a high-pressured environment dealing with lots of people pre-show,*  
*onsite, whatever. We as a company don’t have training at the moment.*  
*It would be worthwhile for some people but I haven’t done any of those*  
*qualifications*.  
\(UK8 – organiser for a pan-European publishing company\) *Tourism and Events* 69  
This is indication that the events industry in the UK is still not closely attuned  
with meeting consumer expectations of service, which is a fact confirmed by  
Berridge \(2012\), who found organisers do not consistently achieve the main  
desired outcomes for all guests.  
The above organiser feels that training in customer service expectations is  
*not something that I’ve needed, I don’t think*, which reveals naivety in under-  
standing the value of people in both the social and professional contexts of  
being an organiser of events. It is a ‘people’ profession after all, which is why  
entrants to the industry who study for a degree in events management are  
taught subjects such as customer service management and the psychology of  
consumer behaviours.  
It is unsurprisingly a parallel situation in Poland and the UK, even though  
the UK industry is more developed. This shortfall in meeting customer service  
expectations is tolerated in both locations because in the microenvironment  
of an event’s immediate surrounds \(Reic, 2017\) an event consumer will judge  
the experience \(and service\) they receive at each event to be autonomous upon  
reflective factors such as quality of food, how easy it was to find the venue,  
and even the weather on the day of the event.  
But it ignores the fact that event tourists exist in the macroenvironment  
and will benchmark the event experience \(and service\) they receive against  
other events in the wider experience economy as they travel around in the  
global market for international events where political, economic, social, tech-  
nological, environmental, and legal factors are less manageable \(Reic, 2017\).  
This creates a distinction between the domestic experience economy and the  
international experience economy, in that an organiser might learn to meet  
service expectations for home clients and attendees, but not when delivering  
to international clients and foreign attendees. Herein lies the cause of a second  
tier of events service and the existence of a gap.  
A second tier occurs in a location where organisers evolve the learning of  
meeting the expectations of their home clients and consumers \(clientele\) and  
get used to delivering to that level of expectation. Vaughan \(1996\) refers to  
this pattern of normalisation during her investigation of the National Aero-  
nautics and Space Administration \(NASA\) Challenger disaster \(see Sec-  
tion 4.4 ‘Attitude to Risk’\). The problem with the normalisation of a second  
tier in the domestic context is that it does not translate to higher levels of  
expectation across the wider market for international events. So, when inter-  
national clients and foreign consumers visit an event in a second-tier destina-  
tion, their expectations will not be met and they will consider that location as  
substandard.  
The way out of a stagnant state of normalised second-tier standards is for  
the evolving industry to shape a construct where organisers are led to iden-  
tify self-learning acculturation from the international market to know what  
standards are expected and how to meet them. This is possible to achieve if 70 *Tourism and Events*  
organisers are making contact with foreign clients and international attend-  
ees, which is the case with all capital city landmark venues. These organisers  
have opportunities to learn from observing their foreign clientele, adopting  
practices and procedures that are expected by their clientele, and conducting  
after-event evaluation and feedback procedures.  
It is less possible to achieve acculturation learning for organisers at inde-  
pendent and smaller venues where they are not interacting with international  
clientele. This is where formal education has value, as does organisers trav-  
elling to overseas events. But again, the industry needs to shape a construct  
where organisers across the evolving industry recognise their need for a self-  
learning environment.  
The gap in service quality is less pronounced or even invisible in the  
developed industry because organisers in this construct have evolved to meet  
the expectations of their foreign clientele. The gap in service quality does still  
exist, though, because not all organisers in the developed industry are work-  
ing with foreign clientele. Even if they are, they might have learnt to meet the  
expectations of their clientele drawn from a particular overseas location such  
as, say, America or the Middle East, but not China.  
Event tourists possess experience of the increasingly competitive global  
tourism market. Thus, the expectations of tourists in the experience economy  
are constantly rising \(Augustyn and Ho, 1998\). Augustyn and Ho further iden-  
tify a strong relationship with consumer services and tourism and find the  
SERVQUAL service quality model \(Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry, 1988\)  
to be important for defining the true meaning of consumer satisfaction. The  
model uses gap analysis to demonstrate how event tourism organisations can  
improve their service quality\:  
•

•  
Gap 1\: Between consumers’ expectations and management’s perceptions  
of consumers’ expectations  
Gap 2\: Between management’s perceptions of consumers’ expectations  
and service quality specifications  
Gap 3\: Between service quality specifications and service delivery  
Gap 4\: Between service delivery and external communications to  
consumers  
•  
Gap 5\: Between consumers’ expectations and perceived service  
There is work to be done in both the developed UK events industry and the  
developing Poland events industry to educate organisers in service quality  
and meeting expectations of service. It is further advanced in the UK because  
the intensely competitive marketplace demands organisers to provide good  
service to win and retain business and protect their good reputation. But in  
both locations the customer service elements of events management are not  
being addressed. *Tourism and Events* 71  
As an events industry takes shape, and when it pivots shape, organisers  
need to align themselves with the tourism side of events so they reach and  
penetrate overseas markets to attract event tourists. This can be done in align-  
ment with a destination’s place marketing initiatives. But winning foreign cli-  
ents and international attendees is the beginning. Once they have been won,  
organisers need to meet customer service expectations which, in an interna-  
tional marketplace, are benchmarked elsewhere. To achieve the objective of  
meeting international expectations, all organisers in both the developed and  
developing industries – and not only those at landmark venues – should be  
led to recognise their need for a self-learning environment. This alone would  
enact acculturation learning from international clientele either through direct  
contact, formal education, or by engaging with professional associations for  
knowledge sharing.  
# 3.6 Summary and Conclusions – Tourism and Events  
Organisers in the developed events industry have created a plurality of  
approaches in reaching foreign markets by both immersing themselves into a  
foreign target market and by drawing foreign markets to their home destina-  
tion. They are active in penetrating foreign markets through targeted mar-  
keting and promotion initiatives, but they also travel abroad to their foreign  
clients to draw bookings into their London venues. This plural of activity is  
due to intense competition in London with its abundance of landmark venues,  
which is driving organisers to need to win clients quickly by developing close  
relationships with bookers and agencies.  
In the developing events industry, there is less demand from foreign cli-  
ents, so the competitive culture is less intense. At first glance it might seem an  
advantage to have less competition in the marketplace, but it means organisers  
are not driven to fight to win business and are complacent about penetrating  
foreign markets.  
This book, however, is not concerned with any gap between the UK and  
Poland in the levels of event tourism business they are winning, nor the gap  
in their competition culture, but the gap between their approaches to winning  
event tourists.  
UK organisers are active and proactive in winning foreign business to cap-  
italise on capturing the event tourism market in immersive and technological  
ways. This is necessary to do because European regions are increasingly com-  
peting to attract visitors with soft factors such as the location’s image, which  
is referred to as ‘place marketing’ \(Warnaby and Medway, 2013\).  
Conversely, Poland organisers adopt a non-interventionist approach and  
wait for foreign business to knock on their door. This is because Poland organ-  
isers do not feel the drive to be competitive in winning event tourist busi-  
ness, so they do not invest in knowledge, resources, or effort to attract event 72 *Tourism and Events*  
tourists, or reach and penetrate foreign markets, or meet the expectations of  
event tourist clients and consumers as a transient social demographic. This  
would not be a concern if Poland were a stand-alone events industry. But  
Poland exists within the global market for international events and is already  
operating in the event tourism marketplace. This means, first, that Poland  
organisers are missing out on business opportunities from foreign clients and  
international consumers; second, they have less opportunity for cross-cultural  
learning; third, Poland is shaping its own tier of event provision, and therein  
lies another gap.  
For a destination to increase its visibility to foreign markets, it needs to  
create an identity by drawing on sociological, geographical, economic, and  
cultural aspects to maintain the competitive edge as an urban landscape shift-  
ing from industrial to cultural capital. Other European municipalities are  
becoming more professional in events policy due to their recognition that  
events are important for urban economy, the quality of life, and the attraction  
of a city. An example is Armstrong, Hobbs and Lindsay \(2011\) describing  
the place marketing undertaken to impress inspectors for the 2012 London  
Olympics, which included relocating undesirable elements of the public, car-  
peting a train station, and hiring a brass band. But event organisers in an  
emerging industry tend to think local and are not thinking global in their  
response to the globalisation of the international events marketplace to which  
they aspire to belong.  
Tourists search for pleasurable experiences \(Urry, 2002b\) to escape from  
everyday life \(Berridge, 2011\) and the experience economy is about mak-  
ing money out of experiences. In the developed UK construct, organisers  
have begun to strategically align their events provision to meet the experi-  
ence economy. Poland organisers, by contrast, know the experience economy  
exists but rely on the experience delivered by their unique landmark venue,  
rather than creating the service experience which international clientele  
expect to receive. Poland organisers also take a non-interventionist stance  
by waiting for the experience economy market to arrive to them by chance –  
drawn by the venue alone.  
It requires an events industry to be actively marketing to engage with pros-  
pect consumers of both the domestic experience economy and the interna-  
tional experience economy who decide whether to travel to attend an event.  
Because event tourists are choosing to spend their money on tickets, travel,  
accommodation, hospitality, and merchandise, the event experience must live  
up to the promise and fulfil their expectations. Otherwise, the social value of  
the experience concept will become devalued – and global-oriented consum-  
ers are ever more demanding.  
Event tourists from different locations will have different levels of expecta-  
tion of the experience they receive at an event. Applying Symbolic Interaction  
\(Berridge, 2011\) will assist organisers to understand how consumers interpret  
experiences. But, as Berridge points out, experience is a complex series of *Tourism and Events* 73  
relational components that are not uniform during the length of time it occurs  
or be the same for all those involved. Consumers who are from a developed  
events marketplace, for instance, will have wider experiences of previous  
events and have a wider availability of choice of which events to attend than  
consumers from an undeveloped or emerging events marketplace. Still, an  
events industry needs to get it right, regardless of their stage of development,  
because as soon as a country reaches a certain level of affluence the demand  
for services shifts to experiences \(Boswijk, Thijssen and Peelen, 2007\).  
Evolving societies take on a new character by the constant requirement  
to adjust to changes induced by the evolution of a host society \(de Kadt and  
Williams, 1976\) which in the case of Poland is the European society. This  
means an evolving society with an industry that is emerging into the global  
marketplace cannot do so if the service quality of that industry does not meet  
international expectations. The implication for Poland is that if they, as an  
emerging events industry, do not shape with the socio-professional construct  
of the global marketplace for international events, their autonomous events  
industry will take shape around the limitations of its own societal environ-  
ment. The impact will be to expose foreign clients and international consum-  
ers to gaps in safety, quality, and standards and a substandard tier of events  
within the one global marketplace for international events.  
For a socio-professional culture shift to happen in the Poland events indus-  
try, international experience would be a valuable contribution to the profes-  
sion as it develops the four characteristics of profession identified by Ritzer  
and Walczak \(1986\) as theoretical knowledge, self-regulated training and  
practice, authority over clients, and orientation to community rather than self-  
identity. Without the international unification of standards of international  
events, Poland is shaping a loose socio-professional construct with fewer  
rules whereby a tight culture has many rules, norms, and standards for correct  
behaviour, as can be seen in the UK events industry.  
The events industry in both the UK and Poland are not in alignment with  
local and national destination marketing and place marketing initiatives. Local  
and national authorities and associations need to position organisers, venues,  
and specific events to reach event tourists as well as leisure tourists and extend  
inbound visitor traffic. This will enhance the profile of London and Warsaw  
destinations with their experiential offering to visitors through leisure events  
and corporate events and will attract higher levels of event-related spend at  
each destination such as on accommodation and visiting other attractions. **4 Risk Awareness at Events**  
When examining factors that shape an events industry, risk awareness must  
be considered because safety at events needs to be the priority of every organ-  
iser anywhere. Also, all event consumers are exposed to risks at every event,  
wherever the event happens to be taking place.  
The particular interest of this book is impacts on safety at events if risk  
awareness varies in different locations due to the stage of development influ-  
encing the way an events industry takes shape.  
Safety and risk management is an essential principle for events industry  
professionals and is key in planning, according to Bladen *et al*. \(2018\), who  
state that safety should be factored in from the start and be considered during  
every part of the planning process. Beech, Kaiser and Kaspar \(2014\) insist that  
risk assessment must be carried out for all events during the entire life cycle  
of an event so that it is an integral and strategic part of organisational pro-  
cesses and decision-making. The Event Management Body of Knowledge is a  
resource which categorises risk in the ‘domains’ section of the EMBOK model.  
This chapter explores, first, whether event organisers in both the developed  
and developing constructs are risk-aware at all stages of managing events,  
particularly in the planning stages where the identification and assessment of  
potential risks can mitigate them from occurring. Second, whether there is a  
gap in risk awareness and the acceptance of risk due to factors within a devel-  
oped socio-professional structure and one which is in development.  
*To be fair, everything should fall behind safety. Really. If you go right*  
\[inaudible\] *to the crisis management planning, everything is about the*  
*safety, wellbeing and welfare of visitors coming to site. It is the number*  
*one of everything. You have to put that one down*.  
\(UK6 – landmark convention centre\)  
The approach of this organiser is indicative of professional event management  
and supports the statement in Berners \(2017, p. 23\) that ‘the job of an event  
organiser is to eliminate or certainly minimise risk’.  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781032684161-4 *Risk Awareness at Events* 75  
Not all risk can be eliminated but there is a process of risk identification  
and assessment to mitigate potential risks \(set out in Section 4.1 ‘Management  
of Risk’\). This is important; as Douglas and Wildavsky \(1982\) acknowledge,  
we cannot know the risks we face now or in the future, but we must act as if  
we do. This helps understand the proactive or before-event approach to risk  
whereby risks can be managed out of an event rather than left in to cause  
damage or harm. Events are temporary live happenings, so if a risk is not  
managed out of the event before the event happens, it is already too late, and  
the damage or harm will have impacts and consequences which will be dif-  
ficult to recover.  
# 4.1 Management of Risk  
The process of risk management is set out by Schwarz *et al*. \(2017,  
pp. 181–184\)\:  
1 Risk identification  
2 Risk analysis  
3 Risk treatment  
4 Risk avoidance  
5 Risk acceptance  
6 Reduction of the likelihood of occurrence  
7 Reduction of the consequences of the occurrence  
8 Transferring the risk  
9 Retaining the risk  
10 Risk monitoring  
This ten-point process highlights the depth of risk management and it is not  
a cursory activity or tick-box exercise to satisfy compliance to legislation but  
is a thread to weave through the fabric of the life cycle of managing events.  
Compliance is somewhat of a get-out for some organisers who might go so far  
as to be compliant but go no further, which is discussed later in this chapter.  
But there is social responsibility to provide a safe event, and this organiser  
of community events underlines the importance of risk management in their  
public-facing role\:  
*Ensuring we’re compliant with health and safety in terms of any kind of*  
*emergency procedures that I’d feel comfortable running an event, and also*  
*the public perception*.  
\(UK5 – organiser of local authority events\)  
This organiser is concerned with the social perception of their events which  
is the driver for them to comply with risk management procedures to ensure 76 *Risk Awareness at Events*  
that the public are kept safe. To run an event with the potential to cause injury  
to members of the public would have a wider detrimental social impact than  
causing harm to an attendee at a private or exclusive event. This perspective  
reflects the individual versus societal risk categorisation by Gerber and Von  
Solms \(2005\), whereby individual risk is about risk to an individual, worker,  
member of the public, or anybody living within a defined radius from an  
establishment. Societal risk is about risk to society caused, for example, by  
the chance of a large accident causing several deaths. This viewpoint seems  
too definitional, however, because events bridge both categories, so fit within  
neither.  
First, all events are for groups of people, so if there is risk to one \(indi-  
vidual risk\) there is risk to several \(societal risk\). Second, all events are live,  
so the organiser must consider, assess, and mitigate both the individual and  
societal risks. Third, it would be wrong for the organiser to focus their risk  
management process for one stakeholder group only, such as the client \(indi-  
vidual risk\) and not the guests \(societal risk\) or the sponsor \(individual risk\)  
and not the workers \(societal risk\).  
Some service professionals who are employed to take decisions on risk  
are reluctant to contemplate risk if death is a potential consequence \(Carson  
and Bain, 2008\). It is understandable that some organisers might prefer not to  
identify risks which will potentially cause them a problem to mitigate, and the  
monetary cost of mitigating them. It might be tempting, then, to look away,  
pretend those risks are not there, and hope nothing goes wrong.  
This type of risk avoidance is observable in the socio-professional con-  
struct of the emergent Poland events industry, but not in the developed UK  
construct. Even so, this is more to do with the lack of knowledge and for-  
mal education in the need for risk management processes than organisers in  
Poland wilfully ignoring the presence of risks. Whatever the reasons an organ-  
iser might ignore risk, risk must not ever be ignored.  
Organisers in the UK events industry are further ahead than Poland in  
their understanding of the need to mitigate risks and the value of doing so.  
Bladen *et al*. \(2018\) note that the UK’s perception of health, safety, and risk  
in the past tended to be red-tape bureaucracy that ticked regulatory boxes  
while creating extra work for the event organiser. This may have been so,  
but it did have the effect to shape the UK events industry towards an audit  
culture psychological stance in line with other sectors. It also created the socio-  
professional environment of safer events. It is easy to view red-tape bureau-  
cracy as a negative factor, but it has in fact driven organisers in the UK to  
compliance behaviours because of the fear of legal repercussions and litiga-  
tion if something were to go wrong \(negligence\).  
Thus, organisers in the developed industry are wont to be compliant to  
avoid litigation, which means they must be educated in the regulations and  
legislations, or risk breaching them. An individual organiser or the company  
they work for might recognise this need and seek training, accreditation, or *Risk Awareness at Events* 77  
knowledge from a professional association or specialist. It is therefore the  
individual organiser or the company they work for which has driven the UK  
events industry to professionalisation and risk aversity rather than consumers  
or even the insurance industry responding to previous tragedies at events.  
This contrasts with the emerging industry where the fear of repercussions  
and litigation is not as pronounced and organisers are further distant from  
the legal system because it is less likely for an event to receive a visit by an  
authoritative body. It means Poland organisers operate in a culture where they  
feel they can get away with noncompliance – not because they wilfully aim to  
breach safety legislation but because they do not feel the need to bother to think  
about it in great depth \(or pay for mitigative steps\). The shape of the industry in  
Poland, therefore, is different from the UK because there is less drive by the law  
to professionalism if individual organisers or the company they work for is not  
rushing to be compliant because they have less fear of litigation.  
# 4.2 Learning about Risk  
When it comes to risk, an emerging events industry can learn by observing  
what has happened elsewhere and then adopting corrective measures before  
having to go through the learning from their own painful experiences. Rec-  
ognising how a developed events industry has shaped itself towards an audit  
culture to prevent disasters from happening would speed the professionalisa-  
tion of the emergent industry, driven by the need to be compliant.  
The need for health, safety, and risk procedures has been accentuated by  
milestone event disasters that could have been prevented if correct health,  
safety, and risk procedures had been in place \(Bladen *et al*., 2018\). There  
is an evident milestone with the bombing of the Manchester Arena Ariana  
Grande concert on 22 May 2017 where 22 concertgoers were killed \(Gard-  
ham, 2020\). The first volume of the government Inquiry into the bombing,  
published in June 2021, set out to identify missed opportunities and failings  
of the accountable parties being the venue operators, the contracted security  
company, and the police \(Saunders, 2021\). The Inquiry chairman stresses that  
the purpose of the Report is not to apportion blame but to learn what went  
wrong and reduce the risk of such an event happening again and, if it does,  
mitigate the harm it causes. Bladen *et al*. \(2018\) say that such occurrences  
result in governments and industry associations regulating against future  
problems by increasing legislation, thus reshaping the industry.  
One example of a law update stems directly from the Manchester Arena  
bombing. Martyn’s Law \(Gov.uk, 2022\) mandates, for the first time, those  
held responsible for premises and events to consider the risk of a terrorist  
attack and how they would respond. This law states ‘simple steps save lives’  
to ensure venues are better prepared and ready to respond to a terrorist attack.  
Increased regulation, such as Martyn’s Law, and others, becomes a  
resource for event organisers to comply with in ensuring their events are safe. 78 *Risk Awareness at Events*  
This is the point where an emerging events industry can shape itself to fit with  
the behaviours of organisers in an advanced events industry to close gaps in  
risk acceptance and risk avoidance.  
This viewpoint is underpinned by a UK organiser who is a member of the  
International Compliance Association \(ICA\), which declares itself to ‘provide  
resources that demonstrate commitment to the highest standards of practice  
and conduct, enhance professional reputation and employability, and enhance  
the performance of the organisation’ \(*ICA*, no date\)\:  
*We offer emergency procedure briefings, also under the CDM\* regulations*  
*that came in 2015 we now need to do site inductions which is driven by*  
*the organiser and the responsibility of the organiser that we will make our*  
*staff go through it*.  
\(UK6 – landmark convention centre\)  
This organiser understands their professional responsibility in society as an  
organiser to lead their staff to deliver a safe event. However, in the Poland’s  
evolving events industry the emphasis for an organiser is on the delivery of an  
event rather than risk management for the delivery of a safe event.  
Professional bodies in the UK, such as the CDM, provide organisers with  
a socio-professional support network indicative of a functioning ‘art world’  
\(Becker, 1984\). This has driven the events industry forward, with people sup-  
porting other people to achieve the art product – in this context, the event. It  
is the art world which influences the way organisers learn to do their job and  
reflects the Douglas Grid Group Diagram \(Anfara and Mertz, 2011\), arguing  
that people need to fit with the behaviour of the group to which they belong.  
Participation with professional associations is a choice for organisers in  
the UK developed industry – there are many to choose from, which is coun-  
terproductive because it is confusing, and an organiser might find it simpler  
to engage with none. In the evolving market in Poland, there are conversely  
too few associations to choose. This is a gap between a developed events  
industry and one that is evolving, but not a significant gap because not all  
UK organisers participate with industry associations, and those whom do can  
choose which ones and how many. Because there is no legal requirement  
to belong to one or any professional association, the gap exists in the UK  
industry anyhow.  
In Poland it is the same gap, albeit more widespread. This gap is not due to  
the stage of development of the events industry in each country. This is what  
makes it an insignificant gap between the UK and Poland and will only get  
filled if both countries require organisers to join a professional association for  
accreditation.  
\*  
The Construction \(Design and Management\) Regulations 2015 \(*CDM*, 2015\). *Risk Awareness at Events* 79  
This said, there is a need for organisers in the UK to comply with con-  
stantly evolving legislation brought about by milestone disasters. This is  
more pronounced for high-level organisers at landmark venues, and less  
driven for organisers at smaller, independent venues. Nevertheless, there  
is an appetite among organisers in the UK for knowledge sharing of best  
practice\:  
*The typical ones for us would be people like the Association of Event*  
*Organisers and the Association of Event Venues* . . . *sharing best practice*  
*and I guess really helping to elevate the standard of our industry, if you*  
*like. Because if we can do it better*. . . . *There are two elements, for us*  
*we’d be in competition with other venues but actually the other side of it*  
*as a group of venues across the country it’s our job to collectively improve*  
*our standards and offer our customers the best* . . . *It’s about trying to*  
*elevate our own industry*. . . . *We need to be presenting the united face of*  
*the industry*.  
\(UK4 – landmark convention centre\)  
This view reflects the social awareness of organisers in their collective  
responsibility to advance the UK events industry. Knowledge is the objec-  
tive here, which Brown and Stokes \(2021\) argue is at the centre of events  
management. This provides a snapshot of the shape of the UK events indus-  
try and reveals a stark differential between the UK and Poland because  
organisers in the UK are keen to exploit their network for knowledge-shar-  
ing activities and associations. Poland organisers are autonomous and will  
view other organisers as competitors in the marketplace. It is a profes-  
sions difference because organisers in the UK have been driven to develop  
a sociocultural behaviour to be professionals and to professionalise their  
habitus\:  
*I have a \*NEBOSH qualification and \*\*PRINCE2 project management*  
*qualification*.  
\(UK6 – landmark convention centre\)  
This organiser is proud of their NEBOSH and PRINCE2 accreditations. For  
them, possessing risk management qualifications provides skills and compe-  
tences accredited by the industry, which reflects the shift in discourse from the  
‘sociology of professions’ to the ‘sociology of professional knowledge’, and  
\*  
\*\*  
NEBOSH \(National Examination Board in Occupational Safety and Health\) is a recognised pro-  
fessional examination in health and safety \(*NEBOSH*, no date\).  
PRINCE2 \(**PR**ojects **IN C**ontrolled **E**nvironments\) \(Pielichaty *et al*., 2017\) courses begin from  
£540 \(*PRINCE2*, 2020\). 80 *Risk Awareness at Events*  
then to the ‘sociology of expertise’ \(Macdonald, 1999; Eyal and Pok, no date;  
Young and Muller, 2014\).  
Knowledge gain is important not only for this organiser to do their job  
\(because they could do the job without qualifications, as others are\) but  
because they feel professional among their professional counterparts in a pro-  
fessional setting. This organiser can, for example, assert authority over others  
in the industry construct, including clients, because the organiser possesses  
knowledge and confidence in an area of event specialism which others might  
lack. This allows an organiser to elevate their status and is an example of ‘the  
real event manager’ \(see Berners, 2017, pp. 19–21\). It confirms, then, how an  
individual organiser or the company they work for is driven to professionali-  
sation by recognising their need to be compliant.  
Possessing industry qualifications and knowledge will make headway in  
the production of safer events wherever risk management is being practised.  
This is a good thing, of course, but it does drive the shaped events industry  
towards accusations of credentialism. Brown \(2001\) explains this can lead to  
declines in employers’ use of other recruitment criteria by insisting on candi-  
dates who have a certain set of professional qualifications or an events man-  
agement degree, say, thus homogenising the social landscape.  
At least in the shaping industry there are no such barriers of entry because  
qualifications are not required. For all the deficiencies that the lack of pro-  
fessional qualifications may entail, it is certainly not a credentialism social  
landscape which limits diversity in the sector, unlike which has taken shape  
in the UK events industry.  
Due to the different stage of development between the events industry  
in the UK and Poland, courses in events management are not yet available  
in Poland and so are not recognised. Therefore, qualifications in events  
specialisms are valued in the UK but have no value in the Poland events  
sector\:  
*Huh* \[laughs\]*, it’s quite a long story, I used to work in different kind of com-*  
*panies because I worked for 15 years in the mobile telecommunications*  
*sector. I did some marketing there. That’s why I’m here at* \[venue name\] *to*  
*somehow support marketing and to organise events. But most of my career*  
*was in a different place and different sector. I was fed up of* \[inaudible\]  
*world – rat race and that kind of stuff*. . . . *I do not have any theoretical*  
*background but rather I would say some practical one*.  
\(PL2 – landmark venue\)  
By laughing at the outset of the interview, this organiser may have found it  
incredulous to be interviewed as an event specialist because their profes-  
sional background is in other sectors. Nonetheless, this is an organiser at a *Risk Awareness at Events* 81  
landmark venue in a European capital city \(Warsaw\). This organiser is not  
an imposter and might be surprised to know that their situation is not dis-  
similar to London organisers who do not have a theoretical background in  
the management of events. This is the reason both the evolved and evolving  
industries place value in experience over qualifications and why the events  
industry in both the UK and Poland mirror the shape of holding experience  
above qualifications.  
This is at odds with the theoretical works of Ulrich Beck and Anthony  
Giddens that we are living in a developed risk society \(Ekberg, 2007\).  
Their theory is that there has been a reconfiguration in the traditional  
way risk is identified, evaluated, communicated, and governed. It is not  
only the sum of probability of an adverse happening and the severity of  
the consequences, but now it includes the perception of risk, the com-  
munication of risk, and the social experience of living in a risk environ-  
ment. This, they argue, is the way to effectively manage risks emerging  
in the age of modernity of the risk society. Beck \(no date, cited in Boyne,  
2003\) considers that there is a break within modernity in shifting from  
classical industrial society to a new self-endangering civilisation. Per-  
haps, then, event organisers are focusing reliance on their experience to  
redress their lack of professional qualifications in meeting the modern  
risk environment\:  
*We had to learn a lot by ourselves. Everything. We gained experience*  
*whilst organising things because we always had to deal with these prob-*  
*lems, and we always had to see to it that everything was tip-top. That there*  
*would be no problems, you know, during the event. We had firefighters, we*  
*had security, we had medical, we had special guards from the* \[name of  
venue\] *as well*.  
\(PL3 – organiser of charity events\)  
This interviewee – being an event organiser in the emerging Poland  
construct – has no access to formal education and so has to learn from their  
experiences, and is responsible for events attended by up to 5,000 people.  
Still, their reliance on trained *professionals* such as *firefighters, security,*  
*medical*, and *special guards* is no different to the level of specialist support  
required by qualified organisers. As previously identified, an organiser hav-  
ing to learn from their experiences means they will make mistakes before  
learning from the pain. In many cases their mistakes cannot be rectified  
because the event is happening and will soon be gone. In some cases, their  
mistakes might lead to harm, loss, or reputational damage. They could, as  
already mentioned, learn from other organisers’ previous mistakes to avoid  
them being replicated. 82 *Risk Awareness at Events*  
# 4.3 Acceptance of Risk  
The level of acceptance of risk is not impacted by specialist qualifications  
or education in events management because some organisers with specialist  
education do not enact risk management procedures such as setting objectives  
and conducting after-event evaluation. Specialist education does, however,  
inform organisers how to enact risk management procedures, which leads to  
knowledge of risk procedures, risk control, and risk management being fun-  
damental in managing events.  
An emerging events industry can learn about risks at events \(and shape  
their construct\) from tragedies that have happened in an already-shaped  
industry so as not to learn from the painful experiences of its own tragedies.  
For this to happen, it will require international policy transfer and imported  
knowledge from graduates of events management whom have been educated  
by studying past tragedies, risk milestones, and the legislations and practices  
which have shaped an events industry after it has experienced tragedy. The  
barrier here is the lack of risk reflection in event literature of risk milestones  
that have shaped a developed industry. Mostly, event literature focuses on  
potential risks, not past risks.  
Another problem here is the gap between rules and what people do in  
actual behaviours. Triandis \(no date, cited in Gillespie and Hennessey, 2016,  
p. 112\) views this as dependent upon the construct of either a ‘tight’ or ‘loose’  
culture, whereby a tight culture has many rules, norms, and standards for cor-  
rect behaviour as can be seen in the UK events industry. In the UK, rule break-  
ers risk receiving criticism or punishment or at least judgement and damage  
to reputation. This concept has relevance with events because of their tempo-  
rary nature making them less likely to be identified as noncompliant before  
they are gone, and the organiser less likely to be criticised or punished which  
drives towards a loose culture, observable in Poland.  
The basis of social order is conforming to social rules and norms, and  
deviance occurs when norms are broken \(O’Donnell, 1997\). Being less likely  
to get noticed, criticised, or punished encourages organisers in Poland to be  
less driven to professionalism and to perform deviant behaviour. This is also  
visible in the high level of risk acceptance of other emerging event constructs  
such as Russia hosting the Sochi Winter Olympics with ‘hundreds’ of workers  
losing their life \(Shaw, Anin and Vdovii, 2015\) and Qatar with the World Cup  
and 6,500 deaths \(*The Guardian*, no date\).  
Partial compliance behaviours of organisers can be observed at events in  
Poland, where rules and norms do get broken. ‘Partial compliance’ is where  
organisers have identified a hazard and go partway to mitigating the risk of  
it causing harm, but without fully negating that potential consequence from  
occurring. By conducting partial compliance, an organiser might not be  
accused of ignoring the hazard because they have identified it, first, and have *Risk Awareness at Events* 83  
gone some way in mitigating it, second – albeit not going so far as to fully  
mitigate the risk from potentially causing harm.  
That last bit of not fully mitigating the risk is deemed to be ‘worth the risk’  
because it is unlikely that it will be noticed before the event is gone. Anyway,  
for it to be noticed would require a safety official to visit the venue, which is  
less likely in an underdeveloped events industry.  
Another reason for ignoring risk, or at least taking only partial steps, is the  
notion of fate, chance, or having faith in God to protect people. In the Poland  
construct, this is a real concept due to the devout Catholic society. Organisers  
might, then, possess an embedded belief that they can trust in chance and fate  
because God will protect.  
Acceptance of risk at events by organisers in the developed industry is  
lower than in the developing industry because it is more likely to be noticed in  
the former, and if it is, it could halt the event or incur litigation. Silvers \(2008\)  
attributes this to the variance in different cultures and different locations, and  
Boyne \(2003\) concurs that standards of acceptability may vary across cultures.  
Operating within a loose culture, the following organiser recognises vari-  
ances in risk acceptance behaviours at other events and is able to determine  
what is good practice and what is not, from experience only\:  
S*ometimes I do come across things which for us would be unthinkable;*  
*poorly managed; poorly organised*.  
\(PL4 – organiser of charity events\)  
This organiser feels able to differentiate their own events from others and is  
benchmarking good practices against observing lesser practices. This has pos-  
itive implications that the role of tragedy facilitates organisers in an emerging  
industry to learn from the tragedies which have shaped an industry that is  
further developed.  
# 4.4 Attitude to Risk  
*It’s about health and safety. So, what to do if something goes wrong, if somebody is*  
*taken ill and how you can get help quickly. It’s about who we might be expecting,*  
*who we need to look out for, any VIP guests. It’s things like, you know, security.*  
*Security can be a big one for some events. About looking out for odd behaviour or*  
*areas that people should not be going into and how to raise help if we need it. Just*  
*making sure everything is as we would want it to be*.  
\(UK2 – organiser at an institution\)  
The use of future tense in the above statement suggests that this organiser con-  
siders risk during the planning stage of their events to identify and anticipate 84 *Risk Awareness at Events*  
what those risks might be. This is underpinned in the statement, *what to do*  
*if something goes wrong*, which indicates a forward-thinking stance and not  
waiting for something to go wrong before thinking what to do about it.  
The use of the phrase *who we might be expecting, who we need to look out*  
*for* further corroborates their forward approach to risk by knowing in advance  
who will be attending and looking out for them to arrive.  
Even though this organiser does not routinely set objectives \(to have a safe  
event is an objective\) or conduct after-event evaluation \(to measure that the  
event was in fact safe, and to identify what risks could be mitigated for future  
events\), they are attuned to the presence of risk, which makes their behaviour  
risk-averse.  
Haniff and Salama \(2016\) recount three levels of risk attitude\:  
1 Risk-averse – risk is avoided and opts towards less risky events.  
2 Risk-seeker – the higher the risk, the higher the returns.  
3 Risk-neutral – decisions are based on detailed analysis.  
Of the above, all events must start from the perspective of risk aversion  
where risk is avoided. But there are examples where organisers delegate their  
responsibility of risk management\:  
*We would have a supplier’s meeting pre-event three or four weeks before*  
*an event. I would present how we saw the whole event running. When we*  
*go onsite at venues they will do sort-of fire safety briefings*. . . . *They will*  
*only do a fire and safety briefing of the venue, of where to go*.  
\(UK8 – organiser for a pan-European publishing company\)  
The above statement reveals that the organiser has an expectation that suppli-  
ers will take responsibility for *sort-of fire safety briefings*. This is understand-  
able because delegation to other professionals is acceptable, had the terms  
*sort-of* and *only do a fire and safety briefing of the venue, of where to go* had  
not been used because these ambiguities indicate a level of complacency on  
top of delegating the utmost priority to a supplier.  
This type of risk-deferment behaviour reinforces that some organisers  
accept that there is the presence of risks at their events but are not prepared to  
accept responsibility for mitigating them.  
The question to this organiser, and others who delegate the responsibil-  
ity for risk, is what would happen if something went wrong at their event?  
It is likely that the blame would be directed towards the supplier who was  
charged with delivering the fire safety briefing. This would be evidence of a  
blame shift.  
Douglas \(2003\) discusses risk and blame, where she cites Hegel and  
Weber, identifying that knowledge and awareness increases technical control. *Risk Awareness at Events* 85  
If organisers delegate the responsibility of risk management to other parties,  
they will fail to evolve their own knowledge and awareness of risks that are  
present at their events and plan the measures to control them.  
Pearn, Mulrooney and Payne \(1998\) discuss turning blame cultures into  
gain cultures by learning from mistakes, which all organisers should be doing.  
But if an organiser is not involving themselves with the risk aspect of their  
events because they delegate that responsibility, they will not gain but they  
will blame. This amounts to lost opportunities for organisers to learn from  
experience, if experience is not gained.  
Learning from what happened is the objective of the Inquiry into the bomb-  
ing of the Manchester Arena – seeking to answer the question of accountabil-  
ity without apportioning blame but to identify who was accountable for the  
missed opportunities to prevent the bombing or mitigate the harm it caused.  
An incident of this magnitude will reshape even a developed events industry  
and will update legislations and practices. There are even wider implications  
of opportunity, other than legal, for organisers outside the UK to learn from  
such tragedy. But this will happen only if there is international and cross-  
cultural engagement in place to facilitate acculturated learning.  
It is important for organisers to work with risk so they learn to identify,  
assess, and mitigate risk from causing harm. Cottle \(no date\) writes that con-  
temporary risks are historically unprecedented, so their potential catastrophic  
effects are invisible. He states they can only become visible when defined  
within knowledge, the legal system, and mass media. He further asserts that  
this is a social-constructionist formulation where risks are dependent upon  
how they are made socially visible.  
Until a tragedy occurs, then, the issue with risk acceptance is normalisa-  
tion, which Vaughan \(1996\) concluded with her investigation into the NASA  
Challenger disaster. In determining how Challenger was launched against  
objections from engineers with a design known to be flawed, Vaughan  
revealed a culture of incremental descent into poor judgement and a pat-  
tern of normalisation in engineering risk assessments. There is danger of this  
attitude happening with events in a shaping industry if the societal accept-  
ance of risk becomes the embedded culture of that location. This is very  
likely because nobody in that social construct knows any better. If this hap-  
pens it will shape a localised tier of lower risk aversion compared to known  
and accepted levels of higher risk aversion across the global marketplace for  
international events.  
The question is, how will an organiser in Poland contrast the practices in  
their own industry, with which they are familiar, against those in an industry  
that has already shaped from its tragedies, and identify the disparities?  
The impact of this gap is that event tourist clients who book their events  
into a location with a shaping events industry, and event tourist consumers  
who travel to attend an event in a shaping events industry, will be unaware of 86 *Risk Awareness at Events*  
their exposure to a higher level of risk acceptance and lower level of mitiga-  
tion of risks. This disparity already exists\:  
*International clients almost always would sit with us and expect a debrief*  
*to see what can we learn, how the event went. What can we learn from it,*  
*what could we do better, what did work, what didn’t work. Sit and think*  
*about how did it go. Very important to see if the client is happy and if their*  
*goals were met*.  
\(PL7 – organiser of events\)  
This organiser identifies that a difference exists in the approach of inter-  
national clients expecting an after-event debrief, whereas their Poland cli-  
ents do not have that same expectation. It confirms approaches vary from  
location to location which is why the gap of risk acceptance needs to be  
at a consistent low level across the global marketplace for international  
events.  
Wynn-Moylan \(2018\) asserts that structured evaluation after an event  
should lead to improvements in planning the next event, changes needed  
to the venue, current or potential problems, ways of improving the system,  
and feedback from staff. The organiser above clearly recognises the value  
in learning from their international clients\: *What can we learn from it, what*  
*could we do better, what did work, what didn’t work*. Yet they still appear to  
accept that their Poland clients do things differently and there is no debrief  
with these clients to learn about how the event went, how the venue per-  
formed, and what could be done better such as risk identification and risk  
mitigation.  
Another organiser confirms the existence of this same gap\:  
*There is a difference between Polish – maybe ten years ago in Poland –*  
*and agencies from Europe, mostly Western Europe. Because the Western*  
*European agencies are very used to having feedback so they are send-*  
*ing letters with ‘maybe you can consider something’. Usually, they are*  
*pleased, I must say, with our work. But for the Polish companies they say*  
*‘thank you, okay, bye. Now it has slightly changed*.  
\(PL5 – landmark historic venue\)  
Again, this organiser is being offered opportunities to improve the service  
they provide to international clients because this category of client is giving  
feedback on where to improve. But their Poland clients do not give feedback.  
Again, there is recognition of the importance of feedback from international  
clients, yet it still has not prompted this organiser to acquire feedback from  
their Polish clientele.  
However, their use of the phrase, *now it has slightly changed*, suggests  
international knowledge transfer is happening and will help to reshape the *Risk Awareness at Events* 87  
Poland events industry towards international practices and narrow this gap,  
which is reinforced here\:  
*I pick up so many things, even in Vienna, you wouldn’t believe it. At the*  
*Polytechnic* \[venue in Warsaw\] *for example I made a point that guests do*  
*not see caterers with their stuff. I said, ‘you cannot have this, so think of*  
*something’. The tables on one side of the hall and they had blinds brought*  
*down and it was cut off for the public so they couldn’t go there and see*  
*everything. I told myself that also the sound engineer must cover his stand*  
*with special material so you don’t see it – he’s not there, if you know what*  
*I mean; everybody has to have black suits which was good, and also the*  
*technicians. Lots of stuff, lots of stuff, lots of stuff*.  
\(PL4 – organiser of charity events\)  
This organiser demonstrates their willingness to learn from sources not avail-  
able in the Poland events industry construct and appears excited and pleased  
for picking up on these elements and importing the learning to their own  
events. Although this organiser is referring to aesthetics, it is reasonable to  
expect that their acculturated learning will extend to other areas of managing  
their events, such as risk management, learning from tragedies elsewhere, and  
adopting a lower threshold of risk acceptance.  
The problem is that organisers in a developing industry receive less experi-  
ence, unless they are involved with events in a foreign location with perhaps a  
further evolved socio-professional construct. If they are involved with events  
for foreign clients and international attendees, they can gain experiences and  
learning, plus learn from the experiences of tragedies, which have already  
happened elsewhere, without having to learn from the painful experiences of  
their own failures – so long as they recognise these learning opportunities and  
are willing to adopt the learning into their practices.  
# 4.5 Learning From Experience  
People learn from the mistakes they make while doing the job. This is what  
builds career experience and is why industry experience is highly valued by  
employers on a candidate’s curriculum vitae. In many cases it is why some  
firms and individuals are trusted implicitly and their word and abilities are  
considered more significant than any qualification – even in the recruitment  
process where qualifications should matter.  
However, where organisers rely on their career experience to learn from,  
rather than a formal education, it takes much time and can be too late for miti-  
gating risks at events. Events are consumed at the point of delivery, plus they  
cannot rehappen, so if a risk is left to cause a consequence it cannot be recov-  
ered. This is more prevalent in the developing construct because organisers  
will not yet have access to formal education in the specialisms of managing 88 *Risk Awareness at Events*  
events. Therein lies the cause of a gap, even though the UK events industry  
eschewed formal education or qualifications until recently.  
In addition, it would be helpful \(and safer\) to learn from the mistakes  
which other organisers have already made than to learn from one’s own mis-  
takes as they happen and those which are yet to happen. This is imperative not  
only for achieving client and consumer satisfaction, quality, and meeting the  
event objectives, but it also becomes real and essential with mistakes that can  
be determined as ‘tragedy’. Examples are the Manchester Arena bombing in  
the UK construct and the murder of the Mayor of Gdansk onstage at a festival  
in the Poland construct \(Buras, 2019\).  
Events literature does widely provide insight with risks at events – some  
event textbooks are devoted to the subject – but it tends to be practical opera-  
tional guidance rather than cross-cultural studies or milestones of tragedies,  
legislations, and practices from which an organiser – or student – might learn.  
For example, Wynn-Moylan \(2018\) proposes an Event Safety Management  
System, which is a set of planning activities leading to a formalised set of pro-  
cedures for the management of safety at events and venues. He asserts that an  
event safety policy defines the commitment to society that the event organiser  
makes in hosting a safe event. So, the delivery of a safe event is not an option  
but a societal expectation. Yet learning from the history of tragedies at events  
is widely ignored and the milestones which have shaped a developed industry  
are largely uncharted.  
There are other procedural approaches to risk including the EMP, which is  
a document that gets disseminated to a Safety Advisory Group \(SAG\)\:  
*For any event, you prepare an EMP, which is an Event Management Plan.*  
*That EMP is usually produced twelve weeks before an event at a minimum.*  
*That will be presented at something called a SAG Group, Safety Advisory*  
*Group, and then you have feedback from the statutory authorities around*  
*that table*.  
\(UK5 – organiser of local authority events\)  
This organiser stating *for any event* indicates the EMP is a procedure for all  
their events to facilitate feedback from the SAG made up of statutory authori-  
ties. This means that an organiser does not have to be a risk or safety specialist  
but can gather a group of advisers with authoritative knowledge, experience,  
training, and qualifications to support the event, provide advice, and ensure  
that it is going to be safe. This is important for organisers operating in a devel-  
oping events industry to know because it facilitates them gaining specialist  
knowledge from expert sources, rather than their own formal education or  
years of experience.  
A detailed account of the function of the SAG at the 2012 London Olym-  
pics is presented by Armstrong, Giulianotti and Hobbs \(2017, pp. 133–141\),  
which they refer to as the Olympics Command Zone. The assembled SAG  
is flexible and adaptable by necessity for each situation at each event. *Risk Awareness at Events* 89  
Paraskevas \(2006\) sees this as a living co-evolving system for effective  
response to crises.  
Working with an SAG is a learning opportunity for an organiser. However,  
not all events warrant an SAG because the event might be low risk, basic, and  
routine. In the UK, just as anywhere else, there is no guarantee that an organiser  
will learn from working with SAG specialists. This leads to the way most organ-  
isers learn about risk\: from their own experience, which obscures the potential  
\(and need\) for learning from other organiser’s tragedies that have already hap-  
pened elsewhere, and the role of tragedy in shaping an events industry. This  
obscureness also masks an organiser’s recognition for the importance of creating  
for themselves an international cross-cultural learning environment. What needs  
to be intrinsic to all organisers, then, is the recognition to formalise their learning.  
# 4.6 The Self-Learning Environment  
*A lot of our events are repeat annual events so just because it’s finished*  
*doesn’t mean it’s not immediately starting again for preparation for the*  
*next year. What we are very, very keen on at the moment is understanding*  
*where we can improve after an event, as soon as possible. We task our*  
*event managers now with starting the debriefing process six weeks before*  
*the event even comes to site*. . . . *I presented at the AEO* \[Association of  
Event Organisers\] *three weeks ago at their ops forums and I talked about*  
*debriefing an awful lot and saying how it needs to loop continuously so it’s*  
*almost not a debrief but an ongoing process, a continuous event life cy-*  
*cle – just because it finishes on* \[date\] *doesn’t mean the event has finished,*  
*it’s actually going to start again for next year so your planning starts the*  
*moment it finishes. And we look at the way this continuous event life cycle*  
*loops and how it feeds, and how we can continuously improve*.  
\(UK6 – landmark convention centre\)  
This organiser understands the cyclical need of learning from one event to the  
next as a formalised and structured process. This is not carried out alone, but  
in cooperation with *venue and organiser and contractor* – what this organiser  
calls the *three pillars to making a successful event*. The difference here, from  
learning from an SAG, is that this organiser is steering their own learning by  
knowing to engage with people in their habitus. Working with an SAG pro-  
vides the opportunity for passive learning, but in the frequent and most-often  
absence of an SAG, an organiser can conduct active self-learning.  
In the above excerpt, the organiser says, *I presented at the AEO*, so they  
have in fact elevated their status from learner to teacher. And the way this  
organiser describes the continuous event life cycle as a *loop* and an *ongoing*  
*process* reflects their recognition of the need to implement continuous evalu-  
ation for their venue to become a learning organisation, achieve their goals,  
and meet standards \(Getz, 2018\). 90 *Risk Awareness at Events*  
Allen, Alston and DeKerchove \(2019\) agree that employees must perform  
safely and in compliance with requirements, as well as continuously seek  
ways to improve operations and processes. Individual organisers, therefore,  
need to shape their socio-professional construct to facilitate a self-learning  
environment – the industry will not lead it. This is especially important for  
organisers to understand in locations where there is limited or no access to for-  
mal education, and organisers are less likely to learn from experience because  
they do not conduct structured evaluation and feedback procedures\:  
*If everything is okay, we have another event next day or we have some days*  
*with four events so there is no time for it* \[evaluation\]*. So, if everything is*  
*okay, we just need to do our paperwork after this and rub our hands and*  
*forget it*.  
\(PL5 – landmark historic venue\)  
The previous organiser was aware of creating opportunities for self-learning,  
whereas the above organiser says they *rub our hands and forget it*. Getz  
\(2018\) highlights the need to measure returns\: Return on Investment \(ROI\),  
Return on Objectives \(ROO\), and Return on Experience \(ROE\), but some  
organisers omit these measures by saying *there is no time for it*. Where  
organisers fail to enact procedures from which they could learn, they are  
inclined to blame lack of time \(see also Section 2.1.5 ‘Event Objectives’\).  
This is true of organisers in both the UK and Poland, as if they know they  
are wrong to be omitting some procedures and are reluctant to admit that it  
is their fault\:  
*There is never time to debrief customers. Customer is always running*  
*away and* \[laughs\] *chasing other subjects and we actually marching*  
*into the next project, so it is very difficult. But we always try to debrief*  
*on email or conversation on the phone maybe to catch up later on. But*  
*I know international clients almost always would sit with us and expect*  
*a debrief*.  
\(PL7 – organiser of events\)  
This is another example of an organiser blaming time for failing to conduct  
after-event feedback and evaluation procedures for their self-learning from  
one event to the next. The post-event procedures are even more important  
where there is no access to formal education in events management. But they  
are not getting omitted because of an unwillingness to learn \(every organiser  
wants to do a good job and run a safe event\), it is the lack of recognition of the  
need to create a self-learning environment.  
Organisers in the developed industry do have opportunities to learn from  
formal education and professional associations, so this is a knowledge gap *Risk Awareness at Events* 91  
between the developed and developing industries. All organisers everywhere  
can conduct active self-learning, though – it just takes them to recognise that  
need. An events industry needs to form this behavioural understanding as  
the shape of their socio-professional construct, especially where the industry  
is eschewing any formal education or qualifications in events management.  
Where this eschewing is happening, there is tension between experience and  
academic qualifications because experience is valued over academic quali-  
fications in the belief that if qualifications are not available, they cannot be  
needed.  
# 4.7 Consumer Risk Perspective  
Risk and uncertainty in events are not limited to how an event is planned and  
executed but extend to the organiser’s responsibility for protecting consumers  
attending an event.  
Also, the risky behaviour of consumers is a factor at events and often exac-  
erbated by large crowds and the presence of alcohol and drugs. Such factors  
are common to events all over the world, so the potential to share knowledge  
across an international platform from a shaped industry to one which is shap-  
ing, and facilitate learning from previous tragedies, is very relevant.  
Also, the trend for providing experiential events for fun, adventure, and  
thrill means consumers are closer to the risk of injury and harm while being  
carefree with their personal safety which they place into the hands of an event  
organiser. Bladen *et al*. \(2018\) state that event design is among the greatest  
challenges facing the events specialist due to clients demanding ever more  
creative events for their attendees to experience. Clearly, in the face of these  
trends, it must be beneficial, and safer, for an international approach to learn-  
ing from tragedy and to shape emerging and developing events industries  
from those which are already developed.  
Consumers have a societal subliminal expectation to be safe at an event  
and there is a distinction provided by Douglas and Wildavsky \(1982\) between  
voluntary and involuntary acceptance of risk by consumers. They write that  
if people wish to expose themselves to risk, that is their own business and  
voluntary, but if they are unaware of the risks or associated risks it is invol-  
untary. Their answer to this is ‘better information’ so that people either reject  
a known risk or seek additional compensation for assuming it. This means  
involuntary risk is due to ignorance but can be converted to voluntary risk  
by knowledge. Organisers should understand this when producing events and  
marketing them to consumers.  
The consumer risk perspective needs to be considered by organisers by  
asking themselves whether the risks are being communicated to the consumer,  
so that the consumer can voluntarily expose themselves to those risks. This is  
especially important with gaps dependent upon location and attendees being 92 *Risk Awareness at Events*  
unaware of this fact \(involuntary acceptance\). However, this is not what is  
happening because instead of considering the consumer risk perspective,  
organisers tend to focus on the commercial objectives\:  
*With an event, obviously there’s usually key drivers. So, it’s either a finan-*  
*cial, or a community, or best-practice initiatives, really. If there’s a finan-*  
*cial driver to an event we’d want to know all the information upfront in*  
*terms of what the costs were, what the percentage income, what the break-*  
*even was, obviously what the community benefit was – engaging with the*  
*residents and engaging with the local community. The economic benefit*  
*as well, in terms of gauging how many visitors we maybe could get to an*  
*event, what the secondary spend opportunities were around that* . . . *but*  
*I think you need to be very clear on what your aims and objectives are*  
*so you can actually achieve them, otherwise you could end up delivering*  
*something which isn’t quite as good as you wanted it to be and it doesn’t*  
*achieve the objective what you set out with*.  
\(UK5 – organiser of local authority events\)  
This organiser is concerned with financial targets and commercial objectives  
because they organise events on behalf of a local authority and is naturally  
driven by budgets, spend, and Return on Investment \(ROI\). But local author-  
ity community events are organised for people – as all events are – yet this  
organiser is leaning closer towards financials than consumers. Additionally,  
this organiser of community events is exposed to societal risk foremost and  
individual risk secondly, so the effect of something going wrong is greater  
\(see also Section 4.1 ‘Management of Risk’\).  
Bowdin *et al*. \(2011\) remind organisers that they have a legal responsibil-  
ity to provide a safe event, and Wynn-Moylan \(2018\) points out that Duty of  
Care is a legal principle which places the event organiser as the responsible  
person to avoid acts of omissions that could injure another. As the legal impli-  
cations become more impactful when an events industry matures \(because  
legislation matures with the industry\), organisers indeed welcome and are  
willing to accept and engage with an international approach to the role of  
tragedy in shaping their industry.  
As it stands, however, none of the senior-level organisers at landmark ven-  
ues who were interviewed included ‘keeping people safe’ as an objective of  
their events – even though risk can be defined as the likelihood of an event not  
fulfilling its objectives \(Allen, 2009\).  
Commercial objectives are certainly easier to define than consumer safety  
because statistics \(costs, revenue, profit\) can be measured quantitatively. It  
takes greater effort to obtain, evaluate, and measure qualitative objectives.  
The stubborn issue is that organisers put on an event for financial reward first,  
not for the safety priority – which is why they will focus on their financial  
objectives at the cost of the risk objective\: *Risk Awareness at Events* 93  
*Our objective is to get the people in and out the building, get them to*  
*empty their pockets – being very commercially driven* \[laughs\] – *and*  
*leave with a smile on their face. I use my cynical commercial outlook but*  
*we’re there to service people and keep people coming back, that’s the*  
*nature of what we’re trying to do. We get around 1.5 million visitors a*  
*year*. . . . *We’ve tried things like customer thermometers which actually*  
*work – smiley faces. There are some good tools out there and I would*  
*encourage more venues to engage with those tools and really benefit*  
*from them*.  
\(UK10 – landmark exhibition centre\)  
This organiser is at a significant landmark London venue which has a good  
reputation to protect, and they are not dismissing the value of their consumers –  
this is clear in the above excerpt referring to *customer thermometers* . . . *smi-*  
*ley faces*. But even when talking about consumers, the perspective of this  
organiser is to view people as a commodity to reach the financial objective  
by getting *them to empty their pockets*. Thus, this organiser is interested in  
the consumer perspective only because of the need to *service people and keep*  
*people coming back* for them to continue spending money and keep the venue  
commercially viable.  
This is not out of step with every organiser who was interviewed. So,  
although this may be a troubling and valuable finding, it is not a gap between  
the UK and Poland because organisers in both constructs failed to mention  
consumer risks and safety. This does indicate a shortfall in the consumer risk  
perspective overall, rather than any difference caused by the stage of develop-  
ment of an events industry.  
There is also stubborn focus on financial objectives in existing theoretical  
event literature, including omitting safety as an event objective. Examples  
include Shone and Parry \(2013, pp. 139–140; p. 333\) discussing objectives  
and financial planning within several sections of their textbook under the  
headings of ‘cultural events; financial; leisure events; new events; organisa-  
tional event; personal event; planning; setting’, but objectives is not included  
in the ‘safety’ section. Their book does discuss risk, but risk and objectives  
are without linkage. Silvers \(2008\) only arrives at the consumer risk perspec-  
tive in the very last chapter of her *Risk Management for Meetings and Events*  
textbook, although Wynn-Moylan \(2018\) does devote three chapters to the  
consumer risk perspective in his *Risk and Hazard Management for Festivals*  
*and Events* textbook.  
Overall, there remains a gap in the literature in addressing consumer risk and  
safety to impart the awareness to organisers – particularly students of events  
management – that consumer safety is the priority objective ahead of other  
objectives such as financial goals and targets. It should be remembered that if an  
event turns out not to be safe, it can compromise the financial objectives anyhow  
- customers can complain or demad refunds which impacts profit and return 94 *Risk Awareness at Events*  
business. To shift the discourse of this perspective would have a behavioural  
impact in the UK events profession because students on formal courses will  
import their learning to the industry. It would not yet impact the Poland events  
industry where there are no courses in events management. Although, if an inter-  
national construct were to happen, Poland would learn from the UK and others.  
Organisers in both the developed and developing events industries are  
aware of risk, but there is higher likelihood of repercussions and litigation in  
the UK if noncompliance is identified or something goes wrong at an event.  
This has driven UK organisers to recognise their need to be compliant with  
regulations and legislations. In turn, this has shaped the UK events industry  
to a risk-averse socio-professional construct. In Poland it is ‘worth the risk’  
to accept risk because it will likely not be discovered. This difference reveals  
that compliance with the law is the driver for individuals or the company they  
work for to be professional, rather than consumers or the insurance industry  
responding to previous tragedies at events.  
Organisers everywhere would benefit by learning from academic quali-  
fications, but the industry places trust in firms and individuals’ word and  
abilities from their experience, which is demonstrable by reputation, client  
portfolio, testimonials, and track record of delivering successful events. The  
events industry does not lead organisers to achieve academic qualifications  
and to a large degree eschews any formal education or qualifications in events  
management. The socio-professional structure takes form around organisers  
organically evolving their learning unaided and relies on individuals or the  
company they work for to identify learning needs by themselves, which tend  
to be driven by the need to be compliant.  
Thus, an industry taking shape recognises experience as more valuable than  
qualifications in the belief that if qualifications are not available, they cannot  
be needed to run an event. But, as an industry matures and academic qualifica-  
tions become available, entrants to the industry seek to study to make them-  
selves more employable, and employers respond by advertising job vacancies  
requiring candidates to be qualified. It should be noted that this is still organic  
development by organisers and is not being led by the industry, so there are  
naturally-occurring tensions between academic qualifications and experience.  
Such tensions are due to experienced organisers abstaining from gaining  
qualifications which have now become available, an understanding in the  
industry of the ‘right’ level of experience versus the ‘right’ level of qualifica-  
tions, and the social barriers of organisers thinking they know how to do the  
job, so they devalue qualifications and qualified organisers, and their rejection  
of academically qualified entrants who lack experience.  
This is where an international cross-cultural construct for knowledge shar-  
ing and learning will facilitate an emerging industry to be safer in its practices  
of managing events by learning from tragedies that have already happened  
elsewhere. Also, if organisers do not routinely set objectives, omit the risk  
management procedures, delegate the risk responsibilities, and fail to conduct *Risk Awareness at Events* 95  
after-event evaluation, they will not identify or learn from their own experi-  
ences of mistakes.  
Therefore, the most significant factor for an emerging events industry in  
addressing risk is for the socio-professional construct to shape an active self-  
learning environment where organisers professionalise by identifying learn-  
ing opportunities from other organisers, specialists, and outside sources such  
as their foreign clients and international attendees.  
# 4.8 Summary and Conclusions – Risk Awareness  
# at Events  
This book is interested in the approach to risk by event organisers in a devel-  
oped industry and those who perform in an emerging construct – their lev-  
els of risk acceptance, and how organisers in the developed and developing  
industries learn from the experiences of tragedy and new and changing legis-  
lations so that they are compliant.  
Events are one-off live happenings which involve the management of  
short-term risks from event to event. This means organisers of events are  
less inclined to adopt strategic risk management behaviours and practices,  
whereas most risk cultures view risk for the longevity and long-term sustain-  
ability of an organisation or society.  
Events are a service rather than a product because services must be expe-  
rienced to be consumed. It means delivery and consumption are inseparable  
and makes it difficult to recover anything which goes wrong. Also, there is  
growing consumer demand for events to fulfil the need for transcendence and  
escapism for intense emotionalism and unrestrained exhibitionism \(Rojek,  
2013\). Pressure to meet these demands means more can go wrong.  
Silvers \(2008\) acknowledges that ethical practices are based on precedent,  
custom, tradition, standards, and fairness. But what is standard and customary  
will vary in different locations with different cultures. Organisers in both the UK  
and Poland do not routinely set objectives for their events and none of the inter-  
viewed organisers in either the UK or Poland mentioned safety as an objective.  
Mostly, the focus of organisers for a successful event is on financial return rather  
than a risk-free and safe event. This is because events are organised for financial  
gain, first, and not for the safety priority, even though every event is for people.  
This finding may be important and valuable in a wider context, but it is not a  
gap between the developed industry and the emerging one\: it occurs with both.  
Neither is formal education a factor in risk awareness because all inter-  
viewees, except one, mentioned risk or safety during the interviews whether  
they were formally educated or not. The one organiser who failed to mention  
risk or safety does have formal education.  
Where there *is* a gap between the developed and emerging industries is  
in the level of acceptance of the presence of risk at events. Organisers in the  
UK are more likely to understand risk and the risk management processes to 96 *Risk Awareness at Events*  
mitigate risk from causing harm because they are more attuned to living in a  
risk society with an audit culture approach. It is the law, then, which drives  
organisers or the company they work for to identify the safety priority.  
Currently, there is no cohesive recognition by the industry, or consum-  
ers, or the insurance industry to lead organisers towards a culture of learning.  
This means there is a fragmented approach in the behaviours and practices of  
organisers, such as setting KPIs and identifying the need for the production  
and reproduction of knowledge.  
UK organisers benefit from operating in a developed community of prac-  
tice \(Brown and Stokes, 2021\), which has shaped to support organisers with  
compliance; otherwise, they face the real risk of repercussions and litigation.  
Whereas, in Poland, organisers are largely autonomous and immune to formal  
management regimes \(Thiel, 2012\) because the threat of repercussions due to  
noncompliance is distant. It is less likely in Poland that an authoritative body  
will visit a live event, and the event will be gone the next day, anyway. This  
is shaping a culture that encourages organisers to be complacent or perform  
deviant behaviour where risk is either ignored or partially addressed but is not  
fully mitigated from the potential to cause harm or injury. Thus, the accept-  
ance of risk at events is lower in the developed industry, whereas there is a  
higher level of accepting risk by organisers in the developing industry.  
The notion of fate and leaving risk to chance, or God, in the devout Catho-  
lic society of Poland is a factor because the issue with risk acceptance is its  
normalisation. Vaughan \(1996\) revealed a culture of incremental descent into  
poor judgement and a pattern of normalisation in engineering risk assess-  
ments by NASA before the launch of Challenger, which resulted in disaster.  
There is danger of the same occurring in Poland if societal acceptance of risk  
becomes embedded in event culture due to, among other things, fate, chance,  
and relying on God for protection. If this should happen, it will create a local-  
ised tier of higher risk acceptance compared to known and accepted levels of  
lower risk acceptance in the global marketplace for international events. This  
is troubling because events are becoming riskier with clients demanding ever  
more creativity, consumers expecting greater and greater experiences, and the  
societal shift towards adrenalin events, challenge events, and deviant events.  
This is at odds with how the interviewed organisers consider their top three  
roles as an organiser of events\: most responded with subjective aesthetical  
or emotional considerations such as good feelings and people being happy.  
Others considered the measurable commercial targets. Just three out of the 24  
interviewees mentioned safety within their top three roles – all three of whom  
are organisers in the developed industry.  
Some organisers are deflecting their social responsibility of delivering a  
risk-free event to other collaborators in their art world such as the venue, the  
client, or a supplier. By absolving themselves of this responsibility, organisers  
will not learn from their mistakes, which Pearn, Mulrooney and Payne \(1998\)  
say is important in turning blame culture into gain culture. The impact of this *Risk Awareness at Events* 97  
is that foreign clients and international consumers will not be aware of their  
exposure to a higher level of risk acceptance and lower level of risk mitigation  
from one location to another\: that they are closer to harm without knowing it  
\(involuntary acceptance of risk\). Organisers should be communicating risks to  
consumers to convert involuntary risk acceptance to voluntary risk acceptance  
\(Douglas and Wildavsky, 1982\).  
There are other risks which may cause harm to the success of an event such  
as unfulfilled revenues, financial loss, poor service, dissatisfied consumers,  
poor levels of attendance, psychological loss, and reputational harm.  
To close this gap, it will require closer international collaboration across  
the global marketplace for international events so that organisers in emerg-  
ing events industries can learn from the mistakes already experienced by a  
developed industry and begin to mirror the shape of their approach to risk,  
acceptance of risk, and mitigation of risk.  
Mostly, events are the same wherever they take place in the world, and the  
risks are the same, which means they are preventable if organisers adopt a self-  
learning environment to learn from mistakes which have already happened at  
events elsewhere. Thus, an international socio-professional construct would  
allow for the role of tragedy to shape an emerging events industry by learn-  
ing from the disaster experiences of an industry which is further developed  
and has shaped itself around tragic experiences that have already happened.  
This would prevent organisers in an emerging industry such as Poland from  
experiencing painful tragedies by themselves, and would, of course, make  
events safer around the globe for event tourists, foreign clients, international  
consumers, and workers and would align organisers in a united approach to  
risk and safety and reduce that gap.  
If there were international collaboration and cross-cultural policy transfer  
learning, to raise the need for the production and reproduction of knowledge,  
an emerging events industry could shape itself around the premise of develop-  
ing a culture of self-learning. Here, they would learn from other organisers by  
adopting legislations and practices that have come about because of tragedies  
already experienced and have shaped a developed industry. Such examples  
include the Bradford fire in 1985; the Hillsborough stadium crush in 1989;  
and the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017. Each of these tragedies at events  
resulted in inquiries that led to safer practices driven by legislations from the  
lessons learnt. **5 Author’s Notes on Conclusions**  
# SPECIAL NOTE\:  
‘Event tourism’ in event literature is the accepted term for consumers who  
travel to attend events. It is a generic term which blurs with *organisers*  
who travel to place their events in a foreign location, destination, or venue.  
To categorise organisers as ‘client tourists’ and an individual stakeholder  
group would be clearer and will identify their specific needs and expecta-  
tions in terms of service, quality, safety, and for targeted marketing and  
promotion initiatives. If this distinction were to be adopted in event lit-  
erature, it would help in events education for learning about the needs and  
expectations of client tourists and how to target and penetrate that specific  
market.  
\*  
Having lived and worked as an organiser of events in both London and War-  
saw for ten years, respectively, I had identified cultural and social differences,  
or ‘gaps’, in the approach to organising events, which have impacts for event  
tourists and client tourists in areas of service delivery, quality, and safety.  
My privileged status \(white, male, with Bachelor of Arts degree, royal and  
celebrity client portfolio\) provided me with access to the socio-professional  
construct in both London and Warsaw without delay, question, or difficulty.  
I acknowledge that my status and career profile is unique in the events indus-  
try and the outcomes presented in this book will be different from a researcher  
with other ethnicity, gender, or career pathway.  
I found, unsurprisingly, omissions in event practices and procedures in  
both the developed and developing constructs. These are\: the failure to rou-  
tinely set event objectives for every event to measure the success of the event  
against reaching those objectives; failure to conduct after-event feedback and  
evaluation procedures to understand if the objectives were met and obtain  
learning from feedback; and failure to always conduct risk management  
DOI\: 10.4324/9781032684161-5 *Author’s Notes on Conclusions* 99  
procedures to identify, assess, and mitigate risks. These failures are replicated  
in both the UK and Poland events industries and so are not a gap between a  
developed and an emerging events industry. It is an important finding, none-  
theless, because it reveals that the cause of these omissions is that the shape of  
an industry does not facilitate, encourage, or demand a culture of self-learning  
where organisers learn from others.  
The events industry can learn from this book to prevent the international  
events industry from continuing to provide disparate practices and variants  
depending on where an event is happening and how the events industry in any  
location has shaped or is shaping due to its stage of development. To this end,  
there is need for an international umbrella association or construct to facilitate  
a recognised professional accreditation to align events industries worldwide  
to a cohesive global narrative.  
This would enable organisers working within less mature events  
industries to rapidly catch up with a further developed events industry;  
to understand how to reach and attract foreign clients and international  
consumers; to narrow the gap between consumer expectations and the  
actual experience they receive; to learn from mistakes and crises that have  
already happened elsewhere so that they do not get replicated in differ-  
ent locations; to adopt legislations to ensure that organisers are compliant  
with risk management and safety protocols; and to enact best practices and  
procedures such as setting event objectives and carrying out after-event  
evaluation.  
The intention would be to standardise international events so that foreign  
clients and international consumers receive a more consistent level of event  
management and safety wherever they are in the world.  
Currently, the events industry is counterfactual from this book’s contribu-  
tion to research and industry. The events industry in the UK is disparate to  
that in Poland. It must follow, therefore, that all events industries in all loca-  
tions have ‘gaps’ because each is at a different stage of development and each  
has sociocultural idiosyncrasies which shape their industry in a unique \(thus  
disparate\) way.  
Academic courses in events management must begin to recognise and  
adopt cross-cultural content, with the purpose to educate students in under-  
standing the factors which shape an industry and how they can \(and must\)  
implement their own self-learning environment. This is an imperative piece  
of events management education.  
Researchers and academic authors in the discipline of events can respond  
by beginning to diversify their own research methodologies from the current  
domination of single case studies and instrumentalist approaches, and move  
towards cross-cultural research. In my novel methodological approach, I have  
shown that there is much to be contributed from qualitative autoethnography  
and great potential for leading academic authors to place themselves into their 100 *Author’s Notes on Conclusions*  
research by drawing on their own unique experiences and interpretations, as  
I have done. This would expand literature beyond its current limitations and  
provide a whole new range of theoretical studies from other researchers’ per-  
spectives alongside mine.
