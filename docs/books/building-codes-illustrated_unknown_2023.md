Family of Solutions\: Preface  
This book is intended to give aspiring building designers a basic understanding of the use and  
application of the International Building Code® \(IBC\). It is intended to be an instructional text on  
how that code was developed and how it is organized, as well as a primer on how to use any  
building code. It uses the IBC as an example of how to apply building codes to project design and  
construction. Code knowledge is among the fundamental reasons for licensing design profession-  
als, for the protection of public health, safety, and welfare. It is our goal to make the acquisition  
and use of code knowledge easier and clearer for code users.  
Many designers feel intimidated by building codes. They can seem daunting and complex at  
first glance. It is important to know that they are a product of years of accretion and evolution.  
Sections start simply and are modified, and new material is added to address additional concerns  
or to address interpretation issues from previous code editions. The complexity of a building code  
often comes from this layering of new information upon old without regard to overall continuity. It  
is important to keep in mind that there is no single author of the building code. Each section has a  
different author. Building codes are living documents, constantly under review and modification.  
It is vital to an understanding of codes to keep in mind that they are a human institution, written  
by ordinary people with specific issues in mind or specific agendas they wish to advance. It is also  
critical in code application to be sure you are using the most current code adopted in the jurisdic-  
tion where you are working.  
BUILDING CODE  
Webster’s Third New International  
Dictionary defines a building  
code as\: “A set of rules of proce-  
dure and standards of materials  
designed to secure uniformity and  
protect the public interest in such  
matters as building construction  
and public health, established  
usually by a public agency and  
commonly having the force of law  
in a particular jurisdiction.”  
vii PREFACE  
How This Book Is Organized  
The first two chapters of this book give background and context regarding  
the development, organization, and use of the IBC. Chapters 3 through 18 are  
organized and numbered the same as the corresponding subject-matter chapters  
in the IBC. Chapters 19–22 summarize the requirements in the remaining IBC  
chapters. Chapter 13 refers briefly to the energy provisions of the International  
Code family, which are contained in a separate code, the International Energy  
Conservation Code \(IECC\), and which are beyond the scope of this book. Chapter  
23 touches on the code provisions for existing buildings, which are no longer  
included in the IBC, but occur in the International Existing Building Code \(IEBC\).  
While not addressed exhaustively in this book, new design work often takes  
place in existing buildings and we want to make code users aware of how the  
IBC and IEBC are to be applied in such cases.

rather than represent specific design solutions.  
viii PREFACE  
For the Student  
The book is part of the introduction to building codes that are an integral part of professional  
studies in architecture, structural engineering, and civil engineering. It will serve as explana-  
tory text to accompany analysis of the organization, intent, and use of codes in general and the  
International Building Code in particular. The introductory chapters will instill in design students  
the reasons codes exist and how they form an integral part of the design process for every building  
project. Most design problems in school are at the schematic design level, so that detailed code  
analysis will not typically be undertaken in most classes. In graduate classes the book can serve  
to organize and facilitate a deeper understanding of detailed requirements common to all building  
codes. The book also gives guidance on best practices for code analysis to lay a foundation for  
future practitioners to better meet the health, safety, and welfare criteria that are the basis for  
professional licensure.  
For Emerging Professionals  
Whether you are engaged in design, production, management, or construction administration,  
codes and standards are an integral and inescapable part of the practice of architecture and engi-  
neering. New practitioners need to refine their skills and knowledge of codes to make their projects  
safe and buildable with few costly changes. The more practitioners know about the code, the more  
it can become a tool for design rather than an impediment. The better the underlying criteria for  
code development and the reasons for code provisions are understood, the easier it is to cre-  
ate code-compliant designs. Early understanding and incorporation of code-compliant design  
provisions in a project reduces the necessity for costly and time-consuming rework or awkward  
rationalizations to justify dubious code decisions late in project documentation, or even during  
construction. Code use and understanding should be part of accepted knowledge for professionals,  
so that it becomes a part of the vocabulary of design.  
ix PREFACE  
How to Use This Book  
This book focuses on the use and interpretation of the basic concepts behind the nonstructural provi-  
sions of the International Building Code. There are references to basic structural requirements, but  
this book does not attempt to go into structural requirements in depth. That is the subject for another  
volume.  
The book’s organization assumes little familiarity with the IBC on the part of the reader. It also assumes  
the reader has access to the latest version of the IBC. The book is intended to expand on, interpret,  
and illustrate various provisions of the code. The IBC has been adopted in many jurisdictions. As it has  
now been extensively applied, there is an evolving body of precedent in application and interpretation.  
The book is not intended to take the place of the International Building Code® \(IBC\) in any way. The  
many detailed tables and criteria contained in the IBC are partially restated in the book for illustrative  
purposes only. For example, we show how various tables are meant to be used and how we presume  
certain parts will be interpreted. When performing a code analysis for a specific project, we anticipate  
the reader will use our book to understand the intent of the applicable code section and then use the  
code itself to find the detailed criteria to apply. One can, however, start with either the IBC or this book  
in researching a specific topic.

The text is based on the language of the code and interprets it to enhance the understanding of the  
user. The interpretations are those of the authors and may not correspond to those rendered by the  
AHJ or by the International Code Council \(ICC\). This book, while based on a publication of the ICC, does  
not in any way represent official policies, interpretations, or positions of the ICC.  
Note that the text of the IBC contains terms in italic type. These italicized terms appear in the defini-  
tions in Chapter 2 of the IBC. Where defined terms are used in ways intended by their definitions,  
they are italicized in the body of the IBC. Italicized type is not used in this book in the same way. The  
IBC publisher’s intent for this notification method is to highlight for the code user that the definitions  
should be read carefully to facilitate a better understanding of how they are used in the context where  
they appear in italics. It is critical that the code user go back to the IBC’s definitions when attempting  
to understand the literal and figurative meaning of code requirements. All code definitions are now  
located in Chapter 2 of the IBC.  
x PREFACE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL \(ICC\)  
The primary purpose of the International Building Code \(IBC\) is to provide reasonable safeguards for  
the design, construction, use, occupancy, and maintenance of buildings. Participation by numerous  
volunteers representing all segments of the building community continue to log countless hours to  
ensure the code is updated every three years and reflects the current state of the art advances in  
building safety, resiliency, and performance. Developed through an open and transparent process, the  
IBC provides a balanced approach to safety, affordability, sustainability, and resiliency of buildings.  
To the uninformed, building codes can appear limiting or even serve as a roadblock to building design  
and construction. Building codes have also been accused of being too rigid or static and unable to stay  
abreast of innovation or the latest advances in technology. While no one denies the need for a building  
regulatory system to address the safety and welfare of the public, everyone wants it to be effective,  
flexible, and allow for innovation. To the informed user of the IBC, the opportunity has always existed  
for designers, builders, manufacturers, and code officials to apply the performance-based provisions  
of the code in a manner that allows for creativity, flexibility, and affordability in building construction.  
The current 2021 International Building Code states the following\:  
“The provisions of this code are not intended to prevent the installation of any material or to prohibit  
any design or method of construction not specifically prescribed by this code, provided that any such  
alterna- tive has been approved. An alternative material, design or method of construction shall be  
approved where the building official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with  
the intent of the provisions of this code, and that the material and method of work offered is, for the  
purpose intended, at least the equivalent of that prescribed in this code in quality, strength, effective-  
ness, fire resistance, durability and safety.”  
With advances in technology, competition, and the globalization of our economy, it is critical that  
building codes be dynamic and provide a pathway for the approval of new and innovative materials,  
designs, and methods of construction. Often, Code officials utilize research reports, listings, and/or  
test reports from approved sources providing verification of code compliance. The independent source  
that code officials frequently use to verify that a product is certified to a standard within the code,  
or an innovative or new product is evaluated to criteria that meet the building code requirements in  
terms of strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability, and safety, is the ICC Evaluation Service,  
Inc. \(ICC-ES\). Functioning as a subsidiary of the International Code Council, ICC-ES works closely with  
manufacturers, code officials, and the design community in an effort to facilitate the acceptance of  
products in the marketplace without compromising public safety. Information on products that have  
been reviewed by ICC-ES for code compliance can be downloaded at no cost by visiting http\://www.  
icc-es.org/Evaluation\_Reports/ or http\://www.icc-es.org/.  
Building Codes Illustrated\: The Basics presents core concepts found in Building Codes Illustrated, now  
in its seventh edition. Codes by their very nature tend to be tedious, dry documents that can also serve  
the late-night insomniac in search of relief. Building Codes Illustrated\: The Basics brings the code to  
life through its use of numerous illustrations accompanied with clear, easy-to-understand text that  
spares the reader the normal legalese contained in regulatory documents. Focused on key concepts for  
those new to building codes, this guide serves as a concise resource for those interested in not only  
understanding the code, but applying it as well.

# Building Codes  
The existence of building regulations goes back almost 4,000 years. The  
Babylonian Code of Hammurabi decreed the death penalty for a builder if a  
house he constructed collapsed and killed the owner. If the collapse killed  
the owner’s son, then the son of the builder would be put to death; if goods  
were damaged, then the contractor would have to repay the owner, and so  
on. This precedent is worth keeping in mind as you contemplate the potential  
legal ramifications of your actions in designing and constructing a building in  
accordance with the code. The protection of the health, safety, and welfare  
of the public is the basis for licensure of design professionals and the reason  
that building regulations exist. HISTORY AND PRECEDENTS  
Various civilizations over the centuries have  
developed building codes. The origins of the  
codes we use today lie in the great fires that  
swept American cities regularly in the 1800s.  
Chicago developed a building code in 1875 to  
placate the National Board of Fire Underwriters,  
who threatened to cut off insurance for busi-  
nesses after the fire of 1871. It is essential to  
keep the fire-based origins of the codes in mind  
when trying to understand the reasoning behind  
many code requirements.  
As the nation’s population has increased, people  
have moved nearer to bodies of water, to regions  
subject to high winds, and into wooded areas  
on the edges of towns. Mitigating the impact  
of hazards such as floods, high winds, earth-  
quakes, and wildland fires in populated areas,  
has increasingly been included in each new  
edition of the model codes. While fire safety is  
still a very large component in model codes, new  
model code documents now also include many  
provisions above and beyond the traditional fire-  
based requirements.  
“If a builder build a house for some  
one, and does not construct it properly,  
and the house which he built fall in and  
kill its owner, then that builder shall be  
put to death.  
If it kill the son of the owner, the son of  
that builder shall be put to death.  
If it kill a slave of the owner, then he  
shall pay slave for slave to the owner  
of the house.  
If it ruin goods, he shall make  
compensation for all that has been  
ruined, and inasmuch as he did not  
construct properly this house which he  
built and it fell, he shall re-erect the  
house from his own means.  
If a builder build a house for some one,  
even though he has not yet completed  
it; if then the walls seem toppling, the  
builder must make the walls solid from  
his own means.”

2 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED—THE BASICS  
The often-conflicting city codes were refined  
over the years and began to be brought  
together by regional nongovernmental organi-  
zations to develop so-called model codes. The  
first model codes were written from the point  
of view of insurance companies to reduce fire  
risks. Model codes are developed by private  
code groups for subsequent adoption by local  
and state government agencies as legally  
enforceable regulations. The first major model-  
code group was the Building Officials and  
Code Administrators \(BOCA\), founded in 1915  
and located in Country Club Hills, Illinois. Next  
was the International Conference of Building  
Officials \(ICBO\), formed in 1922, located in  
Whittier, California. The first edition of their  
Uniform Building Code \(UBC\) was published in  
1927\. The Southern Building Code Congress  
\(SBCCI\), founded in 1940 and headquartered  
in Birmingham, Alabama, first published the  
Southern Building Code in 1946. The first  
BOCA National Building Code was published  
in 1950.  
High Winds  
Fire These three model-code groups published the  
three different building codes previously in  
widespread use in the United States. These  
codes were developed by regional organiza-  
tions of building officials, building materials  
experts, life safety experts, and design profes-  
sionals to provide communities and govern-  
ments with standard construction criteria for  
uniform application and enforcement. The ICBO  
Uniform Building Code was used primarily  
west of the Mississippi River and was the most  
widely applied of the model codes. The BOCA  
National Building Code was used primarily  
in the north-central and northeastern states.  
The SBCCI Standard Building Code was used  
primarily in the Southeast. The model-code  
groups merged in the late 1990s to form the  
International Code Council and BOCA, ICBO,  
and SBCCI ceased maintaining and publishing  
their “legacy” codes.  
The International Building Code  
The new ICC process was a real revolution  
in the development of model codes. There  
was recognition in the early 1990s that the  
nation would be best served by a compre-  
hensive, coordinated national model building  
code developed through a general consensus  
of code writers. There was also recognition  
that it would take time to reconcile the differ-  
ences between the existing codes. To begin  
the reconciliation process, the three model  
codes were reformatted into a common for-  
mat. The International Code Council, made up  
of representatives from the three model-code  
groups, was formed in 1994 to develop a single  
model code using the information contained in  
the three current model codes. While detailed  
requirements still varied from code to code, the  
organization of each code became essentially  
the same during the mid-1990s. This allowed  
direct comparison of requirements in each code  
for similar design situations. Numerous drafts  
of the new International Building Code were  
reviewed by the model-code agencies along  
with code users. From that multiyear review  
grew the original edition of the International  
Building Code \(IBC\), first published in 2000.  
There is now a single national model code  
maintained by a group composed of represen-  
tatives of the three prior model-code agencies,  
the International Code Council, headquartered  
in Washington, D.C. The three organizations  
accomplished many years ago a full merger  
of the three model-code groups into a single  
agency to update and maintain the IBC.  
Note that most local jurisdictions make other  
modifications to the codes in use in their  
communities. For example, many jurisdictions  
make amendments to require fire sprinkler  
systems where they may be optional in the  
model codes. In such cases, mandatory sprin-  
kler requirements may change the design trade-  
offs offered in the model code for inclusion  
of sprinklers where “not otherwise required”  
by the code. It is imperative that the designer  
determines what local adoptions and amend-  
ments have been made to be certain which  
codes apply to a specific project.  
Many jurisdictions have not adopted the lat-  
est versions of the model codes. It is critical  
that designers familiarize themselves with the  
applicable edition of the model codes. All too  
often, practitioners assume that codes they  
have been using in one jurisdiction are the  
same as those in a new locale for their practice.  
That is often not the case and can lead to a lack  
of code compliance for some projects.

MODEL CODES  
A major revision took place in the 2015 IBC.  
The provisions for existing buildings, con-  
tained in Chapter 34 of the previous code,  
were removed. Therefore the IBC applies only  
to new buildings. The provisions for existing  
buildings are now contained exclusively in the  
International Existing Building Code and refer  
back to the IBC or adopt similar requirements,  
but the two codes are now intended to be  
used separately. For the purposes of this book,  
assume that the requirements discussed are  
to apply to new buildings or to additions to  
new buildings unless noted otherwise. See  
Chapter 23 for a more detailed discussion on  
how to use the IBC and the IEBC together.

BUILDING CODES / 3 FEDERAL AND NATIONAL CODES  
There are also specific federal requirements that  
must be considered in design and construction  
in addition to the locally adopted version of the  
model codes. Among these are the Americans with  
Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Federal Fair Housing  
Act of 1988.  
Americans with Disabilities Act  
The Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\) of 1990  
is federal civil-rights legislation requiring that build-  
ings be made accessible to persons with physical  
disabilities and certain defined mental disabilities.  
The original ADA Accessibility Guidelines \(ADAAG\)  
were administered by the Architectural and  
Transportation Barriers Compliance Board \(ATBCB\),  
and the regulations are administered by the US  
Department of Justice. Enforcement of the law  
is through legal actions brought by individuals or  
groups asserting violations of their rights of access,  
as civil rights. A new version of the ADA accessibil-  
ity guidelines known as the 2010 ADA Standards  
for Accessible Design \(ADAS\) went into effect on  
March 15, 2012. Designers can obtain copies of the  
new guidelines from the Access Board at www.  
access-board.gov/ada.  
It is critical for designers to understand that unless  
adopted as the access regulations for a jurisdiction  
or state, the ADA is not subject to interpretation by  
local building officials; it is enforced by legal action,  
through the courts. Access is to be provided for all  
disabilities, not just for people with mobility impair-  
ments. These include hearing, vision, speech, and  
cognitive impairments, as well as persons of short  
stature and with limited mobility not necessarily  
requiring the use of a wheelchair. The ADA applies  
to all new construction. The ADA also requires that  
barriers to access be removed from existing build-  
ings where such work is readily achievable. The  
definition of readily achievable is an economic one  
and should be addressed by the building owner, not  
by the building architect.  
The ADA is one of the few building regulations—  
in this case a law, not a code—that requires  
retrofitting of projects apart from upgrading  
facilities during remodeling or renovation. Most  
codes apply to existing buildings only when  
renovation is undertaken. Under the ADA, those  
access improvements that are readily achievable  
should be undertaken by the owner, whether or  
not any other remodeling work is to be done.  
The owner, not the architect, must make this  
determination.  
As the ADA is not enforced by local building  
officials, we will concentrate here only on those  
accessibility codes that are enforced locally  
and subject to review and interpretation as  
part of the permit process. Designers must  
first concentrate on complying with codes and  
standards adopted locally but must also keep  
national statutory requirements such as the  
ADA in mind. It is prudent to review design  
work against the 2010 ADAS at the same  
time as the model-code review. It is often a  
judgment call as to which is the most stringent  
requirement where requirements between codes  
and legislation differ. In these situations, it is  
essential and prudent to make the client aware  
of these discrepancies and have them actively  
participate in any decisions as to which part of  
which requirements will govern the design of  
project components.  
Space requirements for accessibility are related  
to ergonomics. Bigger is not automatically better.  
The 16"–18" \(406–457\) required range between  
the centerline of a water closet to a side wall  
or partition with grab bars, is based on reach  
ranges and leverage for movement using one’s  
arms. A longer reach reduces leverage and thus  
may be worse than too little space.  
Federal Fair Housing Act  
The Federal Fair Housing Act \(FFHA\) of 1988  
includes Department of Housing and Urban  
Development \(HUD\) regulations requiring all  
residential complexes of four or more dwelling  
units constructed after March 13, 1991, to be  
adaptable for use by persons with disabilities.  
For example, residential complexes must provide  
access to all units on the ground floor, and all  
units must be accessible from grade by a ramp or  
elevator. Many state housing codes also incorpo-  
rate these requirements. A very good reference  
for the FFHA is the Fair Housing Act Design  
Manual, which can be obtained free of charge at  
https\://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/  
PDF/FAIRHOUSING/fairfull.pdf.  
4 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED—THE BASICS  
E L E V AT O R State Building Codes  
Each state has a separate and distinct code adop-  
tion process. In the past, many states adopted  
one of the three previous model codes, and  
some states even had their own building codes.  
The geographic areas for state model-code  
adoptions corresponded roughly to the areas  
of influence of the three previous model codes.  
The BOCA National Building Code predomi-  
nated in the northeastern United States. The  
Southern Building Code was adopted throughout  
the southeastern United States. The Uniform  
Building Code was adopted in most states west  
of the Mississippi River. Many states allowed  
local adoption of codes so that in some states,  
such as Texas, adjacent jurisdictions in the same  
state had different building codes based on  
different model codes. Now, the advent of the  
International Codes has altered this landscape  
drastically. The “I Codes” are now the basic  
model codes in essentially every state. However,  
be aware that most state processes still allow  
amendments to the IBC, which means that there  
will likely be state-adopted amendments to the  
IBC. Make certain you know what code you are  
working with at the permitting level. Also, as  
noted, in states or localities that adopt a model  
code, be sure to verify which edition of the  
model code has been adopted.  
Local Building Codes  
Many localities adopt the model-code  
documents with little modification except for  
the administrative chapters that relate to local  
operations of the building department. Larger  
cities, such as Los Angeles, New York City,  
Chicago, and San Francisco, typically adopt  
much more sweeping revisions to the model  
codes. The codes for such cities often bear little  
resemblance to the underlying model codes  
and in some cases have no basis in them at all.  
Interpretations, even of the unaltered model code  
made by big-city building departments, often  
tend to be very idiosyncratic and nonuniform  
when compared to smaller jurisdictions that  
use less modified versions of the model codes.  
The adoption of the IBC at the state level has  
generated a review of big-city building codes so  
that these city codes are moving toward greater  
conformity with the model codes. For example,  
San Francisco and Los Angeles previously used  
a UBC-based state code, which has now been  
converted to an IBC-based, locally modified  
Seattle  
OREGON  
San Francisco  
Los Angeles  
state code. This will require a careful analysis of  
the city-code amendments to ensure conformance  
with the new model code. This redevelopment of  
codes has also been occurring in other large cities,  
such as Dallas and New York, as their states adopt  
the IBC. Be aware of local modifications and be  
prepared for varying interpretations of the same  
code sections among various jurisdictions. Do not  
proceed too far in the design process based on  
review of similar designs in another jurisdiction  
without verifying the code interpretation in the  
jurisdiction where the project is located. Similarly,  
although this book offers opinions of what code  
sections mean, all such opinions are subject to  
interpretation by local authorities as codes are  
applied to specific projects.

BUILDING CODES / 5 OTHER CODES AND STANDARDS  
Codes and standards are related, but serve  
different purposes. A building code \(e.g., the  
International Building Code\) establishes a jurisdic-  
tional “floor” relative to occupants’ health, safety,  
and welfare. A building standard \(e.g., NFPA 13,  
which addresses fire sprinkler requirements\) is a  
“standard practice” often referred to within the  
codes. In short, a code is what you must do \(sprin-  
klers, yes or no, per which standard\); a standard  
is a guide on how you do it \(sprinkler head flow  
rates, spacing, etc.\). There are thus a number of  
other codes and standards that the designer must  
be familiar with. They are mentioned here in brief  
to remind users of the International Building Code  
that other documents must also be consulted dur-  
ing project design.  
While building code and accessibility regulations  
are usually the focus of interest for architectural  
and structural work, you need to be aware of the  
existence of other separate codes and standards  
for such work as electrical, plumbing, mechanical,  
fire sprinklers, and fire alarms. Each of these may  
impact the work of design consultants and in turn  
the work of the architect. Detailed consideration  
of the requirements in these other codes is beyond  
the scope of this book.  
Fire codes are typically considered maintenance  
codes. They are intended to provide for public  
health and safety in the day-to-day operation of  
a structure. They are also meant to assure that  
building life-safety systems remain operational in  
case of emergency. The various model-code agen-  
cies have developed model fire codes for these  
purposes. They are developed with primary input  
from the fire services and less input from design  
professionals. Note, however, that fire codes can  
have an impact on building design. They con-  
tain requirements for such elements as fire-truck  
access, locations and spacing of fire extinguish-  
ers, as well as requirements for sprinklers and wet  
or dry standpipes. The fire code also may contain  
requirements for added fire protection related to  
the ease or difficulty of fire equipment access to  
structures.  
Plumbing codes often dictate the number of  
plumbing fixtures required in various occupancies.  
Some codes place this information in the build-  
ing code, some in the plumbing code, and some  
in appendices that allow local determination of  
where these requirements may occur in the codes.  
The designer must determine which course of  
legal adoption the local authority has chosen. The  
determination of the required number of plumbing  
fixtures is an important design consideration. It is  
essential to use the adopted tables and not auto-  
matically assume those in the model building code  
apply. A discussion of the use of the fixture counts  
found in Chapter 29 of the 2021 IBC are found in  
Chapter 20 of this book.  
The model codes have no force of law unto them-  
selves. Only after adoption by a governmental  
agency are they enforceable under the police  
powers of the state. Enforcement powers are del-  
egated by statute to officials in various levels of  
government. Designers must verify local amend-  
ments to model codes to be certain which code  
provisions apply to specific projects.  
There are many different codes that may apply to  
various aspects of construction projects. Typically,  
the first question to be asked is whether the  
project requires a permit. Certain projects, such as  
interior work for movable furniture or finishes, are  
usually exempt. Carpeting may be replaced and  
walls painted without a permit, but moving walls,  
relocating doors, or doing plumbing and electrical  
work will require a permit in most jurisdictions.  
6 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED—THE BASICS Traditionally, codes have been written with new  
construction in mind. In recent years more and  
more provisions have been made applicable  
to alteration, repair, and renovation of existing  
facilities. One of the emerging trends in code  
development is the creation of an International  
Existing Building Code. The reuse of existing  
buildings is also of concern for accessibil-  
ity issues. One of the most crucial aspects of  
remodeling work is to determine to what extent  
and in what specific parts of your project do the  
building codes and access regulations apply.  
Most codes are not retroactive. They do not  
require remedial work apart from remodeling  
or renovation of a building. Providing access to  
spaces like toilets serving altered areas may  
require work outside of the area of alteration.  
A notable exception to this is the ADA, which  
requires that renovation be undertaken to pro-  
vide access for persons with disabilities if access  
can be readily provided. However, this is a  
civil-rights law and not a code. As such, it is not  
enforced by building officials. In existing build-  
ings it is critical for the designer to determine  
with the AHJ what the boundaries of the project  
are to be and to make certain that the AHJ, the  
designer, and the client understand and agree  
on the requirements for remedial work to be  
undertaken in the project area.  
Rating Systems  
There are also rating systems, the most  
well known and widespread of which is the  
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design,  
or LEED program, developed by the US Green  
Building Council \(USGBC\). LEED is not intend-  
ed to be a code, although some jurisdictions  
have adopted LEED criteria as code language.  
Typically, a rating system is a voluntary program  
based on options selected by the owner and the  
design team rather than being a set of require-  
ments. Rating systems serve as an ever-being-  
raised “ceiling” for practice.  
LEGAL BASIS FOR CODES  
Standard of Care  
The designer should always remember that  
codes are legally and ethically considered to  
be minimum criteria that must be met by the  
design and construction community. The protec-  
tion of health, safety, and welfare is the goal of  
these minimum standards. It is important to also  
understand that registered design professionals  
will be held by legal and ethical precedents to a  
much higher standard than the code minimum.  
The so-called “standard of care” is a legal term  
defining the level of quality of service that a prac-  
titioner is expected to meet. This is higher than  
the minimum standard defined by the code. The  
code is the level that a practitioner must never  
go below. Because professional work involves  
judgment, perfection is not expected of a design  
professional. The standard of care is defined for  
an individual designer as being those actions  
that any other well-informed practitioner would  
have taken given the same level of knowledge in  
the same situation. It is a relative measure, not  
an absolute one.  
Life Safety vs. Property Protection  
The basis for building-code development is to  
safeguard the health, safety, and welfare of the  
public. The first and foremost goal of building  
codes is the protection of human life from the  
failure of life safety provisions in a building,  
or from structural collapse. But there is also a  
strong component of property protection con-  
tained in code requirements. Sprinkler provisions  
can serve both purposes. When buildings are  
occupied, sprinklers can contain or extinguish a  
fire, allowing the building occupants to escape.  
The same sprinkler system can protect an unoc-  
cupied structure from loss if a fire occurs when  
the structure is not occupied.  
While many systems may perform both life  
safety and property protection functions, it is  
essential that code developers keep the issue  
of life safety versus property protection in mind.  
For example, security measures to prevent intru-  
sion into a structure may become hazards to life  
safety. A prime example of this is burglar bars  
on the exterior of ground-floor windows that  
can trap inhabitants of the building in an emer-  
gency if there is not an interior release to allow  
occupants to escape while still maintaining the  
desired security. In no case should property-  
protection considerations have primacy over life  
safety.  
BUILDING CODES / 7 THE FUTURE FOR CODE DEVELOPMENT  
The International Building Code is a living docu-  
ment. It is subject to regular review and comment  
cycles. A new code is published at regular intervals,  
usually every three years. This publication cycle  
gives some measure of certainty for building design-  
ers that the code will remain unchanged during the  
design-and-construction process. The code responds  
to new information, growing by accretion and adap-  
tation. Since the three model-code agencies merged  
into one organization, detailed changes in the code-  
development process have evolved and have been  
refined. We will give only a general description  
of the code-development process. For a detailed  
description of the current code development pro-  
cess, see the ICC website.  
Any person may propose a code revision. Any  
designer, material supplier, code official, or inter-  
ested member of the public who feels they have  
a better way to describe code requirements or to  
accommodate new life-safety developments or  
new technology may prepare revised code lan-  
guage for consideration. Proposed code changes  
are published for review by all interested parties.  
They are then categorized based on what section  
of the code is being revised and assigned to a  
committee of people experienced in those mat-  
ters for review and consideration. Committees  
are typically organized around specific issues,  
such as means of egress, fire safety, structural  
requirements, and so forth. Anyone may testify  
at these committee hearings regarding the mer-  
its or demerits of the code change. The commit-  
tee then votes to make its recommendation to  
the Public Comment Hearings, which are held  
in conjunction with the annual business meet-  
ing. At the Final Action Hearing, testimony will  
be heard from all interested parties, both from  
non-voting industry representatives and building  
officials who will be able to vote on the pro-  
posed changes. After testimony is heard, only  
the government members of the organization,  
typically public employees serving as building  
and fire officials, are allowed to vote on the pro-  
posed changes. This is described as the “gov-  
ernmental consensus process” by the ICC. The  
ICC Code Development Process is conducted  
using cloud-based cdpACCESS. For details of  
code development process go to https\://www.  
iccsafe.org/wp-content/uploads/ICC-CDP-How-  
It-Works.pdf. For information on cdpACCESS go

8 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED—THE BASICS 2  
# Navigating  
# the Code  
The key word to remember about how all building codes are developed  
and how they all work is intent. Code sections have individual authors  
who had some problem in mind when they wrote a code-change pro-  
posal. The intent of the author of a building-code section is to solve a  
specific design problem with prescriptive language. Designers are usually  
trying to measure visual and spatial expressions against the language of  
the code. During this process, the designer should ask what problem or  
performance criteria the code section is addressing. The language will  
start to make more sense as one tries to go beyond the specific language  
to determine why the words say what they say.  
Designers also have intent. They are trying to achieve certain functional  
or formal goals in the design of the building. Designers should measure  
their own intent for the design against their interpretations of the intent  
of the code. When examined together, the intent of the code and that of  
the design solution should be concurrent.  
Do not try and ignore the code. Do not try and obfuscate code issues  
to achieve approvals. The responsibility for understanding, applying,  
and fulfilling the requirements of the code always rests with the design  
professional. Approvals by the AHJ do not relieve the designer of social  
and licensing responsibilities to maintain the health, safety, and welfare  
of society. INTENT AND INTERPRETATION  
Each section of the code was developed to solve  
a certain problem. Code sections are typically  
written in relatively short paragraphs. Sections  
are organized into chapters based on common  
themes, but sections may be developed in isola-  
tion from one another with little attention to  
continuity of the entire document. As you look  
at the code, try and visualize the intent of the  
writer of that section and try to understand the  
problem they were addressing. Code language  
usually arises from a specific issue the code  
writer wishes to address based on experience  
or on an actual construction or life safety issue.  
The writer then makes the requirements general  
so that they will apply to more typical conditions  
than the specific instance that generated the  
concern.  
The intent of the code is a crucial idea to under-  
stand. Why is a much more important question  
than what when you are puzzled by the actual  
language of a code passage. The code is a gen-  
eral document that must then be interpreted for  
its specific application to a specific project. If  
you know the code in general and think about its  
intent, you will be in a better position to formu-  
late your own interpretation of code sections as  
they apply to your specific project. You will thus  
be in a position to help building officials see the  
validity of your opinion when interpretation of  
the code is required for a specific design condi-  
tion. Confidence will come with experience in  
use of the code. Learning the code is vital to your  
success as a well-rounded designer.  
The application of the code requires interpreta-  
tion on the part of designers and the Authorities  
Having Jurisdiction \[AHJ\]. The individual’  
s view  
of intent can lead to alternative interpretations  
of code compliance. One of the goals of resolv-  
ing an unfavorable code interpretation is to con-  
vince the AHJ that the proposed design meets  
the intent of the writer of the code section in  
question and thus complies with the code.  
Note that in the IBC certain terms are in italic  
type. These italicized terms appear in the defini-  
tions in Chapter 2. Where terms are used in ways  
intended by their definitions, they are italicized  
in the body of the code. Italicized type is not  
used in this book in the same way. The code  
publisher  
’  
s intent for this notification method  
is to highlight for the code user that the code  
’  
s  
definitions should be read carefully to facilitate  
better understanding of how they are used in the  
context where they appear in italics. It is critical  
that the code user go back to the code definitions  
when attempting to understand the literal and  
figurative meaning of code requirements. When  
attempting to interpret a code section, be sure  
to examine the code definitions for the terms  
used in the code section. Do not assume that the  
meanings of terms are the same as in everyday  
speech, especially for italicized text.  
IBC Definition  
Code section using the  
definition \(in italic type\)  
While definitions occur in the IBC in Chapter 2,  
this book discusses definitions in context with  
where the defined items are used in the technical  
requirements in the code. We believe this makes  
the analysis in this book easier to follow. Defined  
terms from the IBC are noted in \[bracketed italic  
type\]. Thus defined terms will be found through-  
out the various chapters of this book.

Learn the table of contents and use  
the index. It is very useful to get the  
code in electronic form for use in your  
practice. This allows keyword search-  
es. Don  
’t try and memorize passages of  
the code, because these may change or  
move around inside the code over time  
or in various jurisdictions as the code is  
amended. Learn the organization of the  
code and learn where to find things that  
way. Use the index if the table of contents  
doesn  
’t get you where you want to be.  
Think of synonyms for the topic you are  
researching to facilitate keyword or index  
searches. You may have to scan large  
portions of the index to locate potential  
items. Try to remember associations of  
ideas, not specific language, to facilitate  
your use of the code.  
In the code, solid vertical lines \[ \] in the  
margins indicate a text change from the  
previous edition. There will be an arrow  
in the margin \[—\>\] indicating a deletion  
in the section. A single asterisk \[\*\] placed  
in the margin indicates that text or a table  
has been relocated within the code. A  
double asterisk \[\*\*\] placed in the margin  
indicates that the text or table immedi-  
ately following it has been relocated there  
from elsewhere in the code.  
You should consider getting a personal  
printed copy of the model code, and an  
electronic copy as well. Remember that the  
model code is often amended during adop-  
tion by local agencies. Be certain to find out  
what local code amendments to the code  
apply to your specific project. Also deter-  
mine if the local AHJ has published written  
opinions regarding their interpretation of the  
code in their jurisdiction.

10 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Alternative Means and Methods  
§ 104.11 states that the provisions of this code  
are not intended to prevent the installation of  
any material or to prohibit any design or method  
of construction not specifically prescribed by this  
code. While written around prescriptive descrip-  
tions of tested assemblies and rated construc-  
tion, the code recognizes that there may be many  
different ways of solving the same design prob-  
lems. It recognizes that there will be innovations  
in building types, such as covered malls, mixed-  
use buildings, and atrium buildings that do not fit  
neatly into prescribed occupancy classifications.  
The code also recognizes that there will be inno-  
vations in materials and construction technology  
that may happen faster than code revisions are  
made. Thus, the code sets up a method for the  
building official to approve proposed alternative  
designs. Deviations from prescribed standards  
must be submitted for review and approval of  
the building official. The criteria they are to use  
are spelled out in the code.  
”An alternative material, design or method of  
construction shall be approved where the build-  
ing official finds that the proposed alternative  
meets all of the following\:  
1\. The alternative material, design, or method of  
construction is satisfactory and complies with  
the intent of the provisions of this code.  
2\. The material, method or work offered is, for  
the purpose intended, not less than the equiva-  
lent of that prescribed in this code as it pertains  
to the following\:  
2.1\. Quality  
2.2\. Strength  
2.3\. Effectiveness  
2.4\. Fire resistance  
2.5\. Durability  
2.6\. Safety”  
The list of words above are also the fundamental  
criteria for why each and every code section is  
included in the basic code.

NAVIGATING THE CODE / 11 INTENT AND INTERPRETATION  
Code Interpretations  
Designers and code officials approach inter-  
pretations from quite different perspectives.  
The designer is trying to make a functional or  
formal design code compliant while satisfying  
project requirements in an aesthetic, economical,  
and practical way. The AHJ examines completed  
drawings for compliance with code requirements.  
While the AHJ is aware of the practical require-  
ments contained in the building design, they are  
charged first and foremost with protecting the  
health, safety, and welfare of the public by verify-  
ing code compliance. It is the responsibility of the  
designer to demonstrate code compliance and to  
modify noncompliant areas identified during plan  
review by the AHJ while continuing to meet the  
project requirements.  
Both the designer and the AHJ are working  
to apply generalized code provisions to a spe-  
cific project. It is differences in opinion about  
the application of the general to the specific that  
most often give rise to differences in interpreta-  
tion. Code officials also see many more similar  
examples of the relationship of code sections  
to various designs. Thus, they may generalize  
interpretations from one project to another even  
though the projects may be different in sig-  
nificant ways. On the other hand, designers may  
find that similar designs receive quite different  
interpretations by the AHJ in different jurisdic-  
tions. When differences of opinion about inter-  
pretation occur, the designer must work with the  
AHJ to reconcile the intent of the design to the  
interpretations of the intent of the code. If recon-  
ciliation cannot be reached, the designer must  
decide whether to revise the project to obtain  
approval or appeal the ruling of the AHJ to some  
civic body prescribed in the jurisdiction for hear-  
ing appeals. Also, the AHJ can be requested to  
apply to the model-code agency that published  
the code for a ruling as to the publisher  
’  
s opinion  
of the intent of the code section in question.  
Such appeals to the ICC are allowed to be made  
by any ICC member. It is thus prudent for design  
professionals to be ICC members to be able to  
access this service. In addition, members receive  
discounts on ICC codes and have access to other  
interpretive and educational materials. Members  
may also participate in the code development  
process and gain deeper insights into code  
interpretations.

Without a code section citation it is very difficult to  
have a productive discussion about interpretations.  
Recording citations focuses code issues for the  
designer during the design process and facilitates  
plan reviews by the AHJ. At the start of every  
code analysis, research should be undertaken to  
determine what, if any, local code amendments are  
applicable to a project.  
At minimum the analysis should contain the follow-  
ing items. We recommend the following format to  
unify code analysis for all projects. The code section  
citations used should be specific for the project and  
sections, not as limited as in our example.

For the designer, many elements required to  
determine how the code should apply to a  
project are a given from the program and the  
site or zoning constraints\:  
•  
Occupancy classification—the client  
determines what functions they want.  
•  
Location of building on property—  
determined by the building footprint,  
zoning, natural features, etc.  
•  
Building height and area—given the scope  
of the project, the designer will note how  
large the building needs to be and how  
many floors will be required.  
With these pieces of information, it is  
possible to determine how the code  
prescribes the minimum for\:  
•  
Construction type—determined by  
calculation for allowable areas and  
heights.  
•  
Exit locations and quantities.  
•  
Exit access widths.  
•  
Exit discharge to a public way.  
NAVIGATING THE CODE / 13 USING THE CODE  
The following procedure is recommended as being helpful in  
using the International Building Code and any applicable local  
jurisdiction code amendments. Note that most of the major  
issues are interactive and that iteration of relationships will  
almost certainly be required to optimize design solutions and  
steps may not occur in precisely the same order for each itera-  
tion. The procedure can be paraphrased as follows.  
1\. Classify the building according to occupancy, type of  
construction, location on property, floor area, height, and  
number of stories.  
A. Occupancy Classification  
Determine the occupancy  
group that the use of the  
building or portion thereof most  
nearly resembles. Compute the  
floor area and occupant load of  
the building or portion thereof.  
See the appropriate sections  
in Chapter 5 for requirements  
for buildings with mixed  
occupancies.  
B. Sprinkler Systems  
Determine if the occupancy is  
required to be protected by a  
sprinkler system and identify the  
threshold\(s\). Determine if the  
anticipated height of the building  
will require fire sprinklers. See  
the appropriate sections in  
Chapter 9 for thresholds based  
on the occupancy. Note also  
the sprinkler adjustments for  
heights and areas in Chapter  
5 as described in Step  
“D.  
”  
The basic model IBC requires  
sprinklers in many conditions.  
Local amendments are often  
made to either increase or  
decrease sprinkler thresholds  
and requirements.  
14 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED

THE BASICS  
C. Type of Construction  
Determine the required  
minimum type of construction,  
or architecturally desired  
construction type, based on the  
occupancy, fire protection, and  
the designed height and area.  
This will dictate the materials  
used and the fire resistance  
of the parts of the building as  
limited in Chapter 6.  
D. Allowable Floor Area  
Determine the allowable floor  
area of the building. Use the  
basic allowable floor area  
based on occupancy group  
and type of construction.  
Determine allowable floor  
area of multistory buildings.  
Determine allowable increases  
based on location on property  
and if there is installation of  
an approved automatic fire-  
sprinkler system. H  
E. Height and Number of  
Stories  
Compute the height of the  
building and determine the  
number of stories. Determine  
the maximum height and  
number of stories permitted  
based on occupancy group  
and type of construction.  
Determine allowable height  
and story increase based on  
the installation of an approved  
automatic fire-sprinkler system.  
F . Location on Property  
Determine the location of  
the building on the site and  
clearances to lot lines and other  
buildings from the plot plan.  
Determine the fire-resistance  
requirements for exterior walls  
and wall-opening requirements  
based on fire-separation  
distances to lot lines. The fire-  
resistance requirements for  
exterior walls and the limitations  
on their openings are found in  
Chapter 7.  
G. Means of Egress  
Determine the requirements  
for means of egress from the  
building found in Chapter 10.  
USING THE CODE  
2\. Review requirements for fire-  
sprinkler protection.  
3\. Review the building for  
conformity with the type-of-  
construction requirements  
in relation to desired and  
allowable building heights and  
plan areas. Iteration may be  
required among heights, areas,  
and construction types.  
4\. Review the effects on the  
building based on its location  
on the building site. Iteration  
may be required in reviewing  
location together with  
construction types and  
amount of openings in  
relation to property lines.  
5\. Review the building for  
conformity with egress  
requirements.  
6\. Review the building for other  
detailed code requirements.  
7\. Review the building for  
conformity with structural  
engineering regulations and  
requirements for materials of  
construction.  
NAVIGATING THE CODE / 15 CODE COMPONENTS  
The following section is a review of the critical  
information required for a project code analysis,  
based on the analysis system noted above.  
Construction Type  
I II III IV V  
•  
Increasing fire resistance and cost  
Occupancy Type  
Projects are almost invariably defined for the  
designer based on occupancy type. A client  
almost always comes to a designer with a  
defined need for a facility. The use of that facility  
determines the occupancy classification to which  
it belongs. Each occupancy classification or type  
has specific requirements related to allowable  
area, height, and exiting, with potential construc-  
tion types growing out of these requirements.  
The codes are fundamentally use \(occupancy\)  
based. Other criteria are derived from the first  
basic classification by occupancy. Occupancy  
classifications are defined in Chapter 3.  
Fire Extinguishing Systems  
Fire sprinklers, standpipes, fire detection, and  
fire-alarm systems are an integral part of most  
new buildings. Use of such systems, especially  
automatic fire sprinklers, often results in trade-  
offs for additional height or area. Trade-offs  
are listed in the code sections related to height  
and areas, but other requirements are listed in  
separate sections of the code. Fire-protection  
systems are covered in Chapter 9. Note also  
that sprinkler system requirements are another  
area where local amendments are often added  
to the model codes. These requirements should  
be verified for each project. It can be critical  
to a trade-off to know if a system is otherwise  
required in the jurisdiction where you are work-  
ing. Trade-offs only apply when the systems are  
not otherwise required by the local code to be  
used for a project. The idea of a trade-off recog-  
nizes that this is a mitigation measure over and  
above basic code requirements to achieve the  
desired level of safety through other means than  
those spelled out in the basic code.  
•  
Decreasing number of occupants and cost  
Construction Type  
Construction types are typically categorized by  
materials based on their resistance to fire in  
structural applications. The construction type  
gives some indication of the amount of time  
available for evacuation of occupants, for fire-  
fighting, and for emergency response under  
fire conditions. Buildings of fire-protected steel  
or concrete will provide more fire resistance  
than those of wood construction. More fire-  
resistant construction types are allowed to be of  
larger area and to have more stories as the fire-  
resistance increases. As a rough rule of thumb,  
allowable occupancy quantities and construction  
costs will both decrease with building type from  
Type I to Type V .  
Types of construction are defined in Chapter  
6\. Table 601 gives a synopsis of the minimum  
fire-resistive requirements of each main element  
of building construction. As you go through a  
code analysis, you will be referring to this table  
and to Table 506.2 to select the optimum bal-  
ance of construction type, occupancy, and area  
requirements for a specific project. It is typically  
a budget goal to minimize construction costs  
by selecting the least costly construction type  
appropriate for the proposed use of the building.  
Building or Floor Area  
Once the occupancy classification and con-  
struction type are known, it is important  
to establish the permissible area for each  
floor, for each use, and for the total building.  
Certain types of construction are limited in  
size based on occupancy and concentration of  
people. As noted, selection of the appropriate  
allowable area and construction type may  
require iteration of selections of construction  
type and allowable area based on occupancy  
requirements.  
Allowable areas are tabulated in Table 506.2.  
See § 506 for allowable area increases based  
on location on the property and allowance for  
installation of automatic fire-sprinkler systems.  
Building Height  
The allowable number of floors is tied closely  
to construction and occupancy classification.  
Total height in feet and number of stories may  
also be limited by planning codes, not for tech-  
nical reasons but as matters of public policy.  
Building heights are tabulated in Tables 504.3  
and 504.4. Study the definition of height and  
story as noted in the IBC. Also be aware that  
the definition of height and story is often  
subject to local amendment. Be certain to  
check these provisions with the local AHJ to  
be certain of the exact requirements for your  
project. This is especially true in older, hilly cit-  
ies like San Francisco, where topography and  
historical development patterns may generate  
definitions of height or story different than  
in other jurisdictions. Do not confuse zoning  
height definitions and limits with those in the  
building code. They are usually different in  
almost all jurisdictions.  
16 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Exits/Egress  
One of the most important functions of build-  
ing codes is determining egress requirements  
and provision of safe means of egress for all of  
the anticipated occupants of a building. There  
are specific requirements for size, spacing, and  
travel distances for all components of the means  
of egress, such as floor plans, doors, corridors,  
and stairs. In simple terms, a means of egress  
consists of three components\: an exit access, an  
exit, and an exit discharge. Chapter 10 of the IBC  
relates to means of egress.  
Building Separations and Shafts  
Where buildings have mixed occupancies,  
designers have the option of selecting separated  
occupancies, which require fire-rated partitions  
to separate the occupancies, or using  
“  
non-  
separated”  
occupancies. Separations may also  
be used to allow more area for a particular  
occupancy on a single floor in certain types of  
construction where such sizes of use would not  
otherwise be permitted.  
Openings between floors such as for stairs,  
elevators, and mechanical shafts can allow the  
passage of smoke, heat, and flames in a fire.  
Therefore, the codes have requirements based  
on occupancy, building type, and building height  
related to shaft protection. Basic shaft-protection  
requirements are contained in Chapter 7.  
Shaft  
Passive fire Active fire  
protection protection  
Fire Protection  
Fire protection can be divided into two broad  
categories\: passive or active protection. Passive  
protection is that built into the structure, either  
inherent in the material or added as part of  
protective membranes. Thus, a steel building  
has more inherent passive protection capability  
than a wood one because steel is noncombus-  
tible whereas wood is not. Active systems are  
ones where a fire causes a reaction in a system  
that serves to combat the fire. Sprinklers are a  
prime example of active systems. A fire causes  
a sprinkler system to activate and extinguish  
the fire before exposing the passive systems to  
a fire. Code analysis and design often includes  
trade-offs between active and passive systems.  
Fire-resistance standards include\:  
1\. Structure Hour Rating\: Requirements for  
the time it takes for a fire to weaken a  
structural element to the point of failure.  
These requirements are minimums based  
on providing enough time for firefighting  
and evacuation operations to take place  
for a specified time period without placing  
emergency responders and occupants in  
danger.  
2\. Area or Occupancy Separation Rating\:  
Requirements of how long it will take for  
a fire to penetrate a wall partition, floor, or  
roof assembly.  
3\. Flame Spread and Smoke Generation\:  
Requirements of how long it takes for fire  
to move along the surface of a building  
material and how much smoke is generated  
under fire exposure. The density and  
toxicity of the smoke is also a factor to be  
considered in these criteria.  
Fire-resistance requirements are found primarily  
in Chapters 7 and 8.  
CODE COMPONENTS  
Engineering Requirements  
A large portion of the code is devoted to engi-  
neering requirements. One of the bases of codes  
is structural adequacy of buildings for both static  
loading such as occupants and equipment, and  
dynamic loading such as earthquakes, snow, and  
wind. Requirements for both structural systems  
and structural materials are contained in the  
code. Chapters 16–18 deal with forces, inspec-  
tions, and foundations. Chapters 19–23 deal  
with structural materials\: concrete, lightweight  
metals, masonry, steel, and wood.  
NAVIGATING THE CODE / 17 CODE ANALYSIS  
Every project, no matter how small, should have  
a written code analysis included in the construc-  
tion documents. We recommend organizing the  
code analysis in the same order as shown ear-  
lier in this chapter, so that the thought process  
you use in developing your code conclusions  
is revealed in the written code analysis. This  
should be done early in the design process so  
that any issues can be identified and discussed  
with the Authorities Having Jurisdiction. As  
noted previously, be sure to do research about  
local code amendments to the model code.  
As noted, don  
’t be shy about using the table  
of contents, index, or keyword searches of  
electronic documents. DO NOT TRY AND  
MEMORIZE PARTS OF THE CODE! As sections  
change and interpretations alter meanings,  
memorization is a recipe for trouble in the  
future. Clients may expect you to be able to  
rattle off requirements at a moment’  
s notice,  
but it is not in the best interest of the project  
or the client to be able to make snap code deci-  
sions. Remember where to look up information  
and check your decisions each time you apply  
them; do not proceed on memory or analogy  
from other jobs. Even seasoned code profes-  
sionals use the index or an electronic code to  
locate familiar phrases when they cannot quite  
recall where the phrase is located in the code.  
It is worthwhile for designers to remember that  
as a new model-code edition is adopted across  
the nation, local code officials will often have  
little more hands-on experience with the IBC  
than design professionals.  
Early Meetings  
One advantage of larger projects is that they  
are often large enough to warrant pre-review  
and consultation with the building department  
prior to finalizing design. No matter what the  
size of your project, we recommend consulting  
with the applicable AHJ early in the process  
wherever it is possible, prior to commencing  
detailed design, even if a fee is charged. We  
also recommend that both the building and fire  
plan reviewers be at such meetings as they  
often do not always interpret the building and  
fire codes in the same way.  
Do not expect the code official to do your work  
for you. Compliance is the responsibility of the  
designer. However, codes are subject to inter-  
pretation, and it is almost always in your best  
interest to determine what, if any, interpreta-  
tions will be needed for any project. This should  
be done prior to expending a lot of time and  
energy designing a project that may be deemed  
not in compliance during plan review.  
18 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS 3  
# Occupancy  
# Classification  
# and Use  
The intended use or occupancy of a building is a fundamental consideration for the  
building code. Typically, a client comes to an architect with a defined need for a facility.  
The desired use of that facility determines the occupancy group to which it is assigned  
under the code. Occupancy group classifications trigger specific requirements for the  
allowable area and height of a building, for means of egress, as well as for type of  
construction. The  
“I”  
codes are fundamentally occupancy based, as were the three  
model codes from which it was born. Most other broad sets of code criteria are derived  
from the basic classification by occupancy.  
The code separates uses into broad groups called occupancies. Under these groups  
are subdivisions that further refine the detailed requirements. It is worth remembering  
that while the designer usually makes the first pass at categorizing uses in terms of  
occupancy according to the fire safety and relative hazard involved, the ultimate judge  
of occupancy classification is the building official per the provisions of Chapter 1 of  
the IBC. The intent regarding classification is best described by the language directing  
classification of atypical occupancies\:  
“Such structure shall be classified in the group  
which the occupancy most nearly resembles, according to the fire safety and relative  
hazard involved.  
” This reiterates the intent and purpose of the occupancy classifica-  
tions that exist in the code. Each of the stated occupancy classifications was deter-  
mined during the code development process by using fire-safety and relative hazard  
performance data to develop criteria.  
The IBC contains  
“User Notes.  
” At the beginning of Chapter 3, these state that  
“Chapter 3 provides the criteria by which buildings and structures are classified into  
use groups and occupancies. Through the balance of the code, occupancy classifica-  
tion is fundamental in the setting of features of construction; occupant safety require-  
ments, especially building limitations; means of egress; fire protection systems; and  
interior finishes.  
” OCCUPANCY CLASSIFICATION  
Determination of the occupancy type flows in  
almost every case from the program given to the  
designer by the client. Other code requirements  
flow from the number of occupants and the  
hazards to their safety from external and internal  
factors. Along with life safety concerns, the code  
looks at property protection considerations. The  
’  
occupancy  
s hazards are assessed relative to  
their impact on adjacent properties as well as on  
the building occupants. The code also analyzes  
the hazards posed by adjacent buildings; how-  
ever, it places the responsibility for protection  
of the adjacent facilities on the building under  
consideration.  
Among the considerations for occupancy clas-  
sification are\: how many people will be using a  
facility; whether there are assembly areas such  
as theaters and restaurants; whether people will  
be awake or asleep in the building; will they  
be drinking alcohol while using the building, or  
undergoing medical treatment, which makes  
them less capable of self-preservation in an  
emergency? The presence of hazardous materi-  
als or processes will also affect the require-  
ments for allowable area, fire separations, and  
construction type.  
Note that the criteria discussed in this book  
generally apply to non-hazardous occupancies.  
Hazardous occupancies are not encountered  
by most design professionals and are covered  
by a separate set of special requirements dis-  
cussed in § 414 and § 415. Because they are  
very specialized and encountered infrequently by  
most designers, the requirements for hazardous  
occupancies will only be lightly touched on in  
this book.  
It is essential to read the detailed requirements  
for each type of occupancy in a project. There are  
often cross-references to various other code sec-  
tions in the detailed occupancy criteria. Another  
factor that impacts occupancy classification is  
the mixture of various uses in a building and  
their sizes relative to the predominant use of the  
building. The sections regarding mixed occupan-  
cies and incidental uses are not found in Chapter  
3 but are located in Chapter 5 of the IBC.  
Several ideas common to most occupancy classi-  
fications, discussed in detail in Chapter 5, should  
be understood. First is the language\:  
“  
structures  
or portions of structures.  
” This distinction allows  
the use of mixed occupancies in a single building  
without having to consider the entire building as  
a single occupancy group. The concept of “  
sepa-  
rated”  
and “  
nonseparated”  
uses, discussed in  
Chapter 5, allows the designer two options for  
addressing mixed-use buildings. It also allows  
rooms within buildings to be considered as  
distinct occupancies that can then be addressed  
as either separated or nonseparated uses at the  
designer  
’  
s discretion.  
The other concept to understand is that the  
laundry lists of examples in each occupancy  
group are not the sole definition of which uses  
are to be classified in which occupancy group.  
The code recognizes that not all occupancies  
are included in the lists and gives direction to  
the designer and the building official regarding  
classification of buildings not included in the  
examples.  
The IBC establishes the following occupancy  
groups\:  
•  
Assembly \(A\)  
•  
Business \(B\)  
•  
Educational \(E\)  
•  
Factory and Industrial \(F\)  
•  
High Hazard \(H\)  
•  
Institutional \(I\)  
•  
Mercantile \(M\)  
•  
Residential \(R\)  
•  
Storage \(S\)  
•  
Utility and Miscellaneous \(U\)  
Code users often speak of “  
uses and occupan-  
cies  
”  
when describing what goes on in a build-  
ing. The code introduces a discussion of “  
”  
uses  
in § 302.2. Occupancy group descriptions contain  
uses considered to have similar hazards and  
risks to building occupants. Uses often also have  
additional requirements described in Chapter  
4\. We recommend first identifying uses in lay  
terms, then looking in the descriptions of uses in  
Chapter 3 that are associated with various occu-  
pancies to help determine the proper occupancy  
classification.  
20 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
Assembly Group A \(303\)  
The examples noted in this group recognize that  
these uses bring large groups of people together  
in relatively small spaces. How the spaces are  
used in relationship to physical features and  
human behavior also enter into the distinction  
between assembly categories, which are meant  
to serve as cues for assigning buildings or parts of  
buildings to an occupancy class. The final deter-  
mination of this classification, as for all classifica-  
tions, is made by the building official. Note that  
the subcategories are examples, not a definitive  
or exhaustive list of possible assignments.  
Be very careful in reading language where  
criteria are based on numbers.  
“Less than 50  
”  
persons  
means that 49 or fewer people have  
one set of criteria and “50 or more  
” have another.  
The dividing line in this case is 50. Read such  
language very carefully when deciding if an issue  
belongs in one category or another. If in doubt,  
be sure to verify the interpretation with your AHJ  
early in the design process to avoid costly errors.  
Group A occupancies are typically defined as  
having 50 or more occupants, but the use of  
the space must be examined in relation to the  
code language stating that these are spaces  
“for  
purposes such as civic, social or religious func-  
tions, recreation, food or drink consumption…  
”  
For instance, retail stores in M occupancies may  
have more than 49 occupants but are not consid-  
ered as Group A. Per § 303.1.1, assembly areas  
with fewer than 50 occupants are to be classified  
as Group B occupancies. Assembly areas of less  
than 750 sf \(69.68 m2\) that are accessory to other  
uses are also not considered as Group A areas  
per § 303.1.2 Item 2.  
Language in § 303.1.3 clarifies that assembly  
occupancies associated with Group E occupan-  
cies \(educational facilities\) need not be con-  
sidered as separate  
“A”  
occupancies. This is  
intended to avoid needing occupancy separa-  
tions between school gymnasiums and class-  
rooms.  
Accessory religious educational rooms and reli-  
gious auditoriums with an occupant load of less  
than 100 are not considered separate occupan-  
cies and would be classified with the majority of  
the facility, likely as an A-3 occupancy. Group B\: Less than 50 occupants  
Group A\: 50 or more occupants  
•  
Group A occupancies are typically  
defined as having 50 or more  
occupants, but per § 303.1.1,  
assembly areas with fewer than  
50 occupants are to be classified  
as Group B occupancies.

OCCUPANCY GROUPS  
Group A-1 per § 303.2 is for assembly  
areas, usually with fixed seats, intended for  
the viewing of performing arts or motion  
pictures. The presence or absence of a stage  
is not a distinguishing feature. The egress  
requirements in Group A-1 occupancies  
recognize that light levels may be low  
during performances and that people may  
panic in emergency situations under such  
circumstances.  
Group A-2 per § 303.3 is for assembly areas  
where food and drink are consumed. The  
requirements for these occupancies presume  
that alcoholic beverages may be served,  
thus potentially impairing the occupants  
’  
responses to an emergency. It also presumes  
that chairs and tables will be loose and may  
obstruct or make unclear egress pathways  
for patrons. The requirements also recognize  
the poor fire history of such occupancies.  
Also, note that the code addresses  
commercial kitchens. They are to be  
classified in the same A-2 occupancy as the  
dining areas they are associated with. See  
“B”  
and “F”  
occupancies for a discussion  
regarding food processing facilities and  
commercial kitchens not associated with  
assembly spaces used for dining.  
Group A-3 occupancies per § 303.4 are  
assembly areas that do not fit into the other  
Group A categories. It also includes spaces  
used for worship, recreation, or amusement.  
The intent of this classification is that any  
use that seems to be an assembly occupancy  
and does not fit the criteria of the other four  
Group A categories should be classified as  
an A-3 occupancy.  
One notable item is the classification of  
greenhouses having public access for  
such uses as botanic gardens. Note that  
greenhouses used for the sale of plants are  
to be an  
“M”  
occupancy.

THE BASICS  
Group A-4 occupancies per § 303.5 are  
assembly areas for the viewing of indoor  
sporting events.  
Group A-5 occupancies per § 303.6 are  
assembly areas for the participation or  
viewing of outdoor sporting events.  
The principal distinction between Group A-4  
and A-5 occupancies is one of indoor versus  
outdoor facilities. Note also that Group A-4  
occupancies are presumed to have spectator  
seating. Those assembly uses that are  
similar to these two classifications but do not  
meet all their criteria would most likely be  
considered Group A-3 occupancies.  
As noted in § 303.1.2 Item 1,  
“  
small”  
assembly spaces with less than 50 occupants  
are to be considered by exclusion as part of  
the overall occupancy. For example, having  
a conference room or a lunchroom with  
fewer than 50 occupants serving a larger use  
does not trigger classifying that space as an  
Assembly Group A occupancy.  
Per the same criteria, a large conference  
room in an office, where the room has more  
than 49 occupants, would be classified as  
an A-3 occupancy. This may trigger code  
provisions related to Group A occupancies  
that might not otherwise apply to the other  
office areas. It also may trigger occupancy  
separation requirements per § 508.4. Business Group B  
Office buildings are typically classified as Group B occupancies.  
Storage areas for offices, such as back-office file rooms, do not  
constitute a separate occupancy.  
Outpatient clinics and ambulatory care facilities are also clas-  
sified in this occupancy group.  
“Clinic-outpatient” defines a  
medical care facility where patients are not rendered incapable  
of self-preservation. Even where patients may be rendered  
incapable of unassisted self-preservation by anesthesia, the  
use could still be classified as a Group B occupancy. Such a  
facility, called an  
“  
ambulatory care facility,  
” is contained in the B  
occupancy list. It is defined in Chapter 2 as being a facility where  
patients stay for less than 24 hours but where such patients are  
rendered incapable of self-preservation.  
The definition refers only to  
“  
care  
“ facilities to broaden the appli-  
cability of this occupancy classification to more uses.  
T esting and research laboratories that do not exceed the quantities  
of hazardous materials specified in the code are also classified as  
Group B occupancies. Those that exceed the quantity limits are  
classified as Group H occupancies.  
Educational facilities for junior colleges, universities, and continu-  
ing education for classes above the 12th grade are considered  
Group B occupancies, not Group E. Assembly rooms in these  
facilities should be examined for conformance with the criteria for  
Group A occupancies.  
Note that procedures such as laser eye surgery or kidney dialysis  
should be considered as rendering patients incapable of unas-  
sisted self-preservation. Note further that facilities accommodat-  
ing people incapable of unassisted self-preservation may also be  
classified as I-2 occupancies, based on duration of stay.

processing facilities that are larger than  
2,500 sf are to be classified as Group F-1.  
USE AND OCCUPANCY / 23 OCCUPANCY GROUPS  
a dwelling unit are classified as Group R-3.  
Educational Group E  
Group-E occupancies are used by six or more peo-  
ple for classes up to the 12th grade. Uses for the  
day care of six or more children over 2  
1/2 years of  
age make up another set of Group-E occupancies.  
Day care uses with fewer than six children are to  
be classified with the larger occupancy they occur  
within. Those uses with fewer than six children in  
pancies per the provisions of § 303.1.3. Religious  
classrooms and auditoriums that are accessory  
to churches and have fewer than 100 occupants  
are to be considered as A-3 occupancies per  
§ 303.1.4.  
Assembly uses in school facilities are not excluded  
from this use group. However, most schools use  
their large rooms for assembly uses. Such facili-  
ties need not be considered as separate A occu-  
Factory and Industrial Group F  
Factory occupancies are defined in part by  
what they are not. The two occupancy groups,  
Moderate-Hazard Occupancy F-1 and Low-  
Hazard Occupancy F-2, are based on an analy-  
sis of the relative hazards of the operations in  
these occupancies and a determination that  
they do not fall under the criteria set for Group  
H. Group F-1 is classified as those operations not  
falling within the definitions for Group F-2. The  
predominant difference between F-1 and F-2 is  
that in F-2 occupancies the materials of manufac-  
ture are considered to be noncombustible.  
The classification of Group F occupancies  
assumes that these are not public areas. The  
users are presumed to be familiar with their  
surroundings and not occasional visitors. The  
processes themselves will determine which clas-  
sification the use is to receive. Uses meeting  
the F-2 classification are limited. Occupancy  
classification determinations between Groups  
F-1 and F-2 often are done by a process of  
elimination. When analyzing whether a use or  
occupancy should be classified as Group F-1  
or F-2, the quantities of materials used in the  
process under consideration will determine to  
which group the use belongs. For example, an  
F occupancy manufacturing alcoholic beverages  
up to 16% alcohol content is considered to be an  
F-2 low-hazard occupancy, while those manufac-  
turing beverages with an alcohol content above  
16% are an F-1 occupancy. This is based on the  
idea that the presumed level of flammability of  
such beverages increases with alcohol content,  
with 16% being established as the threshold  
between conventionally fermented wines and  
wines  
“fortified”  
with added alcohol. Large com-  
mercial cooking operations not associated with  
restaurants are called out to be F-1 occupancies.  
The code places a threshold of 2,500 sf  
\(232 m2\) for F-1 food-processing establishments  
and commercial kitchens. Facilities not exceed-  
ing the threshold, such as take-out restaurants  
with no seating or serving areas, are now called  
out to be classified as Group B occupancies.

THE BASICS  
High-Hazard Group H  
Hazardous occupancies could easily be the sub-  
ject of another book and will only be touched on  
in an introductory fashion in this text. The uses  
classified under this occupancy group are very  
specialized and require careful code and design  
analysis. Understanding the products, processes,  
hazard levels of materials used in the occupancy,  
and their quantities is essential. Variations in  
material quantities and hazards interact to set  
the design criteria for hazardous occupancies.  
The classification of uses in this category will  
almost undoubtedly require consultation with the  
client and with the building official at an early  
stage of design.  
There are two sets of criteria for hazardous  
occupancies. The first set is related to the haz-  
ard of the materials in use and the quantities of  
those materials in use. High-Hazard Groups H-1  
through H-4 fall in this category. The second set  
relates to the nature of the use as well as the  
quantity and nature of hazardous materials in  
use. This is for High-Hazard Group H-5, which  
are semiconductor fabrication facilities and simi-  
lar research and development facilities.  
Areas that contain limited quantities of hazard-  
ous materials may occur in other occupancy  
groups when the amounts are less than the  
“  
maximum allowable quantities  
” \(MAQ\). For  
example, small amounts of flammable cleaning  
fluids or paints might be stored in a room in a  
business occupancy. A mercantile occupancy can  
sell specified quantities of materials that may be  
considered hazardous without being designated  
a Group H occupancy as long as the amount of  
material is below the maximum allowable quan-  
tity. This exemption pertains only to occupancy  
classification related to quantities; it does not  
waive compliance with any other code provi-  
sions. Note also that the International Fire Code  
sets forth many additional construction and use  
requirements for Group H. Control Areas  
The other basic concept in the code provisions  
for High-Hazard Group H is that of control areas.  
The special detailed requirements for the sepa-  
ration of control areas are contained in Chapter  
4 and outlined in Table 414.2.2. Chapter 4 must  
therefore be read in concert with Chapter 3 to  
determine all applicable code requirements. This  
applies both to subdivisions of buildings clas-  
sified as hazardous occupancies and to areas  
where hazardous materials occur within other  
occupancies. The definition of this concept bears  
stating verbatim from § 202\:  
•  
•  
Control areas are  
“  
spaces within a building  
where quantities of hazardous materials not  
exceeding the maximum allowable quantities  
per control area are stored, dispensed, used  
or handled.  
”  
The control area concept allows multiple  
parts of a building to contain an array  
of hazardous materials when the areas  
are properly separated and the quantity  
of materials within each area meet the  
specified maximums for each type of  
material. These criteria reinforce the concept  
that hazard levels are mitigated by passive  
and/or active fire-protection measures.  
This concept is based on two primary  
considerations. The first is the nature of  
the hazard of the material in question. The  
second is that the level of hazard is primarily  
related to the quantity of materials within a  
given area.

OCCUPANCY GROUPS  
Control areas must be separated from one  
another by 1-hour fire-barrier walls and floors  
having a minimum fire-resistance rating of  
2 hours. For the fourth and succeeding floors  
above grade, fire-barrier walls must have a  
2-hour fire-resistance rating.  
Note that both the percentage of maximum  
allowable quantity of hazardous materials  
and the number of control areas decrease  
when proceeding up or down in the building  
to floors either above or below the first floor  
of a building.  
Higher than nine floors above grade, one  
control area with 5% of allowable quantity is  
permitted per floor.  
The seventh through ninth floors above grade  
may have two control areas per floor with  
5% of allowable quantity per control area.  
The fourth through sixth floors above grade  
may have two control areas per floor with  
12.5% of allowable quantity per control area.  
Third floor above grade may have two control  
areas with 50% of allowable quantity per  
control area.  
The second floor above grade and first floor  
below grade may have three control areas  
with 75% of allowable quantity per control  
area.  
The second floor below grade may have two  
control areas with 50% of the allowable  
quantity per control area.  
Control areas are not allowed more than  
two floors below grade.  
USE AND OCCUPANCY / 25 OCCUPANCY GROUPS  
Institutional Group I  
Institutional occupancies are those where people  
have special restrictions placed on them. The  
occupancy groups in these groups are subdivided  
by the abilities of the occupants to take care of  
themselves in an emergency. The different categories  
in this occupancy are determined by the number of  
occupants, their ages, health and personal liberty,  
and whether they are in the facility all day or part  
of the day or night. Whether or not the occupants  
are capable of unassisted self-preservation or are  
somehow incapacitated to the extent they will need  
help to escape danger also enters into the occupancy  
classification. Many of these occupancy groups have  
a residential character, and if they fall outside the  
designated thresholds for Group I occupancies, they  
will likely be classified as residential occupancies.  
The different Group I occupancies have their dis-  
tinguishing characteristics shown here in the same  
order to facilitate understanding the differences  
between them.  
•  
Group I-1 has more than 16 people living under  
supervised conditions and receiving custodial  
care in a residential environment on a 24-hour  
basis.  
“Custodial Care  
” is defined in § 202 as  
“Assistance with day-to-day living tasks, such  
as assistance with cooking, taking medication,  
bathing, using toilet facilities, and other tasks  
of daily living.  
” Custodial care includes persons  
receiving care who have the ability to respond to  
emergency situations and evacuate at a slower  
rate and/or who have mental and psychiatric  
complications. This classification includes  
halfway houses, assisted-living facilities, and  
group homes.  
•  
I-1 occupancies have been broken down into  
two  
“  
conditions  
” based on the abilities of the  
occupants to respond to emergencies and  
evacuate a building. The conditions are as  
follows\:  
\*  
\*  
Condition 1 occupants are presumed to be able  
to respond to an emergency independently and  
without assistance.  
Condition 2 occupants are presumed to need  
“limited verbal or physical assistance  
” to respond  
to an emergency and evacuate the building.

It is essential that the designer and the  
building client confer early in the design  
process to assess the capabilities of the  
prospective building occupants to determine  
the correct classification. This should also  
include consultation with the operator  
of the facility to determine what local  
licensing requirements may apply to the  
facility to assist in determining the proper  
classification.  
Because the occupants under Condition  
2 will likely take more time to evacuate  
the building during an emergency, the  
code places additional limitations for such  
things as the number of stories allowable  
for a given construction type, as well as  
requirements for smoke barriers, sprinkler  
protection, and smoke detection. If the  
•  
understanding of the classification of the  
two conditions occurs late in the design  
process or in the course of construction, the  
change can have profound consequences  
on the building. Thus, it is important to  
make this determination early in the design  
process. If there is any doubt about how  
the building will be used, it is prudent to  
assume it will have to meet Condition 2  
criteria, which would allow the use of the  
building by Condition 1 occupants. The  
reverse would not be the case. Condition  
2 occupants could not be housed in a  
Condition 1 facility.  
Similar occupancies with between 6 and  
16 occupants are to be classified as an R-4  
occupancy, or an R-3 if there are five or  
fewer occupants. •

•  
Group I-2 has more than five people living  
under supervised conditions and medical  
care on a 24-hour basis. The occupants are  
presumed under this classification to be  
incapable of unassisted self-preservation and  
thus cannot respond to emergencies without  
assistance from the staff. This classification  
includes hospitals, mental hospitals, detox  
facilities, and nursing homes.  
Group I-2 occupancies are classified into two  
conditions. The conditions are as follows\:  
§ 308.3.1.1, Condition 1. This occupancy  
condition includes facilities that provide  
nursing and medical care but do not provide  
services typically associated with hospitals.  
This is considered to include nursing homes  
and foster care facilities.  
§ 308.3.1.2, Condition 2. This occupancy  
condition is for hospitals, and includes  
facilities that provide nursing and medical  
care and could provide emergency care,  
surgery, obstetrics, or in-patient stabilization  
units for psychiatric or detoxification.  
Similar occupancies with fewer than six  
occupants or who stay for less than 24 hours  
are to be classified as R-3 occupancies.  
They may also comply with the International  
Residential Code \(IRC\). The designer  
should verify the anticipated uses with the  
facility operator when making occupancy  
classifications. This should also be reviewed  
with the AHJ for their concurrence. Such  
facilities are to be fully sprinklered.

Group I-3 has more than five people living  
under supervised conditions under restraint  
or security on a 24-hour basis. The occupants  
cannot respond to emergencies without  
assistance from the staff, not because of  
illness, infirmity, or age, but due to security  
measures outside their control. This group  
includes prisons, detention centers, and  
mental hospitals, and is further subdivided  
into five conditions based on the relative  
freedom of movement within areas inside the  
facility. These conditions also presume the  
areas are divided into smoke compartments  
with differing degrees of access controls  
between them.  
Group I-4 is for uses having more than five  
people under supervised conditions and  
under custodial care on a less than 24-hour  
basis. The occupants are presumed not to  
be able to respond to emergencies without  
assistance from the staff, although this is  
not stated in the code. This classification  
includes adult day care and child day care.  
The group is further subdivided into care  
facilities for adults and for children under  
2  
1/2 years of age. A child day-care facility for  
between 6 and 100 children under 2  
1/2 years  
of age, located on the exit discharge level  
with a direct exterior exit, is to be classified  
as an E occupancy.  
Similar occupancies with five or fewer  
occupants may be classified as part  
of the primary occupancy, or if located  
within a dwelling unit, be classified as an  
R-3 occupancy or shall comply with the  
International Residential Code. OCCUPANCY GROUPS  
Mercantile Group M  
Uses in this group are fairly self-explanatory. The  
occupancy group includes accessory storage,  
which will be regulated per the mixed use provi-  
sions in § 508. Accessory occupancies are regu-  
lated by § 508.2 and must still be individually  
classified. Larger storage areas would be classi-  
fied as Group S. Typically for larger combinations  
of M and S occupancies, the nonseparated provi-  
sions of § 508.3 are used.  
Most retail facilities, no matter what mer-  
chandise they sell, fall into this occupancy.  
“Greenhouses for display and sale of plants that  
provide public access  
”  
are to be classified as an  
M occupancy.  
There are limits to the quantities of hazardous  
materials that may be stored in mercantile  
occupancies without being classified as a Group  
H occupancy. These limits are shown in Table  
414.2.5\(1\).  
USE AND OCCUPANCY / 29 OCCUPANCY GROUPS  
Residential Group R  
Residential occupancies include typical housing  
units, distinguished mainly by the total number  
of occupants. A key criterion for this type of  
occupancy is that the occupants sleep in the  
building. This group also includes smaller-scale  
institutional occupancies that fall below certain  
thresholds for the number of occupants.  
•  
Note that although defined terms related  
to residential occupancies are listed in the  
residential occupancy section, the definitions

THE BASICS  
Group R-1 occupants are transient,  
sleeping in their rooms for 30 days or  
less, as in hotels and transient boarding  
houses. The requirements assume that  
the occupants are not familiar with the  
surroundings.  
Group R-2 occupants are permanent,  
sleeping in buildings containing more than  
two dwelling units for more than 30 days.  
These include apartments, dormitories,  
and long-term residential boarding houses.  
Congregate living facilities with more than  
16 occupants are to be classified as R-2  
occupancies. S M T W T F S

OCCUPANCY GROUPS  
Group R-3 occupants are permanent, and the group  
is defined as being those not meeting the criteria for  
R-1, R-2, R-4, or Group I occupancy groups. These  
include single-family residences and duplexes.  
Care facilities for five or fewer people also fall into  
this occupancy group. In many jurisdictions these  
occupancies are regulated under the International  
Residential Code \(IRC\) when it is adopted by the local  
jurisdiction.  
Congregate living facilities with 16 or fewer  
nontransient occupants or 10 or fewer transient  
occupants are also classified as R-3 occupancies.  
Lodging houses are a defined term for facilities  
having one or more permanent occupants paying rent  
for guest rooms.  
Care facilities for five or fewer persons are permitted  
to comply with the International Residential Code  
if an automatic sprinkler system is provided. Also,  
owner-occupied lodging houses with five or fewer  
guest rooms and 10 or fewer occupants are allowed  
to be constructed in accordance with the IRC if they  
meet the IRC’  
s height criteria of three stories or less.  
Taller R-3 occupancies must use the IBC. Lodging  
houses with more than five guest rooms are to be  
classified as R-1 for transient lodging and R-2 if used  
for nontransient use, but only if they exceed the 10 or  
16 occupant load threshold. Otherwise, they are R-3s.  
Group R-4 occupancies are used for residential care  
or assisted-living uses with more than 5 but not  
more than 16 occupants receiving custodial care,  
excluding staff. Under these conditions, Group R-4  
is used in lieu of Group I. This occupancy group is to  
meet the requirements for R-3 occupancies except as  
otherwise provided for in other sections of the IBC.  
As for I-1 occupancies, there are two conditions  
related to the ability of residents to respond to  
instructions\: Condition 1 \(§ 310.5.1\) occurs where  
persons receiving custodial care are capable of  
responding to an emergency situation to evacuate  
the building.  
Condition 2 \(§ 310.5.2\) includes buildings in which  
there are any persons receiving custodial care who  
require limited verbal or physical assistance while  
responding to an emergency situation to complete  
building evacuation. See the I-1 discussion for the  
impact of the conditions on building design. When in  
doubt, uses should be classified as Condition 2.  
USE AND OCCUPANCY / 31 OCCUPANCY GROUPS  
Storage Group S  
Storage for materials with quantities or charac-  
teristics not considered hazardous enough to be  
considered a Group H occupancy is classified as  
Group S. The two subdivisions are similar to the  
distinctions made for F occupancies\: Moderate-  
Hazard S-1 occupancies and Low-Hazard S-2  
occupancies. The lists of examples for each  
category are quite lengthy and detailed. When  
occupancies contain mixed groups of various  
products it can be quite difficult to determine  
which occupancy group to use. Careful consid-  
eration of projected uses for the facility and  
potential changes in use over time must be  
considered. It is useful to confer with the client  
and with the building official early in the design  
process to get concurrence on the proposed  
classification. As in the distinction between F-1  
and F-2 occupancies, the distinction between  
S-1 and S-2 is that S-2 is used for the storage of  
noncombustible materials.  
Note that “  
self-service storage,  
”  
also known  
“  
as  
mini-storage  
” facilities, are called out to be  
classified as an  
“S-1”  
occupancy. This is due  
to the varied nature of materials that are often  
stored in such facilities and the likelihood of  
such materials being haphazardly and densely  
packed.  
Utility and Miscellaneous Group U  
This group is for incidental buildings of an  
accessory nature. These structures are typically  
unoccupied except for short times during a  
24-hour period and are typically separate from  
and subservient to other uses. The code now  
classifies  
“  
greenhouses  
” that are not classified  
as another occupancy as a  
“U”  
occupancy. This  
occupancy group is used sparingly. It is not meant  
to be a catch-all for occupancy types that are not  
readily categorized. The AHJ has the ultimate  
responsibility for determination of occupancy  
classification using the criteria set forth in  
§ 302.1\. Note also that this group contains items  
that are not buildings, such as fences over 7'  
\(2134\) in height and retaining walls.  
•  
Aircraft hangars used for the  
storage and repair of aircraft  
are listed as S-1 occupancies.  
Factories for aircraft manufac-  
ture are included in the list for  
F-1 occupancies.

# Special Detailed  
# Requirements Based  
# on Occupancy and  
# Use  
In addition to the requirements for typical occupancies, the code addresses detailed requirements for  
specific building types in Chapter 4. The descriptions of the basic requirements for these special detailed  
uses are abbreviated in this book. Many of these specialized uses occur infrequently in practice. This  
chapter touches on the most basic of these special provisions, and when an actual project falling under  
these provisions is encountered, the detailed provisions in the IBC should be carefully examined.  
The occupancy of these buildings usually fits into one or more of the typical occupancy groups, but char-  
acteristics of these building types require additional code provisions. Examples of such building types are  
covered and open mall buildings, high-rise buildings, and atriums. A mall is basically a Group M occu-  
pancy, but with many stores, large occupant loads, and means of egress that also serve as pedestrian  
walkways. High-rise buildings are typically Group B or R occupancies with very large occupant loads and  
are defined as having occupied floors located above fire department ladder access. Atriums have large  
interior volumes open to pedestrian pathways and to occupied spaces. These buildings need added code  
consideration above and beyond more typical uses in the same occupancy group. The additional code  
requirements for these building types are determined by their configurations, not their uses.  
These provisions are meant to apply over and above the other provisions applicable to their occupancy  
group classification. After the designer has classified the building by occupancy, the building type must  
then be examined to see if it meets the definitions for these specialized use groups and thus must also  
meet the added criteria for them. The process of analysis of use and occupancy should commence with  
an analysis of how the proposed building fits into the uses and occupancies described in Chapter 3 of the  
code, and then should be analyzed against the criteria in Chapter 4 to see which, if any, are applicable. SPECIAL DETAILED REQUIREMENTS BASED ON OCCUPANCY AND USE  
It is worth remembering that the detailed provi-  
sions of Chapter 4 of the code relate to and  
coordinate with the more basic requirements  
spelled out in Chapter 3 for use and occupancy  
requirements. The designer as code user should  
make a progression from the general to the  
specific in analyzing a building. Begin with  
the general categorization of uses and occu-  
pancies. Then proceed to review the detailed  
requirements of Chapter 4 for provisions appli-  
cable to the building in question. While one  
may begin the analysis of a specialized use  
by looking up the detailed requirements, the  
code is organized to proceed from determining  
the occupancy first and then applying detailed  
criteria. Just as one should not read up from  
footnotes to find table sections that may be  
misapplied, the user should not work backward  
in these analyses, as this may lead to erroneous  
code interpretations.  
We will go through the specialized building  
types to describe their distinguishing criteria  
and touch on the major additional code provi-  
sions applicable to them. We will discuss those  
special uses most likely to be encountered by  
designers. Note that detailed discussions of  
many specialized uses have been omitted, as  
they are not seen frequently. Most are related  
to Group H occupancies or to process-related  
special uses. Most designers do not frequently  
encounter these very specialized structures,  
or others such as underground buildings or  
amusement buildings. The criteria applicable  
to each of these other building types are used  
as noted above. The occupancy must first be  
determined before applying the specialized  
requirements contained in Chapter 4.  
Many of the sections in Chapter 4 contain  
definitions of the uses or occupancies to which  
the special provisions apply. These definitions  
are listed in Chapter 2 of the code and cross-  
referenced for location and explanation in  
the section indicated. Note that although the  
definitions may seem familiar and similar to  
common construction terminology, they have  
very specific meanings in the code. Examine  
the building design conditions and definitions  
carefully to determine the applicability of the  
definition to the building design. This analysis  
of the definition may also point out necessary  
modifications to the design to make it code-  
compliant or reveal the need to reclassify it.  
•  
First identify the general use  
and occupancy group to which  
the building belongs, and review  
the requirements contained in  
Chapter 3.

Institutional Groups I-2 and I-3  
The code adds provisions related to Group I-2  
occupancies in § 407 and Group I-3 occupancies  
in § 408 that must be read in concert with those  
in Chapter 3. Chapter 3 is intended to address the  
occupancy classification of a building, and Chapter  
4 is intended to address detailed requirements for  
certain uses and occupancies. Code analysis of  
these occupancy groups requires looking at both  
sets of provisions together. These are very special-  
ized occupancies with many specific and detailed  
requirements. The discussion in this chapter of the  
special requirements for these occupancies is only  
an introduction. The code user must consult the  
detailed requirements in the IBC to determine the  
specific requirements for a specific project.  
Other Specialized Uses  
The remaining groups of uses in Chapter 4, beyond  
those discussed in this chapter, relate to specific  
uses of buildings or parts of buildings that are  
infrequently encountered in most occupancies.  
These include motion-picture projection rooms,  
stages and platforms, special amusement areas,  
aircraft-related facilities, and high-piled combus-  
tible storage. These are specialized uses not often  
encountered in the normal course of work and will  
not be addressed in this book. Covered and Open Mall Buildings  
The code provisions in § 402 for covered mall  
buildings grew out of many years of application  
of special interpretations of existing codes in  
response to a then-new building type. It did not  
fit into the code criteria in use at the time this  
use type was first developing. Covered malls  
came into being based on design and retail-  
ing innovations. They combine the circulation  
paths used for means of egress with pedestrian  
routes. Spaces that might be considered exit  
discharge areas or safe egress terminations,  
such as a city street, became exit access areas  
with enclosures. Multiple tenants have access to  
the common pedestrian areas. There is a mixture  
of large department store type uses, termed  
“anchor” buildings, and smaller shops that open  
on the mall. It is also expected that there may be  
a mixture of other uses such as cinema and food  
court assembly areas as well as major anchor  
uses that are interconnected by the mall.  
The IBC has added language clarifying that the  
term “covered mall building” is intended to  
also include open malls, which are defined as  
“unroofed common pedestrian ways serving two  
or more tenants and which do not have more  
than 3 levels open to each other.” Thus, an open  
mall is essentially the same as a covered mall,  
but without a cover over the mall circulation  
spaces. The open mall is flanked by “open mall  
buildings,” which, as for covered malls, do not  
include anchor buildings.  
Open malls using the provisions of § 402 are to  
be treated in a similar manner to covered malls  
in how they relate to means of egress and major  
stores.

provisions are limited to three levels  
at any point and not more than three  
stories above grade.  
Per § 402.7.2, where a covered

SPECIAL DETAILED REQUIREMENTS BASED ON OCCUPANCY AND USE / 35 COVERED AND OPEN MALL BUILDINGS

An open mall is an unroofed common

not exceeding three levels.  
•  
Gross leasable area \(GLA\) is the total floor area  
available for tenant occupancy, measured from  
the centerlines of joint partitions to the outside  
of tenant walls. All tenant areas, including areas  
used for storage, are to be included in the GLA.  
Example for Determining Occupant Load  
per § 402.8.2  
Assume\:  
Retail Gross Leasable Area \(GLA\) = 200,000 sf  
\(18,580 m2\)  
+ A food court having an area of 5,000 sf  
\(465 m2\)  
+ An assembly use with fixed seating for 500  
\(included in the 200,000 sf \(18,580 m2\) of the  
GLA\)  
To determine the occupant load factor \(OLF\) for the  
mall, use Equation 4-1\:  
OLF = \(0.00007\) \(GLA\) + 25  
OLF = \(0.00007\) \(200,000\) + 25  
= 39 sf \(3.62 m2\) per occupant  
To determine the occupancy of the food court, use  
Table 1004.5 and allow 15 sf \(1.39 m2\) net per  
occupant in the food court seating area \(assembly  
without fixed seats, unconcentrated, with tables  
and chairs\)\:  
5,000 sf/15 sf \(465 m2/1.39 m2\) per occupant  
= 334 occupants  
Total Occupant Load\:  
= \(200,000/39\) + 334  
= 5129 + 334 = 5463 occupants

Assembly occupancies with an

entrance is immediately adjacent to  
a principal entrance to the mall. Not  
less than one half of the assembly  
area means of egress width is to  
open directly to the exterior of the  
covered mall building. Main exits  
may open into the central open mall  
area in an open mall building.  
Whenever travel distance to the  
mall from inside a tenant space is  
more than 75' \(22 860\) or the tenant  
space has an occupant load of 50 or  
more, two means of egress are to  
be provided from the tenant space.  
The second means of egress could  
be directly to the outside or into a  
rated corridor or exit passageway.  
Note that per the Exception  
to § 402.8.2.1, tenant spaces  
attached to the mall building but  
having a means of egress system  
independent of the mall building  
need not be considered as gross  
leasable area for the occupant  
load calculations since they do not  
contribute any occupant load to the  
mall means-of-egress system. The code provisions for covered and open malls  
rely on several basic ideas\:  
1\. First is the provision of multiple clear  
paths of exit with widths sufficient to  
accommodate the occupant load, which  
is calculated according to criteria in this  
section.  
2\. Second is the requirement that the increased  
building area be offset by separation from  
other buildings by at least 60' \(18 288\) of  
permanent open space to allow safe egress  
areas for occupants. This permanent open  
space allows covered mall and anchor  
buildings to have unlimited area for all  
but Type V construction. Note that the  
open space may be reduced under certain  
conditions as illustrated below.  
3\. Third is the requirement that potentially  
hazardous uses such as parking structures  
be separated from the mall, either by a  
minimum distance or by construction type  
\(fire barrier with a fire-resistance rating of  
2 hours\).  
4\. Fourth is a requirement for provision of active  
fire protection in the form of sprinklers,  
standby power, and a central fire department  
operations area.

The maximum distance of travel from  
any point in a covered mall to an exit is  
200' \(60 960\). For an open mall building the  
distance is measured to the perimeter line.  
•  
•  
Anchor buildings are defined  
as having direct access to the  
covered mall. By definition,  
they are required to have  
means of egress independent  
of the mall. They are analyzed  
as separate buildings and are  
not to be considered as part of  
the covered mall building.  
There are to be no means of  
egress from anchor building  
to mall. Openings are  
allowable. The openings may  
be unprotected in Types IA, IB,  
IIA, and IIB construction.

Perimeter line at open mall building.  
The building area must be separated from  
other buildings by at least 60' \(18 288\) of  
permanent open space to allow safe egress  
areas for occupants. This permanent open  
space allows mall and anchor buildings  
to have unlimited area for all but Type V  
construction.  
Per § 402.2 the permanent open space,  
normally 60' \(18 288\), may be reduced to  
40' \(12192\) under certain conditions\:  
• The reduction may occur along no more  
than 75% of the perimeter of the entire  
facility, including both the mall and anchor  
buildings.  
• The exterior walls facing the reduced  
open space must have a fire-resistance  
rating of 3 hours and openings must have a  
fire protection rating of 3 hours.  
• There can be no E, H, I, or R occupancies  
within the facility; thus, hotels and  
apartment buildings may not be in the  
facility if it utilizes the reduced distances.

Per § 402.6.2 and § 402.6.3, kiosks and play  
structures are to meet minimum criteria for  
combustibility to minimize their contribution of  
fuel or smoke in case of a fire in the mall.  
Kiosks and similar structures must be separated  
by a minimum horizontal distance of 20' \(6096\).  
There is to be a minimum of 10' \(3048\) clear  
exit width between tenant spaces and any  
obstructions, such as kiosks, benches, or food  
courts. Thus, placing such elements in a 20'  
\(6096\) wide mall could require the width of the  
mall to be increased to provide the minimum  
clear egress widths. Aggregate egress width  
is to be at least 20' \(6096\).  
Anchor buildings are to be sep-  
arated from the covered mall  
building by 3-hour fire walls per  
§706\. Per exception to §402.4.2.2,  
2-hour fire barriers per §707 are  
acceptable if the anchor building  
is not more than 3 stories and of  
the same occupancy uses as the  
covered mall building.  
Walls at major stores facing an  
open mall are to comply with the  
requirements of Table 705.5.  
Fire partitions between tenant spaces must  
have a minimum fire-resistance rating of  
1 hour as per § 402.4.2.1 and § 708.  
No fire separation is required between a tenant  
space and the mall. The exterior wall is also  
not required to be rated by the tenant space-  
separation provisions.  
Grilles and similar security closures are allowed  
at exits of open storefronts as long as they are  
not closed during normal business hours.  
The mall itself is considered as a corridor, but  
is not required to be fire-rated if it is more than  
20' \(6096\) wide, and all egress width provisions  
are met per § 402.8.1. HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS  
As building technology allowed advances in high-rise  
construction, the buildings often outstripped code  
provisions needed to address the new conditions  
impacting fire and life safety. High-rise buildings,  
made possible by innovative structural technology  
and elevators for transporting occupants, exceed  
the capabilities of firefighting procedures used for  
shorter buildings. They have occupied floors above  
the reach of even the longest ladders carried by fire  
department vehicles.  
Note that high-rise egress systems are based on the  
occupant loads and egress requirements spelled out  
elsewhere in the code \(see Chapter 10\). Stairways  
are the primary means of egress, with elevators typi-  
cally serving only firefighting functions as necessary.  
•  
The definition of a high-rise building in  
§ 202 is based on the height at which typical fire-  
department extension ladders and hose streams  
can effectively fight a fire. Thus a building with an  
occupied floor more than 75' \(22 860\) above the  
lowest level of fire-department access is defined  
as a high-rise. Firefighting in a high-rise assumes  
that the firefighters must enter the building and  
go up inside the building to fight a fire.  
With the advent of ever-taller buildings and in light of  
lessons learned from the September 11, 2001, World  
Trade Center disaster, a subset of requirements for  
“super high-rise” buildings, which are those taller  
than 420' \(128 m\) in height, has been added to the  
IBC. Most of these provisions are found in § 403 but  
many others are scattered throughout the code, most  
notably in Chapter 10, where additional means-of-  
egress provisions are required in such buildings. We  
will highlight these provisions with a notation where  
they apply to our discussion or illustrations.  
Note that requirements for “Fire Service Access  
Elevators” for buildings more than 120' \(36 576\) in  
height are found in Chapter 30.  
•  
Note that the criteria for  
determining if a building is a  
high-rise is measured to the  
highest occupied floor, not  
to the height of the building  
construction, and not to an  
occupied roof.

The buildings must be constructed of noncombustible  
materials or of mass timber construction.  
Shafts and vertical penetrations must be enclosed to  
prevent the spread of smoke and fire.  
§ 403.3 requires that automatic fire sprinklers be  
installed throughout high-rise buildings.  
In Seismic Design Categories C, D, E, or F , a secondary  
water supply capable of supplying the required hydraulic  
sprinkler demand, including the hose stream requirement,  
for up to 30 minutes is required.  
§ 403.2.1 allows a reduction in fire-resistance rating  
if the automatic sprinkler system has control valves  
equipped with supervisory initiating devices and water-  
flow initiating devices for each floor. This reduction does  
not apply to high-rise buildings over 420' \(128 m\) in  
height.  
§ 403.4.1 requires smoke detectors connected to an  
automatic fire-alarm system per § 907.2.13.1.  
Where shafts have sprinklers installed in them at their  
tops and at alternate floor levels, the shaft fire-resistance  
rating may be reduced to 1 hour.  
This reduction does not apply to exit enclosure shafts  
or to elevator hoistway enclosures, or to any shafts in  
buildings over 420' \(128 m\) in height, whether sprinklered  
or not.  
§ 403.4.4 requires an emergency voice/alarm  
communication system to be activated with the operation  
of any automatic fire detector, manual fire-alarm box, or  
sprinkler device.  
§ 403.4.6 requires a firefighting command center per  
§ 911 in a location approved by the fire department.  
•  
•  
§ 403.4.8 requires standby and emergency power  
systems to be located in a separate room enclosed with  
2-hour fire-resistance-rated fire barriers and fueled by  
a 2-hour supply of on-site fuel. These power systems  
are required for the operation of systems necessary for  
evacuation or for firefighting, such as elevators, smoke  
control systems, emergency lights, and firefighting  
systems and operations. Confer with the AHJ to  
determine the Fire Code distinctions and requirements for  
standby and emergency power systems.  
§ 403.5.3 requires stairway doors that are locked from  
the stairway side to be capable of being unlocked  
simultaneously from the fire command center.

Per § 403.5.1, stair enclosures are to  
be separated by at least 30' \(9144\)  
or not less than 1/4 of the length of  
the maximum diagonal dimension,  
whichever is less. Where there are  
three or more stairs, at least two  
must meet this criteria.  
For high rises greater than 120'

at least two fire-service access  
elevators complying with § 3007.

HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Buildings greater than 420' \(128 m\) in height or  
in Risk Categories III and IV per Table 1604.5  
\(i.e., hospitals, large assembly high-rises, and  
essential services\) are to have hardened exit  
and elevator shafts per § 403.2.2. The hardening  
criteria are based on ASTM C1629/C1629M  
standards. Concrete or masonry walls are  
deemed to meet these requirements.  
Per § 403.5.2, a third egress stair is required  
for buildings other than R-2 occupancies  
greater that 420' \(128 m\) in height. \(Note the  
requirement is dependent on building height, not  
just for Occupancy Categories III and IV.\)  
Each sprinkler zone in buildings greater than 420'  
\(128 m\) in height is to have two fire sprinkler  
risers, with each riser supplying sprinklers on  
alternate floors.  
Note that per the Exception to § 403.5.2, a third  
egress stair is not required if occupant self-  
evacuation elevators complying with § 3008 are  
provided.  
\>120’ \(35 576\)  
•  
•  
There are additional requirements for high-rise  
buildings that are more than 120’ \(36 576\) in height\:  
In buildings of Type IV-A and IV-B mass timber  
construction, required fire pumps are to be  
served by water mains in two different streets.  
\[These dual connection requirements also apply  
to Type I buildings more than 420’ \(128 m\) in  
height.  
Such buildings are to have fire service access  
elevators per § 3007 as well as multichannel  
emergency voice communication systems per  
§ 907.2.13.3.  
SPECIAL DETAILED REQUIREMENTS BASED ON OCCUPANCY AND USE / 41 ATRIUMS  
Atriums are an innovative building type that  
require a specific building-code response. The  
code requirements in § 404 for atriums com-  
bine aspects of malls and high-rise fire and life  
safety provisions.  
As for covered malls and high-rise buildings,  
the code requires that a mixture of active and  
passive fire-protection measures be provided in  
atriums. Atrium buildings, however, rely more  
heavily on active systems for fire and life safety.  
•  
•  
•  
The exit travel distance through the atrium  
is regulated by § 1017.3.2.  
Buildings containing atriums must be fully  
sprinklered throughout the building. There  
are limited exceptions to § 404.3 for certain  
areas, but the basic design assumption  
should be that such buildings are fully  
sprinklered.  
Openings into the atrium may be glazed if  
special fire-sprinkler protection is provided.  
The code defines an atrium to be a verti-  
cal space that is closed at the top and con-  
nects two or more stories in Group I-2 and I-3  
occupancies and three or more stories in all  
other occupancies. The greatest concern about  
atrium fire and life safety involves the control  
of smoke. Atriums that connect more than two  
stories, other than those in Group I-2 and I-3  
occupancies, are required to have smoke man-  
agement systems conforming to § 909. These  
interconnect elaborate systems of detectors,  
fans, and controls to contain or move smoke  
to allow safe egress for occupants of atriums.  
Note that smoke control is required in atriums  
connecting two or more stories in I-2 and I-3  
occupancies.  
There is a special case not requiring smoke  
control for atriums open only to the bottom two  
levels. To qualify for this exception, two condi-  
tions must be met\:  
1\. All stories above the lowest two levels  
must be separated from the atrium with  
shaft enclosure protection per § 713.4.  
2\. Only the two lowest levels may be open  
to the atrium.  
•  
By definition, an atrium is an opening that  
connects two or more stories in Group I-2 and  
I-3 occupancies and three or more stories in  
all other occupancies. In other words, it is  
considered to be an interconnected series  
of floor openings inside of a building that  
create a physical connection and a common  
atmosphere between floor levels of the  
building. The code definition assumes that an  
atrium has an enclosed top.  
The description of an atrium is partly determined  
by what it is not.  
•  
A building wrapped around an open space  
creates a court, not an atrium.  
•  
Balconies in assembly areas or mezzanines  
do not create an atrium.  
•  
A series of openings through floors that are  
enclosed by a shaft such as an enclosed  
stair, elevator, or ductwork does not create  
an atrium.  
•  
Buildings with two or three levels of  
openings that meet the criteria for a covered  
mall may be more properly classified as mall  
buildings. The definitions of mall and atrium  
are mutually exclusive and are not intended  
to be interrelated.

§ 404.3 requires an approved automatic fire-sprinkler  
system be installed throughout.  
The sprinkler requirement does not apply to the portion  
of a building adjacent to or above an atrium if that  
portion is separated from the atrium with 2-hour fire  
barrier walls or horizontal assemblies, or both.  
Automatic sprinkler protection for the ceiling of an  
atrium is not required if the ceiling is more than  
55' \(16 764\) above the floor.  
§ 404.4 requires a fire alarm system complying with  
§ 907.2.14.  
§ 404.5 requires a smoke-control system to be installed  
in accordance with § 909 so that the atrium space is  
kept clear of smoke and can be used as a safe means of  
egress.  
Means to exhaust air for smoke-control system.  
§ 404.6 requires atrium spaces to be separated from  
adjacent spaces with 1-hour fire-barrier walls.  
Exceptions to § 404.6 allow escalators and stairs to  
penetrate horizontal assemblies when they are pro-  
tected with draft curtains and closely spaced sprinklers.  
Glass walls separating an atrium space from adjacent  
spaces are permitted if they serve as smoke barriers  
and can be wetted upon activation of automatic  
sprinklers spaced along both sides at 6' \(1829\) on center  
and installed between 4" and 12" \(102 and 305\) away  
from the glass. Only one side need be protected if there  
is no walkway on the atrium side.  
The 1-hour protection may be omitted for the adjacent  
spaces of up to three floors of the atrium if the spaces  
are included in computing the atrium volume for the  
design of the smoke-control system.  
§ 404.7 requires an emergency standby system per  
§ 909.11 be available to power the smoke control system.  
Two-story atrium does not require smoke control per  
Exception to § 404.5, unless the building houses I-1  
Condition 2 or I-2 occupancies where a smoke-control  
system is required at two or more stories.  
Per Exception 4 to § 404.6, fire barriers are not required  
where a smoke control system is not required.  
When the egress is not through the atrium space or  
the exit access travel distance occurs at the level of  
exit discharge, the distance is to comply with § 1017.2.  
Where the exit access travel distance starts at a level  
other than the level of exit discharge, § 404.9 and  
§ 1017.3.2.3 limit the exit-access travel distance to  
200' \(60,960\).  
Means to allow air in for smoke-control system as  
make-up air for smoke exhaust.  
SPECIAL DETAILED REQUIREMENTS BASED ON OCCUPANCY AND USE / 43 MOTOR-VEHICLE-RELATED OCCUPANCIES  
Building codes have traditionally had a great deal of  
difficulty classifying and addressing parking struc-  
tures and garages. There is a longstanding percep-  
tion among code writers that there are inherent  
dangers for vehicles carrying flammable fuels and  
emitting noxious gases. Yet buildings housing these  
types of uses have had a generally good safety  
record. Because of special concerns regarding these  
occupancies expressed in predecessor codes, § 406  
has grouped these uses into a separate category  
that can be considered a distinct occupancy group.  
Revisions to § 406 place all of the general require-  
ments for motor-vehicle-related occupancies into a  
single group at the front of the section. Items that  
are common for all the various uses covered by this  
section, and which used to appear in each subsec-  
tion, are now stated once in the various subsections  
in § 406.2.  
The common criteria are meant to apply to the many  
varied uses covered by this section\: private garages  
and carports; public parking garages, whether open  
or enclosed; and fuel dispensing stations and repair  
garages. Note that there are some special condi-  
tions in the subsections that will augment the  
general provisions discussed here.  
§ 406.2.1 Automatic Garage Door Openers  
and Automatic Gates  
This subsection highlights the broad range of appli-  
cations for § 406.2. These provisions are applicable  
to quite different uses, ranging from single-family  
home garages to multistory public parking garages.  
•  
All automatic openers are to be listed  
and labeled per UL 325. This is a safety  
standard for electric operators rated 600  
volts or less for doors, draperies, gates,  
louvers, and windows.  
•  
Private garage door opener  
•  
Public parking garage entry gate  
§ 406.2.2 Clear Height  
The clear height of each floor level in vehicle and  
pedestrian traffic areas in all motor-vehicle-related  
uses is to be not less than 7' \(2134\). Canopies under  
which fuels are dispensed are to have a taller clear  
height in accordance with § 406.7.2.  
Note that in parking garages serving van acces-  
sible parking, 98" \(2489\) clearance is required per  
Standard ICC A117.1, which is adapted into IBC  
Chapter 11.  
•  
Minimum of 7' \(2134\) clear in all

44 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS § 406.2.3 Accessible Parking Spaces  
Where accessible parking is required, accessible  
parking spaces, access aisles, and vehicular  
routes serving accessible parking are to be pro-  
vided in accordance with § 1106.  
Stall dimensions will be as required by Standard  
ICC A117.1.  
§ 406.2.4 Floor Surfaces  
Floor surfaces are to be of concrete or similar  
noncombustible and nonabsorbent materials.  
Floors areas used for parking are to be sloped  
to facilitate the movement of liquids to a drain  
or toward the main vehicle entry doorway. The  
surfaces of vehicle fueling pads in motor-fuel-  
dispensing facilities are to be in accordance with  
§ 406.7.1.  
Exceptions to § 406.2.4\:  
•  
Asphalt parking surfaces are permitted at the  
ground level in public parking garages and  
private carports.  
•  
Floors of Group S-2 open or enclosed parking  
garages are required to have a sloped  
surface. This requirement was absent for  
several code cycles and reinstated in the  
2021 IBC. We recommend a 2% slope to  
provide drainage and still meet disabled  
access requirements.  
•  
Slip-resistant, nonabsorbent, interior floor  
finishes meeting certain finish criteria are  
permitted in repair garages.  
§ 406.2.5 Sleeping Rooms  
Openings between a motor-vehicle-related occu-  
pancy and a room used for sleeping are not  
permitted.  
§ 406.2.6 Fuel Dispensing  
The dispensing of fuel is only permitted in motor  
fuel-dispensing facilities that are in accordance  
with § 406.7. If there are conflicts between  
§ 406.2 and § 406.7, the requirements of § 406.7  
are more specific to the proposed use and are  
to govern.

§ 406.2.7 Electric Vehicle Charging  
Stations  
This is a new section recognizing the increased  
presence of electric vehicles \(EV\). This is to  
address how to treat them, if provided. It does  
not require them. Where provided, electric  
vehicle charging stations are to be installed in  
accordance with NFPA 70 and are to be listed  
and labeled in accordance with UL 2202 and UL  
2594\. Accessibility to electric vehicle charging  
stations is to be provided in accordance with  
Chapter 11.  
§ 406.2.9 Equipment and Appliances  
Equipment and appliance requirements that  
were previously included with each motor-  
vehicle use have been consolidated into this  
section. Additional requirements are to be found  
in the International Mechanical Code and the  
International Fuel Gas Code.  
§ 406.2.9.1 Elevation of Ignition Sources  
Equipment and appliances having an ignition  
source and located in the uses covered by § 406  
are to have the ignition source elevated such  
that the source of ignition is not less than 18"  
\(457\) above the floor. For the purpose of this  
section, rooms or spaces that are not part of  
the living space of a dwelling unit and that com-  
municate directly with a private garage through  
openings shall be considered to be part of the  
private garage. Per an exception, elevation of  
the ignition source is not required for appliances  
that are listed as being flammable-vapor ignition  
resistant.

Private Garages and Carports  
Private garages or carports are for private use  
and meet the common definition of what we all  
think of as parking for housing. These are typical-  
ly considered Group U occupancies. Separation  
requirements are contained in § 406.3.2.1. Note  
that one- and two-family dwellings and their  
accessory structures such as garages are intended  
to be regulated by the International Residential  
Code.

Parking Garages  
§ 406.4 classifies public parking garages into open park-  
ing garages and enclosed parking garages.  
Open Parking Garages  
Open parking garages are multiple-vehicle facilities used  
for parking or the storage of vehicles where no repairs  
take place. These are typically classified as Group S-2  
occupancies. They are to be of Types I, II, or IV construc-  
tion per § 406.5.1. To meet this definition, the amount  
and distribution of openings are specified in § 406.5.2  
of the code. Because these openings are distributed in  
a manner that provides cross-ventilation for the parking  
tiers, no mechanical ventilation is required.  
•  
•  
§ 406.4.1 requires guards in accordance with § 1015.  
Per § 406.4.2, vehicle barrier systems not less than  
2'9" \(835\) high are to be placed at the end of drive lanes  
and at the end of parking spaces that are more than 1'  
\(305\) above adjacent grade. Vehicle barriers are to be in  
accordance with § 1607.10.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
§ 406.5.2 requires uniformly distributed openings on  
two or more sides for the natural ventilation of open  
parking garages.  
The aggregate length of openings on a tier must be  
at least 40% of the total perimeter of the tier. Interior  
walls are to be at least 20% open, with uniformly  
distributed openings.  
Although openings on a third side are not required,  
openings on opposing sides are preferred for cross-  
ventilation.  
T able 406.5.4 determines the allowable floor areas and  
heights of open, single-use parking garages for private  
vehicles according to type of construction. The grade-  
level tier is permitted to contain an office, waiting, and  
toilet rooms having a combined area of not more than  
1,000 sf \(93 m2\). Such areas need not be separated  
from the open parking garage.  
§ 406.5.5 permits area and height increases for open  
parking garages having a greater percentage of  
openings along a greater perimeter of the building and  
under specific conditions of use. MOTOR-VEHICLE-RELATED OCCUPANCIES  
Enclosed Parking Garages  
Enclosed parking garages are similar to open  
parking garages except that the amount of wall  
enclosure relative to the building area does not  
allow them to be considered as open garages.  
Because they do not meet the criteria for open  
parking garages and are considered enclosed,  
mechanical ventilation is required to compen-  
sate for the lack of cross-ventilation.  
•  
Means to get exhaust air out for

Motor-Fuel Dispensing Facilities  
These uses include motor-vehicle “service sta-  
tions,” which are typically freestanding struc-  
tures and are considered as Group M occupan-  
cies. Note the references to the Fire Code in  
which additional construction detail require-  
ments are contained.  
•  
Vehicles are to be fueled on a concrete  
surface or other approved paving with an  
acceptable electrical resistance level.  
•  
Canopies are to have a clear height of  
not less than 13'6" \(4115\) to the lowest  
projecting element of the canopy to allow  
vehicles to drive under the canopy.  
Repair Garages  
Repair garages are repair facilities not other-  
wise classified as motor-fuel dispensing facili-  
ties. The limitations on hazardous materials  
will dictate whether these facilities are con-

# Building Heights and  
# Areas  
As noted in Chapter 3, building designers almost invariably start a project with a given occupancy. After a building’s  
occupancy classification is determined, the code analysis task becomes one of determining what heights and areas are  
allowable for the occupancy classification, given various types of construction. Criteria for allowable building heights and  
areas are set forth in Chapter 5 of the IBC. Economics and utility generally dictate that buildings be built using the least  
costly and complicated type of construction that will meet the criteria set forth in the code.  
Two types of design choices typically impact the use of Chapter 5 for determining allowable heights and areas. The first is  
when the design of a given occupancy must provide enough area to contain the known uses. The second comes into play  
in speculative buildings built for economic gain. The goal in these facilities, such as office buildings or retail uses, is to  
maximize the allowable height and area using the most economical construction type.  
When addressing the question of maximizing the economically viable building size, the designer must use an iterative  
process to maximize the space for a given building. One must make assumptions regarding construction type and analyze  
the relative cost and return for various construction types before the owner can make a decision. This iterative process  
may also be used to maximize the economic efficiency of a building where the program size requirements are the primary  
consideration. In either case, the goal is to achieve the maximum area with the minimum investment in construction  
materials while still meeting or exceeding the code-mandated requirements to protect public health, safety, and welfare.  
The descriptions for the allowable heights and areas for buildings that are contained in Chapter 5 were completely reor-  
ganized in an earlier code cycle from the way they were presented in previous editions of the code. For those readers still  
familiar with the old table and methods presented in prior code editions, it is important to remember that this reorganiza-  
tion was NOT intended to make any substantive revisions to the heights or areas that would have been determined under  
prior codes. The reorganization was undertaken only to clarify and make more consistent how allowable heights and area  
are interpreted by code users and authorities having jurisdiction. There are no changes in the new code edition that alter  
the fact that using older height and area analysis methods will yield the same results as the newer methods for the same  
construction types.  
The organization of Chapter 5 in the code is based on a set of basic criteria that are then modified by mitigating factors to  
allow increases or trade-offs between heights, areas, construction types, fire protection, and life safety systems. Upon first  
reading, the tables in Chapter 5 may seem very restrictive, but they contain modifications that give the designer greater  
flexibility.  
In summary\:  
1\. The designer usually knows the occupancy classification of the building.  
2\. The program area is usually set either by program needs or by budget.  
3\. A construction type will usually be determined during schematic design.  
4\. Note that, as described in Chapter 2 regarding fire extinguishing systems, code requirements for fire sprinkler systems  
from Chapter 9 must be determined at this time to fully understand how to use the provisions of Chapter 5.  
5\. Since almost any building has a mix of incidental and accessory occupancies, and perhaps a mixture of occupancy  
classifications as described in Chapter 3, the provisions of § 508 must be carefully examined. DEFINITIONS  
As for other chapters, all definitions occur only in  
Chapter 2. Definitions applicable to this chapter  
are discussed below. The definitions have very  
specific code-related criteria that may differ from  
the colloquial meanings of the terms. They should  
be studied carefully for applicability when deter-  
mining allowable heights and areas.  
Height limitations for buildings contained in plan-  
ning and zoning regulations do not necessarily use  
the same definitions or criteria for determining  
heights. The definitions in the code are developed  
to facilitate uniform application of regulations.  
Read the documents that pertain to the regula-  
tions in question. Never apply building-code crite-  
ria to planning issues, or vice versa.  
Building area is usually considered to exclude the  
thickness of the exterior walls of a building. This is  
based on the language describing gross floor area  
as “the area included within surrounding exterior  
walls.” The wording seems to imply the wall is  
not a part of the area to be considered. Therefore,  
the building area is the area enclosed within the  
building and the area begins at the inside face of  
the exterior wall. Another real-estate term often  
used for building area is “gross building area,”  
which is typically calculated to the exterior side of  
the exterior walls. The most conservative way to  
calculate building area is to measure from outside  
face of wall to outside face of wall. This generates  
the most building area when nearing the upper  
limit of allowable area, which should never be  
challenged by the Authorities Having Jurisdiction.  
The definitions of “basement,” “grade plane,” and  
“building height” are correlated and based on the  
relationship of building parts below or above the  
grade plane as it is defined. Note that building  
height, as measured in feet, takes roof profiles  
into account. Building heights are measured to  
the average height of the highest roof, thus allow-  
ing for pitched roofs, varying parapet heights,  
and rooftop equipment enclosures. The height is  
calculated using different criteria than those used  
to determine the height of a building in stories.  
“Story” is intended to mean occupiable or usable  
space located inside the building contained by a  
floor below and a plane \(next story or roof\) above.  
Thus, this would exclude such unoccupied spaces  
as depressed loading docks. This definition is  
found with other definitions in Chapter 2.

52 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED—THE BASICS  
Building area is “the area included  
within surrounding exterior walls.”  
This is generally interpreted as  
meaning the inside face of exterior  
walls. See the commentary at left for  
a description of a more conservative  
approach to calculating building areas.  
Vent shafts and courts are excluded  
from building area, taking into account  
both the shaft’s wall thickness and  
the area inside the shaft as part of the  
excluded area.  
Areas included within the horizontal  
projection of a floor or roof above,  
even if not enclosed by surrounding  
walls, are included in building area at  
full value. Thus, roof overhangs can  
matter in area calculations.  
Basement is defined as what it is not.  
It is a story, but one that is “not a story  
above grade plane,” which term is  
defined in § 202. \(See facing page for  
an explanation of grade plane.\)  
If the finished surface of the floor  
above the lower level is more than 6’  
\(1829\) above the grade plane or if it is  
more than 12' \(3658\) above grade at  
any point, then that level is considered  
to be “a story above grade plane,” as  
defined in Chapter 2 of the IBC. DEFINITIONS

When an intermediate floor meets the criteria of § 505 and is  
considered to be a “mezzanine,” the floor level is not considered  
to be a “story” and it does not contribute to the floor area. Egress  
from mezzanines must comply with the applicable exit access  
provisions of Chapter 10.  
Building height is “the vertical distance from the  
grade plane to the average height of the highest  
roof surface.”  
The story height for the topmost floor takes into  
account the volume of the upper floor, but not  
projections above the roof. Thus, it is measured\:  
• to the top of sloping roof rafters or  
• to the top of ceiling joists.  
Note that parapets are excluded from the height  
definition, but pitched rafters are included.  
Story height is measured as the vertical distance  
from the top of one finished floor to the top of  
the next successive finished floor.  
This is a “story above grade plane” if the  
finished floor surface is entirely above the grade  
plane.  
For sloping sites, the grade plane is based on  
the lowest points within the area between  
the building and the lot line, or between the  
building and a point 6' \(1829\) from the building,  
whichever is smaller.  
Grade plane is a reference plane representing  
the average grade levels along the exterior walls  
of the building.  
Basement \(if it does not meet the definition of  
a story above grade plane\)\: To be a basement,  
the relationship between the lower floor shown  
and the floor above it must fail either of the  
following tests\:  
1\. Be more than 6' \(1829\) above grade  
plane, or  
2\. Be more than 12' \(3658\) above the  
finished ground level at any point.  
Mezzanine is an intermediate floor level  
inserted between larger floor plates. The area  
of a mezzanine is limited to one-third of the  
floor area of the space where the mezzanine is  
located. Floor areas greater than one-third of  
the space containing them will be considered as  
creating another story. Note that the definition  
language allows multiple levels of mezzanines.  
The mezzanine section calls out mezzanines  
and equipment platforms separately. § 505.3.1  
limits the aggregate area of mezzanines and  
equipment platforms to be no more than two-  
thirds of the area of the room or space where  
both of these elements are co-located.  
BUILDING HEIGHTS AND AREAS / 53 EXCEPTIONS TO BUILDING HEIGHT AND AREA LIMITATIONS  
§ 503.1.1 exempts low-hazard, high-bay spaces,  
such as mills or foundries, from the height and  
building area limitations in § 504 and § 506. This  
recognizes the special-process requirements for  
such uses as well as their limited occupant loads  
with little or no public access.  
§ 503.1.3 states that Type I buildings, permitted  
to be of unlimited height and area per § 504 and  
§ 506, do not require the mitigations for unlim-  
ited-area building imposed on other construction  
types by other sections of this chapter.  
§ 503.1.4 regarding “occupied roofs” is included  
in the code to recognize the increased use of  
building roofs for open space in urban areas.  
The occupancy classification of the roof is to  
be per the uses allowed for the story immedi-  
ately below the roof unless the building is fully  
sprinklered and an occupant notification alarm  
system is provided at the roof. The area of an  
occupied roof is not added to the area of the  
building as long as there is no roof above the  
uses or the elements enclosing the occupied  
roof area are less than 48" \(1219\) high and pent-  
houses or other enclosed roof structures comply  
with § 1511.

54 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED—THE BASICS  
§ 503.1 allows one or more “fire walls”  
\(defined and regulated by the provisions  
of Chapter 7\) to divide a single structure  
into a number of “separate” buildings,  
determining area limitations, height  
limitations, and type of construction.  
§ 503.1.2 states that multiple buildings  
on a single site may be considered as  
separate buildings \(see also § 705.3  
regarding assumption of an imaginary  
line between them\), or as a single  
building for determining building areas.  
For a group of buildings to be considered  
as a single building, the group must  
meet the aggregate area limitations  
based on the most restrictive occupancy.  
Means of egress must also be carefully  
examined when multiple buildings  
are treated as one. When multiple  
buildings are treated as one, the walls  
between them \(facing area C\) do not  
have to conform to the requirements for  
exterior-wall fire separation and opening  
protection per § 705.  
E.g., Areas of A + B must not exceed  
the single building area of the more  
restrictive occupancy. If Area C is open  
to the sky, it does not contribute to  
the building area. If Area C were to be  
covered, it would be assigned an area  
and the building area would thus be  
A + B + C.

The provisions for determining allowable heights  
and areas are based on several factors. The  
first question to be determined is the type of  
occupancy \(or multiple types in mixed-occupancy  
buildings\) present in the proposed building. The  
second is whether the building is to be sprin-  
klered or not. Next come determinations or  
assumptions about what construction type is  
desired or required for the proposed occupan-  
cies. The new organization of Chapter 5 uses the  
following abbreviations for conditions\:

standard.\]  
S13D is rarely used, so it is not anlyzed here.  
There are tables in the code that address heights  
in § 504 and areas in § 506. They are organized  
around occupancies and construction types, and  
the tables are separated to address only one  
aspect of height and area allowances in each  
table. The construction types are based on  
those described in Chapter 6, ranging from Type  
I fire-protected construction to Type V unrated  
construction. As in Table 601, “A” denotes  
construction that is “protected” with increased  
fire resistance and “B” denotes construction not  
provided with fire resistance protection or with a  
reduced amount of protection.

as general limitations. We will then examine in  
detail the allowable modifications contained in

There are now sets of mass timber wood

Allowable building height and building  
area, defined in Chapter 2, are determined  
by the intersection of occupancy group and  
construction type.  
As occupancy is usually determined before  
heights and areas, the table will typically  
be entered by reading down the list of  
occupancy groups to find the occupancy that  
fits the building design.  
Then, reading across leads to the allow-  
able building heights based on type of  
construction and whether or not the building  
is sprinklered.  
Note that the distinction between A and B  
categories of construction types is the level  
of fire resistance as described in Table 601.  
Category A is of higher fire resistance, thus  
Type A buildings of any construction type  
have higher allowable heights and areas  
than Type B buildings. Using the principle of  
classifying occupancies by degree of hazard  
and building types by fire resistance, the  
higher the level of fire and life safety, the  
larger and taller a building can be.  
Heights are expressed in two ways, both of  
which refer to defined terms. The first, in  
Table 504.3, is height in feet above the grade  
plane and is generally tied to fire resistance  
rather than occupancy. The second, in Table  
504.4, is height in stories and is tied to  
occupancy. For discussion purposes, the  
values from Tables 504.3 and 504.4 are  
combined here. Both sets of criteria apply  
to any analysis. That is to avoid having high  
floor-to-floor heights between stories that  
could generate a building complying with the  
allowable number of stories but exceeding  
the height limit in feet above grade plane if  
heights were not also tabulated.  
The illustrations starting on the facing page  
are taken from Table 504.3 to show the  
relationship of occupancy and construction  
type to allowable building heights in feet.  
The examples are chosen from building types  
typically encountered by designers with the  
construction types chosen to highlight the  
differences as one proceeds from Type I  
fire-protected construction to Type V unrated  
construction. Entries in the table represent  
allowable heights in feet, as adjusted for  
inclusion of fire sprinklers or not. ALLOWABLE BUILDING HEIGHTS  
§ 504 pertains to the determination of allowable  
building heights in feet and stories above the  
grade plane. As with building areas, building  
heights in feet and in stories are dependent on  
the occupancies to be included in the building  
and on the building’s construction type. The  
inclusion of automatic sprinklers in the building  
also results in increases in allowable heights in  
feet and stories.  
Heights are described in two tables. The first,  
Table 504.3, shows allowable building heights  
in feet only, based on occupancy type, construc-  
tion type, and sprinkler conditions. The second,  
Table 504.4, shows allowable building heights  
in terms of the number of stories, also based on  
occupancy type, construction type, and sprinkler  
conditions. The tables include all of the criteria  
necessary to determine allowable values for  
these variables.  
One looks in the tables under the chosen con-  
struction type, then reads down the chosen  
column to the occupancy in question and then  
makes a selection based on whether the building  
is sprinklered or not. The intersection of those  
variables in the tables gives the code user the  
allowable values for height in feet \(Table 504.3\)  
or height in stories \(Table 504.4\). There are not  
any adjustments necessary to the values in the  
tables for provision of sprinklers; those determi-  
nations are built into the two tables.  
Shown below is a graphic example of how Table  
504.3 applies to various construction types for a  
representative range of occupancies. This is only  
an abbreviated list.

BUILDING HEIGHTS AND AREAS / 59 MEZZANINES AND EQUIPMENT PLATFORMS  
Mezzanines and Equipment Platforms  
§ 505 considers mezzanines that meet the defini-  
tion in Chapter 2 to be part of the story below  
them. If they meet the criteria limiting their area  
to one-third of the floor below, then they are not  
considered part of the overall building area, or  
as an additional story. However, the area must  
be counted toward the overall “Fire Area” as  
defined in Chapter 2.  
Room Area  
Mezzanines are conceived of by the code  
as open areas set above other spaces in a  
room. The code makes an absolute-sounding  
statement that all mezzanines shall be open  
and unobstructed to the room in which they  
are located, except for a railing-height wall at  
the edge. The statement is then followed by  
numerous exceptions. The basic idea is that if  
the mezzanine is small in area or occupant load,  
is furnished with a clearly defined separate exit  
path, or has two means of egress, it may be  
enclosed.

Equipment platforms are not considered  
as a portion of the floor below. Equipment  
platforms do not contribute to either the  
building area or the number of stories.  
Where a room contains both a mezzanine  
and an equipment platform, the aggregate  
area of the two raised floor levels may not  
be greater than two-thirds of the floor area  
of that room or space in which they are  
located. The area of the mezzanine may not  
exceed the area determined in accordance  
with § 505.2.1.  
Mezzanines are limited by the definition in  
Chapter 2, which in turn refers to § 505, to  
one-third of the area of the space in which  
they are located. Such a mezzanine is not  
only excluded from the overall area but also  
from the total floor-area calculation for the  
room containing the mezzanine. Thus, a  
1,000 sf \(93 m2\) floor space can typically  
have a 333 sf \(31 m2\) mezzanine.  
Type I and II buildings housing special  
industrial occupancies get a bonus allowing  
the mezzanine to be up to two-thirds of the  
room floor area.  
Type I and II buildings with sprinklers and  
voice/alarm systems may have mezzanines  
of up to one-half the area of the room floor  
area. This increase is also allowable in  
sprinklered residential units.  
Mezzanines must be of habitable height,  
having a minimum of 7' \(2134\) clear  
headroom at the mezzanine level as well as  
in the floor area under the mezzanine.  
Enclosed portions of a room are not included  
when determining the size of the room in  
which a mezzanine is located.  
Mezzanines are required to have means of  
egress per the requirements of Chapter 10  
of the code. Where the common path of  
travel or the occupant load exceeds the  
limits in Table 1006.2.1, two means of  
egress will be required. ALLOWABLE BUILDING HEIGHTS AND AREAS  
Allowable Building Areas per Table 506.2  
As discussed, in code editions prior to 2015,  
Table 503 combined allowable building heights  
in feet and stories with basic allowable areas.  
Each of the sets of tabular values for heights  
and areas were then adjusted for sprinkler con-  
ditions and location on property. The code now  
breaks apart height in feet, height in number of  
stories, and allowable areas per level into three  
tables. It also includes modifications inside of  
each table based on whether the buildings are  
sprinklered or not.  
The allowable areas are determined per Table 506.2. This table  
shows allowable building areas based on occupancy type and  
construction type. It also shows areas based on whether the  
building is nonsprinklered or is a sprinklered single-story or  
multiple-story building. It is very important to realize that under  
the increase formulas, the “NS” \(nonsprinklered\) values in this  
table will be used in area-increase calculations, even for sprin-  
klered buildings. When doing a code analysis for a proposed  
building, it is important to note the allowable area values for  
nonsprinklered buildings based on anticipated occupancies and  
proposed construction types, so that you are able to insert them  
into the formulas from § 506.2 as described below.  
Combined Table 504.4 and Table 506.2  
The tables below and on the following pages show graphically the allowable areas taken from Table 506.2, based, as for heights, on the building’s  
construction type, occupancy, and whether or not it is sprinklered. This table also graphically combines the number of allowable stories from Table  
504.4 to represent the comparative heights and areas for the various combinations of the variables in the tables. This is a graphic tool to convey the  
use and implications of the choices for construction types for the various occupancies that may occur in a building. The intent of the code is that the  
determinations of the values from each table are made independently and then combined into a set of code criteria for design of the building. The  
following tables are only a sampling of the various combinations for different occupancy groups and cosntruction types.

BUILDING HEIGHTS AND AREAS / 67 ALLOWABLE BUILDING HEIGHTS AND AREAS  
Allowable Building Area Determination  
The allowable area of a building is to be determined  
in accordance with the applicable provisions of  
§ 506.2.1, § 506.2.2, and § 506.3, using the values  
from Table 506.2. The calculations for area increase  
changed dramatically from the way area increases  
were done under editions of the IBC prior to 2015.  
As noted, the increases for heights in feet and  
stories based on sprinklers and construction type  
are now built into the tables in § 504. For those code  
users familiar with the old calculation methods, it is  
very important to remember that the new methods  
are intended to yield the same results in terms of  
allowable building areas, and heights as well, as  
were allowed under previous editions of the IBC.  
Experienced code users may want to verify their  
calculations for allowable heights and areas using  
the new formulas against determinations for the  
allowances using formulas from the prior version of  
the IBC. This will help familiarize experienced users  
with the new methods while minimizing calcula-  
tion errors. We have presented here only the new  
formulas to avoid confusing new code users for  
whom such comparisons would not be helpful. This  
will also familiarize experienced code users with the  
procedures found in the new edition of the code.  
In the 2021 IBC, the calculation for frontage increas-  
es has also changed as described below.  
Frontage Increases  
§ 506 specifies that the areas set by Table 506.2 may  
be modified based on how much open space adjoins  
the building, including streets and open space. This  
is known as “frontage.” As in prior editions of the  
code, the equation numbering in Chapter 5 is some-  
what misleading. The values for frontage increase \(If\)  
are determined by using new Table 506.3.3 and then  
used in Equations 5-1, 5-2, and 5-3.  
The code allows for increases in allowable area  
when buildings front on steets and when there  
is separation distance from adjacent buildings or  
from property lines. The code uses two terms for  
describing the relationship of buildings to the open  
space around them. One term is “frontage,” which  
is undefined in Chapter 2. Every building must adjoin  
or have access to a public way to receive an area  
factor increase based on frontage. The frontage is  
also related to the overall perimeter of the building.  
The term “W” still appears in the code. W is related  
to a now-deleted equation but is intended to refer to  
the width of a public way or open space \(feet\) per  
§ 506.3.2.

Perimeter meeting criteria  
for frontage increase  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Public way per Chapter 2 with a  
minimum width of 20' \(6096\).  
Every building must adjoin or have  
access to a public way in order to  
receive an area increase. When  
a building has 25% or more of its  
perimeter opening onto a public  
way or open space at least 20'  
\(6096\) wide, the building’s area may  
be increased based on the added  
width \(W\) of the public way\(s\) and/  
or open space\(s\) and the extent of  
the building perimeter surrounded by  
them.  
The allowable increases were  
calculated as weighted averages in  
prior codes. With the 2021 edition  
Table 506.3.3 is introduced, showing  
how increases relate to the open  
space around the building.  
If = area increase due to frontage  
= 0.50  
from Table 506.3.3,  
based on 50% of building  
perimeter fronting onto open  
space that is 30' \(9144\) or  
greater in width. AREA MODIFICATIONS  
§ 506.3.2 Minimum Frontage Distances  
To qualify for an area factor increase based on front-  
age, the public way or open space adjacent to the  
building perimeter must have a minimum distance  
\(W\) of 20' \(6096\) measured at right angles from the  
building face to any of the following\:  
1\. The closest interior lot line.  
2\. The entire width of a street, alley, or public way.  
3\. The exterior face of an adjacent building on the  
same property. 20' \(6096\)  
The frontage increase is to be based on the smallest public way or open  
space that is 20' \(6096\) or greater, and the percentage of building perimeter  
having a minimum 20' \(6096\) public way or open space. In past editions, the  
code had a complex set of calculations of weighted averages for determining  
frontage increases when distances from buildings to adjacent elements were  
in the 20' to 30' \(6096 to 9144\) range. This has been replaced with a new table  
giving step values for separations in those ranges. When there is a range of  
values based on varying distances, the lowest value is the one to be used.  
See the example following the table. Note that interpolation is allowed when  
using Table 506.3.3. For buildings where more detailed calculations may yield  
a larger area increase factor, calculations based on the methods used in prior  
code editions should be considered to be proper interpolation methods.

If that is to be used for frontage increases.  
This is based on the language in § 506.3.2  
that states\: “The frontage increase shall be  
based on the smallest public way or open  
space that is 20 feet \(6096 mm\) or greater,  
and the percentage of building perimeter  
having a minimum 20 feet \(6096 mm\) public  
way or open space.”  
Centerline of public way  
70 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED—THE BASICS § 506.2 contains three formulas for calculat-  
ing area modifications. The formulas make use  
of the frontage increase allowable per Table  
506.3.3\. It is very important to keep in mind that  
while part of the area determination is based on  
whether the building is to have sprinklers, the  
“NS” value is to be used as well, regardless of  
whether the building is sprinklered. Be sure that  
for sprinklered buildings you do not duplicate the  
tabular values for sprinklered buildings; instead,  
use the NS values in the appropriate location in  
the equations.  
The first formula is Equation 5-1 from § 506.2.1,  
which is for single-occupancy buildings. This  
formula also applies to the area per story for  
multiple-story, single-occupancy buildings up to  
three stories in height. The basic tabular area  
is taken from Table 506.2 and is based on the  
construction type and sprinkler status of the  
building in question.  
For our example we have assumed a sprinklered  
B occupancy building of Type IIIA construc-  
tion. The tabular area is thus for a sprinklered,  
single-occupancy, single-story building with  
added increase for frontage based on location  
on property.

buildings and adds a factor for stories greater  
than three. Note that for this calculation, the  
area per Equation 5-2 is total area, not area  
per story.

BUILDING HEIGHTS AND AREAS / 75 MIXED USE AND OCCUPANCY  
§ 508 Mixed Use and Occupancy  
This section addresses four concepts that involve  
having more than one occupancy in a single  
building. They are\:  
•  
Accessory Occupancies \(§ 508.2\)  
•  
Nonseparated Occupancies \(§ 508.3\)  
•  
Separated Occupancies \(§ 508.4\)  
• Live/Work Units \(§ 508.5\)  
Per exceptions to § 508.1, the following are not  
considered mixed occupancies for the purposes  
of applying § 508\: occupancies separated per  
§ 510 and hazardous materials in separate build-  
ings when required by Table 415.6.5.  
Accessory Occupancies  
When the occupancy contains a distinctly dif-  
ferent ancillary use to the main occupancy of  
a building, and aggregate accessory occupan-  
cies do not occupy more than 10% of the floor  
area of the story in which they are located and  
do not exceed the area allowed for various  
nonsprinklered occupancies in Table 506.2, the  
accessory use need not be separated from the  
primary occupancy. Exceptions exist for hazard-  
ous uses or when required as an “incidental  
use” for dwelling units and sleeping units per  
§ 420\. It should be noted that “incidental uses”  
are regulated by § 509 and viewed as being part  
of the occupancy where it is located and not as  
a mixed occupancy.

Chapter 3 of the code.  
Accessory occupancy areas need not be  
separated from the primary occupancy  
if they meet the criteria of § 508.2.3 as  
described at left on this page.  
The allowable building area and height is  
to be based on the main occupancy.  
Separations are required for the  
following accessory occupancies\:  
Group H-2, H-3, H-4, and H-5 accessory  
occupancies are to be separated per  
§ 508.4.  
Dwelling units and sleeping units in I-1,

Mixed Occupancies  
When a building has a mix of occupancies that are  
each distinct or extensive enough to be considered as  
separate uses, each use is considered a separate and  
distinct occupancy. The mix of occupancies is addressed  
in several ways instead of being treated as accessory  
occupancies\:  
•  
1\. Nonseparated Occupancies  
For nonseparated occupancies, the entire building  
is regulated according to the most restrictive of  
the height, area, and fire-protection requirements  
for each of the multiple occupancies under  
consideration.  
There are some limitations on how nonseparated  
occupancy rules can be applied.  
• Per § 508.3.1.1, where nonseparated occupancies  
occur in a high-rise building, the most restrictive  
requirements of § 403 are to apply throughout  
the high-rise building.  
• Per § 503.3.1.2, where one of the nonseparated  
occupancies is Group I-2, Condition 2, the most  
restrictive requirements of § 407, § 509, and  
§ 712 are to apply throughout the fire area  
containing the Group I-2 occupancy.  
2\. Separated Occupancies  
Separated occupancies may require that an  
occupancy separation with a fire-resistance rating  
as defined by Table 508.4 be provided between the  
occupancies.  
Allowable Building Height and Building Area for Nonseparated Occupancies with M and A-2 Occupancies  
When using nonseparated occupancy  
criteria per § 508.3, uses need not be  
separated from one another or from  
the remainder of the building, but the  
allowable height, area, and construction  
type for the entire building is governed  
by the most restrictive criteria for each of  
the unseparated uses.  
Per exceptions to § 508.3.3\:  
H-2, H-3, H-4, and H-5 occupancies must  
be separated, even in nonseparated  
occupancies.  
Also, I-1, R-1, R-2, and R-3 dwelling  
and sleeping units must be separated  
from each other and from contiguous  
occupancies per § 420.  
•  
When using separated occupancy criteria  
per § 508.4, different uses may need to  
be separated from each other with a fire  
barrier, but the allowable height area  
and construction types for the building  
as a whole are determined by the  
requirements for each separate area.

BUILDING HEIGHTS AND AREAS / 79 MIXED USE AND OCCUPANCY  
Incidental Uses  
Uses or occupancies that are incidental to the  
main occupancy are not considered to have  
enough impact to warrant their classification as  
an occupancy. The structure or portion thereof  
must be one of the uses listed in Table 509.1.  
These uses are typically considered to have a  
higher level of fire or safety risk than the occu-  
pancies within which they occur and Table 509.1  
requires additional protection or isolation from  
the areas within which they occur.  
When the occupancy of a building contains  
one or more incidental uses as defined in Table  
509.1, the areas are considered part of the main  
occupancy but require fire-resistance-rated sep-  
arations from the rest of the occupancy accord-  
ing to the requirements listed in the table. These  
are seldom required due to the widespread  
prevalence of sprinklers in buildings. Note that  
separation requirements for incidental uses are  
not applicable to dwelling units.  
Designation of incidental use areas is limited to  
those uses listed in Table 509.1. Note that inci-  
dental uses do not change the occupancy group  
of the area where they occur. That is why they  
are called “incidental.”  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
The code notes in § 509.4.2 that even where Table 509.1  
allows just the use of a sprinkler system to protect an  
incidental use, barriers \(including openings\) around the use  
must be smoke-resistant.  
The code states in § 509.4.2.1 that “only the space  
occupied by the incidental use need be equipped with such  
a system.” This is less than the full sprinkler provisions  
of NFPA 13, but based on the code conflict resolution  
provisions in § 102.4.1, the code allows for a very limited  
system instead of requiring the sprinklers throughout the  
building or in surrounding spaces.  
•  
80 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED—THE BASICS  
The incidental uses listed in Table 509.1  
include those that carry an inherent risk  
of fire, such as boilers, furnace rooms,  
and certain types and sizes of storage  
areas.  
Fire barriers per § 707 or horizontal  
assemblies per § 711 should extend  
from the floor to the underside of the  
fire-resistance-rated floor/ceiling or  
roof/ceiling assembly.  
In some cases, an automatic sprinkler  
system may be substituted for the fire-  
rated separation, in which case the  
separation must still be able to resist the  
passage of smoke. The code states that  
where an automatic sprinkler system is  
provided to meet the requirements of  
Table 509.1, it need only be provided in  
the incidental-use room or area.  
Because § 509.4.2.1 only requires the  
sprinkler system within the incidental  
use area, such a limited sprinkler system  
will not qualify a building for such things  
as area increases that are granted for  
provision of sprinkler systems throughout  
the building. The layout of the code places Table 509.1 after  
the text for that section. Do not confuse Table  
508.4 regarding occupancy separations with the  
incidental-use Table 509.1.

506.2, and the other sections in Chapter 5. These exceptions apply only when  
all of the conditions in the subsections are met. These conditions are based  
on specific combinations of occupancy groups and construction types. These  
special provisions were code responses developed over time to meet construc-  
tion conditions found in the jurisdictions of the model codes that preceded  
the IBC. These special provisions will usually give the designer greater flex-  
ibility in meeting the requirements of the building program than will § 503.1  
alone. These conditions should be annotated in that table for reference by the  
designer to be certain that they are not overlooked when commencing design  
and code analysis.

Per § 510.2, parts of buildings shall be consid-  
ered as separate and distinct buildings for the  
purpose of determining area limitations, con-  
tinuity of fire walls, limitations on the number  
of stories, and type of construction when all of  
the following conditions are met\:  
The maximum building height in feet is  
per § 504.3 and measured from the grade  
plane for the building having the smaller  
allowable height.  
Allowed uses above the horizontal  
assembly\: assembly occupancies with  
fewer than 300 occupants and occupancy  
groups B, M, R, or S.  
The buildings are separated by a horizontal  
assembly having a minimum 3-hour fire-  
resistance rating.  
Where a vertical offset occurs in the 3-hour  
horizontal assembly, the vertical offset and  
supporting structure is to be 3-hour rated as  
well.  
Items such as shafts and stair enclosures  
through the horizontal assembly have not  
less than a 2-hour fire-resistance rating with  
opening protectives per § 716. \(There is an  
exception to § 510.2, which allows a 1-hour  
shaft above if the lower portion of the shaft  
is 3-hour fire-resistance rated.\)  
Limitations for the number of stories is  
determined for each building; thus, the story  
limitations for Building B start at the top of  
the 3-hour horizontal assembly.  
The building below the horizontal assembly  
can now be more than one story above  
grade plane.  
The building below the horizontal assembly  
is sprinklered per § 903.3.1.1.  
The building below the horizontal assembly  
is of Type I-A construction.  
Basements below grade plane are allowed  
in the Type I portion of the building.  
Allowed uses below the horizontal  
assembly have been expanded over the last  
few code cycles and now basically include  
any occupancy other than Group H.

# Types of  
# Construction  
The classification of buildings by types of construction has been a part  
of most model codes from their inception. The Uniform Building Code  
contained these classifications in the first, 1927 edition. Those famil-  
iar with construction will understand the basic distinctions between  
construction-type classifications.  
Definitions of building construction in the older model codes went into  
greater detail about construction materials for such elements as struc-  
tural framework and stair treads. The new criteria define the subdivi-  
sion of materials between “combustible” and “noncombustible” by  
their test performance under given conditions. This is a more precise  
definition, but more obscure for the casual code user who understands  
intuitively that steel or concrete are noncombustible materials versus  
how they perform in testing per ASTM E 119, Standard Test Methods  
for Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials. TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION  
The IBC classifies all buildings into five broad  
categories based on the fire-resistance capabili-  
ties of the predominant materials used for their  
construction. The five types of construction are  
given Roman-numeral designations, and prog-  
ress downward in fire resistance from Type I, the  
most fire-resistive construction, to Type V, the  
least fire resistive.  
The five types of construction classes are subdi-  
vided into two broad categories, A and B, based  
on the inherent fire resistance of the materials  
and the degree of fire protection applied over the  
structural members. “A” denotes “protected”  
construction and “B” denotes less protected con-  
struction. These are further subdivided according  
to the fire resistance gained by the application of  
protection to major elements of the construction  
systems. This fire-resistance rating is predicated  
on the protection of the elements from exposure  
to fires both from within the building and from  
adjacent structures.  
The tables in § 504 and § 506 correlate the  
five types of construction with the allowable  
heights and areas for buildings, based on their  
occupancy. The designer must work with three  
sets of dependent variables when making the  
initial code analysis. The desired occupancy  
and the desired building height and area will  
determine the type of construction allowable  
under the code. Typically, for most projects, the  
use \(occupancy\) of the building is a given and the  
design choices are made about which construc-  
tion types to use based on economics and design  
aesthetics.  
Table 601 defines the required fire resistance of  
major building elements for each type of con-  
struction. Note that Chapter 7 governs the actual  
materials and assemblies used in fire-resistance-  
rated construction. § 602.1 refers code users  
to § 703.2, which contains the criteria for fire-  
resistance ratings and fire tests. There is a direct  
relationship between occupancy type and num-  
ber of occupants to the construction classifica-  
tion. Higher occupant quantities, more hazardous  
occupancies, and occupants with special needs,  
such as children and the infirm, all require more  
inherent structural fire resistance or additional  
levels of active fire-suppression systems.

Designer will usually enter from  
the occupancy-group side of the  
tables in Chapter 5.  
•  
Intended occupancy and desired building  
height and area will determine the type  
of construction allowable under the code.  
For example, a Group B occupancy housed  
in a three-story building with 19,000 sf  
\(1765 m2\) in area per floor, assuming  
no increases for sprinklers or frontage,  
could be of Type III-B construction per  
basic height and area allowances. The  
building may always be built of “more fire-  
resistive” construction types to the left of  
Type III-B in the table. With the provision  
of sprinklers and the use of frontage  
increases, it may also be possible to use  
a “less fire-resistive” construction type to  
the right of Type III-B in the table. This is  
an iterative process.

The broadest distinction between the various  
types of construction can be summarized in

•  
Note that levels of fire resistance decrease from left to right and top to bottom of this table.  
Noncombustible Materials  
The principal elements of construction Types I  
and II are made of noncombustible materials.  
The Uniform Building Code defined “noncom-  
bustible” as “material of which no part will  
ignite and burn when subjected to fire” \(1997  
UBC § 215\). The IBC definition of noncombus-  
tibility is contained in § 703.3.1, and states  
that materials required to be noncombustible  
must meet the test criteria prescribed in the  
American Society for Testing and Materials  
\(ASTM\) Standard E136.  
Combustible Materials  
The elements of Types III, IV, and V construc-  
tion allow the use of combustible materials  
in varying degrees. Additional levels of fire  
protection can increase the fire-resistance rat-  
ing of these three types of construction. Note  
that construction types with mixed elements of  
noncombustible and combustible construction  
are considered combustible and are of Types  
III, IV, or V.  
•  
•  
•  
Noncombustible materials include masonry,  
concrete, and steel.  
Note that application of additional fire  
protection materials to the noncombustible  
elements of Types I and II construction  
yields higher Type I-A, I-B, and II-A ratings,  
above the basic II-B classification for  
unprotected noncombustible construction.  
There is no definition of “combustible  
construction” contained in the IBC.  
Technical dictionaries of construction or  
mining terms define it as “capable of  
undergoing combustion or of burning. Used  
esp. for materials that catch fire and burn  
when subjected to fire.” By inference these  
materials, such as wood and plastics,  
would be those that do not comply with  
the requirements for noncombustibility  
contained in ASTM E136.  
TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION / 85 PASSIVE FIRE PROTECTION

86 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
The principle of fire resistance is based on  
the desire to limit the spread of fire from\:  
• one building to another,  
• one area to another,  
• one floor to another,  
to prevent structural collapse.  
The requirements for the fire resistance of  
internal building elements are based on the  
theory of compartmentalization. The idea is  
to divide a building into distinct zones with  
barriers to retard the propagation and spread  
of fire.  
Table 601 specifies the required fire-  
resistance ratings of major building  
elements for the five types of construction.  
The fire resistance of building elements  
gives occupants time to leave the building  
in the event of an emergency and allows  
firefighters time to fight the fire by retarding  
structural failure for a designated time  
period. The categories of building elements  
are\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Structural frame  
Bearing walls  
Nonbearing wall requirements are noted  
in § 602, Table 601, and Table 705.5.  
Interior nonbearing wall and partition  
requirements are per Table 601. Exterior  
nonbearing wall requirements are per  
Tables 601 and 705.5.  
Floor construction  
Roof construction The classification by types of construction deter-  
mines the level of passive fire resistance that is  
inherent in the building’s structure and envelope.  
This is distinct from active fire-suppression sys-  
tems such as sprinklers. As we will discuss in  
Chapters 7 and 9, there can be trade-offs under  
the code between passive and active systems.  
The idea is to look at the building as a whole and  
provide a balance of fire protection to achieve a  
predetermined level of structural protection and  
occupant safety.  
It is important to remember that most building  
owners will opt for the lowest fire-resistance  
rating possible, as there is a direct relationship  
between providing fire resistance and cost of  
construction. The determination of construc-  
tion type usually entails an analysis of both the  
desired occupancy and the requirements for fire  
separation distance between buildings or parts  
of buildings. This helps determine the neces-  
sary minimum fire resistance of the building  
elements.  
The building official will examine the clas-  
sification assigned by the designer and make  
the final determination of classification. The  
building is to be looked at as a whole system  
and considered in the aggregate. § 602.1.1  
notes that although portions of the building may  
exceed the requirements for the type and for the  
building occupancy, the whole building need not  
meet requirements higher than those necessary  
for the intended occupancy.  
•  
Passive fire resistance results from the use of  
construction materials and assemblies that  
can be expected to withstand exposure to  
fire without collapsing or exceeding a certain  
temperature on the side facing away from a  
fire. Examining the Chapter 5 height and area  
tables discloses that the application of fire-  
resistive materials to construction materials  
can allow increases in the allowable heights  
and areas. This recognizes that combustible  
materials may be made more fire-resistive  
by the application of fire-retardant coverings  
to accomplish the goal of slowing the spread  
of fire and to extend the durability of the  
building structure in a fire. The application of  
passive fire-resistive materials can increase  
the durability of even noncombustible  
materials in a fire. Even steel or concrete,  
if unprotected, can lose strength under fire  
exposure.  
•  
•  
PASSIVE FIRE PROTECTION  
Active fire protection consists of  
fire-detection and extinguishing  
systems—piping connected to a  
suitable water supply and supplied with  
valves or sprinkler heads made to open  
automatically at a certain temperature.  
A study of the allowable height and  
area tables in Chapter 5 reveals that the  
provision of sprinklers typically allows  
for area and/or height increases for  
most construction types, independent of  
whether the construction materials are  
combustible or not, or are provided with  
passive fire-protection measures.  
TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION / 87 TABLE 601  
Table 601 specifies the fire-resistance rating  
requirements for the major building elements,  
based on a specified type of construction or con-  
struction classification. A building may only be  
classified as a single type of construction unless  
a fire wall divides it into separate structures,  
or it falls into the special provisions for mixed  
construction permitted under § 510.  
Required Fire-Resistance Ratings in Hours  
Even if some building elements satisfy the fire-  
resistance rating requirements for a higher type  
of construction, the building as a whole should  
be classified based on those elements that  
conform to the lowest type of construction that  
meets the minimum requirements of the code  
based on occupancy. Below is an abbreviated  
version of Table 601.

wall assemblies of Type III or IV construction with a fire rating of 2 hours or less. § 2304.11.2 allows  
the use of cross-laminated timber in exterior walls under certain conditions.

Under the previous model codes, elements  
such as stairways were also defined in terms  
of construction materials under the sections  
addressing types of construction. The new  
test-based criteria called out in § 1011.7  
state that stairways be “built of materials  
consistent with the types permitted for the  
type of construction of the building.” This  
new definition may lead to confusion when  
applied in conjunction with § 603, which  
allows the use of combustible materials in  
Type I and Type II construction.  
\*\*  
The footnotes to Table 601 contain essential  
information for the designer to consider  
when making design decisions and when  
reviewing Table 601 in conjunction with the  
height and area tables in Chapter 5, which  
correlate allowable height and building areas  
with types of construction and occupancies.  
The designer should read the footnotes  
carefully, as they contain notable exceptions  
and trade-offs.  
While it is important to understand the foot-  
notes to Table 601, the code user must use  
great caution when “reading up” from the  
footnotes to be certain that the provisions of  
the footnote apply to the specific building in  
question. The table should typically be read  
from top to bottom in the column that applies to  
the construction being analyzed.  
Footnotes a and b are worthy of note\:  
Footnote a\: Roof supports\: Fire-resistance rat-  
ings of primary structural frame and bearing  
walls are permitted to be reduced by 1 hour  
where supporting a roof only.  
Footnote b\: Except in Group F-1, H, M, and  
S-1 occupancies, fire protection of structural  
members in roof construction is not required,  
including protection of primary structural  
frame members, roof framing, and decking  
where every part of the roof construction is 20'  
\(6096\) or more above any floor immediately  
below. Fire-retardant-treated wood members  
are allowed to be used for such unprotected  
members.

Primary Structural Frame  
•  
The “primary structural frame” \[P\] is defined in  
§ 202 as including all of the following structural  
members\:  
1\. The columns  
2\. Structural members having direct connection to  
the columns, including girders, beams, trusses,  
and spandrels  
3\. Members of the floor construction and roof  
construction having direct connections to the  
columns  
4\. Members that are essential to the vertical  
stability of the primary structural frame under  
gravity loading \(emphasis added\)  
P  
•  
We construe description 4 to mean that diagonal  
bracing that does not contribute to the vertical  
stability of the rest of the primary frame under  
gravity loading is not to be considered part of  
the primary framing system. Thus, such items  
as diagonal braces designed to carry only  
lateral loads would likely not require the same  
fire-resistance rating as the primary structural  
frame, even if connected to the columns. This  
is a subject to discuss in detail with the project  
structural engineer and with the AHJ early in the  
code-analysis process.  
The other elements not making up the structural  
frame are covered by the requirements for floor  
and roof construction.

primary structure for floors.  
Footnote b\: The conditions in this footnote

This footnote has been revised to make clear  
that fire protection may be omitted from the

from roof framing and decking.  
Footnote c\: Allows the use of heavy timbers

“noncombustible” Type I or II construction.  
Footnote d\: This footnote is meant to remind  
the code user that other issues, such as  
corridor-rating requirements, may affect rating  
requirements for nonbearing walls. TABLE 601  
Footnote e\: This footnote advises the designer  
to compare the requirements of both Tables  
601 and 705.5 to determine the fire-resistive  
requirements for exterior bearing walls. It is  
possible that the requirements of Table 705.5  
will require a higher fire-resistance rating for  
an exterior wall than Table 601; in the event of  
overlapping requirements, the most restrictive  
is to govern per § 102.1. For example, a Group  
M occupancy in a Type V-A building located  
within 5' \(1524\) of a property line would require  
a 2-hour wall rating per Table 705.5 and only  
a 1-hour rating per Table 601. In this case the  
2-hour requirement would govern, as the code  
requires the most restrictive provision to govern  
per § 102.1. We also recommend examining  
§ 705 for additional provisions that apply to  
exterior walls.  
Footnote f\: This footnote refers the user to  
§ 704.10 for the fire resistance of the primary  
structural frame.  
•  
•  
Footnote g to Table 705.5 correlates the requirements  
for fire-resistance ratings in nonbearing walls with  
the allowances for the amount of wall openings as  
described in Table 705.8. Where unlimited openings  
are allowed per Table 705.8, the wall rating may  
be 0 hours. This typically occurs at a fire separation  
distance of 20' \(6096\) in sprinklered buildings.  
Footnote i to Table 705.5 allows unprotected  
exterior walls in R-3 occupancies of Type II-B or V-B  
construction.

TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION / 91 TYPES I AND II CONSTRUCTION  
The building elements of Type I and Type II  
construction are of noncombustible materi-  
als. As noted previously, the definition of  
noncombustible is contained in § 703.3 and  
requires meeting the criteria of ASTM E 136.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Type I-A construction, providing the  
highest level of fire-resistance-rated  
construction, requires passive protection  
for all elements of the structure.  
Type I-B construction is similar to Type  
I-A construction but permits a 1-hour  
reduction in fire-resistance rating for the  
structural frame and bearing walls, and a  
1/2-hour reduction for roof construction.  
Type II-A construction requires passive  
protection of all elements of the structure.  
Type II-B construction allows unprotected  
noncombustible building elements. This  
type of construction was described as  
“Type II-nonrated” in some previous  
model codes.  
Combustible Materials  
in Types I and II Construction  
The key to the use of combustible materials  
in a noncombustible construction type is  
understanding that these uses are ancil-  
lary to the primary structure of the building.  
The premise for allowing the use of these  
combustible materials is that they will be of  
limited quantity and used under defined con-  
ditions where they will not contribute in any  
large measure to compromising the desired  
level of fire resistance in the structure. As one  
can see, the rules for Construction Types I and  
II, while calling for noncombustible materials,  
allow for a number of exceptions when all the  
requirements are taken together.

THE BASICS  
§ 603 contains a list of notes specifying which  
combustible materials can be used in buildings of  
Types I and II construction.  
1\. Note 1 calls out allowances for the use  
of fire-retardant-treated wood for nonbearing  
walls and partitions, and for roof construction.  
2\. Thermal and acoustical insulation materials  
with a flame spread of less than 25 have  
ratings corresponding to Class A interior  
finishes per ASTM E 84. These indices may  
be higher, as noted in the exception, where  
insulation is encapsulated between layers  
of noncombustible materials without an air  
space.  
3\. Foam plastics are allowable if compliant with  
the provisions of Chapter 26 of the code.  
Note especially the provisions of § 2603.5  
regarding the use of foam plastics on the  
exterior of Type I, II, III, and IV buildings.  
4\. Most roof coverings have a classification of  
A, B, or C, so this should almost always be  
usable.  
5\. The code recognizes that combustible  
decorative and utilitarian interior finishes,  
such as wood floors, will be applied over  
the noncombustible structural elements if  
installed per § 804.  
6\. Millwork such as doors, door frames,  
window sashes, and window frames are  
acceptable.  
7\. Interior wall and ceiling finishes are  
acceptable if installed per § 801 and 803.  
8\. Trim installed per § 806.  
9\. Wood trim at or near grade level is  
acceptable where not beyond ready  
firefighting access up to a level of 15' \(4572\)  
above grade.  
10\. This note requires fire-stopping in  
wood floors in Type I and II construction per  
§ 805\. This is similar to Note 5.  
11\. The key item in this section is that the area  
in question be occupied and controlled by a  
single tenant. These provisions do not apply  
for multi-tenant spaces. Also, these partitions  
must not define exit access passages that  
could be construed as corridors for the use  
of more than 30 occupants. This note also  
recognizes that single-tenant floors can have  
partitions of wood or similar light construction  
if they are lower than 6' \(1829\) and allow  
standing occupants to generally survey the  
occupied space in the event of an emergency. TYPES I AND II CONSTRUCTION  
12\. Stages and platforms are defined in § 410 as raised  
areas used for worship, lectures, music, plays, or  
other entertainment.  
13\. See specifically the provisions of Chapter 14  
and § 705.2.3.1 regarding the relationship of  
fire separation to the fire-resistive properties of  
combustible wall coverings, bays, and balconies.  
Note also that plastic veneers are to comply with  
Chapter 26 of the code.  
Projections from exterior walls are specified in  
§ 705, and these too are related to the type of  
construction. § 705 in turn refers also to § 1405  
regarding the use of combustible materials on the  
exterior of buildings.

TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION / 93 TYPE III CONSTRUCTION  
Type III buildings are a mix of noncombustible  
and combustible elements, having noncom-  
bustible exterior walls and combustible interior  
construction. These building types arose in the  
U.S. at the end of the 19th century out of a  
desire to end the kind of conflagrations that  
struck congested business districts such as  
in Chicago. The buildings were designed to  
prevent a fire from spreading from building to  
building by requiring noncombustible exterior  
walls of buildings.  
•  
•  
•  
The construction materials on the exterior  
of a Type III building are required to be of  
noncombustible materials. Fire-retardant-  
treated wood is allowable in exterior walls  
where the required fire-resistance rating is 2  
hours or less. Table 601 requires 2-hour walls  
for Type III-A buildings; thus fire-retardant-  
treated wood is acceptable except where  
this is superseded by the requirements  
of Table 705.5 based on fire separation  
distance. This would only occur in Group H  
occupancies with a fire separation distance  
of less than 5' \(1524\).  
Type III buildings are considered combustible  
since the code allows their interior building  
elements to be of combustible materials  
and also to be of unprotected construction  
if allowed by the building height and area  
allowances based on occupancy.  
A very common example of a Type III-B  
building is the tilt-up warehouse. This building  
type has concrete exterior walls, with a  
wood-framed roof supported on unprotected  
steel pipe columns at the interior of the  
building.  
94 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS There is a new set of construction types in  
the 2021 IBC. Recognizing the development  
of new “mass timber” production techniques,  
the category of Type IV buildings has been  
greatly expanded. Per IBC § 602.4, Type IV is  
that type of construction in which the building  
elements are mass timber or noncombustible  
materials and have fire-resistance ratings  
in accordance with Table 601. Mass timber  
elements are to meet the fire-resistance-rating  
requirements of this section based on either  
the fire-resistance rating of the noncombustible  
protection, the mass timber, or a combination of  
both. Mass timber elements of Types IV-A, IV-B,  
and IV-C construction are to be protected with  
noncombustible elements applied directly to the  
mass timber.  
The old Type IV construction is now labeled as  
IV-HT for “heavy timber.” The requirements and  
code criteria for those previous Type IV buildings  
remain unchanged from previous code editions.  
We have chosen to introduce the new Type IV  
classifications in reverse order from how they  
occur in the code—Type IV-C is introduced first,  
then Type IV-B, and Type IV-A last. Because  
mass timber elements in Type IV-C construction  
may be unprotected, they can be introduced  
and illustrated more clearly without the partial  
fire-protective coverings required by Type IV-B  
and the full fire-protective coverings required  
for Type IV-A. In this way, the graphics for Types  
IV-B and IV-A construction can have more of their  
mass timber elements partially or fully covered  
with fire-protective materials.  
As noted, the size of buildings in terms of their  
height and area is related to the fire resistance  
of each level of Type IV construction. More fire  
resistance means a larger building in both height  
and area.  
TYPE IV CONSTRUCTION  
The code defines mass timber as structural  
elements “primarily of solid, built-up, panel-  
ized, or engineered wood products that meet  
minimum cross-section dimensions of Type IV  
construction.”  
Products in the mass timber family include\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Cross-laminated timber \(CLT\) is a  
prefabricated, engineered wood product  
consisting of three, five, or seven layers of  
dimension lumber oriented at right angles  
to one another and bonded under pressure  
with adhesive to form structural panels.  
Nail-laminated timber \(NLT\) is created by  
layering 2× dimension lumber on edge  
and fastening the assembly with nails  
or screws to produce a larger structural  
element.  
Dowel-laminated timber \(DLT\) is made  
by placing 2× dimension lumber on edge  
\(like NLT\) and friction-fitting together with  
wood dowels.  
Glue-laminated timber \(glulam; GLT\) is  
made by laminating stress-grade lumber  
with adhesive under controlled conditions,  
usually with the grain of all plies being  
parallel.  
Parallel strand lumber \(PSL\) is a structural  
lumber product made by bonding long,  
narrow wood strands together under heat  
and pressure using a waterproof adhesive.  
Laminated veneer lumber \(LVL\) is a  
structural lumber product made by bonding  
layers of wood veneers together under  
heat and pressure using a waterproof  
adhesive.

Type IV-HT \(Heavy Timber\) is that type of con-

combustible materials and the interior building  
elements are of solid wood, laminated heavy  
timber, or structural composite lumber \(SCL\),  
without concealed spaces or with concealed

shall be permitted. Interior walls and partitions  
not less than 1-hour fire-resistance rated or

shall be permitted.  
Type IV-HT buildings came about to address  
fire-safety conditions for traditional methods of  
building manufacturing and storage buildings,  
as Type III buildings did for office and residential  
occupancies. The type of construction used in  
Type IV buildings is known as “mill construction”  
or “heavy timber” construction. These buildings  
utilize heavy timber structural members and  
heavy wood floor decking inside exterior walls  
of noncombustible construction. Many of these  
buildings also have movable heavy metal shut-  
ters to close off exterior openings to prevent a  
fire outside the building from propagating into  
the building through unprotected openings.  
The criteria for “heavy timber” \(HT\) construction  
are based on the past performance of historical  
construction, not on the scientific rationales  
contained in ASTM E 136 and E 119. These  
buildings have a good empirical performance  
record in fires. The insurance industry promoted  
construction of these types of buildings during  
the late 1800s and into the 1900s to limit their  
fire losses.  
Type IV buildings generally burn slowly under fire  
conditions. The heavy timber members begin to  
flame and char at about 400°F \(204.4°C\). As the  
charring continues, it retards further deteriora-  
tion of the wood members by insulating the inte-  
rior of the wood members from the fire.

THE BASICS  
Per changes adopted in the 2018 IBC,  
cross-laminated timber may be used in Type  
IV-HT construction. The material is “cross-  
laminated timber” \(CLT\). It is defined as\:  
“A prefabricated engineered wood product  
consisting of not less than three layers of  
solid-sawn lumber or structural composite  
lumber where the adjacent layers are cross  
oriented and bonded with structural adhesive  
to form a solid wood element.”  
Cross-laminated timber \(CLT\) not less than 4"  
\(102\) in thickness complying with § 2303.1.4  
is permitted within exterior wall assemblies  
with a 2-hour rating or less. Heavy timber  
structural members appurtenant to the CLT  
exterior wall shall meet the requirements of  
Table 2304.11 and be fire-resistance rated as  
required for the exterior wall.  
The exterior surface of the cross-laminated  
timber and heavy timber elements is to be  
protected by one the following\:  
•  
•  
•  
Fire-retardant-treated wood siding at least  
15/32" \(12\) thick, or  
1/2" \(12.7\) minimum gypsum board, or  
A noncombustible material § 602.4.4.3\. Concealed Spaces  
Concealed spaces have historically been prohibited  
in heavy timber buildings. They are now allowed if  
they meet certain conditions. They may not contain  
combustible materials other than building elements  
and electrical, mechanical, fire protection, or plumb-  
ing materials and equipment permitted in ple-  
nums in accordance with § 602 of the International  
Mechanical Code. Concealed spaces shall comply  
with applicable provisions of § 718, which address-  
es fireblocking and draftstopping requirements in  
combustible concealed locations.  
Concealed spaces are to be protected in accordance  
with one or more of the following\:  
1\. The building must be sprinklered throughout  
and to be provided also in the concealed space.  
2\. The concealed space is to be completely filled  
with noncombustible insulation.  
3\. Surfaces within the concealed space area to  
be fully sheathed with not less than 5/8" \(16\)  
Type-X gypsum board.  
Exception\: Concealed spaces within interior walls  
and partitions having a 1-hour or greater fire-  
resistance rating complying with § 2304.11.2.2 do  
not require additional protection.  
≥ 20' \(6096\)  
TYPE IV-HT CONSTRUCTION  
•  
•  
•  
•  
A key element of heavy timber construction  
is that there are no concealed spaces in the  
building elements. This prevents fire from  
smoldering inside building elements and  
propagating unobserved. This is part of the  
system of this type of construction to prevent  
sudden structural collapse.  
Detailed requirements for heavy timber  
construction that used to appear in  
§ 602.4 have been moved and now appear  
in § 2304.11 with other wood construction  
requirements.  
Note that some fire separation criteria  
for heavy timber buildings are noted in  
§ 602.4, not in Table 705.5 as for other types  
of construction.  
Per § 602.4.4.4, where a horizontal  
separation of 20' \(6096\) or more is provided,  
wood columns and arches conforming to  
heavy timber sizes complying with § 2304.11  
are permitted to be used externally.  
Items inside concealed spaces must be non-  
combustible, except for building elements  
and electrical, mechanical, fire protection, or  
plumbing materials and equipment permitted in  
plenums in accordance with the International  
Mechanical Code. Concealed spaces shall be  
protected in accordance with one of the fol-  
lowing\:  
•  
•  
•  
Option 1\: Sprinkler the building and sprinkler  
concealed spaces. \(Not required within  
interior walls and partitions if 1-hour or  
greater protection is provided per the  
Exception to § 602.4.4.3.\)  
Option 2\: Fill concealed spaces fully with  
noncombustible insulation \(for the entire  
length of the concealed elements inside the  
space\).  
Option 3\: Apply minimum of 5/8" \(16\) Type-X  
gypsum board on the inside surfaces of the  
concealed spaces.  
TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION / 103 TYPE V CONSTRUCTION  
Type V construction is the least restrictive con-  
struction type. It allows the use of any materials  
permitted by the code. A typical example of Type  
V construction is the conventional light-wood-  
framed single-family residence.  
•  
•  
•  
104 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
Because any element of Type V construction  
may be combustible, the fire resistance of  
building elements is typically provided by the  
application of fire-resistant materials, such  
as gypsum board, to the building parts.  
Type V-A construction is protected  
construction and all major building elements  
must therefore have a 1-hour fire-resistance  
rating. The only exception to this is for  
nonbearing interior walls and partitions  
contained in Table 601.  
Type V-B construction is unprotected and  
requires no fire-resistance ratings, except  
Table 705.5 requires exterior-wall protection. 7  
# Fire-Resistive  
# Construction  
Fire resistance is the major factor in determining classification of construction types. Structural  
materials are broadly classified as combustible or noncombustible. By their nature, noncombus-  
tible materials provide greater resistance to fire. But even noncombustible structural materials can  
be weakened by exposure to fire. Materials that have capabilities to resist fire of a designated  
intensity for a length of time as determined by fire tests can be applied to structural materials to  
achieve required fire resistance. As we saw in the discussion of types of construction, there is a  
direct relationship between fire-resistance requirements by construction type to occupancy type  
and to the allowable number of occupants.  
The code recognizes two basic methods for providing fire-resistive protection to ensure life  
safety in buildings. These can be classified as either passive or active protection. The differ-  
ences between these approaches lie in the way they respond to the effects of fire on a building  
structure. Passive protection is built into the building structure and provides a barrier between  
the structure and the fire. Active protection such as fire sprinklers responds to fire by activation  
of systems to contain or suppress fire and smoke to allow the structure to remain intact for a  
longer period of time than without protection, thus allowing the occupants to escape. The code  
allows trade-offs between the provision of active versus passive fire protection. For example,  
the level of structural fire protection requirements may be offset by provision of fire sprinklers  
under certain circumstances in certain occupancies. Note that this may occur only under very  
limited circumstances.  
In this chapter, we consider code requirements for passive fire resistance; Chapter 9 discusses  
active measures of fire resistance. For designers and owners, the trade-offs between passive  
and active fire resistance are part of the design and economic analyses that go into deciding  
which systems are most suitable for a given project. The consideration of passive versus active  
systems is part of the iterative process of comparing occupancy and site requirements to allow-  
able heights and areas for various construction types. Again, as noted in previous chapters,  
design goals typically involve using the most economical construction type that meets the needs  
of the occupancy.  
The code recognizes the efficacy of trade-offs between types of construction and types of fire  
protection. It also recognizes that there are limits to the value of the trade-offs between active and  
passive fire-resistance as they relate to types of construction and uses. Where active systems are  
required by the code in relationship to given criteria, such as to increase heights and areas, then  
the provision of active systems in lieu of passive protection is generally not allowed. The idea of  
a trade-off implies a voluntary selection by the designer of how to provide the required degree of  
fire resistance. When code provisions otherwise require active systems, they are thus not avail-  
able to offset passive requirements. FIRE-RESISTIVE CONSTRUCTION  
Fire-Resistance Ratings  
The texts of the definitions are contained in Chapter 2.  
§ 202 defines fire-resistance rating as  
“the period of time  
a building element, component or assembly maintains the  
ability to confine a fire, continues to perform a given struc-  
tural function, or both,  
“  
as determined by tests or methods  
prescribed in § 703.  
“Building element” is defined as\:  
“A  
fundamental component of building construction, listed  
in Table 601, which may or may not be of fire-resistance-  
rated construction and is constructed of materials based  
on the building type of construction.  
“ The time-rating in  
hours indicates how long a building material, element,  
or assembly can maintain its structural integrity and/or  
heat-transfer resistance in a fire, and corresponds to the  
construction type designations in Chapter 6 of the code.  
§ 703.2 prescribes that fire-resistance ratings be assigned  
on the basis of a fundamental fire test promulgated by  
ASTM International \(formerly known as the American  
Society for Testing and Materials\) or Underwriters  
Laboratories \(UL\). For example, ASTM Test E119 exposes  
materials and assemblies to actual fire tests. UL 263  
is also listed as another set of criteria. The material  
or assembly being tested is installed in a furnace in a  
condition similar to the anticipated exposure—i.e., verti-  
cal for walls, horizontal for floors or ceilings—and then  
exposed to a fire of a known intensity. The fire exposure is  
governed by a standard time-temperature curve whereby  
the fire grows in intensity over a given period of time,  
reaching a predetermined temperature at a given rate  
and maintaining that temperature thereafter. The sample  
is then exposed to the fire until failure occurs or until the  
maximum desired duration of protection is exceeded. This  
determines the fire-resistance rating in hours for the mate-  
rial or assembly in question.  
•  
•  
Fire-resistive construction, whether  
passive or active, has two primary  
purposes.  
The first is the protection of the building  
structure. Where passive protection is  
provided, such protection is typically  
applied directly to structural members.  
•  
The second is the separation of spaces to  
prevent the spread of fire or smoke within  
a building and the spread of fire between  
buildings. The protection of spaces  
addresses fire or smoke impacts on  
larger-scale building systems such as  
floors, walls, and ceilings, as well as  
openings in these systems.  
•  
•  
§ 202 defines a fire area as the  
aggregate floor area enclosed and  
bounded by  
•  
fire walls and fire barriers; or  
•  
exterior walls; or  
•  
fire-resistance-rated horizontal  
assemblies of a building.  
Fire-resistance ratings are based on  
the performance of various materials  
and construction assemblies under  
fire-test conditions as defined by  
ASTM International or Underwriters  
Laboratories. Tests typically are based  
on assumptions about the side of the  
assembly where the fire is likely to occur.  
•  
The fire-resistance rating  
of building elements,  
components, or assemblies  
are to be determined  
without the use of automatic  
sprinklers or any other fire  
suppression system being  
incorporated.

106 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS § 703.2.1.5 allows exterior bearing-wall rating  
requirements to equal those for nonbearing walls  
when all factors such as fire separations and  
occupancy are considered. This section recognizes  
that fire resistance in exterior walls is concerned  
with stopping the spread of fire beyond the struc-  
ture as well as protecting the structure. Since the  
governing criteria for this condition is preventing  
the spread of fire outside the building, the code  
recognizes that there is no point in protecting the  
structure to a higher level than is required for the  
walls enclosing the space.  
§ 703.2.1.3 assumes that tested assemblies are not  
restrained under the definitions contained in ASTM  
E119 or UL 263. “Restrained” refers to the ability of  
structural members to expand or contract under fire  
conditions. Assemblies considered as restrained  
typically have a higher hourly rating with less appli-  
cation of fire protection and are thus attractive to  
use in design. However, the code requires that such  
assemblies be identified on the plans. The difficulty  
of designing and proving that assemblies are truly  
restrained very often outweighs any advantages  
gained in reducing the quantities of fire-protection  
materials used. We recommend that designers  
follow the lead of the code section and assume all  
assemblies to be unrestrained when determining  
fire-resistance requirements.  
Methods for Determining Fire Resistance  
While fire ratings are fundamentally based on the  
ASTM E119 or UL 263 tests to determine hourly rat-  
ings, § 703.2.2 allows designers to use several ana-  
lytical methods to demonstrate compliance with  
fire-resistive criteria. One method allows the use  
of ratings determined by such recognized agencies  
as Underwriters Laboratory or Factory Mutual. The  
code itself contains a “cookbook” of prescriptive  
assemblies in Table 721, which gives the designer  
a list of protection measures that can be applied  
to structural members, to floor and roof construc-  
tion, and to walls to achieve the necessary ratings.  
§ 722 allows the designer to calculate the fire-  
resistance of assemblies by combining various  
materials. This gives much greater flexibility to  
meet actual design conditions than does the very  
specific set of assemblies listed in Table 721.  
FIRE-RESISTANCE RATINGS  
§ 703.2.2 also allows engineering analysis based  
on ASTM E119 or UL 263 to be used to determine  
projected fire resistance. This typically requires  
use of a consultant familiar with extrapolations  
from data acquired from similar fire tests to predict  
the performance of systems without the time and  
expense of performing a full-scale fire test.  
§ 703.2.3 also acknowledges the testing measures  
prescribed in § 104.11, which allow the building  
official to approve alternate ways of meeting the  
code when new technologies or unusual situations  
are encountered. The reality of using this clause  
is that the building official will require testing  
or a consultant’s verification of the efficacy of a  
proposed fire assembly rating in order to grant  
approval to alternate fire-resistance systems. The  
designer will need to offer convincing evidence in  
some form to allow the building official to deter-  
mine if the proposed system is code-compliant.  
§ 703.3 defines noncombustibility in terms of test  
criteria. The characteristics that determine non-  
combustibility must not be affected by exposure  
to age, moisture, or atmospheric conditions. The  
code also recognizes that certain combinations of  
combustible and noncombustible materials may  
be considered as noncombustible if they meet test  
criteria.  
Chapter 7 analyzes various construction compo-  
nents and conditions in light of their fire-resistance  
capabilities. Once again, as in other chapters, the  
code sections take the form of statements and  
exceptions. The code is organized to move from the  
exterior of the building to areas inside the building  
and then to the structure. The first set of assemblies  
can best be thought of as planes, both vertical and  
horizontal, arranged around the structural system.  
These planes may be bearing walls and part of the  
structural system, or they may be curtain walls or  
interior partitions independent of the structure.  
Various interrelated conditions impact the fire-  
resistance requirements of the systems consid-  
ered. Openings \(and their protection\), location on  
the property, relationships of exterior walls facing  
each other \(as in courts\), separations of interior  
spaces by fire walls, vertical circulation, vertical  
openings, protection of egress paths, smoke bar-  
riers, penetrations by utility systems, the abutment  
of floor systems with curtain-wall systems, and  
fire-resistive protection of structural systems—all  
must be considered. We will explore each of these  
sets of requirements in the same order they are  
presented in the code.  
Per § 703.4, fire-resistance-rated glazing, when  
tested per ASTM E119 or UL 263 and complying  
with the Fire Barrier requirements contained in  
§ 707, may be used. Such glazing is to have a per-  
manently attached label identifying that the glazing  
is fire resistant and indicating its fire-resistance  
rating in minutes. Labels are to appear on the glass  
per the requirements of Table 716.1 \(1\).

FIRE-RESISTIVE CONSTRUCTION / 107 FIRE-RESISTANCE RATINGS  
Per the requirements for Type IV-A and IV-B construction, mass timber  
elements require additional fire protection by application of noncom-  
bustible protection over the mass timber. § 703.6 sets out the criteria  
for determining the noncombustible protection time contributed by  
such materials. The section allows either prescriptive compliance  
with performance criteria or demonstrating compliance by fire testing.  
The basic set of criteria is to test unprotected assemblies and pro-  
tected assemblies with added noncombustible protection. The time  
contribution for the added noncombustible protection is determined  
by subtracting the fire-resistance time, in minutes, of the unprotected  
assembly from the fire-resistance time, in minutes, of the assembly  
protected with the proposed materials and protection details.

struction, sealant or adhesive is to be provided to resist  
the passage of air where there are abutting edges and  
intersections of mass timber building elements that serve as

108 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS FIRE RESISTANCE OF STRUCTURAL MEMBERS  
§ 704 requires that the fire-resistance rat-  
ings of structural members and assemblies  
comply with the requirements for type of  
construction as set forth in Chapter 6 and  
Table 601. The ratings should be comple-  
mentary in that the structure supporting a  
fire-resistance-rated assembly should have  
at least the rating of the assembly supported.  
§ 704.8 prohibits inclusion of service ele-  
ments such as pipes or conduits into the  
fire-protection covering. This recognizes that  
such elements can conduct heat through the  
fire protection to the structural member and  
thus potentially compromise the time rating  
for fire resistance.  
§ 704.10 addresses the protection of struc-  
tural members located on the exterior of a  
building. The protection of such members is  
set forth in Table 601 and must be as required  
for exterior bearing walls, for the structural  
frame, or as required for exterior walls based  
on fire separation distance per Table 705.5,  
whichever is greater.  
•  
§ 704.2 and § 704.3 require individual structural  
members such as columns or beams to be fully  
protected on all sides for their entire length  
if they are required to have a fire-resistance  
rating. This applies to members other than  
columns that either support a direct load from  
more than two floors or a floor and a roof,  
or support a load-bearing wall or a non-load-  
bearing wall more than two stories in height.  
All rated columns must be individually encased  
regardless of loading conditions. Per § 704.4,  
these requirements also apply to “secondary  
members” that are required to have a fire-  
resistance rating.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Fire-protection materials, especially spray-  
applied fire protection, are subject to  
impact damage that could knock off the fire  
protection and compromise the fire resistance  
of the structural member. § 704.9 requires  
impact protection for elements subject to  
damage. The protection is to extend to a  
height of at least 5' \(1524\) above the floor.  
Where primary and secondary structural steel  
members require fire protection, secondary  
steel attachments to those structural members  
are to be protected with the same fire-resistive  
material and thickness as required for the  
structural member. The protection is to extend  
away from the structural member a distance of  
not less than 12" \(305\), or for the entire length  
where the attachment is less than 12" \(305\)  
long. Where an attachment is hollow and the  
ends are open, the fire-resistive material and  
thickness are to be applied to both the exterior  
and interior of the hollow steel attachment.  
The code recognizes that attachment elements  
project out from structural members and that  
reinforcing ties may be located closer to the surface  
of a concrete element than the main reinforcing.  
§ 704.6 and § 704.7 allows these elements to be  
closer to the surface of the fire protection than the  
thickness required for the main members.  
Secondary members can be fire-protected by a  
membrane or ceiling when they provide protection  
with a horizontal assembly complying with § 711.  
§ 704.2\. requires the full height of a column to be  
protected on all sides, including its connection to  
beams and girders, even if it extends through a  
rated ceiling assembly.  
Per § 704.2 Exception and § 704.4.1, studs and  
columns in light-frame construction can meet  
fire-resistance ratings with membrane protection.  
They must terminate at top and bottom plates or  
tracks so that they are encased by the membrane  
protection.  
§ 704.13 clarifies the requirements for sprayed  
fire-resistant materials \(SFRM\). These materials  
are typically applied by pressure-spray on steel  
members to achieve the required fire-resistance  
rating. The fire-resistance-rating duration is  
dependent on the thickness of the materials.  
The in-place performance of SFRM depends on  
it remaining in place during a fire so this section  
sets forth criteria for surface conditions of the  
steel members and for proper application to  
ensure that the materials will perform adequately  
under actual fire conditions. While it is acceptable  
per § 704.13.5 for the SFRM to have surface  
irregularities, it is not acceptable for SFRM to  
have cracks, voids, spalls, or delamination in the  
surface that would allow fire to penetrate the  
protection layer and heat the steel underneath.  
Note that per § 704.11, it is acceptable to have  
unprotected steel shelf angles if they span not  
more than 6'4" \(1931\).

THE BASICS  
§ 704.4.1 allows studs and boundary  
elements that are integral to load-bearing  
walls of light-frame construction to have the  
required fire-resistance rating provided by  
the membrane protection furnished for the  
load-bearing wall. Columns that are located  
entirely between the top and bottom plates  
or tracks are also permitted to have the  
required fire-resistance ratings provided by  
the membrane protection of the wall.  
§ 704.5 permits the encapsulation of an  
entire truss assembly with fire-resistive  
materials if the assembly has been tested,  
or is based on approved calculations based  
on such tests.  
This section can also be construed to  
apply to fire protection applied directly  
to individual truss members as well as to  
complete encasement of a truss.  
§ 704.6 permits attachments to structural  
members, such as lugs and brackets, to  
extend to within 1" \(25\) of the surface of fire  
protection.  
§ 704.7 allows stirrups and spiral  
reinforcement in a masonry or concrete  
structural member to project no more than  
1/2" \(13\) into the protection.  
Required protection depth The contents of § 705 apply more broadly than  
its title would suggest. The relationship to the  
property line of exterior walls as well as open-  
ings within and projections from the walls are  
covered in this section. The wall criteria also  
interact with the type of construction to dictate  
the fire resistance of the elements of the wall.  
This section should be read in conjunction with  
§ 1405, which governs the use of combustible  
materials on the exterior face of exterior walls.  
Exterior egress balconies are to comply with §  
1021, and exterior egress stairs are to comply  
with § 1027.  
Projections  
§ 705.2 governs the extent of allowable projec-  
tions according to their relationship to the prop-  
erty line. The combustibility of the projections is  
governed by the wall construction type \(which  
as we have seen is related to heights, areas,  
and occupancy types\). Combustible projections  
extending to within 5' \(1524\) of the line used  
to determine the fire separation distance are  
to be of not less than 1-hour fire-resistance-  
rated construction, heavy timber construction,  
fire-retardant-treated wood, or as required by

construction, balconies and similar  
appendages may be of Type V  
construction.  
FIRE-RESISTIVE CONSTRUCTION / 113 EXTERIOR WALLS  
Multiple Buildings on the Same  
Property  
§ 705.3 assumes that, when determining  
the protection requirements for multiple  
buildings on the same property, an imagi-  
nary line exists between the buildings or  
elements. The code does not specify that  
the imaginary line be located midway  
between the elements, so the designer is  
free to locate the property line at any point  
between the elements in question as long  
as the wall protection requirements are  
met based on the distance to the assumed  
property line. The intent of § 705.3 is to pre-  
vent the spread of fire by radiant heating or  
convection. The impact of these conditions  
may be diminished by distance or by wall  
treatments, such as having openings in one  
wall face a solid wall on the opposite side of  
the assumed property line.  
Where an S-2 parking garage of construc-  
tion Type I or II-A is erected on the same  
lot as a Group R-2 building and there is  
no fire separation distance between these  
buildings, then the adjoining exterior walls  
between the buildings are permitted to  
have occupant-use openings in accordance  
with § 706.8. However, opening protectives  
in such openings shall only be required in  
the exterior wall of the S-2 parking garage,  
not in the exterior wall openings in the R-2  
building, and these opening protectives in  
the exterior wall of the S-2 parking garage  
shall be not less than 11/2-hour fire protec-  
tion rating per § 705.3.  
Fire-Resistance Ratings  
§ 705.5 requires that the fire-resistance  
ratings for exterior walls be as prescribed  
by Tables 601 and 705.5. Based on the  
intent of the code to prevent the spread of  
fire from one property to another, when an  
exterior wall is located more than 10' \(3048\)  
from the property line, the fire exposure is  
assumed to be from the inside. When an  
exterior wall is located 10' \(3048\) or less  
from the property line, the exposure must  
be assumed to come from either inside or  
outside the building. This recognizes that  
another building may be built on the lot line  
on the adjacent property.  
\> 10' \(3048\)

•  
•  
Two or more buildings on the same property  
may be treated as separate buildings  
with an imaginary line between. Note  
that the distances from each building to  
this imaginary line need not be equal. By  
choosing the line location carefully and  
applying the rules consistently, one wall of  
a set of buildings relatively close to each  
other could have unprotected openings  
as long as the opposite wall was treated  
as required for being near the assumed  
location of the imaginary line.  
Projections on buildings located on the  
same lot with an imaginary line between  
them are to conform to the requirements  
regarding projections contained in § 705.2.  
The buildings may be treated as portions  
of a single building if the aggregate area of  
the buildings are within the limits specified  
in Chapter 5 for the intended occupancies.  
Per § 705.6 the exterior wall is to extend to  
the height required by § 705.11 \(parapets\).  
Interior structural elements that brace the  
exterior wall and are located outside of the  
plane of the wall are to conform to the fire-  
resistance rating requirements of Table 601  
for those structural elements.  
§ 705.5 specifies that exterior walls having  
a fire separation distance greater than 10'  
\(3048\) be rated for exposure to fires from  
the inside.  
Exterior walls having a fire separation

EXTERIOR WALLS  
The term “fire separation distance” is  
defined in Chapter 2. This is a concept that  
encompasses not just the spatial relationship  
of buildings to their site boundaries but  
to adjacent buildings on the same site as  
well. There is an interrelationship between  
building occupancy, construction type, and  
location on the site. These are dependent  
variables with each impacting the other as  
a building design develops. Fire separation  
distance is always to be measured  
perpendicular to the face of the building as  
illustrated.  
The fire-resistance requirements decrease  
with increasing distance between buildings.  
They also decrease in relation to decreasing  
construction-type requirements. Table 705.5  
also builds in assumptions about the hazards  
of occupancies relative to fire separation  
distances. The guiding principle is that  
increased distances offset the hazards  
presented by various occupancies. Distance  
also mitigates the reduction in resistance  
to external fires presented by less resistive  
construction types.  
The amount of opening area in exterior walls  
is governed by the area limitations set forth  
in Table 705.8. The opening protection levels  
are correlated between the wall protection  
requirements of Table 705.5 and the opening  
protection requirements of Tables 716.1\(2\)  
and 716.1\(3\). The designer must first  
ascertain the required fire-resistance rating  
of exterior walls to determine the required  
level of opening protection in the exterior  
walls. The designer can then determine  
the allowable amount of protected and  
unprotected openings in the exterior wall by  
using these two sections together.  
FIRE-RESISTIVE CONSTRUCTION / 115 EXTERIOR WALLS  
Openings  
While § 705.7 contains detailed calculations  
\(Equation 7-1\) for determining the fire-resistance  
rating of protected openings, we will focus on  
the simpler calculations contained in § 705.8  
and T able 705.8. These relate location on the  
property to the percentage of wall openings  
and whether the openings are protected or not.  
For windows in exterior walls to be protected  
they must comply with the opening protection  
requirements of § 716.  
Protected Openings  
Where openings are required to be  
“  
protected,  
”  
the code considers them to be protected per  
§ 705.8.2 if fire doors, fire shutters, and fire win-  
dow assemblies comply with § 716. Additional  
active fire-protection measures can also allow  
increases in the area of openings. For example,  
the provision of a fire-sprinkler system \(adding  
an active fire-protection system to passive mea-  
sures\) is built into Table 705.8 to allow more  
unprotected openings in sprinklered buildings  
under most conditions.  
15' \(4572\)  
Centerline of street  
Vertical Separation of Openings  
§ 705.8.5 regulates the vertical relationship of  
openings to each other. These requirements do  
not apply to buildings less than three stories  
in height, or when fire sprinklers are provided.  
Again, provision of an active system allows  
more freedom in determining whether passive  
systems must also be incorporated.

FIRE-RESISTIVE CONSTRUCTION / 117 EXTERIOR WALLS  
Vertical Exposure  
For multiple buildings on the same property,  
§ 705.8.6 requires the protection of openings  
in any wall that extends above an adjacent  
roof. This protection can be provided in various  
ways\: by distance, by opening protectives, or by  
protection of the roof framing and its supporting  
structure. The principle is one of reduction of the  
likelihood of fire spreading from one location  
to another. The buildings must be separated  
by a minimum distance, some method of fire  
protection applied to the openings, or the con-  
struction facing the openings must be protected.  
≥10’ \(3048\)  
•  
1-hour fire-rated structure

Fire protection of openings in exterior walls other  
than windows and doors must be addressed as  
part of the design as well. Expansion and seis-  
mic joints, wall and floor intersections, ducts,  
louvers, and similar air-transfer openings must  
comply with the detailed requirements of sec-  
tions discussed later in this chapter.  
118 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
•  
•  
•  
•  
§ 705.8.6 requires that openings have  
approved 3/4-hour minimum fire-rated  
protectives if they are\:  
•  
•  
less than 15' \(4572\) vertically above the  
roof of an adjacent structure on the same  
lot, and  
within a horizontal fire distance of 15'  
\(4572\) of the imaginary line between the  
structures.  
For spans perpendicular to the fire wall,  
the entire length of roof framing is to be  
protected since failure at one end would  
result in failure of the entire roof.  
Opening protectives are not required where  
the roof has a minimum rating of 1 hour for  
a minimum distance of 10' \(3048\) and the  
entire length of structural spans supporting  
the roof have a fire-resistance rating of not  
less than 1 hour.  
Buildings on the same lot and considered  
as portions of one building per § 705.3 are  
not required to comply with this section. Parapets  
§ 705.11 makes a general statement that para-  
pets shall be provided at exterior walls of build-  
ings. The purpose of parapets is to impede the  
spread of fire from one building to another by  
providing a barrier to fire and radiant heat trans-  
fer if fire breaks through the roof membrane.  
The exceptions that follow reduce or eliminate  
the need for parapets if any of the conditions  
are met. The list of exceptions becomes the  
code criteria, not the more general opening  
statement that parapets will always occur. Note  
that there may be extensive construction work  
involved to avoid a parapet. The converse is  
also true that the provisions noted in the excep-  
tion can be avoided by providing a parapet. The  
exceptions, where parapets are not required,  
can be summarized as follows. No parapets are  
needed where\:  
1\. The wall is not required to be fire-  
resistance rated per Table 705.5 because  
of fire separation distance.  
2\. The building area does not exceed 1,000 sf  
\(93 m2\) on any floor.  
3\. The roof construction is entirely non-  
combustible or of at least 2-hour fire-  
resistive construction.  
4\. The roof framing is protected against fire  
exposure from the inside, as illustrated to  
the right.  
5\. In residential occupancies, a fire barrier is  
provided by sheathing the underside of the  
roof framing, or the roof sheathing is of  
noncombustible materials for 4' \(1219\) back  
from the roof/wall intersection and the  
entire building has a Class C or better roof  
covering.  
6\. § 705.8 allows the wall to have 25% or  
more of its openings unprotected due to  
the building’s location from a property line.

—THE BASICS § 202 defines a “fire wall” as a fire-resis-  
tance-rated wall whose purpose is to restrict  
the spread of fire. To perform this function,  
a fire wall must extend continuously from  
the building foundation to or through the  
roof, and have sufficient structural stability to  
withstand collapse if construction on either  
side of it collapses. Fire walls can be offset  
in a building plan, but may not be offset in a  
building section.  
Structural Stability  
§ 706.2 requires that a fire wall have a struc-  
tural configuration that allows for structural  
collapse on either side while the wall stays  
in place for the time required by the fire-  
resistance rating. Walls constructed per the  
requirements of NFPA 221 will be deemed  
to comply with this section. Using a double  
wall is the clearest way to comply with the  
structural collapse requirements.  
The interrelated requirements of seismic  
design and sound control must be carefully  
considered along with the structural stability  
criteria, as all of these requirements are  
integrated into a project. This should be  
discussed early in the design process with  
the AHJ.  
Materials  
§ 706.3 requires fire walls to be constructed  
of noncombustible materials, except in Type  
V construction, where they can be of fire-  
protected combustible construction.  
Fire-Resistance Ratings  
§ 706.4 bases the required fire-resistance  
ratings of fire walls on occupancy. For most  
occupancies, fire walls are required to have  
3-hour fire-resistance ratings. Table 706.4  
allows 2-hour ratings in Type II or V build-  
ings for certain occupancies. Where different  
occupancies or groups are separated by a  
fire wall, the more stringent requirements for  
separation rating will apply.  
Horizontal Continuity  
§ 706.5 specifies that fire walls are to be con-  
tinuous horizontally from exterior wall to exte-  
rior wall, and extend at least 18" \(457\) beyond  
the exterior surface of the exterior walls.  
•  
•  
Per § 503.1, each portion of a building separated  
by one or more fire walls complying with § 706  
shall be considered to be a separate building  
when evaluating area limitations, height  
limitations, and type of construction.  
If located on a property line and thus considered  
to be serving as a party wall, the fire wall is  
not permitted to have openings. Note that this  
is different for malls. See § 402.4.2.2. This is  
also different for mixed ownership buildings per  
Exception 2 to § 706.1.1.

FIRE WALLS  
•  
§ 706.1.1 Party Walls. Any wall located  
on a lot line between adjacent buildings,  
which is used or adapted for joint service

with § 706. Party walls shall be constructed  
without openings and shall create separate  
buildings.

wall may be allowed to have a lower fire  
rating to achieve the overall fire rating  
required for the total set of fire walls when  
considered as a complete assembly of all  
of the walls.  
§ 706.5 requires fire walls to extend at  
least 18" \(457\) beyond the exterior surface  
of exterior walls. There are exceptions to  
this requirement, based on the provision of  
additional fire-resistive construction at the  
exterior wall to provide a barrier to heat  
and flame propagation.

The same principles for turning the fire separa-

at exterior walls apply to where fire walls meet  
roof construction. Roof construction is to be  
noncombustible, of fire-retardant-treated wood,  
or have fire-resistive materials applied on the  
inside to protect the roof framing. For design  
purposes, it is best to presume that this fire pro-  
tection of roof construction extends a minimum  
of 4' \(1220\) on each side of the fire wall when  
framing is parallel to the wall and the full length  
of the span when the framing is perpendicular

FIRE-RESISTIVE CONSTRUCTION / 125 FIRE BARRIERS  
Fire barriers are similar to fire walls but  
with simpler criteria. They are used to  
separate interior exit stairways from other  
egress components, to separate differ-  
ent occupancies, or to divide a single or  
mixed occupancy into different fire areas.  
Required fire-resistance ratings for fire bar-  
riers are determined by their use. Barriers

THE BASICS  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Fire barriers serve to separate interior exit  
stairways from other egress components, set apart  
different occupancies,  
or divide a single occupancy into different fire areas.  
Fire-resistance-rated glazing is permitted in fire  
barriers but must be tested and listed.  
Note that walls located on the outside of the building  
at rated enclosures may have a different rating  
than the walls facing the interior of the building.  
Exterior-wall and opening ratings are determined by  
exterior criteria per § 705 in concert with the opening  
requirements in § 716 and exit requirements of  
§ 1023.7.  
Fire barriers are to be continuous between floor levels  
and extend to abut adjacent interior or exterior walls.  
The intent is that the barriers prevent the spread  
of smoke or fire for the duration of the time rating.  
Penetrations and openings are permitted but must be  
protected to maintain the integrity of the barrier.  
Fire barrier should extend from the top of the floor  
assembly below to the underside of the floor or roof  
deck or slab above.  
Fire barrier should be continuous through concealed  
ceiling spaces.  
Supporting floor should have the same fire rating as  
the fire barrier supported.  
•  
Per § 707.6, openings in fire barriers are limited to  
156 sf \(15 m2\) and an aggregate width of 25% of  
the length of the fire barrier wall. The requirements  
for fire barriers are less stringent than those for fire  
walls. Several exceptions are allowed. Among them  
are\:  
1\. Openings are not limited to 156 sf \(15 m2\) when the  
adjoining floor areas have an automatic sprinkler  
system.  
2\. Openings are not limited to 156 sf \(15 m2\) or to 25% of  
the length where the opening protective is a fire door  
serving an enclosure for an interior exit stairway.  
3\. Openings are not limited to 156 sf \(15 m2\) or to  
25% of the length when there is a tested opening  
protective assembly that has a fire-resistance rating  
equal to that of the wall. Fire partitions are the next level of fire-resistive  
wall construction below fire walls and fire bar-  
riers. They typically have 1-hour fire-resistance  
ratings and are primarily used for separations  
between listed building elements.  
Fire partitions have the same relationship to  
exterior walls as fire walls and fire barriers.  
They also have similar requirements for pen-  
etrations, openings, and ductwork as for the  
other groups of partition types.

Smoke Barriers and Smoke Partitions  
§ 709 and § 710 treat smoke barriers as  
fire barriers, but with emphasis on restricting  
the migration of smoke. Smoke barriers are  
required to have a 1-hour rating with 20-minute-  
rated opening protectives. Smoke partitions are  
required to restrict smoke movement but are  
not required to have a fire-resistance rating.  
Openings in smoke barriers are to be pro-  
tected per § 716. There are exceptions for  
opposite-swinging and sliding doors in Group  
I-1, Condition 2, Group I-2, and ambulatory care  
facilities.

•  
Floor and Roof Assemblies  
§ 711 describes the requirements for floor/ceil-  
ing assemblies and roof/ceiling assemblies that  
require a fire-resistance rating. Their required  
fire-resistance rating is determined by their  
use. The rating is primarily determined by the  
fire-resistance rating based on type of construc-  
tion, as dictated by Table 601. When separat-  
ing occupancies or dividing a single or mixed  
occupancy into fire areas, the fire-resistance  
rating of the horizontal assembly must also be  
examined against the requirements of Table  
508.4 and Table 707.3.10.  
The criteria for penetrations of horizontal  
assemblies are more stringent than those for  
vertical assemblies, as the passage of smoke  
and gases vertically between floors of a build-  
ing is of great concern and is facilitated by  
natural convective forces.  
Where ducts are not required to have fire or  
smoke dampers complying with § 717, they  
are required to be treated as penetrations, and  
the spaces around the penetrations are to be  
sealed per this section.  
Horizontal assemblies have the same continu-  
ity requirements as for vertical assemblies.  
Penetrations, joints, and ducts are to be pro-  
tected as for vertical assemblies; refer to § 707,  
§ 712, and § 713.

130 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
Smoke barriers are intended to provide  
separations to prevent smoke migration.  
Smoke-barrier walls are subdivided into  
two categories for continuity in § 709.4.  
§ 709.4.1 addresses smoke barriers  
separating smoke compartments in uses  
such as hospitals and requires the smoke  
barrier to extend continuously from  
outside wall to outside wall or to another  
smoke barrier wall.  
§ 709.4.2 covers smoke barriers for  
smaller areas on a floor, such as an area  
of refuge or elevator lobby, and allows  
the smoke-barrier walls to terminate at a  
1-hour-rated fire barrier, another smoke-  
barrier wall, or at an exterior wall.  
Smoke barriers need to be continuous  
through concealed spaces unless they  
abut assemblies that will resist the  
passage of smoke, such as walls meeting  
fire-rated ceiling assemblies.  
Smoke partitions need not be fire-  
resistance rated.  
In 1-hour fire-resistance-rated floor  
construction, § 711.2.6 permits lower  
membranes to be omitted over unusable  
crawl spaces and upper membranes to  
be omitted below unusable attic spaces.  
Structural members or walls supporting  
a horizontal assembly must have at least  
the same fire-resistance rating as the  
horizontal assembly. There are limited  
exceptions to this requirement. Vertical openings through floors can allow the  
movement of fire or smoke between floors. This  
represents a clear hazard to life safety that must  
be addressed in the design of the building. The  
code addresses treatments for various types  
of vertical openings. One of these treatments  
is the enclosure of openings in shafts. This is  
covered in § 713. Other provisions for treatment  
of openings are contained in § 712. VERTICAL OPENINGS  
There are several items listed under § 712.1 that  
spell out requirements for vertical openings. The  
subsection numbers are as listed below\:  
1\. Openings completely enclosed by shafts  
and complying with § 713 are permitted.  
2\. Openings in residential units extending four  
stories or less need not be enclosed.  
3\. Escalators need not be enclosed in fully  
sprinklered buildings when a draft curtain  
and closely spaced sprinklers are provided  
around the floor opening. This exception  
applies for four or fewer stories except for  
Group B and M occupancies, where there  
is no limit in either of those cases.  
The opening dimension cannot exceed  
twice the size of the escalators.  
Where power-operated shutters with a  
rating of 1  
1/2 hours are provided at each  
opening, there is no limit to the number of  
floors that can be penetrated.  
4\. Pipe, vent, or conduit penetrations are  
to be protected at the floor or ceiling  
according to § 714.  
5\. Expansion or other floor and wall joints  
need not be enclosed, but they must  
be protected per § 715 as for similar  
penetrations. Joints are allowed in  
unprotected floors per § 712.1.5.2.  
6\. Ducts and air transfer openings are to be  
protected per § 717.  
FIRE-RESISTIVE CONSTRUCTION / 131 VERTICAL OPENINGS  
\(§ 712.1 items continued\)  
7\. Atriums that comply with § 404 are permitted  
in all but H occupancies.  
8\. Masonry chimneys need not be in a shaft, but  
concealed annular spaces must be fire-blocked  
at each floor level.  
9\. Openings that do not connect more than two  
stories are permitted, even in buildings not  
equipped with a fire-sprinkler system. Note,  
however, that any such openings must meet  
all of the protection criteria listed in this  
section to be permitted.  
10\. Parking garage openings are permitted under  
specified conditions per\:  
§ 712.1.10.1\: Ramps for automobiles in  
parking garages may be open when the  
criteria of § 406.5 and § 406.6, for open or  
enclosed parking garages, are met.  
§ 712.1.10.2\: A shaft enclosure is not required  
for elevator hoistways in open or enclosed  
parking garages when the elevator serves only  
the parking garage.  
§ 712.1.10.3\: A shaft enclosure is not required  
for mechanical shafts for exhaust or supply air  
in open or enclosed parking garages when the  
duct system is contained in and serves only  
the parking garage.  
11\. Openings connecting mezzanines and the floor  
below need not be enclosed.  
12\. Shaft enclosures are not required for exit  
access stairways and ramps that comply with  
§ 1019.  
15\. Skylights and other penetrations through a  
fire-resistance-rated roof deck or slab are  
permitted to be unprotected.  
The supporting construction shall be protected  
to afford the required fire-resistance rating of  
the horizontal assembly.  
Unprotected skylights are not permitted in roof  
assemblies required to be fire-resistance-rated  
for vertical exposure per § 705.8.6.  
132 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Shaft enclosures differ from fire barriers in  
that they typically enclose openings extending  
through several floors. Shafts are to be  
constructed of the same materials as fire  
barriers or horizontal assemblies, and the  
required ratings for shafts and interior exit  
stairways are usually determined by the  
number of floors they interconnect. Shafts are  
to be of 2-hour construction if extending four  
stories or more and 1-hour otherwise. When  
determining the number of stories connected  
by shafts, basements are to be included as  
stories, but not mezzanines. Shaft ratings are  
to equal those of the floor assembly, but need  
not be greater than 2 hours.  
The code requires that shafts not have mul-  
tiple purposes. Penetrations in shaft walls  
are limited to those related to the purpose of  
the shaft. For example, ducts serving occu-  
pied spaces should not run through interior  
exit stairways, but ducts supplying air to the  
enclosure may be provided as long as pen-  
etration protection requirements are met to  
maintain the fire rating of the enclosure.  
•  
•  
Note that fire dampers, smoke dampers, or  
fire/smoke dampers are typically required  
where ducts enter or exit shafts under  
most conditions. The integrity of the shaft  
is to be maintained continuously around all  
surfaces of the shaft.  
Per § 713.8.1, membrane penetrations at  
the exterior side of a shaft enclosure are  
allowed when in accordance with  
§ 714.4.2.

SHAFT ENCLOSURES  
Shaft enclosures should be continuous from  
the top of the floor assembly below to the  
underside of the floor or roof deck or slab  
above, including concealed spaces such as  
those above suspended ceilings.  
Vertical spaces within shaft enclosures  
should be fire-blocked at each floor level.  
See below for guidance on enclosing shafts  
at the top and bottom when they do not  
extend to the top or bottom of the building  
or structure.  
Shaft continuity and rating requirements  
at exterior walls are similar to those for  
fire barriers. Exterior walls serving as shaft  
enclosures must satisfy the requirements  
of § 705.  
Shafts must be fully contained. Thus, a  
shaft that does not fully extend to the floor  
below, or to the floor or roof above, must be  
enclosed at the top or bottom.  
The closure can be at the roof deck, below the  
highest level penetrated, with the same rating  
as the shaft walls, or above the roof with a  
rooftop structure compliant with § 1511.  
Shafts may be enclosed at the top or bottom  
with construction having the same fire-  
resistance rating as the last floor penetrated  
but not less than the required rating of the  
shaft.  
These enclosures must match the fire rating  
of the shaft wall. The designer must pay  
careful attention in these circumstances as  
assemblies respond to test fires of the same  
intensity much differently based on their  
orientation in relation to heat flows. It may  
not be possible to achieve equivalent ratings  
when a wall assembly tested vertically is  
installed horizontally. The code requires equal  
fire ratings as verified by testing in the actual  
horizontal or vertical orientation.  
Shafts may also terminate in a room related  
to the purpose of the shaft where the room  
is enclosed by construction having the same  
fire-resistance rating of the shaft enclosure.  
FIRE-RESISTIVE CONSTRUCTION / 133 SHAFT ENCLOSURES  
§ 713.13 addresses refuse and laundry chutes.  
The code recognizes that these shafts may inter-  
connect many floors of a building. Requirements  
are included to provide a shaft, but also included  
are requirements to separate the chutes from  
the rest of the building with 1-hour-rated access  
rooms on each floor and 1-hour-rated termina-  
tion rooms at the bottom of the shaft. Active  
fire protection is also required for these shafts  
per § 903.2.11.2.  
§ 713.14 requires that elevator, dumbwaiter,  
and other hoistway enclosures be constructed  
in accordance with § 713 and Chapter 30. The  
requirements for elevator, dumbwaiter, and sim-  
ilar hoistways have been moved from §713.14  
to Chapter 30, which covers elevators.  
•  
Refuse and laundry chutes must be  
separated from the rest of the building  
by 1-hour-rated access rooms at each  
floor level. These rooms are to be  
constructed as for fire barriers per  
§ 707 or horizontal assemblies per  
§ 711, or both.  
•  
§ 903.2.11.2 requires an automatic  
sprinkler system at the top of chutes, in  
their terminal rooms, and on alternate  
floors when the chute passes through  
three or more floors.  
134 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS § 714 requires that penetrations be protected  
to maintain the fire-resistive integrity of the  
assembly being penetrated.  
The governing criteria for penetration protec-  
tion systems are that they prevent the passage  
of flame and hot gases into or through the  
assembly. Penetration treatment requirements  
are based on the size and quantity of penetra-  
tions. The requirements for through-penetration  
fire stops call for tested assemblies meeting  
minimum criteria for resistance to the pas-  
sage of flame and hot gases. The basic criteria  
are that the required fire resistance of the  
penetrated assembly not be compromised or  
reduced. Certain limited penetrations by small  
pipes or electrical components of specified sizes  
are allowed by exceptions.  
Penetration firestop systems are given “F” and  
“T” ratings. An F-rating is related to the time  
period that a through-penetration firestop sys-  
tem limits the movement of fire through a rated  
assembly. This rating should be nominally equal  
to the rating of the building assembly where  
the penetration is located. A T-rating applies to  
any penetration, not just through penetrations,  
and measures how long it takes to raise the  
temperature of an assembly by 325°F \(163°C\)  
on the opposite side of the assembly from a  
fire of specified size. Since the 2012 edition, the  
IBC also addresses “L” ratings \(air leakage\) for  
penetrations of smoke barriers.

PENETRATIONS  
Penetrations are of two basic types. One is a  
through penetration that by definition passes  
through an entire assembly.  
The other is a membrane penetration that  
goes through only a portion of an assembly.  
Sleeves must be securely fastened to the  
assembly penetrated.  
Any space between the sleeve and the  
penetrating item, and between the sleeve  
and the assembly penetrated, must be  
protected by an approved fire-stop material  
or system against the passage of flame and  
hot gases.  
Fire-stop system for through penetrations  
must have an F-rating at least equivalent to  
the fire-resistance rating of the assembly  
penetrated.  
Concrete grout or mortar may be permitted  
to act as a firestop around steel, ferrous, or  
copper pipes, tubes, or conduits penetrating  
through concrete or masonry walls.  
As an example, § 714.4.2 limits the size  
of steel electrical boxes and requires that  
they be separated by a horizontal distance  
of not less than 24" \(610\), or by a horizontal  
distance not less than the depth of the wall  
cavity that is filled with cellulose loose-fill or  
mineral fiber insulation, or by solid blocking.

Joints and Voids  
§ 715 requires expansion, seismic movement,  
and construction control joints to be treated in a  
similar manner to penetrations. The goal is that  
joints do not compromise the fire-resistive capa-  
bilities of the horizontal or vertical assemblies  
where they occur. Joints in fire-rated assem-  
blies are to be fire-tested to match the assembly  
rating. Such joint assemblies are tested before  
and after movement to verify that the joints  
maintain their fire resistance after anticipated  
movements occur.

136 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
Through penetrations in a floor must be  
protected by an approved fire-stop system  
having both an F-rating and a T-rating of not  
less than 1 hour.  
The T-rating may be omitted if the floor  
penetration is contained within the cavity of a  
wall.  
Floor penetrations for sink, tub, or shower drains  
located in the concealed horizontal assembly  
space do not require a T-rating.  
Recessed lighting fixtures shall not reduce the  
fire-resistance rating of floor/ceiling assemblies  
required to have a minimum 1-hour fire-  
resistance rating. Fixtures are to be boxed out or  
tested for use in fire-rated assemblies.  
The annular space around a noncombustible  
item that penetrates only a single fire-  
resistance-rated floor need only be filled with  
an approved material.  
The noncombustible penetrating item may  
connect multiple fire-rated floors if limited in  
size per § 714.5.1.  
§ 714.6 requires that even non-rated horizontal  
assemblies have annular spaces filled to resist  
the free passage of flame and products of  
combustion.  
Penetrating items may connect no more than  
two stories if so treated.  
Noncombustible items may penetrate up to  
five stories if approved noncombustible sealing  
materials are used.  
§ 714.5.2, Exc. 7, allows the ceiling membrane  
of 1- and 2-hour fire-resistance-rated horizontal  
assemblies to be interrupted with the double  
wood top plate of a wall assembly that is  
sheathed with Type-X gypsum wallboard,  
provided that all penetrating items through the  
double top plates are protected as through-  
penetrations per § 714.5.1.1 or § 714.5.1.2 and  
the ceiling membrane is tight to the top plates.  
Expansion joints are to have fire-resistance as  
for other penetrations.  
Joints at the intersection of floor assemblies  
and exterior curtain walls are included in § 715.  
These intersections are to be sealed with  
approved materials tested for such applications.  
The materials are to be installed to prevent  
the spread of flame and hot gases at the  
intersection. § 716 addresses the requirements for protec-  
tion of openings in fire-resistance rated walls.  
The openings may be either doors or glazed  
openings \(windows\). A glazed opening may  
occur in either a wall or within a door. It is  
permissible to have openings in fire-resistance  
rated walls, but the protection provided at the  
opening must provide some specified level of  
fire resistance so that the fire resistance of the  
wall is not compromised by the presence of the  
opening. Clearly doors are required to get into  
spaces, including rated exits. Also, it is often  
desired that vision panels occur in doors, or  
that windows occur in rated walls. This section  
provides the requirements for the various types  
of “opening protectives” that may be used in  
various circumstances.  
The requirements of § 716 for the protection  
of openings in fire-resistive construction often  
allow the opening protectives to have lower  
ratings than those for the wall where they  
are located. For example, a 2-hour-rated fire  
wall typically requires a 11⁄2-hour-rated opening  
protection assembly. Opening protectives are  
typically tested assemblies, so the designer can  
select compliant protection assemblies based  
on their tested performance.  
Fire-rated glazing is a defined term in § 202. The  
definition contains two other defined terms. The  
first is “fire protection rating,” which is defined  
as “The period of time that an opening protec-  
tive will maintain the ability to confine a fire…”  
The second term is “fire-resistance rating,” the  
relevant portion of which is “The period of time  
a building element, component or assembly  
maintains the ability to confine a fire…” These  
terms allow the use of glazing that can either be  
tested as an opening protective or be of more  
robust transparent or translucent fire-resistant  
materials, such as ceramics or glass block that  
are tested as building materials and not just as  
glazing.  
Glazing materials are often tested and rated  
to a higher degree of protection than the code  
requires for a given situation. The code allows  
the use of glazing that exceeds the minimum  
requirements as long as the assembly meets the  
applicable minimum requirements as well. For  
example, glazing may meet the hose stream test  
when it is not needed, but such glazing would  
also need to meet the applicable time limits for  
fire-rated glazing.  
OPENING PROTECTIVES  
•  
The code typically requires that opening  
protectives, including fire doors and  
glazing materials, be labeled for test  
compliance and for their fire rating.  
•  
Tables 716.1\(2\) and 716.1\(3\) specify  
the minimum opening protective fire-  
protection ratings, in hours, based on\:  
• type of assembly  
• required assembly rating  
•  
Glazing materials are to have markings  
on the materials to allow identification  
of which criteria the material was tested  
for. Table 716.1\(1\) lists the various criteria  
for marking fire-rated glazing assemblies.  
The requirements of this table are used in  
Table 716.1\(2\), which lists assemblies for  
opening fire protection. Our commentary  
on Table 716.1\(1\) is shown below\:

FIRE-RESISTIVE CONSTRUCTION / 137 OPENING PROTECTIVES  
Fire doors are to be self-closing. They typically  
require a latch as well. These requirements are  
based on maintaining the integrity of the assem-  
bly where the fire door is located. The doors  
should be closed under most circumstances and  
latched to prevent them from being forced open  
by air currents generated by fire.  
Fire-rated glazing may also occur at exterior walls  
where dictated by fire separation distances. Fire  
ratings of window protection at exterior walls  
requiring more than a 1-hour rating per Table  
705.5 must be at least 11⁄2 hours. Other window  
openings where a 1-hour rating is required may  
have a 3⁄4-hour rating. Where window-opening  
protection is required in otherwise unrated walls  
by proximity of building elements or for vertical  
or lateral exposure per § 705.8.5 or 705.8.6, the  
windows must have a fire-resistance rating of at  
least 3⁄4 hour.

—THE BASICS DUCTS AND AIR TRANSFER OPENINGS  
Ducts and air-transfer openings going through  
fire-rated assemblies must be treated in some  
way to prevent compromising the fire resis-  
tance of the assemblies that the ducts pass  
through. Note also that there are some duct  
penetration provisions in this section that  
apply to ducts in floor assemblies that are not  
fire-resistance-rated. Ducts without damp-  
ers are treated as penetrations per § 714.  
Where ducts must remain operational during  
a fire or smoke emergency—for example, in  
an atrium smoke-control system—they can-  
not have dampers. Alternate protection must  
be provided to maintain the integrity of fire  
protectives. Fire and smoke dampers must be  
tested and listed assemblies. Dampers must  
be provided with access for maintenance,  
testing, and resetting the assemblies when  
they close. These access panels must not  
compromise the fire rating of the fire assem-  
bly where they are located.  
The fire-resistive requirements for fire and  
smoke dampers are based on the type of  
assembly penetrated. Requirements are  
stated in the familiar pattern of basic require-  
ments followed by exceptions. The assembly  
types are organized in the same hierarchy as  
in other parts of this chapter.  
•  
•  
•  
Fire dampers are listed mechanical devices  
installed in ducts and air-transfer openings  
and designed to close automatically on  
detection of heat to restrict the passage of  
flame.  
Smoke dampers are similar to fire dampers  
but are intended to resist the passage of  
air and smoke. They are controlled either  
by a smoke-detection system or by a  
remote-control station.  
Both fire and smoke dampers require  
access for inspection and maintenance.  
The access panels must not compromise  
the integrity of the fire-resistant assembly.  
•  
•  
Fire Walls\: § 717.5.1 requires ducts that  
penetrate fire walls be provided with fire  
dampers per the exception to § 706.11.  
Fire Barriers\: § 717.5.2 requires fire dampers  
where ducts or air transfer openings  
penetrate fire barriers. The exceptions to this  
requirement are\:  
1\. The penetrations are listed in accordance  
with ASTM E119 or UL 263 as part of  
the fire-resistance-rated assembly.  
2\. The ducts are part of a smoke-control  
system.  
3\. The HVAC system is ducted, the  
wall is rated at 1 hour or less, the  
building is not an H occupancy  
and is fully sprinklered.  
•  
•  
22" \(559\)  
•

•  
The opening language of § 717.5.3 states that shaft  
enclosures that are permitted to be penetrated by  
ducts and air transfer openings are to be protected  
with fire and smoke dampers.  
The exceptions then go on to state that fire and  
smoke dampers are not required where\:  
1.1 The duct turns up 22" \(559\) in exhaust ducts in  
the direction of a continuous upward air flow.  
1.2 The penetrations are listed in accordance  
with ASTM E119 or UL 263 as part of the fire-  
resistance-rated assembly.  
1.3 The ducts are part of a smoke-control system.  
1.4 The penetrations are in a parking garage shaft  
separated from other shafts by not less than  
2-hour construction.  
2\. In Group B and R occupancies with automatic  
sprinkler systems for kitchen, bath, and toilet  
room exhausts enclosed in steel ducts that  
extend vertically 22" \(559\) in the shaft, and  
have an exhaust fan at the upper termination  
of the shaft to maintain a continuous upward  
air flow.  
Fire Partitions\: § 717.5.4 requires duct penetrations  
in fire partitions to have fire dampers except in the  
following conditions\:  
1\. The partitions penetrated are corridor walls in  
buildings with sprinkler systems.  
2\. Tenant partitions in malls.  
3\. The ducts are steel, less than 100 square inches  
\(0.06 m2\) in cross-section, do not connect the  
corridor with other spaces, are above a ceiling,  
and do not have a wall register in the fire-  
resistance-rated wall.  
4\. Ducted systems with min. 26 ga. steel ducts may  
penetrate walls of 1-hour or less fire-resistance  
rating in sprinklered buildings.  
Corridors\: § 717.5.4.1 requires smoke dampers at  
corridors except where\:  
1\. There is a smoke-control system.  
2\. The duct is steel and passes through the corridor  
with no openings into it.  
Smoke Barriers\: § 717.5.5 requires that smoke  
dampers be provided when a duct penetrates a  
smoke barrier except when the duct is steel and  
serves only a single smoke compartment.  
At “tunnel corridors” provided per Exception 3 to  
§ 708.4, if air is supplied to the corridor, a “corridor  
damper” is to be provided at the duct penetration  
in the ceiling per § 717.5.4.1.  
FIRE-RESISTIVE CONSTRUCTION / 139 CONCEALED SPACES  
Fire can spread rapidly inside concealed spac-  
es in combustible construction if the spread of  
fire or movement of hot gases is not restricted.  
§ 718 sets out requirements for fireblocking  
and draftstopping. Note that these provisions  
apply only to concealed locations in com-  
bustible construction or in areas containing  
combustible construction.  
The purpose of each requirement is to restrict  
or eliminate the spread of fire or the move-  
ment of hot gases in order to prevent the  
spread of fire within concealed spaces. These  
criteria typically apply to buildings with com-  
bustible construction, but they also apply  
where combustible decorative materials or  
flooring is installed in buildings of noncom-  
bustible construction.  
Sprinklers are often a mitigation measure for  
draftstopping of concealed spaces. However,  
note that in such circumstances the concealed  
spaces must usually be sprinklered as well as  
the occupied spaces.  
Combustible construction materials are not  
allowed in concealed spaces in Type I or II  
buildings except when permitted by § 603,  
when Class A finish materials are used,  
or where combustible piping is installed in  
accordance with the International Mechanical  
and Plumbing Code.

140 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
“Fireblocking  
” is the term used for the  
provision of materials of construction to  
restrict the free passage of flame through  
concealed spaces to other parts of a  
building.  
§ 718.2.1 specifies the kinds of material  
that may be used for fireblocking.  
Fireblocking is typically required in the  
following concealed spaces\:  
•  
connections between vertical stud wall  
spaces and the horizontal spaces created  
by a series of joists;  
•  
connections between vertical and  
horizontal spaces at soffits, dropped  
ceilings, etc.;  
•  
in parallel and staggered stud walls,  
including furred spaces, at 10' \(3048\)  
intervals horizontally;  
•  
between the stringers of a stairway.  
Where annular openings are not protected  
per exceptions to § 712.1.8, § 714.5.1.2, or  
§ 714.6, fireblocking is to be installed at  
ceiling and floor openings around pipes,  
ducts, and chimneys. The space between  
the blocking and the penetration is to be  
filled with an  
“  
approved”  
material to resist  
the free passage of flame and products  
of combustion. Note that per § 714.6 this  
applies to non-rated horizontal assemblies  
as well as fire-resistance-rated horizontal  
assemblies. CONCEALED SPACES  
•

•  
“Draftstopping” is the term used for the  
provision of materials or devices to restrict  
the movement of air within open spaces  
concealed in combustible construction,  
such as floor and ceiling cavities and attics.  
Draftstopping in floors is to be per § 718.3  
and draftstopping in attics is to be per  
§ 718.4.  
Draftstopping is required to subdivide attics  
and other concealed roof spaces.  
The code is open to interpretation, but we  
believe that in most residential occupancies,  
this draftstopping is to be installed in  
attics above and in line with the walls that  
separate one dwelling unit from another  
where they do not already extend to the  
underside of the roof sheathing above.  
In other than residential occupancies,  
draftstopping must subdivide attics and  
other concealed roof spaces into areas  
of less than 3,000 sf \(279 m2\) unless the  
building is fully sprinklered.  
In Groups R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4  
occupancies, draftstopping is to be located  
above and in line with dwelling unit  
separations.  
In other than residential occupancies,  
draftstopping must subdivide horizontal floor  
spaces into areas of less than  
1,000 sf \(93 m2\) unless the building is  
fully sprinklered.  
FIRE-RESISTIVE CONSTRUCTION / 141 PLASTER AND THERMAL- AND SOUND-INSULATING MATERIALS  
Plaster  
Plaster is accepted as a fire-resistance-rated  
material when applied as prescribed in § 719.  
Plaster assemblies must be based on tested  
assemblies. Plaster may be used to substitute  
for 1/2" \(13\) of the required overall assembly  
thickness when applied over concrete. Minimum  
concrete cover of 3/8" \(10\) at floors and 1" \(25\)  
at reinforced columns must still be maintained.  
# ≈ ≈  
Thermal- and Sound-Insulating  
Materials  
§ 720 recognizes that thermal and acoustical  
insulating materials often have paper facings or  
contain combustible materials. When installed  
in concealed spaces, the materials must have  
a flame-spread index of not more than 25 and  
a smoke-developed index of not more than  
450\. Per an exception, cellulosic fiber loose-fill  
insulation with the requirements of § 720.6  
are not required to meet a flame-spread index  
requirement but shall be required to meet a  
smoke-developed index of not more than 450.

The required plaster thickness is measured  
from the face of the lath when applied over  
metal or gypsum lath.  
§ 719.2 notes the following equivalencies  
for fire-resistance purposes\:  
1/2" \(13\) unsanded gypsum plaster  
3/4" \(19\) one-to-three gypsum  
sand plaster  
1" \(25\) Portland cement plaster  
An additional layer of lath embedded at  
least 3/4" \(19\) from the outer surface is  
required for plaster protection more than 1"  
\(25\) thick.  
Per § 720.2.1 flame spread and smoke  
developed limitations do not apply in Type  
III, IV , or V construction when the facing is  
turned toward and is in substantial contact  
with the unexposed surface of the wall,  
ceiling, or floor.  
Roof insulation may be combustible and  
need not meet the flame-spread and smoke-  
generation limits when it is covered with  
approved roof coverings. The tables in § 721 provide a laundry list  
of assemblies deemed to comply with fire-  
resistance requirements for the times noted  
when installed at the thickness indicated.

exhaustive list. The designer will often refer  
to other testing agencies that are acceptable  
to the code, such as Underwriters Laboratory  
or Factory Mutual, to find assemblies that  
meet the needs of the project. The designer  
must use these assemblies with care and  
identify where they are used in a project.  
Modifications to assembly designs should be  
done with caution as this may negate their  
approval and necessitate fire testing to prove  
their efficacy.

—THE BASICS When project conditions cannot be met using  
prescriptive assemblies, § 722 provides a meth-  
odology to calculate the fire-resistive perfor-  
mance of specific materials or combinations of  
materials. These calculations are developed for  
use in the code and meant to apply only to the  
section in which they are contained. They are  
designed to facilitate design and documentation  
of fire assemblies so that the designer and the  
building official will have reasonable assurance  
of the performance of the calculated assembly  
under actual fire conditions. The formulas are  
based on data for heat transfer in structural  
members, thermal conductance of insulating  
materials, conduction in materials, fire-test data  
of the fire resistance of various building materi-  
als; individually and in concert with each other,  
along with anticipated loads on assemblies in  
place.  
The designer can use the data contained in this  
section to determine fire resistance for assem-  
blies that do not fit neatly into the prescriptive,  
pretested categories contained in § 721.  
On the following pages are several examples  
for both structural protection and assembly  
calculations to illustrate the principles at work  
in this section.  
CALCULATED FIRE RESISTANCES  
There are several fundamental precepts for the  
calculation of fire resistance.  
•  
The first is that there is a quantifiable  
relationship between the thickness of  
fire-protection materials applied to  
building elements and the resulting time  
of fire resistance. In short, thicker fire  
protection yields longer fire-resistance  
duration.  
•  
The second precept is that more cover on  
steel reinforcing in concrete construction  
yields a longer fire-resistance duration.  
•  
The third precept is that there is a  
relationship between the overall exterior  
surface dimension of a steel structural  
member \(referred to as the “heated  
perimeter”\), the thickness of the parts of  
the member, and the thickness of the fire-  
protection materials necessary to achieve  
a certain fire rating. For example, compact  
steel wide flange sections with thick webs  
and flanges usually require thinner layers  
of fire-protective materials to achieve a  
given fire-resistance duration than a larger-  
dimension beam made up of thinner steel.

the use of siliceous aggregate.  
Concrete Walls

Per Table 722.2.1.1, a 2-hour-rated wall of  
siliceous concrete is to be 5" \(127\) thick.

Fire protection for steel columns is dependent  
on the weight per lineal foot \(W\) and the heated  
perimeter \(D\) of the column, which is related to  
the physical dimensions of the column.  
Table 722.5.1\(1\) shows W/D ratios for typical  
columns. We will assume a W12 × 96 column.

—THE BASICS § 722.7 Fire-Resistance Rating of Mass  
Timber  
As an alternative to the test method  
demonstration of code compliance prescribed in  
§ 703.2 for protection of mass timber elements  
in Type IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C construction,  
prescriptive methods are called out in a new  
section for calculated fire resistance, § 722.7.  
This section also prescribes fastening methods  
for the installation of additional fire protection  
materials over mass timber elements.  
As do § 602.4, § 703.6, and Table 705.5 \[relocated  
from Table 602 in previous editions\], this section  
recognizes that additional fire protective  
materials are required to achieve the ratings  
allowed for Type IV-A and IV-B construction,  
and added material thickness may be needed  
for rating compliance for Type IV-C unprotected  
mass timber. Calculations are based on Chapter  
16 of the American Wood Council National  
Design Specificiation \(NDS\). The prescriptive  
criteria are based on fire test results showing  
that approximately 2/3 of the fire-resistance  
rating should come from the addition of fire  
protective materials, such as gypsum board over  
the mass timber elements.  
Table 722.7\(1\) shows the relationship of the  
total required fire resistance of a mass timber  
assembly to the fire rating in minutes for the  
minimum additional noncombustible materials.  
Table 722.7\(2\) gives ratings in minutes for  
each layer of the most standard gypsum board  
materials likely to be used in typical details for  
interior and exterior conditions in mass timber  
buildings.  
To use the values in Table 722.7\(2\), the gypsum  
board protection must be installed as indicated  
in § 722.7.2. See illustrations on pages 152–154.

# Interior  
# Finishes  
Chapter 8 of the code governs the use of materials for interior fin-  
ishes, trim, and decorative materials. The primary consideration of  
this chapter is the flame-spread and smoke-generation characteris-  
tics of materials when they are applied to underlying surfaces. These  
regulations are meant to govern those decorative finishes that are  
exposed to view. The regulations include all interior surfaces—floors,  
walls, and ceilings. Trim applied to finish surfaces is also included in  
these regulations. Note that § 802.4 requires finishes to be flood-  
damage-resistant when located below design flood elevation in  
buildings in flood hazard areas. WALL AND CEILING FINISHES  
Classification  
Wall and ceiling finish materials are classified  
by their flame spread and smoke generation as  
tested on the test protocols of NFPA 286, ASTM  
E84, or UL 723.  
ASTM E84 or UL 723 sets a standard for the  
surface-burning characteristics of building mate-  
rials. The materials are placed in a test furnace  
and exposed to a flame of a calibrated size, and  
the ignition, spread of flame, and generation of  
smoke are noted and assigned values based on  
a standard scale. The standard material against  
which other materials are measured for flame  
spread and smoke generation is Red Oak.  
For the ASTM E84 test, the lower the number  
for each measurement, the slower the flames  
spread and the less smoke is generated. Once  
interior finish materials are tested, they are  
classified as A, B, or C. The classifications, per  
§ 803.1.2 are\:  
Flame-Spread Smoke-Developed  
Index Index  
Class A 0–25 0–450  
Class B 26–75 0–450  
Class C 76–200 0–450  
156 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Instead of using ASTM E84 or UL 723, the  
code allows compliance with NFPA 286. This  
test is known as a “room corner” fire test.  
Many materials are tested using this standard  
test, which probably gives a better indication  
of actual performance in the field than does  
the ASTM test. § 803.1.1.1 lists the accep-  
tance criteria for using NFPA 286 data. NFPA  
does not define “Class A” fire ratings as do  
ASTM E84 or UL 723. Materials complying with  
the acceptance criteria for NFPA 286 listed in  
§ 803.1.1.1 are considered to also comply with  
the requirements of Class A.  
§ 803.9 requires materials that contain high-  
density polyethylene \(HDPE\) or polypropylene  
\(PP\) to comply with NFPA 286. This gives a more  
accurate basis for assessing the performance  
of these materials in actual fire conditions. The  
primary impact this has for designers and code  
officials is that when these materials are to be  
used in a project, they should ascertain that their  
manufacturers can demonstrate that the materi-  
als have been tested using the specific criteria  
established by the code.  
WALL AND CEILING FINISHES  
The Room Corner Test determines how a  
material will add to the growth of a fire,  
including heat and smoke; increase off-gassing;  
and cause fire spread beyond the initial fire  
location. It is a pass/fail test.  
Acceptance criteria for NFPA 286\:  
1\. During the 40 kW exposure, flames shall  
not spread to the ceiling.  
2\. The flame shall not spread to the outer  
extremity of the sample on any wall or  
ceiling.  
3\. Flashover, as defined in NFPA 286, shall not  
occur.  
4\. The peak heat release rate throughout the  
test shall not exceed 800 kW.  
5\. The total smoke released throughout the  
test shall not exceed 1,000 m2  
.  
INTERIOR FINISHES / 157 WALL AND CEILING FINISHES  
The required classes of finish materials are deter-  
mined by occupancy. The requirements are fur-  
ther subdivided into sprinklered and unsprinklered  
Note that in Table 803.13 the most restrictive  
flame-spread and smoke-developed classifica-  
tions are required for\:  
occupancies. The final consideration is whether  
the finish occurs in exits, in exit-access areas, or in  
rooms. Per Table 803.13, unsprinklered buildings  
•  
require higher classifications of finish materials.  
Also, egress paths require higher finishes than  
# EXIT EXIT  
Interior exit stairways, interior exit ramps,  
and exit passageways  
rooms or occupied spaces. This is consistent with  
the general philosophy of the code to offset active  
fire-protection measures with passive measures  
and to hold egress paths to higher standards than  
for occupied rooms.  
•  
Group A \(assembly\), H \(high-hazard\), and  
I \(institutional\) occupancies  
New sections address laminated products over  
wood substrates. § 803.11 covers factory-produced  
materials and § 803.12 covers laminates applied  
on-site over wood substrates. The test criteria  
are to be per NFPA 286 in § 803.1.1.1 or with the  
materials meeting the flame spread indexes for  
ASTM E84 or UL 723.  
•  
Factory-laminated panels are finished  
products that must meet the stated  
standards and use the materials and  
adhesives tested and approved.  
•  
Field-applied laminates are essentially the  
same as wall coverings, but when applied  
over wood substrates, perform differently  
than when applied over finishes such as  
gypsum board. Application must meet  
tested criteria for substrate, adhesives, and  
configurations.

§ 803.15 governs the application of materi-  
als over walls or ceilings required to be  
fire-resistance rated or of noncombustible  
construction.  
Where materials are set off from fire-resis-  
tive construction by more than the distances  
noted, the finish materials must be Class A  
except where one of three methods of addi-  
tional protection is used.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
WALL AND CEILING FINISHES  
§ 803.14 requires finish materials be  
securely attached so that they will remain  
in place for at least 30 minutes at 200°F  
\(93°C\).  
§ 803.15 states that wall and ceiling finishes  
in fire-resistance-rated or noncombustible  
construction must be placed directly against  
the backing material, or the spaces behind  
must be furred with furring strips less than  
1  
3/4" \(44.5\) deep.  
The spaces between the furring strips must  
be filled with noncombustible inorganic or  
Class A materials, or the furring must be  
fire-blocked every 8' \(2438\).  
Alternately, where stand-off finishes  
are desired without sprinklers, Class A  
materials must be used, or a second layer of  
noncombustible construction may be used  
to build out the walls and then use furring  
as noted above when it is not desirable or  
feasible to sprinkler both sides of the  
set-out. This may also be combined with the  
infill solutions shown in the example above.  
Site-fabricated stretch wall systems that  
contain all of the three parts contained in  
the definition in § 202—  
• A frame  
• A core material  
• A stretched outer layer attached to  
the frame  
—are to be tested per § 803.10 using  
the requirements of either § 803.1.1 or  
§ 803.1.2.  
INTERIOR FINISHES / 159 INTERIOR FLOOR FINISHES  
§ 804 deals primarily with carpets or similar  
fibrous flooring materials. Traditional-type floor-  
ing—such as wood, vinyl, linoleum, or terrazzo—  
are excepted. Flooring is to be classified into two  
categories, Class I or II, per the results of fire  
testing done per ASTM E648 or NFPA 253, with  
Class I materials being the more resistant to  
flame spread than Class II materials. This test  
records the fire and smoke response of flooring  
assemblies to a radiant heat source. Carpets  
are to be tested in configurations similar to  
how they are to be installed, including pads and  
adhesives or fasteners. Flooring materials are to  
be tagged with test results.  
§ 804.4 governs the interior floor finish in enclo-  
sures for stairways, ramps, exit passageways,  
corridors, and rooms not separated from cor-  
ridors by full-height partitions extending from  
the floor to the underside of the ceiling. The  
finishes in these conditions are to withstand  
a minimum critical radiant flux as specified in  
§ 804.4.2.  
Note that this section applies to all occupancies  
and introduces one additional test criteria, the  
Department of Commerce FF-1 Pill Test \(per  
Consumer Product Safety Commission 16, Code  
of Federal Regulations 1630\). This criteria is  
similar to, but less stringent than the NFPA test.  
The requirements for interior floor finishes are  
thus based on occupancy, construction type, and  
sprinklering, and can be summarized as follows\:  
§ 805 addresses the use of combustible materi-  
als in floors of Type I and II construction.  
•  
•  
There are provisions allowing use of wood  
flooring in Type I or II buildings. In these  
conditions wood floors are to be installed  
over fire-blocked sleepers with blocking  
under walls.  
§ 805.1.1 regulates subfloor construction and  
prohibits combustible sleepers and nailing  
blocks unless the space between the fire-  
resistance-rated floor construction and the  
subfloor is solidly filled with noncombustible  
material or fire-blocked per § 718.  
•  
•  
§ 805.1.2 permits wood flooring to be  
attached directly to embedded or fire-  
blocked wood sleepers, or to be cemented  
directly to the top surface of fire-resistance-  
rated construction, or to a wood subfloor  
attached to sleepers per § 805.1.1.  
Another stipulation of § 805.1.1 prohibits  
spaces from extending under or through  
permanent walls and partitions.

§ 808 regulates the quality, design, fabrication,  
and installation of acoustical tile and lay-in panel  
ceiling systems. The suspension systems must  
meet general engineering principles for vertical  
and lateral load capabilities. The acoustic mate-  
rials must comply with the classification ratings  
noted for the occupancy and configuration in  
relation to the interior finish requirements per  
§ 808.1.1\. Where the ceiling suspension system  
is part of the fire-resistance-rated construction,  
the assembly must be installed consistent with  
the tested assemblies and must conform to the  
fire-resistance-rating requirements of Chapter 7.

# Fire-Protection  
# Systems  
As we have seen in Chapter 7, the code recognizes the effectiveness of  
active fire-protection systems in combination with passive fire protection. The  
provision of an automatic sprinkler system allows trade-offs with passive fire-  
resistance in numerous sections of the code. The code also requires that active  
systems be provided in buildings above a certain height and above certain  
occupancy loadings. Thus, the code recognizes the efficacy of active systems in  
concert with passive fire-protection to provide a balanced approach to fire and  
life safety for building occupants.  
Active systems, especially fire sprinklers, are very effective but subject to  
interruption of water supplies unless emergency water sources with backup  
pressure systems are provided. At the same time, passive systems are subject  
to failure due to construction defects, poor maintenance, remodeling, failure  
of attachments, and damage from building movement or building use. The  
designer should consider the integration of both passive and active systems  
while developing the building design. The best designs do not rely on just one  
set of systems to provide fire protection but use an overall holistic approach to  
provide maximum protection.  
We will touch on those active systems that integrate most effectively with pas-  
sive fire-resistive strategies. The primary systems considered are fire sprinklers  
and smoke-control systems. These systems respond to hazards with defined  
actions designed to suppress fires or provide for occupant safety and egress.  
Other systems—fire alarms, fire extinguishers, and standpipe systems—  
provide notification for egress or auxiliary firefighting capabilities for the fire  
service. The code requires their presence for certain occupancies and usually  
does not allow balancing their use with alternate design considerations. The  
systems that interact with design decisions, especially fire sprinkler systems,  
are the ones discussed here. FIRE-PROTECTION SYSTEMS  
The design and installation of automatic sprin-  
kler systems is typically governed by rules devel-  
oped by the National Fire Protection Association  
and promulgated as the NFPA 13 Standard.  
An automatic sprinkler system is designed to  
respond to a fire when the sprinkler heads are  
activated by a fire or by heat. The systems are  
designed to function without intervention by  
the building occupants to cause their operation.  
The history of fire sprinklers as fire-suppression  
devices has been a good one, and they have  
been required under a greater range of circum-  
stances in each new edition of model codes.  
Residential sprinkler systems may be installed  
under the provisions of NFPA 13D or 13R, which  
are subsets of the provisions of NFPA 13. These  
may be acceptable as sprinkler systems in spe-  
cific instances, but the code does not recognize  
these as fully equivalent to NFPA 13 systems  
for the trade-offs contained in exceptions or  
reductions unless they are specifically allowed.  
See the requirements for Group R occupancies  
for allowable uses for these sprinkler-system  
classes.  
When reading sections of the code that refer to  
Chapter 9, the designer should go to the section  
referred to in Chapter 9 to verify which type of  
sprinkler system is required by the IBC. These  
systems are described in § 903.3. This is where  
the code draws distinctions between NFPA 13,  
13D, 13R, and alternative sprinkler systems. Do  
not assume that all automatic sprinkler systems  
are per NFPA 13 without referring to the appli-  
cable portions of § 903.3.  
Fire-protection systems consist of\:  
•  
Detection systems that sense heat, fire,  
or smoke \(particles of combustion\) and  
activate an appropriate alarm.  
•  
Alarm systems that alert occupants of  
an emergency in a building by the sense  
of hearing, sight, or, in some cases,  
touch, as by such things as vibrations.  
•  
•  
Automatic fire-extinguishing or sprinkler  
systems that are activated by heat from  
a fire and discharge either an approved  
fire-extinguishing agent or water over  
the fire area in order to extinguish or  
control a fire.  
Automatic sprinkler systems that  
consist of underground and overhead  
piping from a suitable water supply, to  
which automatic sprinklers are attached  
in a regular pattern designed to provide  
even coverage for water discharge.  
Upon activation by heat from a fire, the  
systems discharge water over the fire  
area.  
A fire-protection system may also include  
equipment to control or manage smoke and  
combustion products of a fire.

Various occupancies are required to have  
automatic sprinkler systems by § 903. These  
requirements are based on several factors\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Occupancy type  
Occupant load  
Area of occupied space  
Locations not providing ready egress or  
ready fire-department access  
The requirements are listed by occupancy  
group. Carefully note that an automatic  
sprinkler system may be required\:  
•  
Throughout an entire building  
because of a code requirement or  
when the sprinkler system is used as  
a substitute for other fire-protection  
features.  
•  
Throughout a fire area  
that may exceed a certain size or  
occupant load, or one that is located in a  
specific portion of a building.  
Per the definitions contained in Chapter  
2, fire areas are enclosed and bounded  
by fire walls, fire barriers, exterior  
walls, or fire-resistance-rated horizontal  
assemblies.  
•  
In specific rooms or areas  
to protect against a specific hazard.  
Note also that the increases for building  
heights and areas allowed in Chapter 5 for  
provision of sprinkler systems apply only  
when those systems are installed throughout  
a building.  
In addition to the requirements contained in  
§ 903.2, Table 903.2.11.6 is a useful cross-  
reference for sprinkler requirements con-  
tained in other code chapters.  
FIRE-PROTECTION SYSTEMS / 165 AUTOMATIC SPRINKLER SYSTEMS  
Group A\: § 903.2.1 requires that when any of  
the conditions listed on this and the following  
page exist, an automatic sprinkler system must  
be installed\:  
•  
Throughout the floor where a Group A  
occupancy is located.  
•  
On all floors below a rooftop A-2 occupancy  
with more than 100 occupants, or  
other Group A rooftop occupancies with  
more than 300 occupants.  
•  
In all floors between the Group A occupancy  
and the level of exit discharge for the Group  
A occupancy.  
•  
Note that the thresholds for area and  
occupancy refer to the fire area, not just the  
area and occupancy of each assembly room.  
Note that for any of the Group A occupancies  
on this and the facing page, any one of the  
specified conditions triggers the requirement for  
sprinklers. The requirements include\:  
•  
A-1\: Throughout a floor containing an A-1  
occupancy when one of the following  
conditions exist\:  
1\. The fire area exceeds 12,000 sf \(1115 m2\).  
2\. The fire area has an occupant load of 300 or  
more.  
3\. The fire area is located on a floor other than  
the level of exit discharge.  
4\. The fire area contains a multitheater  
complex.  
• In multiple fire areas in A-1, A-2, A-3, or A-4  
occupancies that have a combined occupant  
load of 300 or more and where the fire areas  
share exit or exit access components.  
166 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED

Fire area exceeds 5,000 sf \(465 m2\) for  
Group A-2 occupancies.  
•  
For Group A occupancies other than A-2 or  
A-5, the occupant threshold is 300 for the  
entire fire area in which the assembly is  
located, not just the assembly room. For A-2  
occupancies, the threshold is 100 occupants.  
Group B\: There are increasing numbers of  
“ambulatory care facilities,” which are usually  
classified as B occupancies. The sprinkler provi-  
sions in § 902.2.2 are based on the use descrip-  
tion of ambulatory care, not on the occupancy  
classification. Sprinklers are required on the  
entire floor where there are more than four care  
recipients incapable of self-preservation on the  
level of exit discharge, or when one or more  
such persons are located at other than the level  
of exit discharge. When there are incapacitated  
care recipients above the level of exit discharge,  
then the floors supporting that level must also  
be sprinklered.

local AHJ regarding the adoption of the International  
Residential Code to see what is applicable for one- and  
two-family dwellings as well as when an NFPA “13R”  
sprinkler system may be used in Type R-4 buildings.  
§ 903.2.11.2\: Trash and linen chutes merit special  
sprinkler protection. They typically occur in  
residential buildings where people sleep. They are  
also accessible for use by occupants and thus may  
not be maintained in a safe condition by users.  
Therefore, sprinklers are to be provided in addition to  
the passive protection provided by shaft enclosures  
and fire-rated rooms separating the chutes from  
circulation spaces and adjacent uses.

§ 903.2.11.3 requires that automatic fire  
sprinklers be installed throughout buildings  
having an occupied floor with 30 or more  
occupants located 55' \(16 764\) or more above  
the lowest level of fire-department vehicle  
access. Thus, any building higher than a mid-

the code always governs and the code may  
deliberately impose more stringent requirements  
than the standard. That is the case with these  
NFPA 13R additional requirements.  
•  
Per § 903.3.1.2.1, sprinkler protection is to be  
provided for exterior balconies of dwelling units  
and sleeping units where either of the following  
conditions exists\:  
1\. The building is of Type V construction, provided  
that there is a roof or deck above.  
2\. Exterior balconies, decks, and ground floor  
patios of dwelling units and sleeping units are  
of unprotected combustible construction in  
accordance with § 705.2.3.1, Exception 3.  
Sidewall heads may be provided at such  
projections.  
•  
Per § 903.3.1.2.2, in buildings allowed to use an  
NFPA 13R sprinkler system, the code imposes  
more stringent requirements than the NFPA  
standard for corridors and exit balconies in the  
following conditions\:  
1\. Corridors with combustible floors or walls  
2\. Corridors with a change of direction \> 45°  
3\. Corridors open \< 50% to the outside atmosphere at

170 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS § 905 contains the requirements for the instal-  
lation of standpipe systems. Standpipes are  
permanent pipes rising through a building that  
provide hose connections for use in interior fire-  
fighting. Standpipes are designated as Class I,  
II, or III per the definitions in Chapter 2, based  
on the hose connections they furnish.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Class I standpipes provide large, 2  
1/2" \(64\)  
hose connections for use by firefighters who  
are trained in the use of the heavy flow of  
water these connections provide.  
Class II standpipes provide 11/2" \(38\) hose  
connections that are lower volume and  
pressure and can conceivably be used either  
by untrained building occupants or first  
responders to help fight a fire inside the  
building.  
Class III standpipe systems provide access  
to both sizes of connections to allow use by  
either building occupants or firefighters with  
the choice of which connection to use based  
on the ability and training of the responders.  
Standpipes are to have approved standard  
threads for hose connections that are  
compatible with fire department hose  
threads. These connections should be  
verified and approved by the AHJ.  
Standpipe types are classified as either wet or  
dry and automatic or manual. Dry standpipes  
contain air that is displaced by water when they  
are put to use. Wet standpipes contain water at  
all times. The use of these is often determined  
by location. For example, dry standpipes can be  
on open landings in cold climates, where the  
water in wet standpipes would freeze.  
Standpipe classifications for automatic stand-  
pipes presume that the water supply for the  
standpipe can meet the system demand.  
Manual standpipes depend on additional pres-  
sure and water supply to meet the demand.  
Hooking up a fire-department pumper truck to  
the standpipe typically provides such additional  
supply.  
Class I  
Class II  
Class III  
•  
Water pressure for a standpipe or sprinkler  
system may be provided by a municipal  
water main or a pumper truck, augmented  
by a fire pump or a rooftop water tank.  
STANDPIPE SYSTEMS  
Standpipes are often referred to as fire risers, a  
term also applied to vertical fire-sprinkler supply  
lines. Avoid confusion in language by determin-  
ing to which pipes the term applies.  
Standpipes are permitted to be combined with  
automatic sprinkler systems. Thus, a single riser  
pipe may supply both the sprinkler system and  
the hose connections. However, such a single  
pipe will be larger in diameter than two sepa-  
rate pipes, since it must meet the demand of  
both the sprinkler and hose connection systems.  
Typically, the systems are combined, since a  
single riser, even if somewhat larger in diam-  
eter, is easier to locate in the building than two  
such risers.  
Water main  
FIRE-PROTECTION SYSTEMS / 171 FIRE-ALARM AND DETECTION SYSTEMS  
Fire alarms are audible and visual devices to  
alert occupants and responders of emergencies.  
Detectors are automatic devices that usually  
sound an audible and visual alarm to alert occu-  
pants and also trigger other responses in sys-  
tems such as sprinklers, smoke-control systems,  
or HVAC controls. Systems to notify building  
occupants of an emergency can be either manu-  
ally or automatically actuated.  
The code requires differing types of alarms or  
detectors, and different levels of actuation in  
various occupancies and types of buildings.  
When buildings are sprinklered and the sprin-  
klers are connected to the alarm system, auto-  
matic heat detection is not required. Sprinklers  
are heat-actuated and thus are a type of heat  
detector themselves. Fire detectors are to be  
smoke detectors as well, except in areas like  
boiler rooms where products of combustion  
would tend to set off smoke detectors. In those  
rooms alternative types of fire detectors may be  
used. Alarms are to be per NFPA 72.  
The code offers trade-offs between manual  
alarms and automatic detection systems under  
certain conditions. There are instances where  
having manual alarms may result in a large  
number of false alarms, so providing automatic  
detection may be a desirable alternative.  
Detailed requirements are grouped by occu-  
pancy or use.

not to exceed 200' \(60 960\).  
Visual Alarms  
§ 907.5.2.3 specifies where visual alarms are  
to be provided to notify persons with hearing  
impairments of alarm conditions. These are  
white strobe lights mounted on the wall of cer-  
tain areas. By referencing NFPA 72, accessibility  
criteria require that wall-mounted visual alarms  
be located at least 80" \(2032\) but no more than  
96" \(2438\) above the floor.  
Visual alarms are to be provided in the following  
locations\:  
1\. Public and common areas.  
2\. Employee work areas.  
3\. I-1 and R-1 sleeping accommodations per  
the quantities noted in Table 907.5.2.3.2.

FIRE-PROTECTION SYSTEMS / 173 SMOKE-CONTROL SYSTEMS  
The purpose of smoke-control systems as stated  
in § 909 is to provide a tenable environment for  
the evacuation or relocation of occupants. The  
provisions are not intended for the preservation  
of contents, the timely restoration of operations,  
or for assistance in fire suppression or overhaul  
activities.  
Smoke-control systems are classified as active  
fire-protection systems for our discussion in  
that they actively perform their basic function  
for life safety. They respond to fire not by their  
presence as barriers to fire or heat but by acti-  
vating a sequence of operations to safeguard  
the building’s occupants. These systems are  
referred to in the code as either of the active or  
passive type. This refers to whether the systems  
exhaust smoke through natural convection or by  
the use of mechanical ventilation. All smoke-  
control systems rely on automatic activation,  
whether the exhaust mechanisms are passive  
or active.  
The systems are provided in certain building  
types such as malls or atriums to contain or  
evacuate smoke to allow building occupants  
to leave areas where smoke might hinder their  
egress. Buildings with smoke-control systems  
are typically those having large areas with  
interconnected air spaces where smoke cannot  
be contained by barriers but must be moved or  
exhausted for occupant protection. The design  
criteria for smoke-control systems require  
detailed calculations and modeling. They are  
almost invariably designed with the aid of a  
consultant experienced in design and construc-  
tion of such systems.

Vestibule must be separated from the  
smoke-proof enclosure by a 2-hour fire  
barrier.  
Per § 909.20.5, where the building is  
equipped with an automatic sprinkler  
system, vestibules are not required when  
the exit stairways are pressurized with a  
minimum of 0.10 inches of water \(25 Pa\) and  
a maximum of 0.35 inches of water \(87 Pa\)  
in the shaft with the pressures measured  
relative to the building.  
§ 909.20.6 allows a combination of stair  
pressurization and vestibule pressurization.  
It is a fourth method of providing smoke  
control along with the natural ventilation  
method and the two other mechanical  
ventilation methods described in the code.  
Vestibule must be at least 44" \(1118\) wide  
and 72" \(1829\) long in the direction of egress  
travel.  
Natural ventilation may be provided by a  
minimum net area of 16 sf \(1.5 m2\) opening  
in a wall facing an outer court, yard, or  
public way at least 20' \(6096\) in width.  
Mechanical ventilation may be provided  
by supply and exhaust ducts.  
Tightly constructed duct must exhaust  
at least 150% of the supply air.  
No more than 6" \(152\) below top of  
smoke trap.

# Means of  
# Egress  
Chapter 10 of the International Building Code contains the requirements  
for designing exiting systems that are described as “means of egress.” The  
fundamental purpose for a means of egress is to get all of the occupants  
out of a building in a safe and expeditious manner during a fire or other  
emergency. A means of egress must therefore provide a continuous and  
unobstructed path of exit travel from any occupied point in a building to a  
public way, which is a space such as a street or alley, permanently dedi-  
cated for public use.  
The term “means of egress” is a general one describing ways of getting  
out of a building. Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines  
“egress” as “1. the act or right of going or coming out.” This term has been  
chosen to encompass all system components used for getting people out  
of a building in an emergency. The emphasis is on emergency egress, not  
convenience or function. However, access for persons with disabilities is  
also a consideration in designing a means of egress.  
In the definitions used in this chapter, which are detailed in Chapter 2, such  
seemingly common terms as “exit access,” “exit,” and “exit discharge”  
take on more specific, code-defined meanings as components of a “means  
of egress,” which is the complete system for escape. Pay close attention  
to code-specific nomenclature as you familiarize yourself with this chapter.  
Note that this chapter has often been completely renumbered over the  
various three-year IBC code cycles since its first edition in 2000. This is yet  
another reason not to memorize the code, but rather to use the index or an  
electronic file where you can do a keyword search to locate information. MEANS OF EGRESS  
Chapter 2 defines “means of egress” as a continu-  
ous, unobstructed path of vertical and horizontal  
exit travel from any occupied portion of a building or  
structure to a public way. The means of egress for  
every occupancy in a building must meet the provi-  
sions of Chapter 10. The requirements are driven  
by the occupancy type of the area to be provided  
with egress and the occupant load calculated per  
Table 1004.5.  
A building may contain several different types of  
occupancies. The designer must consider all of the  
uses, present or contemplated, so that adequate  
numbers and capacities of exits are provided. The  
occupant load is typically calculated as if each  
area is occupied at the same time to determine  
the maximum possible number of occupants to be  
accommodated by the means of egress. The code  
presumes that means-of-egress components them-  
selves are generally not occupied spaces but serve  
the occupants of the building. There are specific  
and narrow exceptions to the requirements for cal-  
culating occupant load that will be discussed later.  
Egress widths determine the number of occupants  
that may egress. In other words, the “capacity” of  
the means of egress is dependent on the width of the  
various components of the means-of-egress system.  
The code uses the terms “width” and “capacity”  
somewhat interchangeably since they are so closely  
related.  
Egress Concepts  
The general objective of egress, that of providing  
a continuous, unobstructed, and protected path to  
the outside of a building, is fundamental to the code  
and must be thoroughly understood. It must also be  
understood that when the egress path from a major  
occupancy of the building passes through an area  
containing another occupancy, possibly a public  
assemblage or a garage area, the egress path  
retains the occupancy-class designation and fire-  
protection requirements of the main use. Protection  
should never be reduced as the occupants proceed  
downstream in the means-of-egress system toward  
the final destination of being safely away from the  
building on the ground level of the building site.  
•  
•  
178 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
Flow  
There is a presumed direction of flow to every means  
of egress, leading from an occupied space to a final  
safe outside area, away from any hazard or emergency  
in the building. The best analogy for means-of-egress  
design is that of watercourses. Small streams lead  
to creeks, which feed rivers, which then lead to the  
sea. Rivers get larger and carry more water as they  
go downstream as tributaries feed into them; so too  
should the conceptual design of a means of egress.  
Exit paths must remain the same size or get larger  
as the building occupants proceed downstream from  
areas of lesser safety to areas of greater safety  
and ultimately out of the building through the exit  
discharge.  
It is important to keep in mind that egress has a time  
component. The occupants of the ground-level portions  
of the means of egress in a multistory building are  
assumed to be out of the building when the occupants  
from the upper stories reach the end of the total  
length of the egress path. •  
Alternative Paths  
Another basic exiting principle is that at least  
two different egress paths should lead from  
the interior of a building to the outside at  
ground level. The rationale is that if one path  
is blocked or endangered by a hazard, then  
the other path will be available. There are  
exceptions to this rule for situations involving  
relatively small numbers of occupants, but  
the designer should always begin with the  
basic design concept that two ways out of  
each space should typically be provided in  
case of an emergency.  
EXIT ACCESS  
•  
MEANS OF EGRESS  
•  
Corridors are part  
of exit access.  
EXIT  
EXIT DISCHARGE  
Protection  
Various sections of the egress path may be required  
to provide fire-resistive protection for the occupants.  
Exit access begins in any occupied part of the  
building, which in turn can connect to a corridor or  
to an exit, extend in the exit enclosure down through  
the building, and then to the exit discharge leading  
to the exterior. Note that often corridors will not be  
required to be of fire-resistive construction, typically  
in the situation where a building is fully sprinklered.  
Once in a rated corridor, exit stairway, or similar  
protected egress path, the occupant is to remain  
protected until the building exterior is reached. In  
the process of exiting, the occupant should not be  
required to move out of a protected environment  
into adjacent occupied spaces or unprotected egress  
paths to get to the next portion of the protected  
egress path or to the exterior, because doing so  
would necessitate removing the protection the exit  
enclosure is required to provide.  
MEANS OF EGRESS / 179 EGRESS COMPONENTS  
There are three basic components to a means  
of egress\: the exit access, the exit, and the exit  
discharge. It is important to clearly understand  
how the code defines these components so that  
you can apply the requirements of Chapter 10.  
EXIT ACCESS  
•  
•  
It is important to remember that the  
distance one may travel in the exit access,  
from the most remote point in the room or  
space to the door of an exit, is regulated  
by the code. It may be necessary to  
provide a fire-rated passage, such as an  
exit passageway, for larger floor areas  
that may exceed the travel distances  
for various other means-of-egress  
components.  
Travel distances are not restricted in exits  
or in the exit discharge.  
180 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
1\. EXIT ACCESS is that portion of the means-  
of-egress system that leads from any  
occupied portion in a building or structure  
to an exit.  
•  
It is important to remember that corridors,  
whether rated or not, are an egress  
component that is always part of the  
exit access according to the definition of  
“corridor” in the code.  
CORRIDOR \(EXIT ACCESS\)  
Exit access is the part of the building where  
the occupants are engaged in the functions  
for which the building was designed and  
are thus the spaces to be escaped from  
in an emergency. Although the exit access  
allows the occupants the most freedom  
of movement, it also offers the lowest  
level of life-safety protection of any of the  
components of the means of egress.  
In the typical exit access path from a room or  
space one may encounter aisles, passages,  
corridors, or other intervening rooms before  
entering a protected fire-rated enclosure  
called the exit. The distance to be traversed  
is limited by the code, as will be covered in  
this analysis. 2\. EXIT is that portion of the means-of-egress  
system between the exit access and the exit  
discharge or the public way. The exit is typically  
separated from other interior spaces by fire-  
resistive construction, but this may not be the  
case for each and every exit.  
The exit portion of the means of egress allows  
the occupants of a building to move inside  
of or toward a protected enclosure from the  
area where a hazardous event is occurring  
to a place where they may finally escape  
the building. Exits are typically separated  
from other interior spaces of a building or  
structure by fire-resistance-rated construction  
and opening protectives on doors or windows  
as required to provide a protected path-of-  
egress travel from the exit access to the exit  
discharge.  
Exits include interior exit stairways and  
ramps, exit passageways, exterior exit  
stairways, exterior exit ramps, horizontal exits,  
and exterior exit doors at ground level. The  
distance one may travel within an exit is not  
limited by the code. This part of the egress  
path can be very long, as in the case of the  
stairways in a high-rise building.  
3\. EXIT DISCHARGE is that portion of the  
means-of-egress system between the  
termination of an exit and a public way. The  
exit discharge may include egress courts  
and yards, and stairways and ramps within  
them. Many of these are building-related  
components, but an exit discharge may also  
include site elements.  
This portion of the means of egress is basically  
assumed to be at or near grade and open to  
the atmosphere. The occupants are presumed  
to be able to clearly see where an area of  
safety outside the building lies and are able to  
move toward it.  
The code defines “public way” as any street,  
alley, or other parcel of land open to the  
outside air leading to a street that has been  
deeded, dedicated, or otherwise permanently  
appropriated to the public for public use and  
having a clear width and height of not less  
than 10' \(3048\).

The means of egress for a small single-  
story building is usually simple, because  
the second and the third components of  
the egress path are often combined.  
In many one-story buildings, such as retail  
stores and banks, only the first portion  
of the means of egress is obvious, but  
there will still be an “exit” and an “exit  
discharge.” A corridor may extend to the  
exterior wall and open onto a street, yard,  
or other public space. This simultaneously  
provides the exit access, the exit, and the  
exit discharge to the exterior public way  
of the building at ground level. The room  
or space opens directly to the building’s  
exterior without the need of protected  
egress pathways or stairways.  
MEANS OF EGRESS / 181 GENERAL EGRESS REQUIREMENTS  
§ 1003 through § 1015 specify the require-  
ments that apply to all three portions of  
the means of egress. Thus, requirements for  
doors, stairs, ramps, and similar egress com-  
ponents apply to all three parts of the means  
of egress when included in these sections.  
Note also that there may be additional modifi-  
cations to conditions in this section contained  
in the specific sections applicable to the three  
parts of a means of egress.  
•  
•  
Ceiling Height  
§ 1003.2 requires that egress paths have a  
ceiling height of not less than 7'6" \(2286\),  
although it is acceptable to have some projec-  
tions that reduce the minimum headroom to  
80" \(2032\) for any walking surface.  
Means-of-egress ramps may have a mini-  
mum headroom of 80" \(2032\) per § 1012.5.2.  
Pedestrian and vehicular areas in public park-  
ing garages may have egress paths with  
a minimum clear height of 7' \(2134\) per  
§ 406.2.2\. Egress areas above and below mez-  
zanine floors are to have clear heights of at  
least 7' \(2134\) per § 505.2.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Protruding Objects  
§ 1003.3 governs how much objects may  
project into the required ceiling height and  
required egress widths.  
•  
182 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
7'6" \(2286\) minimum ceiling height  
Not more than 50% of the ceiling area of  
a means of egress may be reduced to an  
80" \(2032\) height by protruding objects.  
Door closers, overhead door stops, power  
door operators, and electromagnetic  
door locks may not reduce headroom  
to less than 78" \(1981\) per § 1010.1.1.1  
exception.  
Where the vertical clearance is less than  
80" \(2032\), barriers to protect visually  
impaired persons must be provided.  
These barriers must be no more than  
27" \(686\) above the floor.  
For the same reasons, structural elements,  
fixtures, and furnishings may not project  
horizontally more than 4" \(102\) between  
the heights of 27" \(686\) and 80" \(2032\).  
Handrails may project 4 1⁄2" \(114\) from the  
wall. These requirements are compatible  
with the accessibility provisions of the  
Americans with Disabilities Act Standards  
\(ADAS\). Elevation Changes  
§ 1003.5 restricts elevation changes in the  
means of egress. If the elevation change  
is less than 12" \(305\), it must be sloped.  
Maintaining Width and Capacity  
of the Means of Egress  
§ 1003.6 emphasizes that when objects,  
such as brackets or columns, occur in a  
means of egress, they shall not decrease  
the required width or capacity of the  
means of egress. Where these obstruc-  
tions or projections do occur, additional  
width is needed to maintain the required  
egress capacity.  
Elevators, Escalators, and Moving  
Walks  
§ 1003.7 does not permit any of these  
modes of transportation to be used as  
components of a means of egress. The  
only exceptions are for elevators used as  
an egress component for high-rise build-  
ings per § 403.6.2 or as an accessible  
means of egress per § 1009.4, where they  
are provided with standby power and also  
with operation and signal devices per  
§ 2.27 of ASME A17.1.  
GENERAL EGRESS REQUIREMENTS  
•  
•  
•  
When the slope exceeds 1 in 20, then  
the transition should be made by a ramp.  
We recommend also reviewing the ramp  
requirements in Chapter 11 related to  
accessibility.  
Slopes rising 6" \(152\) or less must be  
equipped with handrails or a floor finish  
that contrasts with adjacent flooring. This is  
to provide visual cues for a shallow ramp,  
which may not be readily visible.  
It is not recommended to use single steps or  
short stairways in any passageway, as such  
steps may be overlooked by occupants and  
present a severe tripping hazard in daily use.  
They are to be avoided whenever possible.  
In addition, passageways with such steps  
are not accessible for persons with mobility  
disabilities.  
•  
Maintain minimum width of egress travel  
around obstructions.  
MEANS OF EGRESS / 183 GENERAL EGRESS REQUIREMENTS  
Design Occupant Load  
§ 1004.1 specifies that means-of-egress facili-  
ties for a building are to be designed to accom-  
modate the number of occupants as computed  
in accordance with Table 1004.5. The occupant  
load is to be based on actual occupant loads  
when it can be determined, as for the number  
of seats in a theater, or by using Table 1004.5,  
where occupant-load factors are assigned to  
determine occupant loads based on use. These  
factors are based on past history of anticipated  
occupant loads for various uses. The code does  
not state requirements regarding rounding. We  
suggest rounding all fractional calculations up  
to the next whole number in typical cases.  
The floor-area allowances in the table are  
based not on the actual physical situation  
within any building but for code purposes, on  
probabilities and observation. The values are  
codified so that they can be used uniformly  
by everyone in determining the exit details;  
i.e., the number and width of the exit compo-  
nents. They are not intended as design program  
guidelines. It is not necessary that every office  
worker have a 150 sf \(13.94 m2\) office even  
though the occupant load factor is 150.  
Per § 1004.5.1, occupant loads may be increased  
beyond those listed in Table 1004.5 as long as  
the means of egress system is sized to accom-  
modate the occupant load. In no case may the  
occupant load calculated under this provision  
exceed one occupant per 7 sf \(0.65 m2\) of occu-  
piable floor area.  
Where there are mixed uses in a building, some  
of which use “gross” floor area calculations per  
Table 1004.5 and others use “net” floor areas,  
the occupant load factors should be applied  
consistently, based on the use of the areas.  
When areas such as toilet rooms are used by  
both assembly areas \(net\) and office areas  
\(gross\), we recommend that the toilet rooms be  
treated as a part of the net area occupant load  
and thus they may be excluded from occupied  
floor area calculations per the definitions found  
in Chapter 2. This interpretation should be con-  
firmed with the AHJ.  
Actual Number  
•  
§ 1004.5 states that for areas without fixed seating,  
the design occupant load shall be based on the  
number of occupants determined by assigning one  
occupant per unit of area from Table 1004.5. For  
areas with fixed seating, however, the actual  
number of fixed seats in a theater will determine the  
occupant load for that space, per § 1004.6.  
•  
Per § 1004.6, occupant loads for areas such as  
waiting areas or wheelchair areas for persons with  
disabilities are to be calculated using Table 1004.5.

Note that the words net and gross used in the  
table are defined in Chapter 2. It is expected that  
the interpretation of these terms will be that net  
refers to the actual area where occupants may stand,  
less the space occupied by building elements and  
not including accessory areas such as corridors,  
stairways, or toilet rooms. Gross would be expected  
to apply to large areas defined by the perimeter  
walls, excluding vent shafts.  
Note also that there are no occupant-load factors for  
such service spaces as restrooms where it can be  
anticipated that the users of those spaces are already  
occupants of the building. It is anticipated that these  
spaces will be considered a part of the gross area per  
the discussion above, and may not be deducted from  
the area used to determine occupant loads where  
gross areas are to be used.

occupant load. This section addresses such  
areas as conference rooms or alcoves, and  
adheres to the principle that each tributary

stream” of the areas being served by a  
means of egress.

There are also occupant load criteria in  
Table 1004.5 for “Concentrated business  
area uses.” Per § 1004.8, the occupant-  
load factor for such concentrated uses as

to be calculated at the actual occupant  
load, or for uses where the occupant load  
may vary, at no less than 50 sf \(4.65 m2\)/

If in doubt about the function you should  
apply, use the more conservative value of  
50 sf \(4.65 m2\)/occupant \(gross\), which will  
yield a higher occupant load.

to the means of egress from a mezzanine, based  
on the assumption that some of the occupants of  
the mezzanine will pass through the floor below  
to get to a common set of exit paths and thus are  
added to the occupant load. When other egress  
paths are provided, those occupants need not  
be added.  
Note that other than times when egress paths  
converge on a story, which is to be considered  
per § 1005.6, the occupant loads from stories  
separate from the one under consideration are  
not to be added to the occupant load for that  
story.

Table 1004.5 has criteria for exhibit galleries

We strongly recommend that more occupants  
be assumed for gallery uses \[maybe a factor  
as low as 7 sf \(0.7 m2\) per occupant\] because  
such spaces often have opening receptions  
or special events with a large number of  
occupants.

to those occupants inside the building, this  
occupant load must be added to the egress-  
capacity calculations. When the occupants can  
be expected to be either inside or outside, but  
not both, the capacity need not be additive.  
The designer should make assumptions about  
uses of spaces with great caution. For example,  
even when a courtyard serves an office area for  
the office occupants only, it is conceivable that  
there could be a public event in the office that  
would have guests and employees occupying  
both spaces. Such special events with crowded  
conditions can be the most conducive to panic in  
an emergency, and egress systems should take  
such possibilities into account.  
Multiple Occupancies  
§ 1004.4 covers the means-of-egress require-  
ments that apply to buildings housing multiple  
occupancies. When there are special egress  
requirements based on occupancy, they apply  
in that portion of the building housing that  
occupancy. When different occupancies share  
common egress paths, the most stringent  
requirements for each occupancy will govern  
the design of the means-of-egress system.

MEANS OF EGRESS / 187 GENERAL EGRESS REQUIREMENTS  
Egress Sizing  
§ 1005 specifies that the capacity of exit path-  
ways be governed by\: the occupant load, the  
hazard of the occupancy, whether the building  
is sprinklered, and whether the path is a stair  
or other component of a means of egress.  
\*  
Note that a reduction in stair widths and  
the width of other egress components  
\(in other than H and I-2 occupancies\)  
for sprinklered buildings is allowed by  
Exception 1 to § 1005.3.1 and § 1005.3.2  
when an emergency voice/alarm system is  
also provided. For stairs the factor is 0.2"  
\(5.1\) per occupant and for other egress  
components the factor is 0.15" \(3.8\)  
per occupant. Since most buildings are  
sprinklered per the IBC, and provision of a  
voice/alarm system is relatively low-cost  
compared to stair width costs, these will  
probably be the sizing factors used by  
most designers.  
The required egress width in unsprinklered  
buildings is based on the occupant load  
served by an egress component multiplied by  
an egress width factor. For stairs the factor is  
0.3" \(7.62\) per occupant and for other egress  
components it is 0.2" \(5.08\) per occupant.  
§ 1005.3.1 states that stairs are to be sized  
based on the occupant load of the indi-  
vidual story served by the stair. Thus, the  
highest occupant load of any story served by  
a stair will determine the minimum size of the  
stair. This is based on observations of the time  
factor, along with their directional nature, in  
determining how people move through egress  
systems. The occupants of the floor below  
are assumed to exit that level before those  
behind them get to the same point in the  
egress system.

A pair of doors may be necessary to  
satisfy egress width requirements.  
The calculated width of other egress  
components, such as corridors, will  
be less than the required width  
calculated for egress stairways  
because of their differing egress  
width factors per § 1005.  
•  
•  
•  
Stairs are required to provide more width  
than corridors since people move more  
slowly in stairways than in corridors or  
passages. Thus a corridor with a given  
occupant capacity will be narrower than a  
stair in the same egress system.  
Based on the principle of maintaining  
capacity, not width, it should be  
permissible to have a narrower egress  
passage width downstream of a  
stairway as long as the required capacity  
is provided. This may be subject to  
interpretation and negotiation between  
the building official and the designer.  
Egress width reductions are tied to  
provision of both sprinklers and a voice/  
alarm system. GENERAL EGRESS REQUIREMENTS  
Per § 1006.3, the means of egress system serv-  
ing any story or occupied roof is to be provided  
with the number of exits based on the aggregate  
occupant load served. But, where stairways  
serve more than one story, only the occupant  
load of each story considered individually need  
be used in calculating the required number of  
exits or access to exits serving that story.  
Per § 1006.3.2, the path-of-egress travel to an  
exit may not pass through more than one adja-  
cent story.

•  
Egress width = A + B

Note that § 1005.4 states that the capacity  
of the egress paths shall not decrease in exit  
capacity in the direction of egress travel. This  
corresponds to the watercourse analogy as  
well. This is further supported by § 1005.6,  
which requires that when egress paths  
merge, the capacity of the egress  
paths serves both tributary areas.  
•  
Egress capacity A •  
Egress capacity B  
The code requires that in buildings or spaces  
needing two means of egress that occupant  
loads be distributed more or less equally  
between exits, not weighted based on prox-  
imity to an exit. Per § 1005.5, the means-of-  
egress system is to be configured such that  
the loss of any one exit or access to one exit  
will not reduce the available capacity to less  
than 50% of the required capacity. This means  
in effect that the egress widths are to be sized  
to make the smallest capacity greater than or  
equal to 50% of the anticipated occupant load.

Because exit doors typically swing in the direc-

swing into paths of egress travel, such as cor-  
ridors. § 1005.7 requires that in such situations\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
The door should project a maximum of 7"  
\(178\) into the required width when fully  
opened against the wall of the passage, and  
The door, when open, should not reduce the  
required width by more than one-half.  
Along narrow corridors, doors should be  
recessed. Minimum recess for a 36" \(914\)  
door would be\:  
36"– 7" = 29" \(914 – 178 = 736\)  
Be sure to provide pull-side door clearance  
for access at recessed doors. See Chapter  
11.  
Nonstructural elements, such as trim and  
similar decorative features, can project into  
the required corridor width a maximum of  
11/2" \(38\) on each side. Handrail projections  
are to be per § 1014.8.  
190 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS GENERAL EGRESS REQUIREMENTS  
§ 1015 and § 1021 from previous editions of  
the code were moved forward to § 1006 and  
§ 1007 in Chapter 10 of the 2015 edition.  
The provisions for the number of exits and  
exit access doorways and their configuration  
are now gathered together in a more rational  
flow for code users to determine how the  
various portions of the means of egress sys-  
tem are to be arranged. After occupant loads  
are determined using § 1004, the capacities  
of the means of egress system are deter-  
mined using § 1005. § 1006 then is used to  
establish the number of means of egress  
required and § 1007 is used to determine  
their arrangement.  
Exit Access Components  
The criteria contained in § 1006 and § 1007  
apply to those components that occur within  
the exit access. Some common terminology  
may also occur in the exit and exit discharge  
portions of the means of egress, but their  
application must be viewed in the context of  
which parts of the means of egress are being  
described by the various code sections.  
Number of Exits and Exit Access  
Doorways  
§ 1006 sets the requirements for the number  
of exit or exit access doorways required from  
any space. Two exits or exit access doorways  
are required when the occupant load exceeds  
the values in Table 1006.2.1 or when the con-  
ditions of the common path-of-egress travel  
distance exceed the requirements of the table.

THE BASICS  
•  
•  
A common-path-of-egress travel is any  
portion of an exit access offering an  
occupant no choice between separate and  
distinct paths of egress travel to two exits.  
It is measured from the most remote point  
in a room to that point where multiple  
paths to separate exits become available to  
occupants.  
Common-paths-of-egress travel include paths  
that split and merge within the exit access  
prior to the location where multiple paths  
lead to separate exits. GENERAL EGRESS REQUIREMENTS  
The basic provision for egress is to provide  
two means of egress for each story except  
under certain circumstances where single  
exits are permitted. The basic egress require-  
ments per story appear in Table 1006.3.3.  
This table leads the code user to believe  
that two means of egress are required, but  
subsequent tables allow several conditions  
where a single exit is allowable.

—  
THE BASICS  
When two exits are required, they are to be  
placed a distance apart equal to one-half the  
diagonal dimension of the space.  
The diagonal measurement line can go  
outside the building footprint. See below for  
reductions allowed at sprinklered buildings.  
The separation distance required in  
§ 1007.1.1 is to be measured from\:  
1\. Any point along the width of the doorway.  
\[We recommend using the door centerline  
to be conservative.\]  
2\. The closest riser at exit access stairs.  
3\. The start of the ramp run at exit access  
ramps.  
There are exceptions to the exit layout for  
corridors and for sprinklered buildings.  
When a 1-hour fire-rated corridor connecting  
interior exit stairways is provided, the exit  
separation may be measured along a direct  
path of travel within the corridor. No minimum  
distance is required between stair enclosures  
except in high-rise buildings as noted below, but  
interlocking or “scissor” stairs that touch can  
only be counted as one exit stairway per  
§ 1007.1.1\. This provision addresses the  
required separation of interior exit stairways in  
the core of office buildings.  
In such instances, the corridor configuration  
connecting the tenant spaces to the interior exit  
stairways allows placement of the interior  
exit stairways closer together than half the  
diagonal distance of the floor without a corridor.  
Note that in high-rise buildings, stair  
separations of 30' \(9144\) or not less than one-  
fourth of the length of the maximum overall  
diagonal dimension apply. See § 403.5.1. Also,  
additional stairs are required in buildings having  
floor levels above 420' \(128 m\) per § 403.5.2.  
In sprinklered buildings, the exits may be  
more closely spaced. Exit doors or exit access  
doorways may be a minimum of one-third the  
diagonal dimension of the area served.  
When three exits are required, two are to  
be placed to comply with the separation  
requirements for two exits and the third is to be  
arranged a reasonable distance apart so that  
if one becomes blocked, the other two will be  
available. Determination of the location of the  
third exit is thus open to interpretation by the  
building official. Means-of-Egress Illumination  
§ 1008.2 requires that the illumination level for a  
means of egress be not less than 1 foot-candle \(11  
lux\) at the walking surface level. The areas to be illu-  
minated should include all three parts of the means-  
of-egress system to be certain that occupants can  
safely exit the building to the public way. In assembly  
areas such as movie theaters, the illumination may  
be dimmed during a performance but should be  
automatically restored in the event of activation of  
the premises’ fire-alarm system. Emergency-power  
requirements are intended to apply to those build-  
ings that require two or more exits, thus exempting  
small structures and residences.  
Emergency-lighting requirements for means of  
egress require an average of 1 foot-candle \(11  
lux\) of illumination within means of egress with a  
minimum of 0.1 foot-candle \(1 lux\) upon initial opera-  
tion. Such systems are allowed to dim slightly over  
the 90-minute life of the emergency operations but  
must not fall below 0.6 foot-candle \(6 lux\) average  
and 0.06 foot-candle \(0.6 lux\) minimum. In Group I-2  
occupancies, failure of any single lighting unit shall  
not reduce the illumination level to less than 0.2  
foot-candle \(2.2 lux\).  
Per § 1008.2.1, exit access stairs and exit stairs are  
to be illuminated at 10 footcandles \(11 lux\) “when  
the stairway is in use.” This is intended to apply  
under normal power conditions and could be con-  
trolled by occupancy sensors or other energy-saving  
techniques.  
Where means of egress lead to a safe dispersal area  
per § 1028.5, that area must be lit with 1 foot-candle  
\(11 lux\) of illumination per § 1008.2.3.  
Accessible Means of Egress  
§ 1009 addresses the egress requirements for people  
with disabilities. The basic requirement is that acces-  
sible spaces in a building must have an accessible  
means of egress. Where more than one means of  
egress is required, based on occupancy or occupant  
load, then at least two accessible means of egress  
are to be provided. Note that this requirement for  
two accessible means of egress applies even when  
three or more exits may be required based on occu-  
pant load. This provision applies only to new con-  
struction; it is not required for alterations to existing  
buildings, although other work in altered areas must  
comply with code requirements for the altered area.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
GENERAL EGRESS REQUIREMENTS  
Stairways in an accessible means of egress must be at  
least 48" \(1219\) wide between handrails. This is to provide  
sufficient width to carry people with disabilities between  
two other people. This requirement does not apply to exit  
access stairways or exit stairs in fully sprinklered buildings.  
Area of Refuge. The code defines “area of refuge” as an  
“area where persons unable to use stairways can remain  
temporarily to await instructions or assistance during  
emergency evacuation.” Temporary is not further defined, so  
the duration of stay is not set. When required, the area of  
refuge must be on an accessible path of travel from the area  
served. The area of refuge must be in a stairway or have  
direct access to an enclosed stairway or to an elevator with  
emergency power.  
The area of refuge must provide space for one 30" × 52"  
\(762 × 1321\) wheelchair space for each 200 occupants of  
the space served. These spaces must not reduce the egress  
width.  
Areas of refuge are not required when an automatic  
sprinkler system is provided per Exception 2 to § 1009.4.2,  
nor are they required in R -2 occupancies, all of which are  
required to be sprinklered and also are generally more  
compartmented than other buildings.  
MEANS OF EGRESS / 195 GENERAL EGRESS REQUIREMENTS  
Accessible Means of Egress \(continued\)  
For buildings with a required accessible floor  
or occupied roof that is four or more stories  
above the level of exit discharge, one acces-  
sible means of egress is to be provided by eleva-  
tor with standby power and signal devices per  
§ 1009.2.1\. The language in this section is very  
confusing. The level of exit discharge is the  
“ground floor” or first story, so the emergency  
power requirements apply to five-story buildings  
or four-story buildings with an occupied roof.  
Note that Exception 1 to this section allows the use  
of a horizontal exit in fully sprinklered buildings in  
lieu of providing emergency power to the elevator.

§ 1010 is a general section that applies to all  
doors, gates, and turnstiles that are part of any  
of the three parts of the means of egress.  
Egress Doors  
§ 1010.1 requires that egress doors be readily  
distinguishable from adjacent construction. They  
should never be blind doors, hidden by decora-  
tive materials.  
Power-Operated Doors  
Where egress doors are power-operated, they  
shall be openable in the event of a power failure.  
Doors with access controls must also have a fail-  
safe mechanism to allow egress in the event of  
power failure. The operation of any egress door  
shall be obvious and not require special knowl-  
edge or effort on the part of the user.  
Revolving Doors  
§ 1010.1.3.1\. Revolving doors may be used  
as egress doors when the leaves of the door  
collapse in the direction of egress and provide  
an aggregate width of egress of at least 36"  
\(914\). For practical purposes, it is desirable that  
each opening be at least the 32" \(813\) minimum  
required for typical doors.

GENERAL EGRESS REQUIREMENTS  
Egress doors should be not less than 80"  
\(2032\) high.  
Egress doors must have a minimum clear  
width of 32" \(813\), measured from the face  
of the door to the stop when the door is open  
90° \(1.57 rad\).  
Practically speaking, this means that egress  
doors should always be 3'0" × 6'8" \(914 ×  
2032\) doors to provide the required minimum  
opening clearances.  
There are minor exceptions for doors in small  
closets or in residences, but these should  
be avoided by the designer. This width  
criteria should also be applied to all doors  
in residential occupancies, even when not  
strictly required by access standards.  
Egress doors should typically be side-hinged  
swinging doors. Per § 1010.1.2.1, they  
must swing in the direction of exit travel  
when serving a room having an occupant  
load of 50 or more in a typical occupancy, or  
when serving any occupant load in a high-  
hazard occupancy. Note that the requirement  
is based on the occupant load of the space,  
not on the occupant load at each door.  
Access criteria limit the force that must  
be exerted on doors to open them. The  
maximum force is 5 pounds \(22 N\) at interior  
doors and 15 pounds \(67 N\) at exterior doors.  
In previous code editions, egress door widths  
were limited to 48" \(1219\) maximum. That  
maximum has been eliminated, but the force  
requirements remain, which will limit door  
widths or require mechanical assistance to  
open doors.  
The capacity and use of revolving doors is  
limited. Revolving doors may be credited for  
no more than 50% of the required egress  
capacity, each door may have no more than  
a 50-occupant capacity, and the collapsing  
force can be no greater than 130 pounds  
\(578 N\) in a revolving door used as an egress  
component.  
Each revolving door must have a side-hinged  
swinging door complying with § 1010.1 in  
the same wall and within 10' \(3048\) of the  
revolving door.  
MEANS OF EGRESS / 197 GENERAL EGRESS REQUIREMENTS  
Landings  
§ 1010.1.5\. There should be a landing or floor  
on each side of a door, and the elevation of  
the floor or landing should be the same. There  
are exceptions in residential occupancies for  
screen doors and at interior stairways to allow  
doors to swing over landings.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
§ 1010.1.5\. Landings are to have a width  
not less than that of the stairway or the  
door, whichever is greater.  
Doors in the open position should not reduce  
the required width or depth of a landing by  
more than 7" \(178\).  
Landings are to be a minimum of 44" \(1118\)  
in length in the direction of travel, except  
they may be 36" \(914\) long in residential  
occupancies.  
For occupant loads of 50 or more, the door in  
any position may not reduce the width of the  
landing to less than half of its required width.  
§ 1010.1.7\. Doors in series must be at  
least 48" \(1219\) apart, not including the  
swing of each door. Thus, where a 3' \(914\)  
wide door swings toward another door, the  
space between them must be at least 7'  
\(2134\) long.  
Exceptions allow power doors operating  
in tandem and storm or screen doors in  
residential occupancies to be closer together.  
198 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Locks and Latches  
§ 1010.2 requires egress doors to be readily  
openable from the egress side without the use  
of a key or special knowledge or effort. The  
unlatching of any door or leaf should not require  
more than one operation. This recognizes the  
directional nature of the egress path and that the  
path serves to make exiting clear and simple for  
the least familiar building occupant.  
Power-operated locks are permissible under  
certain conditions. The space layout must not  
require an occupant to pass through more than  
one delayed or controlled egress locking system  
before entering an exit. Door locks must be deac-  
tivated upon actuation of the sprinkler system or  
automatic detection system. Also, locks must  
have a fail-safe mechanism to allow egress in  
the event of power failure. Mechanisms that  
open the door upon application of a constant  
force to the egress mechanism for a maximum  
of 3 seconds are also allowed.  
GENERAL EGRESS REQUIREMENTS  
•  
•  
§ 1010.2.2\. Doors need to be accessible without  
pinching or grasping the hardware. Lever handles  
meet these criteria.  
§ 1010.2.3\. Door handles, pulls, locks,  
and other operating hardware are to be installed  
from 34" to 48" \(864 to 1219\) above the finished  
floor.  
•  
Per § 1010.2.8, in Group E, Group B educational,  
and Group I-4 occupancies, egress doors from  
classrooms, offices, and other occupied rooms  
are permitted to be provided with locking  
arrangements designed to keep intruders from  
entering the room where all of the following  
conditions are met\:  
1\. The door is capable of being unlocked from  
outside the room with a key or other approved  
means.  
2\. The door is openable from within the room in  
accordance with § 1010.2.  
3\. Modifications may not be made to listed panic  
hardware, fire door hardware, or door closers.  
4\. Modifications to fire door assemblies shall be in  
accordance with NFPA 80.  
•  
§ 1010.2.13\. Delayed egress locking systems  
are to be permitted to be installed on doors  
serving certain occupancies in buildings that are  
equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler  
system. Among these are Group E classrooms  
with an occupant load of less than 50. This  
allows protection of classrooms from intrusion  
while still allowing emergency egress.

Panic and Fire-Exit Hardware  
§ 1010.2.9 contains the provisions for panic  
and fire-exit hardware. Panic hardware is a  
door-latching assembly incorporating a device,  
usually a bar, that releases the latch upon  
the application of a force in the direction of  
egress travel. It is named panic hardware based  
on experience in assembly occupancies where  
people may crush against doors in panic situ-  
ations such that normal hardware is jammed  
by pressure, even if the door opens outward.  
Panic hardware is designed to open the door if  
a person is pressed against it. This hardware is  
always used in conjunction with doors opening  
in the direction of egress.  
Fire-exit hardware is a defined term for a type of  
panic hardware that is listed for use on fire-door  
assemblies.  
Panic or fire-exit hardware is required in Group A  
or E occupancies having occupant loads of 50 or  
more and in Group H occupancies with any occu-  
pant load. Panic hardware is not required in very  
large assembly occupancies such as stadiums,  
where the gates are under constant, immediate  
supervision, as is usually the case.  
Electrical rooms with electrical equipment rated  
at 800 amperes or more must have panic hard-  
ware or fire-exit hardware, and the doors to such  
spaces must swing in the direction of exit travel.  
•  
Per § 1010.2.7, interior stairway means of  
egress doors are to be openable from both  
sides without the use of a key or special  
knowledge or effort, with several exceptions.  
There is often a security concern if doors are  
openable from inside the stairway, as this  
allows movement from one floor to another  
in multistory buildings. The exceptions  
address this issue\:  
1\. The discharge door at the end of the path of  
egress may be locked on the exterior side but  
must be openable from the egress side.  
2\. Doors at the interior side of stairways  
may be locked if they can all be opened  
by remote control and there is a means of  
communications inside the stairway per  
§ 403.5.3.  
3\. Doors may be locked on the stair-side in  
stairways if they are operable from the  
egress side and all locks can be unlocked  
simultaneously by emergency personnel from  
a single location in the building.

Stairways  
§ 1011 covers requirements for the  
design of stairs and stairways. Note  
that per § 1011.1, it is the intent of the  
code that all stairs serving occupied  
portions of a building comply with  
Chapter 10 regardless of whether they  
are part of a means of egress.  
•  
§ 1011.2\. Stairways must be at  
least 44" \(1118\) wide, except when  
serving an occupant load of less  
than 50, where they may be 36"  
\(914\) wide.

§ 1011.3\. Stairs must have at least  
80" \(2032\) of headroom at any  
point.  
•

§ 1011.5\. Stair treads shall have a  
minimum depth of 11" \(279\).  
Stair riser heights shall be 4" \(102\)  
minimum and 7" \(178\) maximum.  
The primary exception to rise  
and run requirements occurs in  
residential and utility uses where  
risers may have a maximum height  
of 7  
3⁄4" \(197\) and treads may have  
a minimum length of 10" \(254\).  
§ 1011.5.4\. Treads and risers are to  
be essentially uniform in dimension  
with a tolerance of 3/8" \(9.5\) plus  
or minus between the smallest and  
largest within any flight.  
•  
•  
•  
Where the top or bottom riser  
abuts a sloping sidewalk or public  
way, the rise may be less than 4"  
\(102\) with a maximum cross slope  
of 8% \(1\:12\) across the width of  
the stair.  
A distinctive marking stripe visible  
in descent and having a slip-

§ 1011.7.3 requires that enclosed usable space  
under either enclosed or unenclosed stairs  
be protected with a minimum of 1-hour fire-  
resistance-rated construction. The only exception  
to this is for stairs in R-2 or R-3 occupancies.  
This requirement applies to similar spaces under  
exterior stairs. The usable space is not to be  
accessed from inside the stair enclosure.  
Note that these requirements do not require  
the underside of a stairway to have a fire-rated  
enclosure merely because there is usable space  
under the stairs. These requirements apply  
only when the usable space itself is enclosed.  
However, note that an open space under exterior  
stairs is not to be used for any purpose.

of travel, equal to the width of the stairway.  
Landings serving a straight-run stairway,  
however, need not be greater than 48" \(1219\)  
in length, even if the stair width exceeds 48"  
\(1219\).  
Walking surfaces of stairways are to be  
stable and slip-resistant.  
Exterior stairs must be designed to avoid  
water accumulation.  
Any single flight of stairs may not exceed  
12' \(3658\) in vertical rise between floors or  
landings.  
Where stairs have a rise greater than 12'  
\(3658\), then intermediate landings are  
required. Curved stairs, winding stairs, and spiral stairs are  
allowable as egress elements in limited use, pri-  
marily in residential occupancies.  
Spiral stairs have specific provisions relating stair  
tread width to the diameter of the stairway. They  
may be used as a component of a means of egress  
only within residences or in spaces not more than

THE BASICS  
Per § 1011.12.1 roofs and penthouses  
containing elevator equipment that must  
be accessed for maintenance are required  
to be accessed by a stairway. This  
requirement applies even in smaller  
buildings \(three stories or less\) that normally  
don’t need roof access.  
Minimum headroom is the same as for stairs,  
80" \(2032\).  
Ramps in a means of egress may not exceed  
a 1-in-12 \(8%\) slope.  
Other ramps may not exceed a 1-in-8 \(12.5%\)  
slope. It is recommended that the designer  
never use ramps steeper than 1 in 12 \(8%\),  
even in nonaccessible paths of travel. The  
use of 1-in-12 ramps makes those paths of  
travel accessible and safer for all building  
users.  
The clear width of a ramp between handrails,  
if provided, shall be 36" \(914\) minimum.  
The width of ramps in a means of egress  
shall not be less than the width of corridors  
as required by § 1020.3. Once the width of  
an egress ramp is established, it should not  
be reduced in the direction of egress. Ramps \(continued\)

have the capability to remain illuminated for  
up to 90 minutes after power is cut off, either  
by battery, internal illumination, or connection  
to an emergency power source.  
Exit signs must be clearly visible and be not  
more than 100' \(30 480\) from any point in an  
exit access corridor.  
Tactile exit signs accessible for persons  
with disabilities are to be provided at  
doors to areas of refuge, exterior areas for  
assisted rescue, exit stairways or ramps, exit  
passageways, and the exit discharge.  
Per § 1013.4 a sign stating EXIT in visual  
characters, raised characters, and Braille  
complying with ICC A117.1 is to be provided  
adjacent to each door to an area of refuge,  
an exterior area for assisted rescue, an exit  
stairway or ramp, an exit passageway, and  
the exit discharge. This is supplementary to  
the exit sign above the door.  
Where exit signs are required in Group R-1  
occupancies, additional low-level exit signs  
are to be provided in all areas serving guest  
rooms in the R-1 areas. The low-level sign is  
to be flush-mounted to the door or wall. Handrails  
§ 1011.11 specifies that stairways are to have  
handrails on each side complying with § 1014,  
except in certain limited cases, mostly dwell-  
ings. Handrails are not required on decks hav-  
ing a single-level change between two areas

Handrails must extend horizontally for 12" \(305\) beyond  
the top riser of a stairway.  
Handrails must also continue their slope for the depth of one  
tread beyond the bottom riser. Bends or transitions that occur  
between flights or to transition to a guard are permitted to  
exceed the maximum height of 38" \(965\).  
Note that the original ADA standard required an additional 12"  
\(305\) horizontal extension at the bottom of a stairway. This is  
not required by the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design.  
When handrails do not continue to the handrail of an  
adjacent flight, they are required to return to a wall or  
to the walking surface.  
Only portions of a stairway width within 30" \(762\) of a handrail  
may count toward the width required for egress capacity.  
This means that intermediate handrails may be required for  
stairways that are required by occupant load to be wider.  
Stair width more than 30" \(762\) from handrails does not count  
toward required egress capacity.  
Note that “monumental” stairs that are wider for design  
purposes do not require intermediate rails if their occupant  
load does not dictate a wide stair.  
Railings are to be continuous except in residences where  
newel posts and turnouts are acceptable.  
Handrail extensions are not required where the handrails  
are continuous between flights.  
Type I Circular Rail  
Circular handrails are to have a minimum diameter of  
1  
1⁄4" \(32\) and a maximum diameter of 2" \(51\).  
Handrails require a minimum clearance from the wall of  
1  
1⁄2" \(38\) to allow for grasping.  
There are to be no sharp or abrasive elements to  
interfere with the ability of the stair user to grasp the handrail.  
Edges must have a minimum radius of 0.01" \(0.25\).  
•  
Projections, such as stringers and baseboards, are allowed at  
and below each handrail, but they cannot project more than a  
total of 4

Chapter 2 defines “guard” as a building compo-  
nent located at or near the sides of an elevated  
walkway that minimizes the possibility of a fall  
to a lower level. The intent of these require-  
ments is that any building occupant moving  
through the means of egress will be protected  
from falling from the edges of the means of  
egress. Such guards are not required when  
they would impede the intended use of parts of

be 36" \(914\) in height when not more than 3  
stories above grade in height.  
Bends or transitions in handrails that occur  
between flights or transition to a guard in R-2  
and R-3 occupancies are permitted to exceed  
the maximum handrail height of 38" \(965\).  
Guards are to be designed with a pattern  
from the floor up to 34" \(864\) such that a  
sphere 4" \(102\) in diameter cannot pass  
through. \[Openings in R-2 and R-3 sleeping  
units at the open sides of stairs may allow  
passage of a 4.375" \(111\) sphere.\]  
From a height of 36" to 42" \(864 to 1067\), the  
pattern may be more open, allowing a sphere  
up to 4 3/8" \(111\) in diameter to pass.  
42" \(1067\) high minimum above walking  
surfaces  
The triangular space between the tread, riser,  
and rail may allow a sphere no more than 6"  
\(152\) in diameter to pass.  
In industrial occupancies where public access  
does not occur, railings may have spacing up  
to 21" \(533\). Such guards must be provided at  
rooftop mechanical equipment or roof access  
openings located closer than 10' \(3048\) from  
the roof edge. § 1016 through § 1021 cover the exit  
access portion of the means of egress that  
leads from any occupied portion of a build-  
ing to any component of an exit—an exteri-  
or exit door at grade, interior exit stairways  
and passageways, horizontal exits, and  
exterior exit stairways. Exit access there-  
fore includes the functional areas of the  
building along with various levels of egress  
pathways that will be discussed in detail.  
As will become clear as we proceed  
through the analysis, there is a hierarchy  
of protection requirements for various ele-  
ments of the exit access. As the number  
of occupants increases or as occupants  
get closer to an exit, these requirements  
become more stringent.  
Exit Access Design Requirements  
§ 1006 and § 1007 contain the key design  
requirements for exits and exit access  
doorways, addressing such issues as the  
number and arrangement of exit paths. Exit  
access travel distances, as well as travel  
through intervening rooms and spaces, are  
addressed in § 1016 and § 1017.  
•  
Per § 1016.2.1, exit access through an  
enclosed elevator lobby is permitted.  
Where two or more means of egress  
are required, access to not less than  
one of the required exits must be  
provided without travel through the  
enclosed elevator lobbies required by  
§ 3006\. Where the path of exit access  
travel passes through an enclosed  
elevator lobby, the level of protection  
required for the enclosed elevator lobby  
is not required to be extended to the  
exit unless direct access to an exit is  
required by other sections of this code.

EXIT ACCESS  
•  
The exit access portion of a means of egress  
leads from any occupied point in a building to  
an exit.  
•  
Exit access doorways lead from one  
component of the exit access to another exit  
access component. Note that an exit access  
doorway refers to the opening and may or  
may not actually have a door.  
•  
Note also that the terms “exit” and “exit  
access doorway” are used without distinction  
in the general sections of § 1005, § 1006,  
and § 1007.  
•  
Note too that exit access stairways are part  
of the exit access.  
•  
§ 1016.2 does not allow egress from a  
room or space to pass through intervening  
spaces unless they are accessory to each  
other and there is a discernible path-of-  
egress travel to an exit. These adjacent  
spaces may not be high-hazard occupancies  
unless the rooms are of the same occupancy  
group.  
•  
There is no hierarchy of size for rooms that  
are accessory to each other. A larger room  
may egress through a smaller room if they  
are functionally related.  
•  
Egress paths are not to lead through  
kitchens, storerooms, closets, or similar  
spaces; through rooms that can be locked to  
prevent egress; or through sleeping areas or  
bathrooms in dwelling units.

Exit Access Travel Distance  
§ 1017 and Table 1017.2 provide the maxi-  
mum length of exit access travel distances,  
measured from the most remote point in  
the exit access space to the entrance to an  
exit along a “natural and unobstructed path  
of egress travel.”  
Egress distances are measured in the exit  
access space under consideration. They  
are not the total length of the means of  
egress but rather the distance an occupant  
must travel within the exit access portion  
of the means of egress before entering the  
next higher level of protection in the means  
of egress, the exit. Thus, these distances  
would apply on the upper floor of a high-  
rise building, but only until the occupant  
entered the exit stair enclosure and began  
moving through the exit portion of the  
means of egress.  
See § 1019 for a discussion of how to treat  
open stairways, which are now considered  
by § 1017.3.1 to be part of exit access.

Egress paths may pass through kitchens that are  
part of the same dwelling unit or guestroom.  
Occupants should not be required to exit through  
a space controlled by another tenant or owner.  
For example, egress paths may not pass through  
adjacent tenant spaces, dwelling units, or  
sleeping units. Each occupant’s access to the  
means of egress should be under their own  
control to the maximum extent possible.  
Note that a provision allows tenant spaces within  
other larger tenant spaces to exit through the  
space they are contained within if they occupy  
less than 10% of the larger area. This allows  
separate tenancies such as coffee bars to exit  
through a larger retail store under the control of a  
different tenant.  
Group I-2 occupancies are those where the  
occupants are not capable of self-preservation  
without assistance, such as in hospitals and  
nursing homes. In these occupancies, § 407.4.1  
requires that hospital rooms or suites have an  
exit access door leading directly to an exit access  
corridor. The exceptions apply to detailed hospital  
design considerations that we will not consider  
here.  
The path length is to be measured along the  
natural and unobstructed path-of-egress travel.  
The determination of the natural path must  
take fixed obstacles and obvious pathways into  
account. The potential location of furniture,  
especially large fixed furniture, such as library  
shelving, should be taken into account when  
measuring distances.  
On the other hand, in speculative office or  
commercial buildings, the designer may not have  
any idea of the ultimate use of the space and  
must use the 90° method. The designer should  
use common sense and care in determining travel  
distances.  
The measurement of exit access travel distance  
must include the central path along unenclosed  
stairs and ramps and be measured from the most  
remote part of the building that makes use of the  
egress pathway. EXIT ACCESS DESIGN REQUIREMENTS  
For most occupancies, the allowable exit access travel dis-  
tance is 200' \(60 960\) without a sprinkler system and from  
250' to 300' \(76 200 to 91 440\) with a sprinkler system. The  
table below graphically represents the relative lengths of  
exit access travel allowable for various occupancies.  
Note that allowable exit access travel distances are  
increased in buildings with automatic sprinkler systems.  
This provision acknowledges the increased level of safety for  
occupants in sprinklered buildings. Note also that there are  
numerous footnotes to Table 1017.2 regarding occupancy-  
specific travel distances in such specialized building types  
as covered malls, atriums, and assembly spaces.

MEANS OF EGRESS / 211 EXIT ACCESS DESIGN REQUIREMENTS  
Exit Access Stairways and Ramps  
Exit access stairway requirements were heavily  
revised in the 2012 IBC to try and standardize inter-  
pretation and enforcement of egress requirements  
for enclosed “exit” stairs and unenclosed “exit  
access” stairs. Both may be components of the  
means of egress. The primary design difference is  
that exit access stairs, as part of the exit access,  
have travel distance restrictions, whereas exit stairs  
do not. Only appropriately enclosed stairs are to be  
considered to be “exits.” The requirements for open  
exit access stairways have now been relocated to  
§ 1019.  
“Interior Exit Stairways,” discussed in § 1023, are  
defined as being an exit component that serves to  
meet such egress design requirements as number  
of means of egress or exit access travel distance \(by  
ending the travel distance where the exit enclosure  
begins\). They are to provide a protected \(rated\) path-  
of-egress travel to an exit discharge or a public way.

Exit access travel distance is measured

Note that per § 1006.3 the path-of-egress  
travel to an exit may not pass through more  
than one adjacent story. This could be seen  
as limiting the use of open exit access  
stairways connecting up to four stories per  
Exceptions 3 and 4 to § 1019.3, unless the  
criteria for added protection at the stairs  
using those exceptions are met.  
212 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED

THE BASICS  
Exit Access Stairs  
§ 1019.3 calls for exit access stairs to be  
enclosed, but provides numerous exceptions  
that may be applied for other than Group I-2  
and I-3 occupancies. Among the most relevant  
for designers are\:  
1\. Exit access stairways that connect only two  
adjacent stories and do not open to other  
stories are not required to be enclosed.  
2\. Exit access stairways within a single  
residential dwelling unit or sleeping unit  
in Group R-1, R-2, or R-3 occupancies and  
connecting four or fewer stories are not  
required to be enclosed.  
3\. Exit access stairways serving and contained  
within a Group R-3 congregate residence or  
a Group R-4 facility are not required to be  
enclosed.  
4\. Exit access stairway openings are not  
required to be enclosed provided that the  
building is equipped with an automatic  
sprinkler system, the area of the floor  
opening between stories does not exceed  
twice the horizontal projected area of the  
exit access stairway, and the opening is  
protected by a draft curtain and closely  
spaced sprinklers. In other than Group B and  
M occupancies, this provision is limited to  
openings that do not connect more than four  
stories.  
5\. Exit access stairways within an atrium  
complying with the provisions of § 404 are  
not required to be enclosed.  
6\. Exit access stairways and ramps in open  
parking garages that serve only the parking  
garage are not required to be enclosed.  
7\. Vertical exits need not be enclosed in Group  
A-5 buildings, such as outdoor stadiums,  
where the entire means of egress is  
essentially open.  
8\. Exit access stairways and ramps that connect  
a balcony, gallery, or press box and the  
main assembly floor in occupancies such  
as theaters, places of religious worship,  
auditoriums, and sports facilities need not be  
enclosed.  
9\. Exterior exit access stairways or ramps  
between occupied roofs. \(See illustration.\) EXIT ACCESS DESIGN REQUIREMENTS  
Corridors  
§ 1020 provides for the design of corridors, which  
comprise the next level of occupant protection in  
the exit access above the aisle. “Corridor” is now  
a defined term in the code as an enclosed exit  
access component that defines and provides a  
path-of-egress travel to an exit. It is important to  
note and remember that corridors are not exits;  
they are a component of the exit access.  
The table on page 214, based on Tables 1020.2  
and 1020.3, provides information about the occu-  
pant load, fire-resistance rating, and dimensions  
of corridors. Widths shown are minimums, which  
should be compared with width requirements  
calculated per § 1005.3.2.  
•  
•  
In exit access systems with multiple  
components, it can be visualized that aisles  
lead to corridors that, in turn, lead to exits.  
While layouts are subject to interpretation by  
the building official, a corridor typically is a  
space longer than it is wide, separated from  
adjacent spaces by walls, and having two  
clear choices of egress leading to two exits.  
There may be variations in the details of this  
arrangement but the basic components will  
almost always be present in a corridor.  
•  
•  
Corridors may require a fire-resistance rating of  
at least 1 hour, based on the occupancy group  
where they occur. Several occupancies allow  
the use of unrated corridors in sprinklered  
buildings.  
Corridors at exterior walls may have  
unprotected openings when the walls are  
allowed to be unrated per Table 705.5 and  
unprotected openings are allowed per Table  
705.8.

214 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Dead Ends  
§ 1020.5 prescribes a maximum length for dead-  
end corridors. This is to avoid having occupants  
backtrack after they have gone some distance  
down a corridor before discovering that there is  
no exit or exit access doorway at its end. Note  
that per the table on page 214, the allowable  
length of dead-end corridors may be modified in  
certain occupancies.  
Air Movement in Corridors  
§ 1020.6 prohibits corridors from being used as  
part of the air-supply or return system. This is to  
allow the corridor to remain a separate atmo-  
sphere from the spaces it serves to the maximum  
extent possible. There are several exceptions to  
the corridor air-supply requirements\:  
1\. Corridors may be used for makeup air  
exhaust systems for rooms such as toilet  
rooms, dressing rooms, or janitors’ closets if  
the corridor is directly supplied with outdoor  
air at a rate to keep a positive pressure in  
the corridor.  
2\. Corridors in dwelling units may be used to  
convey return air.  
3\. Corridors in tenant spaces of less than  
1,000 sf \(93 m2\) may be used to convey  
return air.  
4\. Corridors may have incidental air movement  
resulting from abutting pressurized rooms  
in health care facilities, but the corridor  
cannot be the primary source of supply or  
return air.  
EXIT ACCESS DESIGN REQUIREMENTS  
•  
•  
•  
Dead ends in corridors are generally limited  
to 20' \(6096\) in length. See synopsis of  
Tables 1020.2 and 1020.3 for exceptions  
where the distance may be 50' \(15 240\) in  
sprinklered buildings.  
Dead-end provisions apply where there are  
corridors that branch off the main egress  
path and may thus lead an occupant to  
proceed to the end of a side corridor that  
does not have an exit, before having to  
return to the main egress path.  
When only one exit is required, the  
provisions for dead-end corridors do not  
apply. Single exits have relatively low  
occupant loads and the premise of a single  
exit assumes a directional nature to the  
egress path where the way to the exit will  
be clear.

Dead-end corridors are not limited in length  
when their length is less than 2  
1⁄2 times the  
least width of the dead end.  
•  
Per § 1020.6.1, corridor ceilings may be  
used as a return-air plenum if one of the  
following conditions apply. \(These are not  
listed as exceptions, and all need not apply  
at once\)\:  
1\. The corridor is not required to be of fire-  
resistance-rated construction.  
2\. The corridor is separated from the plenum  
by fire-resistance-rated construction.  
3\. The air handlers serving the corridor are  
shut down by smoke detectors at the units.  
4\. The air handlers serving the corridor are  
shut down upon detection of sprinkler  
waterflow.  
5\. The plenum space is a component of an  
engineered smoke control system.  
MEANS OF EGRESS / 215 EXIT ACCESS DESIGN REQUIREMENTS  
Corridor Continuity  
§ 1020.7 stipulates that when a fire-resistance-  
rated corridor is required, the fire rating is to be  
maintained throughout the egress path from  
the point that occupants enter the corridor in  
the exit access until they leave the corridor at  
the exit.  
•  
Where the path-of-egress travel within a fire-  
resistance-rated corridor to the exit includes  
travel along unenclosed exit access stairways  
or ramps, the fire resistance rating shall be  
continuous for the length of the stairway or  
ramp and at the connecting corridor on the  
adjacent floor leading to the exit. This does not  
require an enclosure at the stairs or ramps, but  
the wall, floor/ceiling assembly, and stair or  
ramp construction ratings should be the same  
as for the corridor containing them.  
Egress Balconies  
§ 1021 contains the requirements for exterior  
balconies that are used for egress in the exit  
access. Minimum requirements for clearance  
and width, as well as restrictions for dead ends  
and projections, are the same as for corridors.  
They are to be designed to minimize accumula-  
tion of snow or ice that could impede egress.  
•  
The long side of exterior egress  
balconies must be at least 50%  
open and arranged to minimize  
the accumulation of smoke or  
toxic gases.

THE BASICS

•  
Fire-resistance-rated corridors are not to be  
interrupted by intervening rooms. There are  
limited exceptions to these provisions\:  
1\. Foyers, lobbies, or reception rooms constructed  
with the same fire resistance as required for  
corridors are not considered intervening rooms.  
2\. Per Exception 2 to § 1020.7, enclosed elevator  
lobbies as permitted by Item 1 of § 1016.2 are  
not construed as intervening rooms.  
3\. Elevator lobbies are to be provided in accordance  
with the requirements and exceptions contained  
in § 3006.  
•  
Per Exception 3 to § 1020.5, elevator lobbies off  
of corridors need not be considered as dead-end  
corridors when their width exceeds 2  
1/2 times  
their depth.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Exterior egress balconies are to have a minimum  
10' \(3048\) separation distance from adjacent  
property lines, other portions of the building, or  
adjacent buildings on the same site, measured  
from the exterior edge of the egress balcony.  
The distance to buildings on the same site may  
be reduced if the exterior walls and openings of  
the adjacent building are protected in accordance  
with § 705 based on fire separation distance.  
Since occupants may pass by doors or windows  
in getting to the exits, wall and opening  
protectives may be required as for corridors. The  
wall and all openings are to be protected if there  
is only one means of egress from the balcony.  
When two means of egress are provided, then  
only those openings in the dead ends will require  
protectives. The requirements of § 1022 through § 1027 apply  
to the level of fire resistance, the quantities, the  
dimensions, and the occupant capacity of exits.  
The exit is the intermediate portion of a means  
of egress, located between the exit access and  
the exit discharge. Unlike the exit access, where  
building functions share the occupied spaces with  
egress uses, exits are generally single-purpose  
spaces that function primarily as a means of  
egress. Once a certain level of occupant protection  
is achieved in the exit, it is not to be reduced until  
arrival at the exit discharge.  
Exit Design Requirements  
§ 1022 through § 1027 set out the general design  
requirements for exits. The requirements for spac-  
es with single exits that used to be located with  
exit provisions have been moved to § 1006.

§ 1023.1 presumes per the definition in Chapter  
2 and the text in the section that all interior  
exit stairways are enclosed interior exit stair-  
ways that provide for a protected path-of-egress  
travel. Interior exit stairways connecting four sto-  
ries or more shall have a 2-hour fire-resistance  
rating. Per § 1023.2, interior exit stairways  
connecting less than four stories are to have  
a minimum 1-hour rating. Enclosures at exit  
ramps have the same requirements as for stair-  
ways. The number of stories connected includes  
basements, but mezzanines are not counted as  
additional stories.

—THE BASICS Openings and Penetrations  
§ 1023.4 and § 1023.5 limit openings and pen-  
etrations in interior exit stairways and ramps  
to those necessary for exit access to the enclo-  
sure from normally occupied spaces and for  
egress from the enclosure. There are similar  
provisions in § 1024.5, and § 1024.6 for exit pas-  
sageways. These sections recognize the primary  
use of exit components as pathways for egress.  
Opening protectives for both exit passageways  
and interior exit stairways shall be as required by  
§ 716\. Thus, 1-hour fire-rated walls will require  
1-hour-rated doors per Table 716.1\(2\). Where  
higher fire ratings for interior exit stairways are  
required, the rating of exit-passageway construc-  
tion and opening protectives should match as  
well.  
§ 1023.3 requires interior exit stairways to ter-  
minate at an exit discharge or a public way.  
Per the exception to this section, an exit pas-  
sageway may extend the interior exit stairway  
to an exit discharge or to a public way. When an  
exit passageway is provided, it must be separated  
from the interior exit stairway by a fire barrier per  
§ 707, by a horizontal assembly per § 711, or both.

Penetrations  
§ 1023.5 prohibits penetrations into or through  
interior exit stairways and ramps except for  
equipment and ductwork necessary for inde-  
pendent ventilation or pressurization; sprinkler  
piping and standpipes; electrical raceways for  
fire department communication systems; electri-  
cal raceways serving the interior exit stairway  
and ramp and terminating at a steel box not  
exceeding 16 in2 \(0.010 m2\); or structural ele-  
ments supporting the interior exit stairway or  
ramp or enclosure, such as beams or joists.  
Such penetrations shall be protected in accor-  
dance with § 714. Exception\: Membrane pen-  
etrations shall be permitted on the outside of  
an interior exit stairway and ramp. Such pen-  
etrations shall be protected in accordance with  
§ 714.4.2\. There shall not be penetrations or

not, between adjacent interior exit stairways

stairs and ramps when they are protected per  
§ 714.4.2.  
Per Exception 2 to § 1023.3.1, separation  
between an interior exit stairway or ramp and  
the exit passageway extension is not required  
where there are no openings into the exit  
passageway extension. The condition shown  
here would require a door since there is an  
opening into the exit passageway that is not  
a door leading to a direct exit or to the exit  
discharge.  
Per Exception 3, separation between an interior  
exit stairway or ramp and the exit passageway

interior exit stairway and the exit passageway  
extension are pressurized in accordance with  
§ 909.20.5.

Ventilation for exit enclosures is to be served  
directly from outside or from ductwork enclosed  
in fire protection as required for shafts.  
The intent of these requirements is that vertical  
and horizontal exit enclosures should be as  
separate from the occupied spaces as possible  
to provide a safe means of egress from those  
spaces.  
In malls, areas such as mechanical and  
electrical rooms may open onto the exit

§ 1026 provides for horizontal exits, a unique  
concept for exiting because they provide  
an intermediate area of escape rather than  
a complete means of egress to grade. The  
concept is based on the assumption that, by  
providing a high degree of fire-resistive sep-  
aration between two segments of a building,  
occupants can pass through the separation,  
which is essentially a fire-compartment wall,  
and be safe from the danger that caused the  
need to egress.

EXIT DESIGN REQUIREMENTS  
A horizontal exit is a wall that completely  
divides a floor of a building into two or  
more separate exit access areas in order to  
afford safety from fire and smoke in the exit  
access area of incident origin. The horizontal  
exit essentially creates separate buildings  
on each floor level to allow exiting to occur  
from one protected area into another without  
entering exit enclosures or exit passageways.  
Horizontal exit separations must extend  
vertically through all levels of a building …  
… unless horizontal floor assemblies having  
a fire-resistance rating of not less than 2  
hours with no unprotected openings are  
provided.  
The essential characteristics of a horizontal  
exit are as follows\:  
•  
The separation must be of at least 2-hour  
construction.  
•  
Opening protectives are based on the fire  
rating of the wall.  
Interconnection by ductwork between the  
sides of the horizontal exit is not allowed  
unless the duct or air transfer opening is  
provided with fire/smoke dampers.  
Horizontal exits may not serve as the only  
exit from a portion of a building. Where two  
or more exits are required, not more than  
one-half of the exits may be in the form of  
a horizontal exit. The code states “not more  
than one-half of the total number of exits or  
total exit minimum width or required capacity  
shall be horizontal exits.”  
For many buildings, using this concept  
enables the omission of at least one stairway  
or egress pathway. Only one stairway need  
be provided for each segment, and the  
horizontal exit can be used as the second exit  
for each segment.  
At least one refuge area exit must lead  
directly to the exterior or to an interior exit  
stair or ramp.  
MEANS OF EGRESS / 221 EXIT DESIGN REQUIREMENTS  
§ 1026.4 specifies that the refuge area to which  
a horizontal exit leads shall be of sufficient size  
to accommodate 100% of the original occupant  
load of the area in which refuge is sought, plus  
the occupant load anticipated from the adjoin-  
ing compartment. The capacity of such refuge  
floor area shall be determined by allowing 3 sf  
\(0.28 m2\) of net clear floor area per occupant.  
The area of stairs, elevators, and other shafts  
shall not be counted.  
Note that the anticipated occupant load from  
the adjoining compartment is to be based on  
the capacity of the horizontal exit doors entering  
the refuge area or on the total occupant load  
of the adjoining compartment, whichever is  
less. In cases where there is a relatively small  
occupant load but minimum door widths are  
specified elsewhere in Chapter 10, this provision  
allows the smaller total occupant load from the  
adjoining compartment to govern rather than the  
larger capacity load that the doors could actually  
accommodate.  
Where the horizontal exit also forms a smoke  
compartment, the capacity of the refuge area  
shall be determined as follows\:  
•  
In Group I-2 occupancies, allow 6 net sf  
\(0.56 m2\) per ambulatory care recipient or  
other occupant and 30 net sf \(2.8 m2\) per  
nonambulatory care recipient  
•  
In Group I-3 occupancies, allow 6 net sf \(0.56  
m2\) per occupant.  
•  
In Group I-1, Condition 2 occupancies, allow  
15 net sf \(1.4 m2\) for each care recipient and  
6 net sf \(0.56 m2\) for other occupants.  
•  
In ambulatory care facilities, allow 30 net  
sf \(2.8 m2\) for each nonambulatory care  
recipient.  
•

222 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
The theory underlying the horizontal  
exit involves moving occupants from  
an area impacted by an emergency to  
another safe area of refuge. A building  
designed with a horizontal exit has  
two adjacent areas that may serve as  
both exit access and horizontal exit. To  
accommodate the anticipated number  
of occupants, the area to be considered  
as a horizontal exit must accommodate  
its own occupant load plus 100% of  
the anticipated occupant load from the  
adjoining compartment.  
This additional load is calculated at  
3 sf \(0.28 m2\) per occupant of net  
clear area, unless creating a smoke  
compartment in a hospital, jail, assisted  
living, or ambulatory care facilities. This  
recognizes that in an emergency people  
can be in tighter quarters and still egress  
safely. For occupancies where there  
may be ambulatory and nonambulatory  
patients, see list to the left.  
The application of the design criteria  
takes into account the direction of exit  
flow. The downstream area receiving  
the occupants from upstream must be  
able to accommodate both its normal  
occupant load and that of the occupants  
from the adjacent space.  
Only in cases where a horizontal exit  
may function in both directions must  
both areas have more exit capacity than  
is normally required for the area itself.  
A two-way exit is allowed when the  
exit access design requirements are  
independently satisfied for each  
exit access area.  
The design of the exit access capacity  
for the building segment serving as  
the refuge area shall be based on the  
normal occupant load served and need  
not consider the increased occupant  
load imposed by persons entering such  
refuge area through horizontal exits. § 1028 contains the provisions for the design  
of the exit discharge. The exit discharge is the  
third and final portion of the means of egress.  
It begins where building occupants leave the  
exit portion of the means of egress and ends  
when they reach the public way. There is some  
flexibility on the part of the building official  
to determine when occupants have gone far  
enough from the structure in question to be  
safe, and in these cases, the exit discharge may  
lead through an egress court. Egress courts are  
defined as a court or yard that provides access  
to a public way.

EXIT DISCHARGE  
The exit discharge is to be at grade or

level egress travel outside the building is  
considered part of the exit discharge. There  
is no limit to the length of the path of travel  
in the exit discharge.  
The exit discharge may not reenter the  
building. Thus once occupants leave the  
exit they may not reenter exits, even  
enclosed exits.

Per § 1019.3, Exception 6, exit access

exit discharge at these stairs may be open

are met\: 5 sf \(0.46m2\) per person; 50' \(15 240\)

identified as a safe dispersal area, with safe path  
of travel from the building.

•  
•  
Prior code editions had criteria for reductions in  
egress width in the exit discharge. The code now  
just requires that the minimum egress width be  
maintained throughout this path. We recommend  
tapering the reductions to prevent occupants  
being trapped in tight corner conditions when the  
egress path is fully occupied in an emergency.  
This is another application of using the water  
flow analogy to promote smooth egress flows.  
Egress width beyond the narrowing cannot be  
less than the minimum required egress width up  
to the end of the exit discharge path.  
226 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS EXIT-DISCHARGE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS  
Exit-Discharge Components  
Per § 1028.4 exit-discharge components are pre-  
sumed to be outside the building envelope and  
are thus required to be sufficiently open to pre-  
vent the accumulation of smoke or toxic gases.  
Egress Courts  
§ 1029 requires egress courts to comply with the  
code’s general capacity provisions and normal  
requirements for clear width and door encroach-  
ment.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Egress courts are open spaces that provide  
access to a public way from one or more  
exits.  
Doors may encroach into this space but  
must be compliant with § 1005.7 in not  
reducing the required width or capacity of  
the means of egress.  
Egress courts less than 10' \(3048\) wide are  
to be of 1-hour-rated construction for 10'  
\(3048\) above the floor of the court.  
Openings in such conditions are to have  
3/4-hour-rated opening protectives that are  
fixed or self-closing, except in Group R-3  
occupancies or where the court serves  
an occupant load of less than ten.  
Per § 1029.2, the required capacity of  
egress courts is to be as specified in  
§ 1005.1, but the minimum width shall  
be not less than 44" \(1118\), except for  
egress courts serving Group R-3 and U  
occupancies, which are to be not less than  
36" \(914\) in width. The required capacity  
and width of egress courts is to be  
unobstructed to a height of 7' \(2134\).  
MEANS OF EGRESS / 227 ASSEMBLY EGRESS  
§ 1030 contains egress requirements spe-  
cific to assembly occupancies that supple-  
ment the general requirements located  
elsewhere in Chapter 10. Very large  
assembly occupancies typically provide  
smoke-protected seating to avoid having  
excessive egress widths. The number of  
such large assembly occupancies that  
are designed and constructed every year  
are so small as not to warrant treatment  
in this book. However, there are several  
basic principles that apply to assembly  
occupancies that should be understood.

Second means of egress besides main exit\:  
320/2 = 160 occupants  
Buildings, rooms, or spaces used for  
assembly purposes that have more than  
300 seats are to have a “main exit” per  
§ 1030.2\. This exit is to be sized to  
accommodate not less than one-half of the  
occupant load of the assembly space. The  
main exit is to be on a public way or have a  
ready access path at least 10' \(3048\) wide  
leading to a street or public way.  
In addition to the main exit, each level of  
assembly areas for 300 or more occupants  
are to have additional means of egress  
serving at least one-half of the occupant  
load of that level.  
Where the layout and use of the assembly  
area is such that there is not a well-defined  
main exit, it is acceptable to distribute the  
exits around the perimeter as long as the  
total width of egress is at least 100% of  
the required width.  
Balconies used for assembly purposes and  
having an occupant load of 50 or more are  
to have two means of egress, from each  
side of the balcony.  
Per § 1019.3, Exc. 8, interior exit access  
stairs may be open between the balcony,  
gallery, or press box and the main assembly  
floor in occupancies such as theaters, places  
of religious worship, auditoriums, and sports  
facilities. •

one of the other exits.  
Since there are more than 300 occupants,  
one exit must be a “main exit” and sized  
to accommodate at least one-half of the  
occupant load per § 1030.2.  
MEANS OF EGRESS / 229 EMERGENCY ESCAPE  
Residential R-2 occupancies that make use of  
the single exit provisions of Tables 1006.3.4\(1\)  
and 1006.3.4\(2\) as well as Group R-3 and R-4  
occupancies \(which require only a single means  
of egress\) are required by § 1031 to have egress  
openings for emergency escape and rescue.  
These are in addition to normal paths of egress  
leading out of rooms in such occupancies. These  
are to provide a way out of sleeping rooms  
for the occupants and a way into those rooms for  
rescue personnel in emergencies.  
§ 1006.3 and § 1031, when read together, do not  
require emergency escape and rescue windows  
in fully sprinklered R-2 buildings that have two  
exits on floors below the fourth story where  
dwelling sleeping units are located.  
Basements and all sleeping rooms below the  
fourth story in buildings that have only a single  
exit are to have at least one emergency escape  
and rescue opening in each sleeping room.  
These are to open directly onto a public street,  
public alley, yard, or court. There are exceptions  
to this requirement applicable to certain occu-  
pancies, but we recommend provision of such  
openings in all residential occupancies where  
it is practical.  
Per Exception 5 to § 1031.2, individual dwelling  
and sleeping units in Groups R-2 and R-3, where  
the building is equipped throughout with an  
automatic sprinkler system, sleeping rooms in  
basements are not required to have emergency  
escape and rescue openings provided that the  
basement has one of the following\:  
5.1 One means of egress and one emergency  
escape and rescue opening, or  
5.2 Two means of egress.  
Minimum Size  
•  
Per § 1031.3, emergency escape and  
rescue openings are to have a minimum  
net clear opening of 5.7 sf \(0.53 m2\); grade  
floor openings may be reduced in net area  
to 5 sf \(0.46 m2\).  
•  
•  
Minimum net clear width of 20" \(508\).  
Minimum net clear height of 24" \(610\).

230 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS 11  
# Accessibility  
Chapter 11 regulates the design and construction of “facilities for accessi-  
bility to individuals with disabilities.“ The terms of federal law and of state  
code modifications often expand coverage of local codes far beyond the  
basic code requirements. The designer must understand that many states  
have significantly different, locally developed accessibility requirements; in  
some cases, states have rewritten Chapter 11 completely. The basic code  
provisions should therefore be reviewed carefully against federal criteria  
as well as state and local amendments. The likelihood of significant and  
extensive local variation from the basic IBC is higher for this chapter than  
for any other in the code. The designer must be certain to use the correct  
accessibility code for a specific project.  
The provisions for accessibility to existing buildings are found in the  
International Existing Building Code \(IEBC\). The existing building provisions  
are therefore not examined in this chapter. Note that we believe that  
several portions of the “Supplementary Accessibility Requirements” of  
the code Appendix E apply in most conditions covered by the ADA or local  
amendments; we will therefore discuss Appendix E as part of this chapter.  
The designer should verify that status of the adoption of this Appendix by  
the local AHJ. Because of the interrelationship of scoping provisions, the  
authors assume that Appendix E will be adopted. We will therefore treat  
Chapter 11 as containing both the body of the code and the appendix. DESIGNING FOR ACCESSIBILITY  
Making buildings accessible to persons  
with disabilities is an increasingly impor-  
tant design requirement. It has been a  
significant issue since the passage of the  
Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\) in 1990,  
along with the access provisions contained  
in the Fair Housing Act as amended in 1988.  
The model codes have long incorporated  
requirements for accessibility that are intended  
to be coordinated with the requirements of the  
ADA. However, the designer must remember  
that plan review by the building official is  
only for compliance with the provisions of the  
building code. The model codes are typically  
not considered to be equivalent substitutions  
for the ADA, and compliance with the code  
is no guarantee of compliance with the ADA.  
Therefore, no designer should rely solely on  
the code to determine access-compliance  
requirements. Every project should also be  
carefully reviewed against the provisions of  
the ADA to assure compliance with federal  
law. Remember that approval by the building  
official has no bearing on the applicability  
of the ADA. The building official does not  
review for ADA compliance and has neither  
authority nor responsibility to enforce this  
federal law. The ADA is enforced only through  
legal action, and obtaining a permit is no  
guarantee of ADA compliance.  
The ADA Accessibility Guidelines \[2010 ADA  
Standards for Accessible Design \(2010 ADA  
Standards\)\], published by the Department  
of Justice and the Access Board, went into  
effect for mandatory application on March  
15, 2012\. The technical criteria contained  
in the 2010 ADA Standards are generally  
well-coordinated with the applicable  
reference standard, ICC A117.1. However, we  
recommend designers carefully review the  
IBC, ICC A117.1, and the 2010 ADA Standards  
to help assure accessibility compliance both  
for scoping and for technical requirements.  
The code basis for access clearances and  
reach ranges is primarily for people who use  
wheelchairs. It is important to remember  
that the definition of disability also includes  
sensory and cognitive impairments, not just  
mobility impairments. Designers must also  
accommodate people with visual impair-  
ments and people with hearing impairments.  
Provision for access by mobility-impaired  
people will accommodate most disabilities,  
but the designer must also be certain to  
accommodate other disabled groups, such  
as people of short stature, in a coordinated  
fashion. A design solution for one group of  
disabled people should not adversely impact  
another group with different disabilities.  
Accessibility to buildings is monitored closely  
by a large number of advocacy groups. They  
review the provision of, or lack of access to,  
buildings on an ongoing basis. A challenge to  
the accessibility of a building is among the  
most likely post-occupancy code questions  
that can arise after the completion of a  
project. Any decisions that lead to a lack of  
access are subject to scrutiny over the life of  
the project. Our advice is\: If the applicability  
of accessibility requirements is in doubt, the  
designer and building owner should always  
opt to provide the access.  
The code requires that buildings and facilities  
be designed and constructed to be accessible  
in accordance with the code and the detailed  
dimensional requirements contained in the  
referenced standard, ICC A117.1, referenced  
hereafter simply as A117.1.  
The provisions of Chapter 11 focus on  
scoping, telling the designer and building  
official where provisions are to apply and in  
what quantities. For example, scoping sets  
forth such items as the number of required  
accessible rooms in hotel accommodations.  
The dimensions and technical requirements  
for such accessible hotel rooms are contained  
in A117.1. The designer must therefore have  
a current reference copy of A117.1 to be able  
to comply with the access requirements of  
the code. It is critical that you are using the  
latest version of A117.1.  
While designers should read and familiar-  
ize themselves thoroughly with the detailed  
requirements of A117.1, we will only touch  
on small areas of that standard here. A117.1  
has a strong resemblance to the 2010 ADA  
Standards. However, we reiterate that the  
designer must consult both the locally modi-  
fied code and the ADA to be certain of  
compliance.  
232 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT  
The designer must also be completely familiar  
with the Americans with Disabilities Act  
\(ADA\), particularly the 2010 ADA Standards for  
Accessible Design \(2010 ADA Standards\). The  
2010 ADA Standards set forth the fundamental  
federal design criteria for access. The ADA is  
a civil-rights law and applies under different  
circumstances than the code. It also may be  
applied retroactively for existing buildings as  
opposed to the existing building code, which  
applies to additions, alterations, or repairs.  
It should be presumed from the beginning  
of a design project that both the 2010 ADA  
Standards and the code, as amended by local  
code modifications, apply to the project. A  
detailed comparison of the applicability  
and potential conflicts between the federal  
guidelines, local modifications, and the code  
is beyond the scope of this book, but designers  
must not only review the application of the code  
to projects but also the 2010 ADA Standards  
and local modifications as well.  
Designers should pay particular attention to the  
requirements for door clearances and landings  
contained in A117.1. The requirements for clear  
and level landings and for clearances at the latch  
side of doors depend on the direction of approach  
to the door by persons with mobility impairments.  
The provision of space in the floor plan for these  
clearances is essential during the initial design  
phases of a project.  
The designer must consider the approach con-  
figuration and the side of approach to determine  
which criteria to apply. If these clearances are not  
provided at the outset of planning it will be very  
difficult to provide such clearances later without  
major revisions to the floor plans. It is essential  
that such clearance criteria for doors and for Type  
A and B dwelling units, designed and constructed  
to be in accordance with A117.1, be understood  
early and incorporated into the plans.  
•  
•  
•  
Study the diagrams in A117.1 to understand  
the criteria for provision of required clearances.  
The clearances are to allow wheelchairs to  
clear door swings, to allow maneuvering  
around obstacles, and to allow wheelchairs  
to pivot and turn.  
It is acceptable to demonstrate alternative  
means of providing such maneuvering  
room, but the designer must understand  
wheelchair movements and design criteria  
in the same way one understands how a  
car moves through a parking lot or a truck  
approaches a loading dock. The same  
understanding should be gained of reach  
ranges for people seated in wheelchairs  
to allow the designer to correctly place  
operating switches or equipment.  
Be especially conscious of ranges of  
dimensions for accessible reach to things  
like light switches and door handles \[e.g.,  
side reach range is 15" \(380\) to 48" \(1229\)\].  
Items located beyond the reach range  
are considered code violations, even if  
only by a fraction of an inch. There are no  
construction tolerances that allow placing  
things outside of a permitted dimensional  
range.  
ACCESSIBILITY / 233 DEFINITIONS  
Accessible Route  
The intent of an accessible route is to allow  
persons with disabilities to enter a building,  
get into and out of spaces where desired  
functions occur, and then exit the building. It  
is also necessary that support functions such  
as toilets, telephones, and drinking fountains  
be accessible. The goal is the integration of  
people with disabilities into the full function  
of a facility with a minimum of atypical  
treatment. Such unequal treatment could be  
considered to be a civil rights violation.  
The concept of “universal design” is useful  
to keep in mind. The goal of universal  
design is to make facilities accessible to the  
widest possible range of people, regardless  
of mobility, physical ability, size, age, or  
cognitive skills.  
The designer should bear in mind all types  
of disabilities when designing accessible  
routes. Protruding objects on a wall may  
affect people with visual impairments and,  
of course, changes in grade, such as ramps  
or steps, impact people in wheelchairs.  
The requirements for “accessible means of  
egress,” discussed in Chapter 10, recognize  
that getting people with disabilities into  
a building under normal conditions may  
not allow them to exit under emergency  
circumstances. See the provisions for such  
egress in § 1009.  
# P  
234 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
•  
•  
•  
•  
The basis of accessible design is the idea  
of an accessible route. The definition of  
“accessible route” in Chapter 2 uses the  
words continuous and unobstructed. Any  
usable path for people with disabilities  
must not cut them off from the spaces or  
elements of the building that they have a  
right to use. This route is often referred to in  
other code sections or access documents as  
the “path of travel.”  
Ramps having a slope of 1\:12 and  
shallower and complying with the technical  
requirements of A117.1 are acceptable for  
use in accessible routes.  
A sloped surface with a pitch of 1\:20 and  
shallower is not considered a ramp. It is  
acceptable to use such slopes in accessible  
routes if level landing areas are provided at  
doors or changes in direction, as required by  
A117.1.  
The path of travel extends to the edge of the  
project site. People with disabilities often  
rely on public transit, and it must be possible  
to traverse the site and reach the building  
from pedestrian access points. Dwelling Unit Types  
There are three broad categories of acces-  
sible dwelling units addressed in the code.  
The definitions for these units are contained  
in Chapter 2. The definitions all refer back to  
ICC A117.1 for the descriptions of the detailed  
requirements for each type of unit. The units  
can be generally described, in descending  
order of accessibility, as follows\:  
•  
•  
•  
Accessible units \(with the “A” always  
capitalized\), which are fully wheelchair  
accessible at the time of first occupancy;  
“Type A” units, which are adaptable units,  
with clearances for wheelchair access  
built in and provisions such as blocking for  
grab bars to allow them to be modified to  
have access approaching the level of fully  
acccessible units;  
“Type B” units, which meet or exceed  
Fair Housing Act requirements and are  
wheelchair friendly but not accessible.  
They generally allow tighter spaces than  
Accessible or Type A units.  
These requirements impact the space  
requirements for single-level multifamily  
housing and multiple-level buildings where  
elevators are provided. Designers of Group-R  
occupancies should study the scoping  
requirements carefully. Note also that while  
these code revisions are intended to conform  
to Federal Fair Housing Act requirements,  
those requirements should be reviewed as  
well, so that the designer may be assured  
of compliance with both federal and local  
requirements.  
Type A dwelling unit  
Type B dwelling unit  
•  
•  
DEFINITIONS  
Definitions and requirements for Type A and  
B dwelling units have been incorporated  
into the code to bring the code requirements  
in line with the Federal Fair Housing  
Act Guidelines \(FFHA\). The designer has  
the option under given conditions of  
providing fully Accessible units per A117.1  
\(Accessible units\) or adaptable units \(Type  
A or B\) in residential projects. The scoping  
requirements for these dwelling units are  
contained in § 1108. The plan dimension  
requirements are essentially the same  
for both Accessible and Type A units, as  
clearances must be provided for future  
accessibility in adaptable units. Type B units  
are intended to meet or exceed the Fair  
Housing Act requirements but are not held  
to the higher levels that Accessible and Type  
A units must meet.  
Certain accessibility features, such as grab  
bars, lowered counters, and clear space  
under cabinets, may be provided after  
occupancy in adaptable units. Construction  
features, such as convertible cabinetry and  
wall blocking for grab bars, are necessary  
so that the conversion to an Accessible  
unit may be made readily, without major  
remodeling.  
ACCESSIBILITY / 235 SCOPING REQUIREMENTS  
§ 1103.1 states that the requirements for acces-  
sibility apply both to buildings and to the sites  
where they are located. The accessible route is  
typically considered to extend to the boundaries  
of the site. Every path of travel may not need to  
be accessible, but a readily located accessible  
route must be provided inside and outside of the  
building and on the site.  
Exceptions  
§ 1103.2 specifies the exceptions to access  
requirements, and these exceptions are distrib-  
uted among sections in other chapters of the  
code. The exceptions apply in general to low  
occupancy spaces and those where provision of  
access would be disproportionate to the utility of  
the space. However, it is also worth noting once  
again that the exceptions noted in the code may  
not correspond to federal or local laws and regu-  
lations, and must be carefully reviewed.  
Specific exceptions to accessibility in the IBC  
include the following items\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Individual workstations are not required to  
be accessible but must be on an accessible  
route. Thus aisles leading to individual  
workstations must be of accessible width.  
Note that typically areas under 300 sf  
\(30 m2\) in area and more than 7" \(178\) above  
adjacent areas are exempt. This exception  
does not apply to raised courtroom stations  
in accordance with § 1109.4.1.4.  
Raised or lowered areas in places of religious  
worship that are less than 300 sf \(30 m2\)  
and located 7" \(178\) or more above or below  
the finished floor and used primarily for the  
performance of religious ceremonies are not  
required to comply with this chapter.  
Detached residences, such as single-family  
homes and duplexes, along with their  
sites and facilities, are not required to be  
accessible.  
Utility buildings \(Group-U occupancies\) not  
open to the general public or required to  
have accessible parking are exempt from  
accessibility requirements.  
Where a day-care facility is part of a dwelling  
unit, only the portion of the structure used  
for day care is required to be accessible. The  
converse, however, is also that where day-  
care facilities are provided in dwelling units,  
the day-care portion must be accessible.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Construction sites need not be accessible.  
Raised areas, areas with limited access,  
equipment spaces, and single-occupant  
structures, such as guard stations, catwalks,  
crawl spaces, elevator pits, and some  
tollbooths, are not required to be accessible.  
R-1 occupancies with five or fewer sleeping  
rooms that are also the residence of the  
proprietor are not required to be accessible.  
The nonresidential portions of live/work  
units are to be accessible. The residential  
portion of each live/work unit is to be  
evaluated as a residential unit.  
Walk-in coolers and freezers are not  
required to be accessible where they are  
intended for employee use only, but only  
when accessed from an employee-use area.  
Large walk-in coolers that serve public-use  
areas, such as those found in a “big-box”  
retail store, should be assumed to be used  
by the public and should be accessible.  
Local access requirements should be  
verified with the local AHJ.  
When dealing with accessibility requirements,  
especially for new construction, the designer’s  
first assumption should be that all areas and all  
functions used by the public should be acces-  
sible. It is also a prudent assumption that all  
employee areas should be accessible to people  
with disabilities, except for specific service  
areas not typically occupied by either the public  
or employees.  
•  
Because of the potential for local or federal  
variations, use the exceptions with great  
caution!  
Note that many temporary facilities, such  
as tents or public-use facilities, are not  
exempt from access requirements. These  
are covered by the wording of the first  
scoping paragraph, § 1103.1, that mentions  
buildings and structures, temporary or  
permanent.  
•  
236 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS § 1104 requires that at least one accessible  
route be provided at site arrival points, from  
public transportation stops, accessible park-  
ing and loading zones, public streets, and  
sidewalks within the site. The only exception  
to this requirement is for a large site where  
elements are spread out along a vehicu-  
lar access route that is not in itself acces-  
sible. This assumes that all people on the site  
are moving from one location to another by  
vehicle and that there is not a separate inac-  
cessible pedestrian route for people without  
disabilities. The wording seems to require that  
an accessible route must be provided where  
a pedestrian path is included as part of the  
site path-of-travel system. This is consistent  
with the idea that persons with disabilities  
receive equal treatment as pedestrians. Note  
that this exception does not apply to buildings  
where there are Type B units; in such cases,  
an accessible route from site arrival points  
would need to be provided. Note also that  
§ 1111 has been added to Chapter 11, cover-  
ing access to recreational facilities.  
•  
•  
ACCESSIBLE ROUTES  
Mezzanines and stories must be  
connected by an accessible route unless  
their aggregate area is not more than  
3,000 sf \(278.7 m2\). This minimum size  
exemption does not apply when these  
spaces house health care providers,  
transit facilities, government buildings, or  
separate tenant spaces in multiple-tenant  
Group-M occupancies. There are also  
limited exceptions for other occupancies,  
but in general every effort should be made  
to provide at least one accessible route to  
all usable spaces within a building.  
# P  
Within a building, at least one accessible  
path of travel is to be provided from  
accessible entrances to each portion  
of the building. It cannot pass through  
kitchens or service spaces. The accessible  
route must not be seen as a second-class  
way of moving about in the building. The  
accessible route should correspond to  
or be near the general circulation path.  
Where circulation paths are interior and  
thus protected from the elements, the  
accessible route must be on the interior as  
well to provide equality of access.  
ACCESSIBILITY / 237 ACCESSIBLE ENTRANCES  
§ 1105 requires that at least one main entrance,  
and at least 60% of the total of all public  
entrances, to a building must be accessible.  
Where there are separate tenant space entries  
the same criteria apply to each tenant space.  
The only exceptions are entrances not required  
to be accessible and service entrances or load-  
ing docks that are not the only entry to a building  
or tenant space. Where service entrances are  
the only entrance, they are to be accessible.  
When entrances to the building serve accessi-  
ble adjunct facilities, such as accessible parking  
areas, passenger loading zones, transit facili-  
ties, or public streets, then at least one of each  
of the entries serving those functions must be  
accessible. The design of the accessible route  
and entrance systems cannot require people  
with disabilities to traverse long distances to  
get from one accessible facility to another.  
•  
•  
Per § 1105.1.7 at least one accessible  
entrance must be provided to each  
tenant in a facility, with the exception of  
self-service storage facilities that are not  
required to be accessible.  
# P  
This building entrance also may not need  
to be accessible, because a total of at  
least 60% of the other entrances provide  
access to an accessible route. If there are  
only two public entrances then both must  
be accessible to meet the 60% criteria.  
•  
If this is just a service entrance, it  
need not be accessible as the requisite  
number of public entrances is provided.  
But if this is a public entrance,  
the required number of accessible  
entrances needs to be measured  
against the overall 60% requirement.  
238 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS The requirements of § 1106 highlight the nature of how  
Chapter 11 operates. The requirements for parking are  
stated in terms of quantities, not as criteria for how to lay  
out accessible stalls. The stall dimensions are contained  
in the reference standard, A117.1. The scoping require-  
ments for parking are per Table 1106.2, which stipulates  
the minimum number of accessible parking stalls based  
on the total number of parking spaces provided.  
•  
•  
The accessible stalls are to be included in the total  
parking count, but they must be set aside for use  
by people with disabilities. The basic criterion for  
residential occupancies is that at least 2% of parking  
spaces be accessible. Other occupancies vary  
significantly. Parking requirements at rehabilitation  
and outpatient facilities are higher, being 20% of the  
total. This recognizes that the population of users of  
such facilities is much more likely to have disabilities  
that would require accessible parking.  
For every six accessible spaces, or fraction thereof,  
one space is to be a van-accessible space. This is  
a space with a larger access aisle than the typical  
accessible parking space. For small parking areas,  
where only one space is provided, it must be van  
accessible. The van space counts toward the total  
of required accessible spaces. All accessible parking  
counts in the grand total of parking spaces, both  
accessible and nonaccessible.  
•  
§ 1106.3 sets out requirements for accessible parking  
for Groups I-1, R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4.  
1\. In Group R-2, R-3, and R-4 occupancies that are  
required to have “Accessible,” “Type A,” or “Type  
B” dwelling units or sleeping units, at least 2%  
but not less than one of each type of parking  
space provided must be accessible. We presume  
“type of parking space” refers to various types of  
parking\: e.g., surface parking, public garage parking,  
carports, etc. See also Item 3 below.  
2\. In Group I-1 and R-1 occupancies, accessible  
parking is to be provided in accordance with Table  
1106.2.  
3\. Where at least one parking space is provided for  
each dwelling unit or sleeping unit, at least one  
accessible parking space is to be provided for each  
“Accessible” and “Type A” unit.  
4\. Where parking is provided within or beneath a  
building, accessible parking spaces shall also  
be provided within or beneath the building. This  
is an expression of the idea of equal treatment  
for all persons regardless of disability, which is  
fundamental to how accessibility requirements are  
meant to be applied.

PARKING AND PASSENGER LOADING FACILITIES

•  
Example\: Parking for 400  
vehicles; 8 accessible  
spaces minimum;  
2 of the 8 must be  
van-accessible since  
there are more than  
6 accessible spaces  
required.  
When the triggering  
number is exceeded by  
any fractional amount  
the requirement rounds  
to the next whole  
number of spaces.  
•  
5' \(1524\) minimum width for access  
aisles adjacent to van-accessible spaces;  
may be 8' \(2438\) wide if the van parking  
space is 8' \(2438\), which results in the  
same overall width total of 16' \(4877\).  
\[5' \(1524\) width of access aisle dis-  
courages parking in the access aisle.\]  
It is recommended that the van access  
aisle should always be on the passenger  
side of van with van heading into space.  
\[This is a requirement in some state’s  
local access regulations.\]  
11' \(3353\) minimum width for accessible  
van spaces.  
5' \(1524\) minimum width for access aisles.  
8' \(2438\) minimum width for accessible  
auto spaces.  
Access aisles are considered part of the  
accessible route.  
Parking is to be located such that the  
accessible route of travel is the shortest  
possible path from the parking area to  
the nearest accessible building entrance.  
Note that this requirement can be  
construed to place accessible parking  
immediately adjacent to an entrance  
no matter how the circulation in the  
parking area is configured. The definition  
of “possible” can be the subject for  
debate and subject to non-uniform  
interpretation by building officials and  
disabled access advocates. For buildings  
with multiple accessible entrances and  
adjacent parking, accessible parking  
is to be dispersed in such a way as to  
have accessible parking nearby each  
accessible entrance.  
Accessible passenger loading zones  
are to be provided at medical facilities  
where people stay longer than 24 hours,  
whether as long-term residents or as  
medical patients. Loading zones are also  
required when valet parking services are  
provided.  
•  
•  
Accessible passenger loading zones must  
have a minimum overhead clearance of  
114" \(3658\).  
5' \(1524\) minimum width for adjacent  
access aisle at passenger loading zones.  
ACCESSIBILITY / 239 MOTOR-VEHICLE-RELATED FACILITIES  
A new scoping section for motor-vehicle-related  
facilities, § 1107, is now part of Chapter 11. This  
new section is intended to address the increase  
in electrical vehicle charging stations \(EVCS\).  
The new code requirements are intended to  
clarify that such public charging stations must be  
accessible since they are intended for use by the  
general public. This is further reinforced by the  
exception to § 1107.2, which states that these  
requirements for provision of accessible EVCS  
are not required in housing of R-2, R-3, or R-4  
occupancies. Note that R-1 occupancies, which  
are hotels used by the traveling public, are not  
excluded from the requirements.

THE BASICS  
•  
•  
•  
Where there are different charging  
systems \(i.e., Tesla vs. standard IEEE plugs  
or DC quick chargers\), there are to be  
accessible stalls for each type of system.  
Not less 5% of the vehicle spaces served  
by an EVCS are to be accessible, but no  
fewer than one for each type of EVCS  
provided.  
Accessible EVCS spaces are to  
comply with the requirements for a  
van accessible parking space that is  
132" \(3350\) minimum in width with an  
adjoining access aisle that is 60" \(1525\)  
minimum in width.  
•  
Per § 1107.3, standard fuel-dispensing  
systems are to be accessible. The intent of the dwelling unit and sleeping unit  
requirements in § 1108 is that hotels, motels, mul-  
tifamily dwellings, and Group I institutional uses be  
accessible to the maximum extent that is practical,  
and in quantities that will serve the anticipated  
demand by people with disabilities. The determina-  
tion of the quantities required is not always empiri-  
cally based, but the designer must use the scoping  
required by the code to design the facility. Common-  
use and recreational facilities open to all residents or  
to the public are to be accessible as well.  
Accessible Dwelling Units and  
Sleeping Units  
§ 1108.2 divides accessible dwelling units and  
sleeping units into Accessible, Type A, and Type B  
units. We will use the word “units” here to include  
both dwelling and sleeping units unless indicated  
otherwise. “Sleeping units” are defined in Chapter  
2 as rooms or spaces in which people sleep. This  
could include dormitory, hotel or motel guest rooms  
or suites, or nursing home rooms.  
Accessible Spaces  
The requirements of § 1108.3 arise from the  
requirements for accessible routes. Rooms and  
spaces that serve accessible units and that are  
available to the general public, or for the use of  
the residents in general, are to be accessible. This  
includes such areas as toilet and bathing rooms,  
kitchens, living and dining areas, and exterior  
spaces, including patios, terraces, and balconies.  
There is an exception related to recreational facili-  
ties that we will discuss later in commentary about  
§ 1111.  
Accessible Route  
§ 1108.4 requires that at least one accessible route  
connect the primary building or site entrance with  
the front entry to each accessible dwelling unit. An  
accessible route should also connect the acces-  
sible units to areas that serve the units, such as  
laundry rooms or community rooms. One exception  
to this provision applies on steep sites where build-  
ings with dwelling units are connected by nonac-  
cessible vehicular routes, similar to the provisions  
of § 1104.1. In such cases, accessible parking at  
each accessible facility is acceptable.  
There are a number of exceptions to § 1108.4  
that exempt certain upper-level areas from access  
requirements when accessible elements are avail-  
able on an accessible level.

Accessible units are described in detail in ICC  
A117.1. They are to be laid out and constructed  
to be wheelchair accessible at the time of first  
occupancy.  
“Type A” units are also described in detail in  
A117.1. They are “adaptable” units, with clearances  
for wheelchair access built in and provisions, such  
as blocking for grab bars, to allow them to be  
modified into Accessible units.  
“Type B” unit criteria in A117.1 are intended to be  
consistent with the intent of the criteria of the U.S.  
Department of Housing and Urban Development  
\(HUD\) Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines. Type  
B units are intended to supplement, not replace,  
Accessible units or Type A units. These units are  
wheelchair friendly, but not as fully accessible as  
the other two types of units.  
Decks and patios in Type B units that are usually  
dropped at exterior doors for drainage and weather  
protection need not be accessible if the step is  
less than 4" \(102\) and the exterior area has an  
impervious paving surface.  
Note that this exception does not apply to Type A  
dwelling units. Type A units are to be accessible;  
Type B units are adaptable. The code assumes that  
when a Type B unit is adapted the access can be  
provided at the time of adaptation.  
Per § 1108.4, in Group I-3 facilities, an accessible  
route is not required to connect stories or  
mezzanines where Accessible units, all common-  
use areas serving Accessible units, and all public-  
use areas are on an accessible level.  
In other than Group R-2 dormitory housing provided  
by places of education, in Group R-2 facilities with  
Accessible units complying with § 1108.6.2.3.1,  
an accessible route is not required to connect  
stories or mezzanines where Accessible units, all  
common-use areas serving Accessible units, and  
all public-use areas are on an accessible route.  
In Group R-1, an accessible route is not required  
to connect stories or mezzanines within individual  
units, provided the accessible level meets the  
provisions for Accessible units and sleeping  
accommodations for two persons minimum and a  
toilet facility are provided on that level.  
In congregate residences in Groups R-3 and R-4, an  
accessible route is not required to connect stories  
or mezzanines where Accessible or Type B units, all  
common-use areas serving Accessible and Type B  
units, and all public-use areas serving Accessible  
and Type B units are on an accessible route.  
ACCESSIBILITY / 241 DWELLING UNITS AND SLEEPING UNITS  
Group I Occupancies  
Group I occupancies have detailed special  
requirements in § 1108.5 that recognize the  
institutional nature of this occupancy group.  
Typically, the requirements for the number of  
accessible spaces are higher than for other  
occupancies as these facilities have a higher  
proportion of people with disabilities than other  
occupancies. Where facilities specialize in  
treatment of conditions affecting mobility, up to  
100% of the rooms may be required to be acces-  
sible. The designer should verify the percent-  
age of Accessible and Type B units required by  
§ 1108.5 based on the prospective use of an  
I occupancy.

Group R Occupancies  
The trigger for various scoping requirements  
in Group R occupancies is the number of  
sleeping spaces and the number of dwelling  
units. A percentage of each type of multi-unit  
residential facility must be accessible, with the  
number and diversity of the types of accom-  
modation increasing with the size and type of  
the residential facility. These provisions do not  
apply to individual single-family residences,  
but do apply to single family residences where  
there are four or more such units per building.

THE BASICS  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
§ 1108.6.1.2 requires every dwelling unit to be a  
Type B dwelling unit in residential occupancies,  
such as Group R-2 and R-3 occupancies, where  
there are four or more dwelling units. See also  
the comment at left regarding I occupancies.  
As buildings get larger, Type A dwelling units are  
required. For example, in Group R-2 occupancies  
containing more than 20 dwelling units, at least  
2%, but not less than one, of the dwelling units  
must be a Type A dwelling unit. Because they  
have a higher degree of accessibility, Type A  
units may be substituted for Type B units, but not  
vice versa.  
Per § 1108.6.1.1, as the number of units  
increases, the number of required Accessible  
units increases.  
Accessible dwelling and sleeping units are to be  
provided per Table 1108.6.1.1. Where a building  
contains more than 50 dwelling units or sleeping  
units, the number of Accessible units are to be  
determined per building.  
Where each building in a group of buildings  
contains 50 or fewer dwelling units or sleeping  
units, all dwelling units and sleeping units on  
the site are to be considered together when  
determining the total number of Accessible units.  
Accessible units are to be dispersed among the  
various classes of units.  
Note that additional accessible features such  
as roll-in showers are required as the number of  
units increases. Thus, Table 1008.6.1.1 requires  
2 Accessible units for up to 50 total units, with  
no roll-in shower requirements. However, when  
there are between 51 and 75 units, a roll-in  
shower is to be provided in one of the 4 required  
Accessible units; the other 3 units cannot be  
provided with a roll-in shower.  
To apply the numerous exceptions to these  
requirements, the designer must further  
understand the distinction for Type B dwelling  
unit requirements, based on whether the units  
in question are ground-floor units or multistory  
units.  
A ground-floor dwelling unit has a primary  
entrance and habitable space at grade.  
A multistory unit refers to a single dwelling unit  
with multiple floors where there is habitable  
space or a bathroom space \(which is not normally  
considered habitable space\) on more than one  
floor level. Note that the definition of “multistory“  
does not refer to a single-level dwelling unit  
located above grade in a multistory building. DWELLING UNITS AND SLEEPING UNITS  
General Exceptions  
The exceptions for accessible dwelling units  
depend on specific circumstances and do not  
apply equally to Type A and B dwelling units.  
The exceptions are\:  
B B B B B B  
1\. In walk-up type buildings, where no  
elevator is provided, neither Type A nor  
Type B dwelling units need be provided  
on floors other than the ground floor. The  
number of Type A dwelling units is to be  
provided based on the total of all units in  
the building, not just at the ground floor. It  
should be assumed that in buildings with  
more than 3 and fewer than 21 units, the  
ground-floor units should all be Type B  
units.  
Type B units on this floor only  
2\. In podium-type buildings without elevators,  
where the dwelling units occur only above  
the ground floor, only the dwelling units  
on the lowest floor need comply with the  
requirements of this section. Thus, on the  
lowest level of a building with 4 to 20  
units, all of the units on the lowest level  
of dwelling units need be Type B units,  
but only on that level. When the total  
dwelling unit count exceeds 20, then Type  
A dwelling units would need to be provided  
as required in this section, but again only  
on the lowest dwelling unit level.  
3\. A multilevel dwelling unit without an  
elevator is not required to comply with  
the requirements for Type B dwelling  
units. Thus, townhouse-style multilevel  
dwelling units are not required to be Type  
B units. When elevator service is provided  
to one floor of the unit, however, that  
floor must meet Type B requirements and  
a toilet facility provided. It is not stated  
that this facility requires access, but it  
should be designed as such. If an elevator  
accesses any level serving a multilevel  
unit, that level must meet the requirements  
noted above.  
•  
To meet the intent of accessibility  
provisions, we recommend that the  
ground floors of townhouses that are on  
an accessible route be made adaptable,  
and that an adaptable, or fully accessible,  
powder room be provided for use by guests  
on the ground floor.

THE BASICS  
•  
\> 30" \(762\)  
4\. Where there are multiple buildings on a  
site that do not have elevators, and the  
site has varying grades, then the need to  
provide Type B dwelling units should be  
examined in the context of the entire site.  
•  
•  
Where site grades prior to development  
are 10% or steeper, then the units on that  
slope are exempt from the ground-floor  
Type B dwelling unit requirement. This  
recognizes that under such site conditions,  
it is unlikely that an accessible route can  
be easily provided.  
In no case, however, should the total  
number of Type B dwelling units be less  
than 20% of the total number of ground-  
floor dwelling units on the entire site.  
So even where the site is steeply sloped  
throughout, accessible route provisions  
must be made to satisfy the 20% minimum  
requirement.  
5\. Neither Type A nor Type B dwelling  
units need be provided where a site is  
susceptible to flooding and an accessible  
route cannot be provided such that the  
grade cannot be within 30" \(762\) of the  
floor within 50' \(15 240\) of the entry, or  
the grade exceeds 10% between the  
pedestrian or vehicular arrival point and  
the primary entrances of the units. This is  
very specific site criteria. This exception  
should be used with great caution, as  
the conditions may be subject to design  
solution by site grading.  
•  
The arcane and somewhat ambiguous  
nature of these and most other exceptions  
to accessibility provisions in this code  
and the Fair Housing and ADA Standards  
only reinforce our basic recommendation  
regarding provision of access in buildings.  
If it seems that access may be required  
by the code, then it should be provided.  
Providing access does the building and  
occupants no harm, while its absence can  
lead to lack of access and legal problems  
that are best avoided. § 1109 establishes supplemental accessibil-  
ity requirements for special occupancies. The  
wording “special occupancies” is somewhat  
misleading in that the occupancies discussed  
in this section are the same as those described  
throughout the code, and their occurrence in  
buildings is not unusual or special in most  
cases. However, the occupancies described in  
this section do not necessarily correspond to  
the conventional occupancy groups discussed in  
other parts of the code.  
Assembly Areas  
In assembly areas with fixed seating, the fol-  
lowing provisions are required\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
§ 1109.2.1 requires that services be  
accessible either by providing an accessible  
route or providing equal services on the  
accessible route as in nonaccessible areas.  
§ 1109.2.2–§ 1109.2.4 require wheelchair  
spaces to be provided based on the number  
of seats in the assembly occupancy per  
Table 1109.2.2.1, or as described in the  
noted sections.  
§ 1109.2.4 requires the wheelchair seating  
to be dispersed. The purpose of the dispersal  
is to provide a variety of sight lines and a  
variety of seating prices for people with  
disabilities to choose from.  
At least one companion seat complying with  
A117.1 shall be provided for each required  
wheelchair space.  
SPECIAL OCCUPANCIES  
•  
Transmitter for  
assisted listening

for wheelchair with side entry  
•  
Sight lines should be carefully studied to  
allow wheelchair patrons to see the event.  
Sight lines for patrons in wheelchairs are  
the subject of much controversy. Especially  
at issue is providing views for wheelchair  
patrons over patrons who may be standing  
at their seats at sporting events, where  
fans often jump up in excitement during  
the event. This has been the subject of  
review by the courts in several cases. It  
is worth the designer’s attention to the  
current legal status of seating dispersal  
and sight line access criteria as the design  
is prepared.  
ACCESSIBILITY / 245 SPECIAL OCCUPANCIES  
•  
In assembly areas where audible  
communications are integral to the use of  
the space, assistive listening devices are  
to be provided. The number of receivers  
is based on the seating capacity in the  
assembly area. Assistive listening devices  
are required for all spaces where audio-  
amplification systems are installed. Other  
than in courtrooms, an assistive listening  
system is not required where there is  
no audio amplification system. The best  
guideline is that if amplification is provided  
for some, it should be provided for all. Do  
not assume that assisted listening and  
wheelchair access always overlap. They  
often do not.

Dining areas are to be accessible for the  
total floor area allotted for table and seating,  
except for mezzanine areas that contain less  
than 25% of the total area and if the same  
services are offered in both areas.  
This exception should be used with caution  
due to the possible ambiguous interpretation  
of the term “same services.” The intent of  
the exception is that the same experiences  
of environmental character, service, and food  
be available to all patrons, regardless of  
disability. The designer must be certain that  
not only the physical character of the space  
but also the operation of the establishment  
will not result in segregation of people with  
disabilities. The basis of access, especially  
under the ADA, is providing equal access as  
a civil right.  
Where seating or tables are built-in, at least  
5% of the total, but not less than one such  
”dining surface,” is to be accessible.  
Where only counters are provided for  
dining and the counter exceeds 34" \(864\)  
in height, a section of the counter is to be  
made accessible. Note that this is scoping  
information only. Clearance requirements  
for aisles between tables and chairs and  
at counters are contained in the reference  
standard A117.1. OTHER FEATURES AND FACILITIES  
§ 1110 sets forth scoping provisions for access  
to various building parts and functions. These  
provisions apply to all areas except Accessible,  
Type A, and Type B dwelling units, which are  
to comply with A117.1. Where facilities for  
people without disabilities are provided, then  
essentially equal facilities are to be provided  
for people with disabilities. It is also possible  
and permissible to make all facilities usable  
by almost all potential users whether disabled  
or not. This is the underlying principle of what  
is called “universal design.” Where there are  
multiple facilities, then percentages apply to  
determine the total number of such facilities  
to be provided. But in almost every case, at  
least one such facility is to be accessible as a  
base requirement. Where there is a distinctive  
use for facilities, such as bathing versus toilet  
facilities, or express checkout lines in addition  
to normal lines, then accessible facilities should  
be provided for each different function. The  
criteria in this section usually do not determine  
if the facility in question needs to be accessible,  
but only what criteria apply if accessibility is  
required by other parts of the code.  
Toilet and Bathing Facilities  
§ 1110.2 requires all toilet rooms and bathing  
facilities to be accessible. Where there are  
inaccessible floors that otherwise comply with  
the code, the only available toilet and bathing  
facilities should not be located on that level.  
At least one of each type of fixture, element,  
control, or dispenser in each toilet room is to be  
accessible. The facilities are to provide equal  
access to all of the functions provided in them.  
Equal access to facilities  
ICU  
The exceptions for accessible toilet rooms and  
bathing facilities are very focused and very  
minimal\:  
1\. In private offices not meant for public  
use and meant for a single occupant, the  
toilet facilities need not be accessible, but  
provisions must be made for them to be  
adapted for use by a person with disabilities.  
Thus, the space layout must accommodate  
access in the initial floor plan.  
2\. These provisions do not apply to dwelling  
or sleeping units that are not required to be  
accessible in § 1108.  
3\. Where multiple single-user toilet facilities  
are clustered, then at least 50%, but not less  
than one in each cluster of such facilities,  
must be accessible. This is an instance of  
provision of equal access at each location of  
a group of facilities.  
4\. Where not more than one urinal is provided  
in a toilet room or bathing room, the urinal is  
not required to be accessible.  
5\. Toilet rooms that are part of a critical-care  
or intensive-care patient sleeping room need  
not be accessible. \(This is on the theory that  
the patient will not be using the toilet room.\)  
ACCESSIBILITY / 247 OTHER FEATURES AND FACILITIES  
Family or Assisted-Use Toilet and  
Bathing Rooms  
§ 1110.2.1 requires an accessible family or  
assisted-use toilet in assembly and mercantile  
occupancies when six or more water closets in  
total are required in the facility. This also applies  
to all recreational facilities where separate-sex  
bathing facilities are provided, regardless of the  
count of water closets. This does not apply in  
facilities where there is only one bathing fixture  
in each separated-sex bathing room. These fam-  
ily or assisted-use facilities can be counted as  
part of the total number of fixtures to satisfy  
fixture-count requirements. Per § 1110.2.4, at  
least 5% of toilet compartments are to be acces-  
sible. For very large toilet rooms \(\>20 stalls\) this  
will result in needing to provide two accessible  
stalls in such toilet rooms.

THE BASICS  
Family or assisted-use facilities are to  
be on an accessible route. They are to  
be reasonably close to the separate-sex  
facilities, no more than one floor above  
or below them, and with the accessible  
route no more than 500' \(15 m\) in length.  
Practically speaking, in most instances,  
all of these facilities should be located  
adjacent to one another.  
When water closet compartments  
are provided, at least one should be  
wheelchair accessible.  
When there are six or more toilet  
compartments in a toilet facility, then  
at least one compartment is to be an  
ambulatory-accessible stall per A117.1,  
in addition to the wheelchair-accessible  
compartment.  
Where an accessible lavatory is located  
within the accessible water closet  
compartment, at least one additional

Family or assisted-use facilities are to meet  
the criteria of A117.1 for space layout.  
Each facility is to contain only one water  
closet and one lavatory; however, in family  
or assisted-use bathing facilities, a shower  
or bathtub may be in the same room.  
Where lockers or similar storage units are  
provided in separate-sex bathing facilities,  
then accessible storage facilities are to be  
provided in the family or assisted-use bathing  
facilities as well.  
Separate-sex toilets with only two sanitary  
fixtures in each—one water closet and a  
lavatory or one water closet, a lavatory, and  
a urinal—may be considered as family or  
assisted-use toilet rooms.  
Per exception to § 1110.2.1.2, the following  
additional fixtures are permitted in a family  
or assisted-use toilet room\: 1. A urinal.  
2\. A child-height water closet. 3. A child-  
height lavatory.  
Family or assisted-use toilets will need to be  
larger than under previous editions of A117.1  
and the old ADAAG. The new provisions of  
§ 604 in both documents require a minimum  
clear space of 60" × 56" \(1525 × 1420\) at  
the water closet. The lavatory may not be  
located in the clear space and the door swing  
should not impinge on this clear space unless  
a 30" × 52" \(762 × 1320\) clear floor space is  
provided beyond the arc of the door. Sinks  
§ 1110.3 requires 5% of sinks to be accessible,  
except for service sinks.  
Kitchens  
§ 1110.4 requires that, when provided in acces-  
sible space or rooms, kitchens, kitchenettes,  
and wet bars must be accessible per the space  
criteria of A117.1.  
Drinking Fountains  
§ 1110.5 requires that 50% of the drinking foun-  
tains be wheelchair accessible on floors where  
they are provided. Note that, given the wording  
of this section, this requirement will also apply  
for floors not otherwise considered or required  
to be accessible. Note also that each drinking  
fountain location has two fountains; one located  
at a low elevation for persons using wheelchairs  
and one higher for standing persons.  
A single drinking fountain with two separate  
spouts that complies with the requirements for  
people who use a wheelchair and for standing  
persons is permitted to be substituted for two  
separate drinking fountains.  
Bottle-Filling Stations  
§ 1110.6\. Where bottle-filling stations are pro-  
vided, they must be accessible. Per an except-  
tion, bottle-filling stations over drinking foun-  
tains for standing persons are not required to be  
accessible, provided that bottle-filling stations  
are also located over the drinking fountains for  
persons using wheelchairs.

Lifts  
§ 1110.9 prohibits the use of platform \(wheel-

are often not well maintained and are often  
nonfunctional in real-world applications. They  
should be avoided by designers and used only in  
these specific applications or in the retrofitting  
of older buildings when other modifications to  
provide access are not feasible.  
Storage  
Where fixed or built-in storage facilities, such  
as cabinets, lockers, and medicine cabinets  
are provided, § 1110.10 requires that 5% or at  
least one of each type of storage be accessible.  
When items such as coat hooks and folding  
shelves are provided in inaccessible facilities,  
then at least one of each shall also be provided  
in an accessible facility as well.

10\. To provide an accessible route where  
existing exterior site constraints make use  
of a ramp or a stair infeasible. OTHER FEATURES AND FACILITIES  
Detectable Warnings  
A “detectable warning” is a defined term, typi-  
cally meaning a pattern of raised truncated domes  
of specified size and spacing. § 1110.11 requires  
passenger transit platforms without guards to have  
detectable warnings at the edge to warn people  
with visual impairments of the falling hazard at that  
edge.  
A117.1 regulates detectable warnings as  
follows\:  
•  
§ 705.5 Truncated Domes. Detectable  
warning surfaces shall have truncated  
domes complying with § 705.5.  
•  
§ 705.5.1 Size. Truncated domes shall  
have a base diameter of 0.9" \(23\)  
minimum and 1.4" \(36\) maximum, and  
a top diameter of 50% minimum and  
65% maximum of the base diameter.  
•  
§ 705.5.2 Height. Truncated domes  
shall have a height of 0.2" \(5.1\).  
•  
§ 705.5.3 Spacing. Truncated domes  
shall have a center-to-center spacing  
of 1.6" \(41\) minimum and 2.4" \(61\)  
maximum, and a base-to-base spacing  
of 0.65" \(16.5\) minimum, measured  
between the most adjacent domes on  
the grid.  
•  
§ 705.5.4 Alignment. Truncated domes  
shall be aligned in a square grid  
pattern.  
•  
Note that this provision does not apply  
to bus stops as they typically abut  
a curb rather than have the kind of  
drop that occurs at a train or subway  
platform.  
Seating at Tables, Counters, and Work  
Surfaces  
§ 1110.12 is to be read in concert with § 1109.2.9.1.  
The scoping requires 5% of seats at fixed or built-  
in tables or work surfaces to be accessible if they  
are on an accessible route. As is typical for such  
provisions, these accessible facilities are to be  
dispersed in the building or the space containing  
these features.  
Customer-Service Facilities  
§ 1110.13 and § 1110.14 provide for customer-  
service facilities for public use on accessible routes.  
These facilities include dressing rooms, locker  
rooms, check-out aisles in stores, point-of-sales  
stations, food service lines, and waiting lines. They  
should be dispersed, and they should provide the  
same diversity of service facilities as those for non-  
accessible facilities.  
Controls, Operating Mechanisms, and  
Hardware  
Where controls such as light switches, thermo-  
stats, window hardware, and convenience out-  
lets are intended for operation by the occupant,  
§ 1110.15 requires that they be accessible per the  
reach-range criteria contained in A117.1. These  
requirements apply to accessible spaces and along  
accessible routes.  
At least one of the operable windows in an acces-  
sible space should comply with A117.1 § 506, as  
should any operable window that provides natural  
ventilation or emergency escape and rescue.  
ACCESSIBILITY / 251 SIGNAGE  
§ 1112 contains the requirements for signage, such as  
for the International Symbol of Accessibility used to  
identify required accessible elements.  
Signs  
§ 1112.1 requires the International Symbol of  
Accessibility to be located at accessible parking spaces  
per § 1106.2 and 1106.3, accessible areas of refuge per  
§ 1009.9, at accessible toilet locations, at accessible  
entries, accessible checkout aisles, and at accessible  
dressing and accessible locker rooms.  
The 2010 ADA Standards requires permanent room  
designation signs to be located in a prescribed loca-  
tion. Signs are also to have tactile raised lettering and  
Braille symbols. These requirements apply even if not  
stated in the body of the code since the 2010 ADA  
Standards are to be applied as well. This is a good  
example of why designers must review ADA require-  
ments along with code requirements. See signage  
requirements in the commentary on Supplementary  
Accessibility Requirements.  
Directional Signage  
Where not all elements are accessible, § 1112.3  
requires there be signage to direct people with disabil-  
ities to the nearest accessible element. These signs  
must have the International Symbol of Accessibility.  
Directional signage is required at inaccessible building  
entrances, inaccessible toilet facilities, inaccessible  
bathing facilities, and elevators not serving an acces-  
sible route. Directions to the nearest accessible unisex  
toilet are to be provided where there are unisex facili-  
ties per § 1110.2.1.  
Other Signs  
When special access provisions are made, then  
§ 1112.4 requires signage be provided to highlight  
those provisions. The specific requirements noted in  
the code are\:  
1\. When assistive listening devices are provided per  
§ 1109.2.7, signs to that effect are to be provided  
at ticket offices or similar locations.  
2\. Each door to an exit stairway is to have a sign in  
accordance with § 1013.4. This section requires a  
tactile exit sign complying with A117.1.  
3\. At areas of refuge and areas for assisted rescue,  
signage shall be provided in accordance with §  
1009.11.  
4\. At areas for assisted rescue, signage is to be  
provided per § 1009.11.  
•  
Signs for assistive listening devices  
are to comply with ICC A117.1  
requirements for visual characters  
and include the International Symbol  
of Access for Hearing Loss.  
252 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Appendix E  
Provisions in the appendices of the IBC do not  
have any force or effect in local jurisdictions  
unless the local authority having jurisdiction  
specifically adopts them. We have included  
the supplementary accessibility provisions in  
this chapter as an example of how appendices  
work. The access section is included because  
the provisions in this appendix closely parallel  
ADA and local modifications made to access  
regulations. In our opinion, most of these  
requirements should be applied based on  
common sense or compliance with the ADA,  
whether the appendix is adopted locally or  
not. Note that the referenced standards in the  
appendix include the ADA and various federal  
publications related to access and access  
regulations in addition to A117.1. Although the  
code refers to the old ADAAG, we suggest the  
reader follow the 2010 ADA Standards, since  
March 15, 2012, was the effective date for the  
new ADA standards.  
Designers should be familiar with these  
provisions as it is likely that these requirements  
or similar ones will be encountered in the course  
of design work. Appendix requirements are  
typically ones that are not universally accepted  
or that are still under development. These  
provisions are placed in the appendix to give  
local authorities the option to adopt them or not  
without compromising the basic code.  
Appendix E uses the same reference criteria  
as the basic code, A117.1. The provisions of  
the appendix are designed to coordinate the  
basic code with supplemental requirements. If  
adopted, the section numbers are placed in the  
basic code in the numerical sequences noted in  
the appendix. The appendix requirements form an  
overlay with the basic code to add requirements  
for specific occupancies or functions beyond the  
requirements of the basic code.  
SUPPLEMENTARY ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS  
Definitions  
§ E102 contains definitions of accessible ele-  
ments.  
•  
Transient Lodging\: This is the primary  
additional term introduced in Appendix  
E. This function is typically a Group I or  
Group R occupancy. The major distinction  
is that the residents of these facilities  
are not long-term residents and thus are  
less familiar with their surroundings and  
may require supplementary services,  
clearances, or devices to use the transient  
lodging functions. Longer-term residents  
may adapt their spaces or have personal or  
programmatic supplements to their activities  
to accommodate their disabilities.  
Accessible Routes  
§ E103 adds requirements for access to raised  
speaker’s platforms or lecterns in banquet areas.  
\(Note that this is an ADA requirement.\)  
Special Occupancies  
§ E104 adds requirements for transient lodging  
facilities as defined.  
ACCESSIBILITY / 253 SUPPLEMENTARY ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS  
Signage  
Where permanent signs for rooms or spaces  
are provided at doors, § E107 requires that the  
visual characters, raised characters, and Braille  
comply with ICC A117.1. Where pictograms are  
provided as permanent designations of perma-  
nent interior rooms, the pictograms are to have  
tactile text descriptors. Directional signs for  
permanent interior locations except for building  
directories and personnel names and temporary  
signs should also be accessible. This is another  
instance where these requirements should be  
followed regardless of local adoptions. The 2010  
ADA Standards should be reviewed along with  
A117.1 for signage requirements.

However, designers should be aware of the  
special requirements for these facilities placed  
on them by the ADA, the code, and the appendix,  
and apply them when appropriate.

# Interior  
# Environment  
The quality of interior environments is one of the primary factors in  
code development outside of the considerations of structural safety, fire  
resistance, and egress. Many of the environmental considerations in  
model codes came into being as a response to deplorable living condi-  
tions in buildings at the turn of the 20th century. Tenement housing and  
factory conditions often contributed to serious public-health problems  
for occupants. Tenants were often crowded together in tiny rooms with  
little light or ventilation and with inadequate sanitation or maintenance  
of facilities. Also, unregulated building materials, especially decorative  
materials, led to installation of highly flammable materials in egress  
paths, often making egress passages more dangerous than the spaces  
occupants were leaving in an emergency. Code provisions were written  
to address these quality-of-life issues for occupants. Recently, indoor air  
quality has become increasingly important, as buildings become more  
energy efficient and more airtight. The need to prevent accumulations  
of molds or toxic gases while achieving energy efficiency has been a  
challenge for recent code development.  
The considerations for interior environment address several primary fac-  
tors. Chapter 8 considers the flame-resistance and smoke-generation  
capacities of various building materials used in interior spaces; Chapter  
12 addresses the remaining environmental considerations.  
These include air quality, both for human health and also for build-  
ing durability, which is governed by regulations for the ventilation of  
building and occupied spaces. Another consideration is the quality of  
the occupants’ experience in a space, which is regulated by provisions  
for temperature controls, natural or artificial lighting levels, and air  
and sound isolation between spaces. Also covered are the sizes of  
the spaces to be occupied, access to unoccupied spaces, and ongoing  
sanitation and maintenance issues for building interiors, including the  
materials that can be readily maintained in toilet and bathing facilities.  
Chapter 12 is therefore something of a catchall chapter in the code,  
with many provisions having only slight relationship to the chapter title. INTERIOR ENVIRONMENT  
This chapter has many disparate parts. One part  
governs quality-of-life issues for interiors and  
also includes measures to assist in mitigating  
the impact of climate on buildings. The stan-  
dards set forth in this chapter also relate to how  
spaces work and feel for occupants, and how  
buildings can be maintained. This is in contrast  
to Chapter 8, which deals primarily with the  
fire safety of the occupants of interior spaces.  
The chapter title is somewhat misleading in  
that requirements of the chapter also pertain to  
spaces not normally occupied, although they are  
inside the building envelope.  
Ventilation  
§ 1202 deals with the ventilation of concealed  
attic and rafter spaces as well as with the venti-  
lation of occupied spaces. The section is there-  
fore divided among requirements for ventilation  
of building material areas and for ventilation of  
spaces used by building occupants.  
Where building materials are enclosed on both  
the exterior and interior side of spaces, the con-  
cealed spaces, whether attics or rafter spaces,  
become susceptible to moisture intrusion.  
Building Ventilation  
Where houses are found to be relatively airtight,  
which means for code purposes that a blower  
door test finds the air infiltration rate in a dwell-  
ing to be less than 5 air changes per hour when  
tested at a pressure of 0.2" of water at 4°C  
\(50 Pa\) in accordance with the International  
Energy Conservation Code, the dwelling must be  
ventilated by mechanical means in accordance  
with the International Mechanical Code. If the  
house is found to allow 5 or more air changes  
per hour, then natural ventilation is still allowed.  
However, the IECC typically does not permit  
a house to have more than 5 air changes per  
hour, so if it is adopted, mechanical ventilation  
will typically be mandated. As houses become  
more energy efficient and thus more airtight,  
it will become more likely that blower door tests  
will be required for residences and mechanical  
ventilation will be required more often than in  
the past.  
No matter what number of air changes per  
hour are anticipated, ambulatory care facilities  
and Group I-2 occupancies are to be ventilated  
by mechanical means in accordance with the  
International Mechanical Code.

Interior spaces are maintained at different  
temperatures than exterior spaces.  
Occupied spaces tend to have higher  
humidity than the exterior due to human  
activities like respiration, cooking, and  
bathing.  
As moisture moves about inside the building  
it can be trapped in concealed spaces.  
Temperature variations and dew-point  
locations can allow water vapor to  
condense into liquid water inside building  
cavities. This can lead to rot, mold, or other  
deteriorating conditions that may attack  
the structure of the building or may cause  
an accumulation of substances that can be  
toxic to the occupants.  
One course of action is creation of  
ventilation paths to allow moist air to be  
exhausted from concealed spaces. The  
ventilation requirements are designed to  
modify air movement in concealed spaces.  
These measures are designed to take  
advantage of natural convection and the  
condensation properties of water vapor.  
The use of convection allows ventilation to  
take place passively, without mechanical  
assistance.  
Another action is the use of vapor retarders  
to prevent migration of moisture from wetter  
to drier parts of the building.  
Exhaust fan is required if air infiltration rate  
is measured at less than 5 air changes per  
hour.

Ventilation opening requirements are expressed in terms  
of fractions of the area to be ventilated. Note that ven-  
tilation area requirements refer to free area. Free area  
is the amount of space allowing actual airflow. Vent  
louvers and screened openings do not provide 100% free  
area. A good rule of thumb for louvers at vent openings  
is to assume 50% free area. Consult manufacturers’ data  
for actual free areas of any vent coverings selected to be  
certain of their actual free area.

VENTILATION  
With this provision the code assumes that ventilation for  
insulation will be above the insulation. Designs should  
make this assumption as well. Vents are to be distributed  
to promote convection, with half high and half low in  
sloped conditions.  
The basic net free ventilation area requirement for attics  
is to be 1/150 of the space being ventilated. There is no  
guidance or set requirement for vertical offsets between  
the vent locations.  
Blocking and bridging must be arranged to not interfere  
with the flow of ventilation.  
A minimum of 1" \(25.4\) of space is to be provided  
between insulation and roof sheathing.  
The net free cross-ventilation area is permitted to be  
reduced to 1/300 where a Class I or II vapor retarder is  
installed on the warm-in-winter side of the ceiling.

Ventilation may be reduced to 1/300 of the area to be

located in the upper portion of the space.  
Upper ventilators are to be located not more than 3' \(914\)  
below the ridge or highest point of the space, with the  
balance of the ventilation provided by eave or cornice  
vents.  
Vents are to be covered with screens to keep out vermin  
and birds as well as be protected from the entry of rain  
and snow.

—  
THE BASICS  
•  
•  
Per § 1202.3, unvented attics and unvented  
enclosed roof framing assemblies are permitted  
where all of the following conditions are met\:  
1\. The unvented attic space is completely within  
the building thermal envelope \(i.e., attic is  
conditioned interior space, as is the space  
below.  
2\. No interior Class I vapor retarders are installed  
on the ceiling side \(attic floor\) of the unvented  
attic assembly or on the ceiling side of the  
unvented enclosed roof framing assembly.  
3\. Where wood shingles or shakes are used, a  
minimum 1/4" \(6.4\) vented air space separates  
the shingles or shakes from the roofing  
underlayment above the structural sheathing.  
4\. In Climate Zones 5, 6, 7, and 8, any air-  
impermeable insulation shall be a Class II  
vapor retarder or shall have a Class III vapor  
retarder coating or covering in direct contact  
with the underside of the insulation.  
5\. A continuous envelope of insulation is applied  
per the requirements of either Item 5.1 or  
5.2, and additionally Item 5.3 of this section,  
depending on whether the insulation is air-  
permeable or air-impermeable.  
Note that § 1202.3 contains variable detailed  
conditions regarding unvented attics. These  
requirements are dependent on the climate  
zone where the building is located and on the  
assembly details of air-impermeable and air-  
permeable insulation. The conditions are too  
site-specific and construction assembly-specific  
to describe in this introductory text, but should  
be examined closely to determine applicable  
code conditions. Under-Floor Ventilation  
§ 1202.4 requires that, in buildings that are not  
slab-on-grade structures, the space between  
the underside of floor joists and the earth below  
be ventilated.  
•  
•  
•  
Subsections of § 1202.4 allow under-floor  
ventilation to be reduced or replaced with  
mechanical ventilation. The ventilation area  
may be reduced to 1/1,500 of the under-floor area  
when a vapor retarder is placed on the ground  
surface of the crawl space. The ventilation is  
also not required when the space is insulated,  
climate conditioned, and provided with a vapor  
retarder. Any of these measures—general ven-  
tilation per § 1202.4.1.1, reduced ventilation  
per § 1202.4.1.2, or mechanical ventilation per  
§ 1202.4.3—is considered equivalent protec-  
tion from vapor intrusion and collection when  
combined with a given quantity of passive or  
mechanical ventilation.  
•  
•  
•  
§ 1202.4.3\: Mechanical ventilation may  
be provided to crawl spaces when certain  
criteria are met\:

•  
Continuously operated mechanical  
ventilation can be provided at a rate of  
1.0 cubic foot per minute \(cfm\) for each  
50 sf \(1.02 L/s for each 10 m2\) of crawl  
space ground surface area when the  
ground surface is covered with a Class I  
vapor retarder, or  
the crawl space may be conditioned  
in accordance with the International  
Mechanical Code and the walls of  
the crawl space are insulated in  
accordance with the International Energy  
Conservation Code.  
VENTILATION  
Vents for crawl spaces with uncovered  
earth floors are to have a net \(free\) area  
of 1 sf for each 150 sf \(0.67 m2 for each  
100 m2\) of crawl space. The vents should  
be vermin proof to prevent animals getting  
into the crawl space area.  
The vent openings should be placed to  
allow cross-ventilation of the under-floor  
area. Thus openings should be distributed  
around the building perimeter to the  
maximum extent possible.  
The net area of ventilation openings for  
crawl spaces with the ground surface  
covered with a Class I vapor retarder shall  
be not less than 1 sf for each 1,500 sf  
\(0.67 m2 for each 1000 m2\) of crawl space  
area.  
In extremely cold climates, where  
a ventilation opening will cause a  
detrimental loss of energy, ventilation  
openings to the interior of the structure  
are to be provided.  
For buildings in flood hazard areas as  
established in § 1612.3, the openings for  
under-floor ventilation are to meet the  
flood opening requirements of ASCE 24.  
INTERIOR ENVIRONMENT / 259 VENTILATION  
Natural Ventilation  
§ 1202.1 requires natural ventilation when mechan-  
ical ventilation is not provided. Mechanical venti-  
lation is to be per the International Mechanical  
Code. The intent of these requirements is that  
habitable spaces be provided with light and air,  
even when those interior spaces are windowless  
and adjoin another room.  
2  
1  
Where there are additional contaminants in the  
air in naturally ventilated spaces, then additional  
mechanical ventilation may be required by the  
code.  
In all cases, the code requires mechanical ven-  
tilation of rooms containing bathtubs, showers,  
spas, and similar bathing fixtures. Note that  
natural ventilation is not considered an alternate  
to mechanical ventilation in bathrooms. This  
recognizes the need for positive ventilation of  
interior moisture to prevent moisture buildup in  
the structure. Many times, especially in cold cli-  
mates, natural ventilation is not used and mois-  
ture can build up in buildings when mechanical  
ventilation is not provided.

THE BASICS  
•  
•  
•  
Per § 1202.5.1, rooms are to have an area  
openable to the outdoors of at least 4% of  
the floor area of the space being ventilated.  
§ 1202.5.1.1 states that adjoining rooms  
without openings to the outdoors must  
have an opening of at least 8% of the floor  
area, or 25 sf \(2.3 m2\), whichever is larger,  
into the adjacent room with the window.  
The openable area in the room facing the  
outdoors shall be based on the total area  
of all of the rooms relying on the window  
for ventilation. Thus in this example,  
area number 2 is considered part of room  
number 1. § 1203 states that all habitable spaces are to be  
provided with space heating. The heating system  
must be capable of sustaining a temperature of  
68°F \(20°C\) at a point 36" \(914\) above the floor  
of the space. This capability is to be available on  
the coldest anticipated design day of the year.  
Space heating systems are not required for  
interior spaces whose primary purpose is not  
associated with human comfort, or in Group F, H,  
S, or U occupancies.  
36" \(914\)  
TEMPERATURE CONTROL  
68°F \(20°C\)  
INTERIOR ENVIRONMENT / 261 LIGHTING  
§ 1204 requires all habitable spaces to have nat-  
ural or artificial light. Note that while artificial  
light is to provide 10 foot-candles \(107 lux\) over  
the area of the room at a height of 30" \(762\), no  
specific light-quantity criteria is set for natural  
light. While highly unlikely, it is thus possible  
under a literal interpretation of the code to have  
a building that could be occupied only during  
daylight as long as there were no internal rooms  
lacking natural light.  
•  
Net exterior glazed opening areas are to  
be 8% of the floor area of the room, or  
rooms, served. Thus, it is two times the  
requirement for ventilation area. Typically,  
this is interpreted to mean that one-half of  
the window area is to be openable.  
Stairways in dwelling units must have specified  
light levels, measured at the nosing of every  
stair tread. The basic light level is to be 1 foot-  
candle \(11 lux\) at the tread run. Stairs in other  
occupancies are to be lit per Chapter 10.  
See § 1008 for emergency lighting requirements  
at means of egress. § 1008.2.1 requires the  
illumination level to be not less than 10 foot-  
candles \(108 lux\) at the walking surface when  
the stairway is in use.  
262 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
•  
•  
The code allows for interior rooms to borrow  
light from adjacent rooms. For an adjoining  
room to serve another, at least half of the  
common wall between them must be open.  
The opening must be at least 10% of the  
floor area of the interior room, or 25 sf  
\(2.3 m2\), whichever is larger. YARDS OR COURTS  
Exterior openings are to open to the outdoors  
to yards and courts of sizes specified in § 1205.  
Yard and court sizes are set to provide minimum  
dimensions for light wells and backyards of  
multistory buildings so that these areas provide  
real light and air to the spaces they serve.  
•  
•  
Yards are to be at least 3' \(914\) wide for the  
first two stories.  
The width of yards must increase by 1' \(305\)  
for every floor above the second floor. This  
increase applies up to 14 stories. Buildings  
taller than 14 stories need not have a yard  
greater than 15' \(4572\) wide.  
INTERIOR ENVIRONMENT / 263 YARDS OR COURTS  
•  
•  
•  
•  
264 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
Where windows face each other, the  
minimum court width is to be 6' \(1829\).  
The court can be stepped as shown, or the  
court walls may be vertical if the court size is  
as determined by the largest court dimension  
required at the top story.  
Courts must be at least 10' \(3048\) in length  
unless bounded on one end by a public way  
or yard and 3' \(914\) in width for buildings up  
to two stories tall.  
Courts must increase 1' \(305\) in width and  
2' \(610\) in depth for every floor above the  
second floor up to a limit of 14 stories,  
beyond which increases are not required.  
Thus a court for a 14-story building with  
windows facing each other would be at least  
18' × 34' \(5486 × 10 363\) in size.  
\[Minimum court width with facing windows  
is 6', plus 1' for each of 12 stories\:  
6' + 12' = 18' \(1829 + 3657 = 5486\)\]. Sound transmission can severely impact the  
quality of life in multitenant buildings, especially  
in residential occupancies. § 1206 sets stan-  
dards for sound-transmission reduction at walls  
and floor/ceiling assemblies between adjoining  
units. These criteria apply at the perimeter of  
dwelling units where they abut other units, pub-  
lic areas, or service areas.  
Criteria are established using ASTM test crite-  
ria. The code sets a higher standard for design  
criteria based on test data versus field testing.  
These criteria recognize that test conditions  
are difficult to achieve in the field, and thus the  
expected minimum criteria are established such  
that field-measured conditions will meet the  
minimum necessary criteria. Criteria are estab-  
lished for both airborne sound \(ASTM E90\) and  
for structure-borne sound \(ASTM E492\) for the  
lab tests, or ASTM E336 and ASTM E1007 for  
the field tests.  
Alternatively, the sound transmission class of  
walls, partitions, and floor-ceiling assemblies  
may be established by engineering analysis  
based on a comparison of walls, partitions, and  
floor-ceiling assemblies having sound transmis-  
sion class ratings as determined by the lab  
test procedures set forth in ASTM E90 for air-  
borne sound and ASTM E492 for structure-borne  
sound.  
SOUND TRANSMISSION  
•  
Airborne sounds include music, speech,  
or equipment sounds that travel through  
the air.  
•  
Structure-borne sounds include footfalls,  
noise from dropped items, or equipment  
vibrations that are conducted by the  
structure and resonate in other spaces  
than the space of origin.  
INTERIOR ENVIRONMENT / 265 INTERIOR SPACE DIMENSIONS  
Based on the abuses of tenement housing  
during the early part of the Industrial  
Revolution, model codes as well as § 1208  
of this code set minimum room dimensions  
for each anticipated use of a dwelling.  
Room Width  
•  
No habitable room, other than a kitchen,  
is to be less than 7' \(2134\) in any plan  
dimension.  
•  
•  
•  
Kitchens are to provide at least 3' \(914\) of  
clear passage area.  
Thus, a single-sided kitchen with typical  
cabinetry will be at least 5' \(1524\) in width,  
or wider if the refrigerator is standard depth  
and clearances are maintained.  
Note that these minimums do not  
necessarily provide clearances for access for  
people with disabilities. Applicable disabled-  
access criteria will always take precedence  
over these minimums.  
Ceiling Height  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Rooms that are considered habitable rooms,  
such as living rooms or bedrooms, are to  
be at least 7'6" \(2286\) in height above the  
finished floor. Designers should use caution  
with low-ceiling areas where thick floor  
finishes could result in ceilings being too low.  
Decorative items such as beams may reduce  
the height in habitable rooms of one- or two-  
family dwellings to 7' \(2134\).  
Corridors within a dwelling unit or sleeping  
unit in a Group R occupancy may have a  
ceiling height of not less than 7' \(2134\)  
above the finished floor.  
Bathrooms, toilet rooms, storage rooms, or  
laundry rooms may be 7' \(2134\) in height  
above the finished floor.  
•  
Basements must have the same ceiling  
heights and clearances as other habitable  
spaces.  
266 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS INTERIOR SPACE DIMENSIONS  
Sloping and Furred Ceilings  
•  
•  
Rooms with a sloped ceiling must have one-  
half the area of the room either meeting or  
exceeding the 7'6" \(2286\) minimum.  
The area of such sloped spaces assumes  
an imaginary wall 5' \(1524\) high around the  
area to be calculated to determine the area  
of minimum ceiling height to comply with  
the code.  
•  
A furred ceiling may not be less than 7'  
\(2134\) in height and occupy not more than  
one-third of the area of a room.  
Room Area  
•  
•  
Each dwelling unit must have one room of  
at least 120 sf \(13.9 m2\) in net area.  
Other rooms, except kitchens, are to have a  
minimum net area of 70 sf \(6.5 m2\).  
•  
Note that the definition of habitable spaces  
excludes bathrooms and toilet rooms, but  
includes spaces for cooking, living, sleeping,  
or eating. Thus, bedrooms must be at least  
10' × 7' \(3048 × 2134\) to meet the space  
criteria of this section.  
INTERIOR ENVIRONMENT / 267 ACCESS AND MATERIALS  
Surrounding Materials  
These provisions in § 1210 apply to toilet and  
bathing facilities in uses other than dwelling  
units. They are to address the maintenance,  
cleanliness, and health issues associated with  
public toilet and bathing facilities. Note that  
while these provisions do not apply to dwelling  
units except as indicated, their application should  
be carefully considered as good design practice  
by the designer for all types of buildings.

THE BASICS  
Walls and partitions within 2' \(610\) of service  
sinks, urinals, and water closets must have a  
smooth, hard, nonabsorbent surface at least  
4' \(1219\) high. The wall materials, apart from  
the structure, must also be of materials not  
adversely affected by moisture. Items such  
as grab bars and dispensers must be sealed  
to protect the underlying structure from  
moisture.  
Floors are to be smooth, hard, and  
nonabsorbent.  
The surface treatment must extend up the  
wall at least 4" \(102\).  
Shower compartments and walls above tubs  
must be finished with a hard, nonabsorbent  
finish to a height of 72" \(1829\) above the  
drain inlet elevation. Built-in tubs with  
showers are to have sealant joints between  
the tub and the adjacent walls.  
Per § 2902.3.2, repeated from the  
International Plumbing Code, toilet rooms  
are not to open directly into a room used for  
preparing food for the public. This obviously  
would include commercial kitchens but  
would also include serving areas or food-  
preparation stations outside the kitchen in a  
food-service venue. A vestibule or hallway  
needs to be provided in such circumstances. 13  
# Energy  
# Efficiency  
The requirements for energy-efficient design are contained in a separate  
companion code, the International Energy Conservation Code \(IECC\). This  
code volume must be adopted by local jurisdictions to allow its enforcement  
to accompany the International Building Code. Similar correlations occur  
with several other I-codes, such as the International Mechanical Code and  
the International Plumbing Code. For the purposes of this very short chapter,  
when we refer to “the code” we mean the IECC.  
The building-design implications of energy conservation are contained in  
the IECC. The energy conservation requirements for mechanical and plumb-  
ing installations are typically contained in the mechanical and plumbing  
codes rather than in the energy code. Discussions of the energy-efficiency  
design requirements of the energy code, mechanical code, or plumbing code  
are outside the scope of this book.  
Note that many states and local jurisdictions have adopted their own  
energy codes. These local codes may have quite different standards than  
this model code. As is the case for other possible local modifications, the  
designer should always verify the status of local code adoptions.  
The calculations for energy use are inherently site specific. They depend  
heavily on geography, climate, and local environmental conditions. Obviously,  
a building that performs well in a hot, humid climate near sea level, such  
as in Florida, will have quite different environmental-control and energy-  
use patterns than a building in the hot, dry, high-desert climate of central  
Arizona. To clearly discuss the concepts of the energy conservation calcula-  
tion methods and criteria in the code, one must know where the building  
is, what its function is, what type of construction it uses, and what type of  
mechanical systems it is to have. 14  
# Exterior  
# Walls  
Chapter 14 establishes requirements for exterior walls. It also  
sets standards for wall materials and wall coverings, as well as  
for wall components such as windows, doors, and trim. The pro-  
visions of this chapter are meant to apply primarily to weather  
protection and moisture control. The definition of “exterior  
wall“ specifically excludes fire walls, which have additional  
fire-resistive requirements.  
It is the intent of the code that exterior-wall requirements for  
weather protection and moisture control not supersede or com-  
promise the overriding structural bearing and fire-resistance  
requirements for walls. On the other hand, the code does not  
intend for fire walls or structural bearing walls not to provide  
the required degree of weather resistance. EXTERIOR-WALL ENVELOPE  
§ 1402.2 requires an “exterior wall envelope”  
to protect the structural members of a building,  
including framing and sheathing materials, as  
well as conditioned interior spaces from detri-  
mental effects of the exterior environment.  
•  
•

272 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
By definition, any exterior wall, bearing or  
nonbearing, in a plane with an angle of  
60° \(1.05 rad\) or greater with the horizontal  
plane, is an exterior wall. It is to be inferred  
from the definition that any exterior wall  
having a slope of less than 60° \(1.05 rad\) is  
to be considered to be a roof, but there is no  
accompanying definition of roof in Chapter  
15 of the code.  
Exterior wall coverings are elements applied  
over the exterior sides of exterior walls  
for the purposes of providing a weather-  
resistant barrier, insulation, or for aesthetics.  
These coverings therefore include veneers,  
siding, and exterior insulation and finish  
systems.  
Veneers are facings attached to a wall  
to provide protection, insulation, or  
ornamentation, but not additional strength.  
Exterior-wall components include such items  
as exterior windows and doors, architectural  
trim, and balconies. § 1402 sets out the performance criteria for  
exterior walls, wall coverings, and components.  
Weather Protection  
§ 1402.2 states that the basic performance  
criterion for exterior walls is providing an  
exterior-wall envelope that is weather-  
resistant. Exterior-wall systems must there-  
fore be designed to prevent water penetration  
and the accumulation of water behind exterior  
veneers, and to provide drainage for any mois-  
ture that does enter the wall assemblies to the  
exterior of the veneer. The systems must also  
protect against condensation inside wall assem-  
blies as required by § 1404.4, which describes  
flashing requirements.  
Other Requirements  
Exterior walls are to be designed to resist  
structural loads per Chapter 16, and meet  
the applicable fire-resistance and opening-  
protection requirements of Chapter 7. In flood-  
hazard areas, designated per § 1612.3, exterior  
walls extending below the design flood eleva-  
tion are to be resistant to water damage. Any  
wood used in these areas is to be pressure-  
treated or naturally decay resistant.

greater than 40' \(12 192\) in height above  
grade plane and contain a combustible  
water-resistive barrier shall be tested in  
accordance with and comply with the  
acceptance criteria of NFPA 285. This is  
to address issues with vertical and lateral  
flame propagation in such walls where these  
conditions exist.  
Combustible water-resistive barrier  
For the purposes of this section, fenestration  
products, such as windows and associated  
flashings, as well as water-resistive barrier  
flashing and accessories, including through-  
wall flashing, are not considered part of the  
water-resistive barrier.  
EXTERIOR WALLS / 273 WALL MATERIALS  
§ 1402 and § 1403 require that all materials  
used in exterior walls are to meet the structural  
criteria contained in Chapter 16, as well as the  
detailed provisions for specific materials con-  
tained in Chapters 19 through 26 of the code.

§ 1404.3 describes the requirements for vapor  
retarders that are required in buildings to prevent  
the condensation of moisture inside of wall cavi-  
ties. Moisture tends to migrate from the warmer  
and more moist interior of a building toward the  
exterior. If moisture is allowed to collect in wall  
cavities, it can lead to mold, mildew, or decay  
of the materials. The code requires different  
classes of vapor retarders, based on the loca-  
tion of the building in relation to the Climate  
Zones described in the International Energy  
Conservation Code \(IECC\).  
The US climate zones are broken down by  
county. They range from extremely hot and dry  
desert conditions as found in Nevada or Arizona  
to extremely warm and humid conditions as  
found in Hawaii and southern Florida. There are  
also zones for extreme cold as found in Alaska.  
There are subsets of climate zones applied in  
the IECC. These zones move from the western  
US to the East Coast—from Marine \(C\) to Dry  
\(B\) and Moist \(A\). For the IBC, typically only the  
numerical zones are applicable. The zones can

EXTERIOR WALLS / 275 VAPOR RETARDERS  
Vapor retarder materials are classified in accor-  
dance with Table 1404.3\(1\), based on their  
permeability in perms. A perm rating is the unit  
measuring the mass rate of water vapor flowing  
through 1 square foot of material. In the US, a  
perm is defined as 1 grain of water vapor per  
hour, per square foot, per inch of mercury. A met-  
ric perm is defined as 1 gram of water vapor per  
day, per square meter, per millimeter of mercury.  
A vapor retarder is be provided on the interior  
side of frame walls in accordance with Tables  
Table 1404.3\(1\)\: Vapor Retarder Materials and Classes  
Vapor retarders are classified based on manufacturers’ tests.  
The following are classified in the code in Table 1404.3\(1\)\:  
Exterior Interior  
Class I Sheet polyethylene sheet, nonperforated alumi-  
num foil, or other approved material with a perm  
rating of less than or equal to 0.1  
1404.3\(2\) and 1404.3\(3\), depending on the cli-  
mate zones where the building is located. The  
tables are to be considered together, or as an  
alternative, an approved design using accepted  
engineering practice for hygrothermal analysis  
may be used. The code discourages the use  
of double vapor barriers since they may trap  
moisture within walls. Use of a Type I class  
vapor retarder will require a careful design  
with sealing and a drainage plane to avoid both  
water leakage and moisture accumulation within  
walls.  
Vapor retarder class is determined by the manu-  
facturer’s certified testing of assemblies. Certain  
materials, as described at right, are deemed by  
the code to meet the classes noted. The lowest  
class of vapor retarders is paint, which is Class  
III. This lowest level of vapor retarder is permit-  
ted in a specific group of assemblies in the  
Climate Zones listed in Table 1404.3\(3\).  
Class II Kraft-faced fiberglass batts or paint with a perm  
rating greater than 0.1 and less than or equal to  
1.0  
Class III Latex or enamel paint with a perm rating greater  
than 1.0 and less than or equal to 10.0

—THE BASICS Class III Vapor Retarders  
Class III vapor retarders are paints having a  
perm rating of \>1.0 to ≤10.0. They are permit-  
ted on the interior side of exterior walls in a  
wide variety of climate zones. Table 1404.3\(3\)  
illustrates examples of a few of the possible  
assembly variations in different climate zones.

Class I and II Vapor Retarders  
Where a Class II vapor retarder is used in com-  
bination with foam plastic insulating sheathing  
installed as continuous insulation on the exteri-  
or side of frame walls, the continuous insulation  
is to comply with Table 1404.3.4, shown below.  
The Class II vapor retarder is to have a vapor  
permeance greater than 1. Use of a Class I inte-  
rior vapor retarder in frame walls with a Class I  
vapor retarder on the exterior side shall require  
an approved design. Class I vapor retarders may  
not be used without a project-specific design.

§1404.4 requires the installation of flashing  
to prevent moisture from entering at locations  
such as those illustrated to the right. The intent  
of the list that contains examples, not just the  
conditions to be satisfied, is that flashing be  
provided at any condition where it would pre-  
vent moisture from entering the structure.

Flashing is also to be provided, along with  
weep holes in masonry walls, at the first  
course above the finished grade level and at  
support points such as floors, shelf angles,

Wood Veneers  
§ 1404.5 prescribes the requirements for install-  
ing wood veneers.  
Notwithstanding the requirements of Table  
1404.2 for the minimum thickness of weather  
coverings, wood veneer used in Types I, II, III,  
and IV construction is to be of thickness called  
out in § 1404.5.  
•  
Wood veneer may not exceed 40' \(12 190\)  
above grade. Fire-retardant-treated wood  
may extend up to 60' \(18 290\) above grade.  
•  
Wood veneer is to be 1" \(25.4\)  
nominal thickness, versus 1/2" \(12.7\) per the  
table.  
•  
Hardboard siding is to be 0.438" \(11.1\)  
versus 1/4" \(6.4\) per the table.  
•  
Wood structural panels are to be 3/8"  
\(9.5\) versus 0.313" \(8\) thick.  
The extent of wood veneer in other than Type V  
construction is also limited. The requirements  
are not exceptions, and all must be met for  
wood veneer to be used in these types of con-  
struction. The requirements are\:  
1\. The veneer cannot exceed 40' \(12 190\)  
in height; 60' \(18 290\) is the limit if fire-  
retardant-treated wood is used.  
2\. The wood is attached to or furred out from  
a noncombustible backing that is fire-  
resistance rated per the code.  
3\. Where open or spaced wood veneers  
without concealed spaces are used, they  
do not project more than 24" \(610\) from  
the building wall. See the discussion later  
regarding combustible materials at exterior  
walls contained in § 1405.  
EXTERIOR WALLS / 279 INSTALLATION OF WALL COVERINGS  
Anchored Masonry Veneer  
§ 1404.6 prescribes specific requirements  
for the use of anchored veneers, whether of  
masonry, stone, or terra-cotta. These provisions  
apply to materials anchored to backing materi-  
als using mechanical fasteners. This is distinct  
from adhered veneers that are attached to the  
backing by adhesives. These requirements are  
broken down by material into separate sections.  
§ 1404.6 also requires anchored masonry  
veneers to comply with the standards contained  
in § 12.1 and § 12.2 of TMS 402, but the text  
applies these requirements to several types of  
veneers\: masonry, stone, slab-type, and terra-  
cotta.  
There are additional criteria for various types  
of exterior cladding, such as stone veneer and  
glass veneer. The intent of this discussion is  
to introduce the concepts of exterior material  
code requirements. See the IBC for the detailed  
requirements for the various materials.•

§ 1404.11 states that metal veneers must be of  
noncorrosive materials or must be coated with  
anticorrosive coatings such as porcelain enamel.  
Connections to the backing are to be made with  
corrosion-resistant fasteners. Wood supports  
for metal veneers are to be of pressure-treated  
wood. Joints are to be caulked or sealed to pre-  
vent penetration of moisture. Masonry backing  
is not required for metal veneers except as may  
be necessary for fire resistance per other code  
sections.

Fiber-Cement Siding  
Fiber-cement siding is permitted per § 1404.16  
on any type of construction. It is to meet the  
water-resistive barrier requirements of § 1402.  
The siding is to be applied per the manufacturer’s  
instructions with fastenings per § 1404.16.  
282 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
Joints and edges exposed to weather must  
be caulked or otherwise protected against the  
penetration of moisture.  
Exterior metal veneer must be protected by  
painting, galvanizing, or equivalent coating or  
treatment.  
Wood studs, furring strips, or wood supports  
must be of pressure-treated wood or  
protected as required by § 1402.2.  
Corrosion-resistant fastenings spaced  
not more than 24" \(610\) on center vertically  
and horizontally.  
Units exceeding 4 sf \(0.4 m2\) in area  
must have no fewer than four attachments  
per unit.  
Masonry backup is not required except  
when necessary to meet fire-resistance  
requirements.  
Metal-veneer walls need to be grounded for  
lightning and electrical discharge protection  
per Chapter 27 of the IBC and per NFPA 70. COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS ON THE EXTERIOR SIDE OF EXTERIOR WALLS  
§ 1405 applies to combustible exterior wall  
coverings, except for plastics complying with  
Chapter 26 of the code. The standards for  
ignition resistance of exterior materials are  
set forth in NFPA 268. Note, however, that the  
exceptions to § 1405.1.1.1 cover such broad  
areas that the criteria from NFPA 268 may not  
apply in many cases. The exceptions include\:  
wood or wood-based products, combustible  
materials other than vinyl siding, and aluminum  
at least 0.019" \(0.48\) thick. Based on the scop-  
ing in § 1405.1.1, these requirements apply to  
classes of construction other than Type V.  
Table 1405.1.1.1.2 shows the relationship of  
combustible veneers to fire-separation dis-  
tance from a lot line. When located closer  
than 5' \(1524\) to a lot line, materials \(those not  
covered by the exceptions\) shall not exhibit  
sustained flaming per NFPA 268. As the dis-  
tance to the lot line increases, the radiant-heat  
energy flux decreases. Thus, the heat impact  
on the materials decreases with distance and  
the types of material that will not exhibit sus-  
tained flaming increases.  
Combustible Materials in  
Construction Types I, II, III, and IV  
Per § 1405.1.1, exterior wall coverings may be  
of combustible materials or of wood veneers  
where permitted by § 1404.5 in buildings of  
Types I, II, III, and IV construction if the build-  
ings are no more 40' \(12 192\) in height. Where  
such buildings have a fire-separation distance  
of less than 5' \(1524\), no more than 10% of the  
exterior wall may be of combustible materials  
unless of fire-retardant-treated wood. Note  
that combustible exterior wall coverings con-  
structed of fire-retardant-treated wood are  
permitted up to 60' \(18 288\) in height above  
grade plane regardless of the fire separation  
distance.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
40' \(12 192\) above grade plane  
•  
•  
As fire-separation distance increases,  
the tolerable level of incident radiant-heat  
energy decreases.  
Per § 1405.1.2, combustible exterior  
wall coverings located along the top  
of exterior walls are to be completely  
backed up by the exterior wall and not  
extend over or above the top of the  
exterior wall.  
Exterior wall coverings more than  
40' \(12 192\) above grade plane must be  
constructed of noncombustible materials.  
\[May be combustible up to 60' \(18 288\) if  
of fire-retardant-treated wood.\]  
Architectural items such as trim or  
balconies may be constructed of wood  
or other equivalent combustible material  
where combustible wall coverings are  
allowed.  
Where the fire-separation distance is less  
than 5' \(1524\), combustible exterior-wall  
covering, except for fire-retardant-treated  
wood, shall not exceed 10% of exterior  
wall surface.  
Combustible exterior wall coverings  
constructed of fire-retardant-treated  
wood per § 2303.2 shall not be limited in  
area when the fire-separation distance is  
5' \(1524\) or less and may be used up to  
60' above grade regardless of the  
fire-separation distance.  
EXTERIOR WALLS / 283 COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS ON THE EXTERIOR SIDE OF EXTERIOR WALLS  
Fire-Blocking  
When combustible wall coverings are furred  
from the wall and form a solid surface,  
§ 1405.1.3 requires the space between the  
back of the covering and the wall to not exceed  
1  
5/8" \(41\), and the space must be fire-blocked  
per § 718 so that no open space exceeds  
100 sf \(9.3 m2\). Note that Item 3 of  
§ 1404.5 allows open or spaced veneers to  
project up to 24" \(610\) from the backing wall.  
Fire-blocking may be omitted in certain cir-  
cumstances, but good practice should dictate  
its inclusion in almost every condition where  
feasible.  
•  
1  
5/8" \(41\) maximum between back of  
exterior wall covering and wall.  
•  
•  
Fire-blocking per § 718 with no open space  
exceeding 100 sf \(9.3 m2\).  
Fire-blocking is not required where the  
exterior wall covering is installed over  
noncombustible framing and the face of the  
exterior wall finish exposed to the  
concealed space is faced with aluminum,  
corrosion-resistant steel, or other approved  
noncombustible material.  
284 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Metal composite materials \(MCM\) are a recently  
developed type of exterior finish material com-  
bining metal skin panels with plastic cores.  
These materials are regulated in two ways, both  
as exterior finishes under § 1406 and as plastics  
under Chapter 26 of the code. They are required  
to meet all of the water-resistance and durability  
criteria set forth in this chapter for other finish  
materials. Their installation in rated construc-  
tion is controlled by testing and approval data  
establishing flame spread and smoke genera-  
tion. A gypsum wall board thermal barrier may  
be required under the assemblies to limit heat  
transfer from exterior fire exposure into the  
building. This barrier is not required when test  
data support its removal.  
The use of this material will be governed by  
tests and approvals for individual materials.  
These tests and approvals must be examined  
in light of the detailed requirements for generic  
types of exterior enclosure. As new materials are  
tested and approved, they must be compared to  
the code requirements to determine detailed  
responses to their installation. An example of  
a typical exterior MCM assembly is illustrated.  
Per § 1406.10, MCM can be used on Type I, II, III,  
and IV construction up to 40' \(12 192\) in height  
when complying with the surface-burning and  
thermal barrier requirements. Above 40' \(12 192\),  
they require additional testing using NFPA 285.  
Successful installations of innovative materials  
such as MCM will be dependent on close con-  
formance with manufacturers’ recommendations.  
This is true of other innovations as well. The code  
endeavors to incorporate new materials and new  
ways of assembling familiar materials such as  
the composite of aluminum and plastics to cre-  
ate MCMs. Innovations usually precede code  
development, so such innovative materials must  
be incorporated into buildings using manufactur-  
ers’ data in concert with close consultation with  
the AHJ.  
Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems  
Exterior insulation and finish \(EIFS\) systems are to  
conform to the requirements of § 1407. They are to  
be designed to comply with ASTM E2568, conform  
to the structural requirements of Chapter 16 of the  
code, and meet the weather resistance require-  
ments of § 1402. Installation is to be in accordance  
with the EIFS manufacturer’s instructions.

above grade plane must comply with the  
following\:  
Per § 1406.10.1, the MCM is to have a  
flame-spread index of not more than 25 and  
a smoke-developed index of 450 or less.  
Per 1406.10.2, the MCM is to be separated  
from the interior of the building by an  
approved thermal barrier of 1/2" \(12.7\)  
gypsum board or an equivalent thermal  
barrier that meets prescribed temperature-  
rise criteria. This barrier may be omitted  
if the MCM assembly complies with  
specified test criteria that are applicable to  
the proposed installation.  
Per § 1406.10.3, full-scale tests are  
required for MCM systems in Types I, II, III,

EXTERIOR WALLS / 285 HIGH-PRESSURE LAMINATE SYSTEMS  
§ 1408 High-Pressure Decorative  
Exterior-Grade Laminates \(HPL\)  
These exterior wall covering systems use pan-  
els made of layers of cellulose fibrous mate-  
rial impregnated with thermosetting resins and  
bonded together by a high-pressure process to  
form a homogeneous, nonporous core suitable  
for exterior use. They are usually applied as  
panels over a metal-channel backing system.  
These are often used in “rain screen” systems.  
Per §1408.8, where HPL systems are used on  
exterior walls required to have a fire-resistance  
rating, evidence is to be submitted to the build-  
ing official that the required fire-resistance  
rating is maintained.  
Per the exception, this requirement does not  
apply to HPL systems that do not contain foam  
plastic insulation and are installed on the outer  
surface of a fire-resistance-rated exterior wall in  
a manner such that the attachments do not pen-  
etrate through the entire exterior wall assembly.  
Unless otherwise specified, HPL shall have a  
maximum flame spread index of 75 or less \(25  
or less in Types I, II, III, and IV construction\) and  
a smoke-developed index of 450 or less when  
tested in the minimum and maximum thick-  
nesses intended for use in accordance with

# Roof Assemblies  
# and Rooftop  
# Structures  
This chapter establishes requirements for the design and construction of roofing  
assemblies for buildings. It also establishes requirements for rooftop structures,  
those that are built on or are projecting from building roofs.  
The definitions located in Chapter 2 describe different types of roofing. The most  
common types are illustrated in this chapter to accompany the requirements for  
roof coverings. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS  
§ 1502 Roof Drainage  
Roof drainage is to comply with the International  
Plumbing Code. Secondary \(emergency over-  
flow\) roof drains or scuppers are to be provided  
where the roof perimeter extends above the  
roof such that water will be trapped if the  
primary drains are blocked. The need and sizing  
for secondary drains is to be per § 1611 and  
Chapter 11 of the International Plumbing Code.  
•  
Minimum Slope  
The roofing criteria include minimum slope  
requirements for the installation of various  
roof coverings. In no case are dead-flat roofs  
allowed for any roofing material.  
•  
288 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
Where scuppers are used, they are to be  
sized to prevent ponding that will exceed the  
roof’s design capacity. Scuppers are to have  
a minimum dimension of 4" \(102\).  
The minimum slope allowable is for coal-  
tar built-up roofs that can be installed  
with a slope of 1/8 vertical in 12 units \(1%  
slope\). We recommend that roofs typically  
be installed with a minimum slope of  
1/4 vertical in 12 units \(2% slope\) at the  
shallowest diagonal slope. § 1503 Weather Protection  
The general criteria in § 1503 require that roof-  
ing materials and assemblies be designed and  
installed in accordance with code requirements  
and manufacturers’ recommendations.  
•  
•  
•  
Flashing and underlayments are to be installed  
to provide a tight, weather-resistant covering  
and to prevent water from entering the wall  
through joints or at intersections between  
building elements.  
Drainage is to be installed per the  
International Plumbing Code.  
Attic spaces at roof assemblies are to be  
ventilated as required by § 1202.2 and  
§ 1202.3.  
•  
•  
The tops of parapet walls are to be capped  
with coping or covered in weatherproof  
materials. The width of this material is to be  
no less than the width of the parapet and  
the top surface of the parapet is to provide  
positive drainage.  
Attic and rafter ventilation is to be  
provided where required by  
§ 1203.2 and § 1202.3.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS  
At roofs with multiple drainage slopes—  
that is, with a series of high and low points  
—the slopes, which are expressed as  
minimums, should be measured at the  
shallowest slope of the roof. This usually  
occurs along a diagonal intersection of two  
slopes.  
If minimum slopes are measured along  
the fall line of intersecting slopes, the roof  
geometry will dictate that the slope of the  
longer intersection will be less than the  
allowable minimum. This is to be avoided.  
Flashings are to be installed at wall and roof  
intersections, at gutters, at changes in roof  
slope or direction, and around roof openings.  
Gutters and drains are to be provided to  
conduct water off the roof and prevent  
ponding and leaking.  
ROOF ASSEMBLIES / 289 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS  
§ 1504 Performance Requirements  
§ 1504 requires roofing to be securely fastened to the  
building to prevent damage in wind exposure. Roofs are  
to resist wind loads per Chapter 16 of the code and per  
requirements spelled out in test criteria for specific types  
of roofing materials, as called out in § 1504.2, 1504.3,  
1504.4, and 1504.5.  
•  
•  
When low-slope roofs \(defined as having a roof slope  
of less than 2\:12\) are installed, the roof materials  
must be tested to verify that they will maintain  
their physical integrity over the life of the roof. The  
tests are to cover physical properties such as sun  
and wind exposure, flexure of membranes in wind-  
load conditions, and impact-resistance of the roof  
coverings.  
Asphalt shingles are to meet the classification  
requirements of Table 1504.2 for the appropriate  
maximum basic wind speed.  
§ 1504.9 Wind Resistance of Aggregate-  
Surfaced Roofs  
Roofing may be surfaced with a top layer of loose aggre-  
gate. Such roofing aggregate can be subject to being  
blown off the roof in high winds and becoming projec-  
tiles that can damage elements downwind of the roof  
from which they are blown. The propensity for blow off  
is related to aggregate size and to the height of parapets  
along roof perimeters. As wind speeds increase, para-

—THE BASICS GENERAL REQUIREMENTS  
§ 1505 Fire Classification  
§ 1505 divides roofing assemblies into fire-  
resistance classifications\: A, B, C, and Nonclassified  
in descending order of effectiveness against fire  
exposure. Nonclassified roofing is material not listed  
as Class A, B, or C and must be approved by the  
building official. The ratings are determined based  
on the performance of roof coverings in fire tests.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
The fire classification of roof coverings is related  
to construction type in Table 1505.1.  
Class A roofing assemblies are permitted in all  
types of construction.  
Class B or better roofing assemblies are required  
for all types of construction other than IIB, IIIB,  
and VB.  
There is a general exception for R-3  
occupancies when the roof edges are separated  
from other buildings by at least 6’ \(1829\).  
There is also an exception for buildings that  
normally require a Class C roof, allowing the  
use of No. 1 cedar or redwood shakes and  
shingles on buildings two stories or less in  
height with a roof area of less than 6,000 sf  
\(557.4 m2\) and with a minimum 10’ \(3048\) fire-  
separation distance to a lot line on all sides,  
except for street fronts or public ways.

ROOF ASSEMBLIES / 291 REQUIREMENTS FOR ROOF COVERINGS  
Roof coverings are to be installed in accordance  
with § 1507 and the manufacturer’s installation  
instructions. The building official may require  
testing for unusual roofing assemblies where  
standards are unclear or the suitability of instal-  
lation criteria may be in question for a proposed  
application.  
Underlayment  
Underlayment requirements for various types  
of roofing materials are consolidated into a  
single location in § 1507.1. Roofing materials  
addressed in this section include asphalt shin-  
gles, clay and concrete tile, metal roof shingles,  
mineral-surfaced roll roofing, slate and slate-  
type shingles, wood shingles, wood shakes,  
metal roof panels, and photovoltaic shingles.  
In areas where there has been a history of ice  
forming along the eaves, causing a backup of  
water, an ice barrier is to be installed for asphalt  
shingles, metal roof shingles, mineral-surfaced  
roll roofing, slate and slate-type shingles, wood  
shingles, and wood shakes. The ice barrier is to  
consist of not less than two layers of underlay-  
ment cemented together, or a self-adhering  
polymer-modified bitumen sheet shall be used  
in place of normal underlayment, extending  
from the lower edges of all roof surfaces to a  
point not less than 24" \(610\) inside the exterior  
wall line of the building.

§ 1507.2 specifies that  
asphalt shingles are to  
be installed over solidly  
sheathed decks.  
•  
Typical shingles are to have at least  
two nails per individual shingle or four  
per shingle strip unless more nailing  
is called for in the manufacturers’  
installation instructions.  
•  
Special fastening methods with  
increased numbers of fasteners are  
required for very steep roofs or in areas  
where high basic wind speeds are noted  
in Chapter 16 of the code.

ASPHALT SHINGLES  
In areas where the climate is cold enough  
that ice may form at the eaves, causing  
a backup of water under the shingles, an  
ice barrier of two layers of underlayment  
cemented together or a polymer-modified  
bitumen sheet is to be installed from the  
eave to a point on the roof that is 24" \(610\)  
inside the exterior wall line of the building.  
Base and cap flashings are to be installed  
with asphalt shingles.  
Base flashing is to be corrosion-resistant  
metal minimum 0.019" \(0.483\) thickness or  
mineral surface roll roofing.  
Cap flashing is to be corrosion-resistant  
metal of the same gauge as the base  
flashing.  
Valley flashing is to be installed before the  
shingles are applied.  
Valley lining is to be installed under  
open valleys using corrosion-resistant  
sheet metal at least 24" \(610\) wide with  
thicknesses per Table 1507.2.8.2.  
An alternative lining consists of two plies  
of mineral surface roll roofing, a bottom  
layer 18" \(457\) wide and a top layer at  
least 36" \(914\) wide.  
One ply of smooth roll roofing at least  
36" \(914\) wide under closed valley. Self-  
adhering polymer-modified bitumen

294 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
The minimum slope for lapped,  
nonsoldered seam metal roofs without  
applied lap sealant is to be 3\:12.  
With lap sealant the minimum slope is  
1/2 vertical in 12 units horizontal \(4%  
slope\).  
For standing seam roofs, the minimum  
slope is 1/4 vertical in 12 units horizontal  
\(2% slope\).  
When the roof covering incorporates  
supporting structural members, the system  
is to be designed in accordance with  
Chapter 22.  
Metal-sheet roof coverings installed  
over structural decking are to comply  
with Table 1507.4.3\(1\). The table sets  
testing standards, application rates, and  
thicknesses for various types of metal  
roofing system ranging from galvanized  
steel to copper, aluminum, and terne-  
coated stainless steel. Metal roofs must be  
of a naturally corrosion-resistant material  
or be provided with corrosion resistance  
per Table 1507.4.3\(2\).  
Fastenings must match the type of metal  
to avoid corrosion caused by galvanic  
electrical activity between dissimilar  
metals.  
Panels are to be installed per the  
manufacturer’s instructions. In the absence  
of such instructions, the fastenings are  
to be galvanized fasteners for galvanized  
roofs and hard copper or copper alloy for  
copper roofs. Stainless-steel fasteners are  
acceptable for all types of metal roofs.  
Note that underlayment requirements are  
not spelled out in the code for metal roof  
panel installations. Many manufacturers  
recommend the use of underlayment. This  
is a reminder that the code is only the  
minimum standard for construction quality,  
not the maximum standard. The installation requirements for both wood  
shakes and shingles are summarized in Table

underlayment is to be solidly cemented to  
the roofing underlayment.  
ROOF ASSEMBLIES / 295 WOOD SHAKES  
•  
•  
•  
•  
While wood shingles are sawn, wood  
shakes are formed by splitting a short log  
into a number of tapered radial sections,  
resulting in at least one texture face.  
Wood shakes may be installed over either  
spaced or solid sheathing.  
Spaced sheathing shall not be less than  
1 × 4 \(nominal; 25 × 102\) boards, spaced  
equal to weather exposure.  
Solid sheathing is required in areas where  
the average daily temperature in January

296 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
Minimum roof slope for wood shakes  
is 4\:12.  
Fastening, sidelap, and flashing  
requirements are similar to those of  
wood shingles.  
See below for weather exposure.  
3/8" to 5/8" \(9.5 to 15.9\) spacing between  
shakes and taper-sawn shakes of naturally  
durable wood.  
1/4" to 3/8" \(6.4 to 9.5\) spacing between  
preservative taper-sawn shakes.  
Shingles are to have exposures in relation  
to roof slopes and shingle length per Table  
1507.8.7.  
For example, for a 4\:12 pitch or steeper  
roofs, No. 1 Grade shingles may have a 5"  
\(127\) exposure for 16" \(406\) length shingles,  
a 5.5" \(140\) exposure for 18" \(457\) length  
shingles, and a 7.5" \(191\) exposure for 24"  
\(610\) length shingles.  
Shakes are to have exposures in relation  
to roof slopes per Table 1507.9.8.  
In an example similar to that for shingles  
above, for a 4\:12 pitch or steeper roofs,  
No. 1 Grade shakes may have a 7.5" \(191\)  
exposure for 18" \(457\) length shakes and  
a 10" \(254\) exposure for 24" \(610\) length  
shakes. \[Note that for 24" \(610\), 0.375"  
\(10\) thick handsplit shakes, the maximum  
exposure is 7.5" \(191\).\] Built-up roof coverings are defined as two or  
more layers of felt cemented together and  
topped with a cap sheet, aggregate, or similar  
surfacing material. Although not stated in the  
code, the intent of this section is that materials  
for such roofs must be complementary and work  
together in accordance with the manufacturer’s  
written installation instructions. The designer  
should verify the compatibility of the various  
components of such roofs to be certain they  
work together chemically and mechanically in  
accordance with the test criteria and standards  
cited in § 1507.10.2 and § 1507.11.2.  
Modified Bitumen Roofing  
Modified bitumen roofing consists of one or  
more layers of polymer-modified asphalt sheets.

BUILT-UP ROOFS  
Material standards are specified in Table  
1507.10.2.  
Slope  
Built-up roof coverings must have a design  
slope of at least 1/4 unit vertical in 12  
units horizontal \(2% slope\) except for  
coal-tar built-up roofs, which may have a  
minimum slope of 1/8 unit vertical in 12 units  
horizontal \(1% slope\).  
Minimum slopes should be maintained  
along the shallowest slope at intersecting  
valleys. Thus, typical roof slopes will be  
slightly greater than 1/4\:12.  
Modified bitumen roofing is similar to built-  
up roofing in application. The sheets are  
fully adhered or mechanically attached to  
the substrate or held in place with a layer of  
ballast.  
These roofing materials are to be installed  
with a minimum slope of at least 1/4\:12.  
ROOF ASSEMBLIES / 297 SINGLE-PLY ROOFING  
Single-Ply Roofing Membranes  
Single-ply roofing membranes are field-applied  
using one layer of a homogeneous or composite  
material rather than multiple layers.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Sprayed Polyurethane Foam Roofing  
This type of roof covering is applied by spraying  
a layer of polyurethane foam onto the roof deck  
and then applying a liquid-applied protective  
coating over the foam membrane after it has  
been chemically cured.  
•  
•  
Liquid-Applied Coatings  
Liquid-applied coatings are not defined in this  
chapter. Typically such coatings form a mem-  
brane by sealing the surface to which they are  
applied after the liquid congeals or dries.  
298 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
The membrane material is seamed  
together with heat or adhesives or a  
combination of seaming methods.  
Table 1507.12.2 specifies the applicable  
ASTM standards for single-ply roofing.  
Single-ply roofing requires a minimum  
design slope of 1/4 unit vertical in 12 units  
horizontal \(2% slope\).  
Application is to be per the manufacturer’s  
installation instructions. The foam plastic  
materials must also comply with the  
code requirements for plastics contained  
in Chapter 26 of the code. Note that the  
only portion of the chapter that seems  
to apply is § 2603.6, which is contained  
in the section pertaining to foam plastic  
insulation and not roofing as such.  
The design slope is to be at least 1/4 unit  
vertical in 12 units horizontal \(2% slope\).  
Liquid-applied roofing must have a  
minimum design slope of 1/4 unit vertical  
in 12 units horizontal \(2% slope\). § 1507.15 addresses the requirements for veg-  
etative roofs. IBC Chapter 2 defines a vegetative  
roof as “an assembly of interacting components  
designed to waterproof a building’s top surface  
that includes, by design, vegetation and related  
landscape elements.” There are requirements  
contained in the International Fire Code \(IFC\)  
that are referenced in this chapter, but not  
restated in the IBC. They are illustrated here. In  
this instance the IFC contains requirements that  
impact project design.  
125' \(39 m\) max.  
125' \(39 m\) max.  
§ 1507.15.1 states that the the structural frame  
and roof construction supporting the load  
imposed on the roof by the vegetative or land-  
scaped roofs is to comply with the requirements  
of Table 601. This is intended to prevent the use  
of Footnote “a” to that table where structural  
elements are permitted to be reduced by 1 hour  
“where supporting a roof only.” It is the intent  
that vegetation and landscape elements on the  
roof constitute more than only a roof.  
Vegetation is to be maintained, with supple-  
mental irrigation provided to maintain levels of  
hydration necessary to keep green roof plants  
alive and to keep dry foliage to a minimum.  
Excess biomass, such as overgrown vegetation,  
leaves, and other dead and decaying material, is  
to be removed at regular intervals, but not less  
than two times per year.  
VEGETATIVE ROOFS AND LANDSCAPED ROOFS  
•  
•  
IFC § 317 states that landscaped roofs are to  
be installed and maintained in accordance  
with § 317.2 through § 317.5 of the IFC.  
Any single area of a rooftop garden or  
landscaped roof areas is not to exceed  
15,625 sf \(1,450 m2\) in size for any single  
area with a maximum dimension of 125 feet  
\(39 m\) in length or width.  
A minimum 6' wide \(1800\) clearance  
consisting of a Class A–rated roof system is  
to be provided between adjacent landscaped  
roof areas. We believe it is the intent of  
the IFC that 6' \(1800\) wide buffer zones be  
provided around all of the items listed in  
this section, both for fire protection and for  
maintenance access.  
6' \(1800\) min.  
•  
Per IFC § 905.3.8, buildings or  
structures that have landscaped roofs  
and that are equipped with a standpipe  
system shall have the standpipe  
system extended to the roof level on  
which the landscaped roof is located.  
•  
IFC § 317.3 calls for all vegetated roofing  
systems abutting combustible vertical  
surfaces to provide a Class A–rated  
roof system for a minimum 6' wide  
\(1800\) continuous border around rooftop  
structures and all rooftop equipment  
including mechanical and machine rooms,  
penthouses, skylights, roof vents, solar  
panels, antenna supports, and building  
service equipment. Many of the items listed  
would not necessarily be considered to have  
combustible vertical surfaces.  
ROOF ASSEMBLIES / 299 ROOF INSULATION  
Per § 1508.1, thermal insulation may be installed  
above the roof deck if it is protected by a roof  
covering complying with the fire-resistance rat-  
ings of NFPA 276 or UL 1256, or a concrete roof  
deck is used and the above-deck thermal insula-  
tion is covered with an approved roof covering.

the material and installation requirements of  
Chapter 26 of the code.  
Above-deck thermal insulation board shall  
comply with the standards in Table 1508.2  
based on the type of material used.  
Radiant Barriers Installed above Deck  
§ 1510.1 contains provisions for radiant barri-  
ers, which are reflective low-emittance layers  
in attics or similar spaces to reflect heat from  
roofs. Any radiant barrier installed above a  
roof deck shall comply with § 1510.2 through  
§ 1510.4.  
Fire Testing  
Radiant barriers shall be permitted for use  
above decks where the radiant barrier is cov-  
ered with an approved roof covering and the  
system consisting of the radiant barrier and the  
roof covering complies with the requirements of  
either FM 4550 or UL 1256.

# Provisions  
This chapter is a summary of structural design requirements, which  
begin with Chapter 16 of the code. Chapter 16 sets forth general design  
criteria for structural loads to be accommodated by the structural system  
of a building. Detailed criteria for building materials are contained in the  
code chapters devoted to specific materials, such as wood \(Chapter 23\),  
concrete \(Chapter 19\), and steel \(Chapter 22\). Chapter 17 of the code  
governs the testing and special inspection of construction materials.  
Chapter 18 of the code applies to the requirements for soils, site grading,  
and foundation design. STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
The structural design requirements contained  
in Chapter 16 apply to all buildings and struc-  
tures. The chapter focuses on the engineering  
principles that underlie the requirements and  
design of structural systems to accommodate  
anticipated loads, such as the weight of the  
building, the weight of occupants and materials  
in the building, and loads imposed by nature,  
such as wind, snow, floods, and earthquakes.  
Chapter 16 contains numerous tables and crite-  
ria that are to be applied in specific situations  
based on building use, occupancy, construction  
type, and geographic location. Detailed analysis  
must be undertaken by the designer in concert  
with appropriate engineering consultants as  
needed to supplement the designer’s train-  
ing and expertise to prepare a code-compliant  
design.  
Snow Load  
Definitions  
The terms in Chapter 16 are defined in Chapter  
2\. Other basic structural terms may not be  
defined, but also need to be understood.  
Terms include\:  
Wind Load  
•  
Earthquake Load  
•  
Dead Load\: The weight of construction  
materials incorporated into a building,  
including architectural and structural  
elements, such as walls, floors, roofs and  
ceilings, stairs, and finishes, as well as  
equipment attached to the structure.  
Note that many definitions in the IBC are  
derived from reference standards and  
are updated when the definitions in the  
reference standards change. For example,  
the definitions of “rigid” and “flexible”  
diaphragms are found in the base  
reference standard, ASCE 7.  
•  
Live Loads\: Loads produced by the use and  
occupancy of a building and not including  
dead loads or environmental loads such  
as wind, snow, floods, or earthquakes.  
•  
Essential Facilities\: Buildings and other  
structures intended to remain operational  
in the event of extreme environmental  
loading, such as from wind, snow, floods, or  
earthquakes.  
•  
“Stress” is the internal resistance or reaction of an  
elastic body to external forces applied to it, expressed in  
•  
units of force per unit of cross-sectional area.  
•  
Nonductile Element\: An element having  
a failure mode that results in an abrupt  
loss of resistance when the element  
is deformed beyond the deformation  
corresponding to its nominal strength.  
Such elements lose their strength when  
deformed beyond their load ranges.  
Ductile Element\: An element capable  
of sustaining large cyclic deformation  
without any significant loss of strength.  
Such elements can deform and still  
maintain structural strength.  
•  
“Strain” is the deformation of a body under the action of  
an applied force, equal to the ratio of the change in size or  
shape to the original size or shape of a stressed element.  
304 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Construction Documents  
Construction documents must have sufficient  
information to allow the AHJ to review the  
documents for code compliance. The documents  
are to show the size, section dimensions, and  
relative locations of structural members. Design  
loads are to be indicated to verify compliance  
with structural design requirements for various  
types of loading. Light-frame buildings, such as  
houses and small commercial buildings con-  
structed under the conventional framing provi-  
sions of § 2308, have a separate, shorter set of  
design requirements for floor and roof live loads,  
ground snow load, basic wind speed, seismic  
design category, flood design data, soil bearing  
values, and rain load data.  
The construction documents are to show the  
loads and information for specified items. The  
detailed requirements for these items will be  
elaborated on later in this chapter.  
STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
•  
•  
Braced Frame\: An essentially vertical  
truss included in a building frame system  
to resist horizontal shear forces, such as  
those imparted by wind or seismic forces.  
Moment Frame\: A frame in which the  
members and joints are capable of  
resisting forces by flexure as well as  
along the axis of the members.  
•  
•  
Shear Wall\: A wall designed to resist  
lateral forces applied parallel to the plane  
of the wall.  
Wall, Load Bearing\: Defined as any metal  
or wood stud wall that supports more  
than 100 pounds per linear foot \(1459  
N/m\). Also, any masonry, concrete, or  
mass timber wall that supports more than  
200 pounds per linear foot \(2919 N/m\).  
The basic concept is that bearing walls  
support the weight of the structure above  
them in a way that their removal would  
compromise the structural stability of the  
building. Non-load-bearing walls could be  
removed with no impact on the building's  
structural system.  
STRUCTURAL PROVISIONS / 305 STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
General Design Requirements  
Buildings are to be designed in accordance with one of several  
defined and approved structural design methods, such as the  
strength design method, the load and resistance factor design  
method, the allowable stress design method, and so forth. The  
structure is to support the factored loads in load combinations  
as defined in the code.  
Serviceability  
The structure is to be designed to limit deflections and lateral  
drift under anticipated loading. Load effects on the structure  
are to be determined by application of a rational analysis tak-  
ing into account equilibrium of the structure, general stability,  
and short-term and long-term material properties.  
Risk Category  
Table 1604.5 classifies buildings into risk categories by impor-  
tance. Factors noted in the structural chapters are for typical  
buildings. Values for loads and strengths are to be increased  
by the factors based on the anticipated consequences of the  
failure of the structure being categorized.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Buildings with low occupancy loads and with little hazard  
to human life in the event of failure, such as agricultural  
buildings or minor storage facilities, fall into Risk Category I.  
Typical buildings not classified as any other category are  
classified as Category II.  
Category III buildings are those where structural failures  
would be a substantial hazard to human life. These include  
structures containing one or more public assembly spaces,  
each having more than 300 occupants and a cumulative  
occupant load of the public assembly spaces of greater  
than 2500, as well as schools and health care facilities  
with an occupant load greater than 250.  
Essential facilities, such as hospitals with surgery or  
emergency facilities, fire stations, police stations, and  
water and power stations that need to be relied on in  
emergencies, have the highest importance, Category IV.  
Determination of wind and seismic loads takes into account  
the risk category of each facility. Wind speeds which are  
used to determine wind loads are based on maps specifically  
keyed to different risk categories. Seismic design is governed  
by a structure’s seismic design category, a classification that  
also considers the nature of the occupancy along with the soil  
characteristics at the site.  
•  
•  
Deflection limits for exterior walls and  
interior partitions\:  
With plaster or stucco finishes— l/360  
With other brittle finishes— l/240  
With flexible finishes— l/120  
l = span  
•  
Deflection limits are based on  
Table 1604.3. Deflection limits are  
typically l/360 for roof members with  
ceilings supporting plaster, l/240 for  
other ceilings, and l/180 for roofs not  
supporting ceilings.  
Category I/II •  
Category III  
•  
Category IV  
Anchorage  
Roofs are to be anchored to walls and columns,  
and walls and columns are to be anchored to  
foundations, to resist the anticipated uplift and  
sliding forces that result from the application of  
the prescribed loads, whether from dead loads  
or live loads.  
306 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Load Combinations  
Various combinations of dead loads, live loads,  
seismic loads, and wind loads are to be applied  
in the design of structural systems. The load fac-  
tors for each combination depend on the type of  
analysis used. Various combinations of loading  
are to be examined and the design is to resist  
the most critical effects of the combinations  
specified. Buildings and other structures are to  
be designed to resist the strength load combina-  
tions specified in ASCE 7 § 2.3; the allowable  
stress design load combinations specified in  
ASCE 7 § 2.4; or the alternative allowable stress  
design load combinations of IBC § 1605.2. We  
will examine the detailed descriptions for each  
load category.  
Dead Loads  
Actual weights of materials and construction  
are to be used to determine dead loads. Fixed  
service equipment is to be considered as dead  
load. These fixed elements include plumbing,  
electrical feeders, HVAC systems, and fire sprin-  
klers. Dead loads are to be considered as  
permanent loads.  
Live Loads  
As defined in Chapter 2, live loads are those pro-  
duced by the use or occupancy of the building.  
Table 1607.1 defines minimum uniformly dis-  
tributed live loads and concentrated loads for  
various occupancies.  
Per § 1607.2, live loads not designated in Table  
1607.1 shall be determined in accordance with  
a method approved by the building official.  
Thus, live loads not noted in the table must be  
evaluated by an approved method.  
STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
•  
•  
The weight of photovoltaic panel systems  
and their support systems are to be  
considered as dead loads.  
The weight of all landscaping and  
hardscaping materials for vegetative and  
landscaped roofs is to be considered as a  
dead load. Their weight is to be computed  
considering both fully saturated soil and  
drainage layer materials and fully dry soil  
and drainage layer materials to determine  
the most severe load effects on the  
structure.

STRUCTURAL PROVISIONS / 307 STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
Concentrated Loads  
Concentrated loads are to be determined either  
by the table or the approved methods, and  
the design is to use the method producing the  
greatest load effect. Concentrated loads are  
to be applied over an area of 2  
1/2 feet square  
\[6  
1/4 sf \(0.58 m2\)\], located so as to produce the  
maximum load effect on the structural members  
being designed.  
Where partitions may be installed and later  
moved, a uniformly distributed partition live load  
of 15 psf \(0.74 kN/m2\) is to be assumed unless  
the specified floor live load is 80 psf \(3.8 kN/m2\)  
or greater.  
To the right is a summary of examples from Table  
1607.1\. The numbers alongside the occupancy  
correspond to the location of the examples in

308 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Loads on Handrails and Guards  
Handrails and guards are to be designed  
to resist a load of 50 pounds per linear  
foot \(0.73 kN/m\) applied in any direction  
at the top and to transfer this load through  
the supports to the structure supporting the  
rail or guard.  
Roof Loads  
Roof loads acting on a sloping surface are  
to be assumed to act vertically on the horizon-  
tal projection of that surface.  
Interior Walls and Partitions  
Walls that exceed 6' \(1829\) in height are  
to be designed to resist loads to which they  
are subjected, but not less than a horizontal  
load of 5 psf \(0.240 kN/m2\).  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
Handrail assemblies are also to be able  
to resist a single concentrated load of 200  
pounds \(0.89 kN\) applied in any direction  
at any point along the top. This load can be  
considered independently of the uniform load  
noted previously.  
Intermediate rails—that is, those not the  
handrail—are to be able to resist a load of  
50 pounds \(0.22 kN\) on an area not to exceed  
12" × 12" \(305 × 305\) including the openings  
and spaces between rails. These are not  
required to be superimposed with the other  
railing loads noted above.  
Grab bars are to be designed to resist a  
single concentrated load of 250 pounds  
\(1.11 kN\) applied in any direction at any  
point.  
Minimum roof live loads are determined  
based on roof slopes per § 1607.14.1 and  
§ 1607.14.2.  
Landscaped roofs not intended for occupancy  
are to have a uniform design live load of  
20 psf \(0.958 kN/m2\). The weight of the  
landscaping materials is to be considered as  
dead load, and the weight is to be calculated  
based on assumed saturation of the soil.  
STRUCTURAL PROVISIONS / 309 STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
Snow Loads  
Snow loads are to be determined in accor-  
dance with a reference standard\: Chapter 7 of  
ASCE 7. Snow loads in the contiguous United  
States are shown in Figures 1608.2\(1\) and \(2\).  
Snow loads are determined based on historical  
data and are correlated to geographic location  
and to elevations.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
For example, the snow load in north  
central Kansas is 25 psf \(1.19 kN/m2\).  
In northeast Arizona, the load varies from  
zero up to the 3000' \(914 m\) elevation; 5  
psf up to the 4500' elevation \(0.24 kN/m2  
load up to the 1372 m elevation\); 10 psf  
up to the 5400' elevation \(0.48 kN/m2  
load up to the 1645 m elevation\); and 15  
psf up to the 6300' elevation \(0.72 kN/m2  
load up to the 1920 m elevation\).  
In heavy snow areas, such as the  
Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains,  
the snow load is to be determined by  
case studies that are based on 50-year  
recurrence data and must be approved by  
the building official.  
The IBC refers directly to ASCE 7 Chapter  
7 for specific snow loads for the states  
of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana,  
Colorado, New Mexico, and New  
Hampshire, and does not provide ground  
snow load information for these states.  
Roofs are to be designed in accordance with  
ASCE 7 to accommodate snow loads under  
varying conditions, such as\:  
•  
Snow loads on flat roofs \(≤ 5°; 0.09 rad\),  
taking into account such factors as exposure  
and rain-on-snow surcharge  
•  
Snow loads on sloped roofs \( \> 5°; 0.09 rad\)  
•  
Drifting snow on low roofs  
•  
Snow sliding from higher sloped roofs onto  
lower roofs  
310 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Wind Loads  
Buildings and portions of buildings are to be  
designed to withstand, at a minimum, the  
wind loads included in the code in accordance  
with Chapters 26–30 of ASCE 7. The wind is  
assumed to come from any horizontal direction,  
and no reduction is to be taken for the effect of  
shielding by other structures. This is in keeping  
with the principle that the code applies to the  
building in question and is affected neither  
positively nor negatively by adjacent buildings.  
There are, however, portions of § 1609 where  
adjacent site and topographic conditions may  
impact wind loads. See § 1609.4.  
Sliding  
Uplift  
STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
•  
•  
•  
Total wind loads are determined by taking  
the product of the wind load per square  
foot multiplied by the area of the building or  
structure being designed.  
Wind is to be assumed to come from any  
horizontal direction and wind pressures are  
to be assumed to act normal to the surface  
considered.  
Because wind can create suction as well as  
pressure effects on a building, the force is to  
be resisted in either direction normal to the  
surface.  
•  
Wind pressures are higher at the corners of  
the building and at roof edges and the ridge.  
•  
Structural members and systems as well  
as building cladding must be anchored to  
resist overturning, uplift, or sliding caused by  
wind forces. Continuous load paths for these  
forces are to be provided to the foundation.  
Overturning  
STRUCTURAL PROVISIONS / 311 STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
Wind Speed  
Wind speeds are designated as “basic design wind  
speeds” and are used for either strength design or  
allowable stress designs. The basic design wind  
speeds are indicated in Figures 1609.3 \(1\) through  
1609.3 \(12\), and vary based on the building’s risk  
category and location. The basic design wind  
speeds for a Risk Category II building vary from 90  
mph \(40 m/s\) on the West Coast of the US to 180  
mph \(80 m/s\) in hurricane-prone areas in southern  
Florida.  
Exposure Category  
The exposure category reflects how ground sur-  
face irregularities affect design wind pressure.  
The exposure conditions vary from the most  
protected to the least protected wind exposures.  
Where buildings have multiple exposures, the  
condition that results in the highest wind force  
shall apply. The exposures are determined by  
applying a “surface roughness” category to wind  
calculations over each 45° \(0.79 rad\) sector from  
which wind can impact the building. The factors  
roughly increase with each surface roughness  
category\:  
•  
•  
•  
Surface Roughness B in urban and suburban  
residential areas; this is the assumed basic  
exposure. For buildings more than 30' \(9140\)  
tall, Exposure B occurs when the surface  
roughness prevails in the upwind direction  
for a distance of at least 2,600' \(792 m\) or 20  
times the height of the building, whichever is  
greater. For buildings less than or equal to 30'  
\(9140\) in height, the distance is 1,500' \(457 m\).  
Surface Roughness C in open terrain with  
scattered obstructions, including areas in  
flat open country and grasslands. Exposure C  
occurs when Exposure B or D does not apply.  
Surface Roughness D in flat, unobstructed  
areas and water surfaces. Exposure D occurs  
when surface roughness D prevails upwind for  
at least 5,000' \(1524 m\) or 20 times the height  
of the building, whichever is greater. Exposure  
D extends inland from the shoreline for 600'  
\(183 m\) or 20 times the height of the structure,  
whichever is greater.  
312 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Soil Lateral Load  
§ 1610 requires basement walls and retaining  
walls to be designed to resist lateral loads  
imposed by soils behind the walls. These walls  
are to be designed to be stable against over-  
turning, sliding, excessive foundation pressure  
and water uplift. The soil loads are to be per  
Table 1610.1 and range from 30 psf per foot  
of depth \(4.7 kPa/m\) for gravels to 60 psf per  
foot of depth \(9.4 kPa/m\) for relatively dense  
inorganic clay soils. Lateral pressures are to be  
increased for surcharge loads \(e.g., parking\) and  
expansive soils.  
Rain Loads  
§ 1611 specifies that roofs are to be designed  
to accommodate the load of accumulated water  
when roof drains are clogged.  
Flat roofs must be analyzed to determine if  
ponding will result in progressive deformation  
of the roof members, leading to potential roof  
instability or failure in accordance with Chapter  
8 of ASCE 7. The anticipated depth of water is  
based on the difference in elevation between  
the primary roof drain system and the outlet of  
the secondary system.  
Flood Loads  
§ 1612 requires that, in flood hazard areas estab-  
lished under the Federal Energy Management  
Agency Flood Insurance Study Program, all  
new buildings as well as major improvements  
or reconstruction projects must be designed to  
resist the effects of flood hazards or flood loads.  
Determination of whether a building falls under  
this requirement is based on locally adopted  
flood-hazard maps. These identify the antici-  
pated flooding areas and elevations of flood  
waters for given anticipated return periods such  
as 50 or 100 years. The elevation and location  
of the building site must be compared to the  
flood-hazard maps to determine if this section  
is applicable.  
STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
•  
§ 1610.2 requires  
basement floors, slabs  
on ground, foundations,  
and similar approximately  
horizontal elements  
below grade to be  
designed to resist uplift  
loads from hydrostatic  
forces or expansive soils.  
Overturning Water and Uplift  
Sliding  
•  
Per Chapter 15, where roof drains  
are required, secondary \(emergency  
overflow\) roof drains or scuppers must  
be provided where the roof perimeter  
construction extends above the roof  
in such a manner that water will  
be entrapped if the primary drains  
allow buildup for any reason. The  
installation and sizing of secondary  
emergency overflow drains, leaders,  
and conductors are to comply with  
§ 1611\. The overflow drain may be\:  
•  
a scupper through the perimeter  
wall, or  
•  
a secondary drain with a visible  
outlet to indicate that there is  
a clogged roof drain.  
STRUCTURAL PROVISIONS / 313 STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
Earthquake Loads  
§ 1613 contains the provisions for the seismic  
design of structures. Earthquake design must  
be investigated for every structure and included  
to varying degrees based on the location of  
the building and the anticipated seismicity of  
the location. Earthquake design can be quite  
complex and involve detailed calculations.  
Certain basic types of structure, notably those  
wood-frame residences and light commercial  
buildings using the Conventional Light-Frame  
Construction provisions of § 2308, are deemed  
to comply with the seismic requirements of  
the code. Other more complex buildings must  
undergo seismic analysis based on ASCE 7. This  
analysis takes into account several basic fac-  
tors. While we will not go into the design calcu-  
lation bases in detail, it is worth understanding  
the basic criteria that are to be addressed by  
seismic analysis and design. Our discussion  
is conceptual, with the assumption that those  
seeking greater detail will refer to the design  
criteria contained in ASCE 7.  
Chapter 16 requires that all structures be  
designed and constructed to resist the effects of  
earthquake motions and be assigned a Seismic  
Design Category based on anticipated earth-  
quake acceleration, risk category, and seismic  
design of the building.  
Site Ground Motion  
§ 1613 provides procedures for determining  
design-earthquake ground motions.  
The magnitude of earthquake ground motions  
at a specific site depends on the proximity of  
the site to the earthquake source, the site’s  
soil characteristics, and the attenuation of the  
peak acceleration. The dynamic response of  
a structure to earthquake ground motions can  
be represented by a graph of spectral response  
acceleration versus period.  
Seismic forces are produced in a structure by  
ground motions that cause a time-dependent  
response in the structure. The response gener-  
ated by the ground motions depends on\:  
•  
•  
•  
the magnitude, duration, and harmonic  
content of the ground motions  
the dynamic properties of the structure  
\(size, configuration, and stiffness\)  
the type and characteristics of the soil  
supporting the structure  
Site class definitions are to be per § 1613.2.2.  
Based on the site soil properties, the site shall  
be classified as Site Class A, B, C, D, E, or F in  
accordance with Chapter 20 of ASCE 7.  
Where the soil properties are not known in  
sufficient detail to determine the site class, Site  
Class D is to be used unless the building official  
or geotechnical data determines Site Class E or  
F soils are present at the site.  
314 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Structural Design Criteria  
All structures require lateral-force-resisting  
and vertical-force-resisting systems having  
adequate strength, stiffness, and energy dis-  
sipation capacity to withstand the anticipated  
or design earthquake ground motions.  
•  
•  
These ground motions are assumed to  
occur along any horizontal or vertical  
direction of a structure.  
Continuous load paths are required to  
transfer forces induced by earthquake  
ground motions from points of application  
to points of resistance.

Design Category \(A, B, C, D, E or F\) based  
on the risk category and the anticipated  
severity of the earthquake ground motion  
at the site. This classification is used to  
determine permissible structural systems,  
limitations on height and irregularity, which  
components must be designed for seismic  
resistance, and the type of lateral force  
analysis required.  
Risk Categories  
Risk categories are taken from the classifi-  
cation of buildings in § 1604.5.  
•  
Risk Category I refers to low-hazard  
uses such as agricultural buildings and  
minor storage facilities.  
•  
Risk Category II refers to most  
buildings that cannot be categorized  
into other groups.  
•  
Risk Category III includes buildings  
whose failure would result in  
substantial risk due to use or  
occupancy.  
•  
Risk Category IV comprises structures  
having essential facilities for post-  
earthquake recovery or a substantial  
amount of hazardous substances.  
Determination of Seismic Design  
Category  
All structures must be assigned a Seismic  
Design Category based on its risk category  
and the design spectral response accel-  
eration coefficient, based on either its short  
or 1-second period response acceleration,  
whichever produces the most severe SDC.  
The design criteria provide the design  
requirements for buildings in Seismic  
Design Category A because earthquakes  
are possible but rare. These structures must  
have all of their parts interconnected and  
be provided with a lateral-force-resisting  
system to resist 0.01 of the portion of the  
total dead load of the structure located at  
the level being designed.  
STRUCTURAL PROVISIONS / 315 STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
Plan Irregularities  
Plan irregularities include\:  
•  
Torsional irregularity existing when the  
maximum story drift at one end of a  
structure is 120–140% greater than the  
average of the story drifts at the two ends of  
the structure  
Building Configuration  
Perhaps of greatest interest to architects and  
designers is the idea of building configuration,  
which classifies buildings into regular and  
irregular configurations. Irregularity in a build-  
ing, either in its plan or its section configura-  
tion, can impact its susceptibility to damage in  
an earthquake.  
•  
Reentrant corners where the projections  
are greater than 15% of the plan dimension  
in the given direction  
•  
Discontinuous diaphragms, especially  
when containing cutouts or open areas  
greater than 50% of the gross enclosed  
diaphragm area  
•  
Out-of-plane offsets creating discontinuities  
in lateral-force-resisting paths  
•  
Nonparallel systems in which the vertical  
lateral-force-resisting systems are not  
parallel or symmetric about the major  
orthogonal axes of the lateral-force-resisting  
systems  
316 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
Vertical Irregularities  
Vertical or sectional irregularities include\:  
•  
Soft story having a lateral stiffness  
significantly less than that in the story above  
•  
Weight or mass irregularity caused by the  
mass of a story being significantly heavier  
than the mass of an adjacent story  
•  
Geometric irregularity caused by one  
horizontal dimension of the lateral-force-  
resisting system that is significantly greater  
than that of an adjacent story  
•  
In-plane discontinuity in vertical lateral-  
force-resisting elements  
•  
Weak story caused by the lateral strength  
of one story being significantly less than that  
in the story above  
STRUCTURAL PROVISIONS / 317 STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
Redundancy  
Redundancy provides multiple paths for a load  
to travel from a point of application to a point of  
resistance. The design criteria assign a redun-  
dancy coefficient to a structure based on the  
extent of structural redundancy inherent in its  
lateral-force-resisting system.  
Deflection and Drift Limits  
The design criteria specify that the design  
story drift not exceed the allowable story drift  
obtained from the criteria specifications. All  
portions of a building should act as a structural  
unit unless they are separated structurally by a  
distance sufficient to avoid damaging contact  
when under deflection.  
Equivalent Lateral Force Procedure  
The equivalent lateral force procedure for the  
seismic design of buildings assumes that the  
buildings are fixed at their base.  
318 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Vertical Distribution of Seismic  
Forces  
The design criteria specify how the seismic  
base shear is to be distributed at each story  
level.  
Horizontal Shear Distribution  
Seismic design story shear is the sum of the  
lateral forces acting at all levels above the  
story. The design criteria specify how the seis-  
mic design story shear is distributed according  
to the rigidity or flexibility of vertical resisting  
elements, horizontal diaphragms, and torsion.  
Overturning  
A structure must be able to resist the over-  
turning moments caused by the lateral forces  
determined to impact the structure.  
STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
•  
•  
•  
The seismic base shear for buildings having  
a fundamental period not exceeding a  
specified period \(around 0.5 second\) are  
distributed linearly along the height with a  
zero value at the base and the maximum  
value at the top.  
The seismic base shear for buildings having  
a fundamental period exceeding a specified  
period \(around 2.5 seconds\) is distributed in  
a parabolic manner along the height with  
a zero value at the base and the maximum  
value at the top.  
The seismic base shear for buildings having  
a fundamental period between the specified  
low and high limits is distributed by linear  
interpolation between a linear and a  
parabolic distribution.  
STRUCTURAL PROVISIONS / 319 STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
Dynamic Analysis Procedure for the  
Seismic Design of Buildings  
The static analysis contained in the design crite-  
ria may only be used for buildings with a lower  
Seismic Design Category, or buildings with a  
regular configuration that meet height limita-  
tions and are assigned a higher Seismic Design  
Category. There are basically three types of  
dynamic analysis procedures that may be used  
for the seismic design of all buildings\: modal  
response spectra analysis, linear time-history  
analysis, and nonlinear time-history analysis.  
Seismic-Force-Resisting Systems  
There are several basic types of seismic-  
force-resisting systems\:  
• Bearing wall systems  
• Building frame systems  
• Moment-resisting frame systems  
• Dual systems with special moment frames  
• Dual systems with intermediate moment  
frames  
• Cantilevered column systems  
320 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS Detailing of Structural Components  
There are requirements for the design and  
detailing of the components making up the  
seismic-force-resisting system of a building.  
After a building is analyzed by calculations to  
determine its dynamic and static responses to  
seismic loads, it must be detailed to implement  
the design requirements of its seismic-force-  
resisting system.  
This analysis must determine the worst-case  
forces based on the direction of seismic load,  
and that maximum force is to be used as the  
design basis.  
STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
Among details to be considered are\:  
•  
Openings in shear walls and diaphragms are  
to transfer stresses at the openings into the  
structure.  
•  
Members are to be interconnected and  
designed to resist seismic forces.  
•  
Collector elements are to be capable of  
transferring seismic forces from the building  
to the lateral-force-resisting system.  
•  
Bearing and shear walls are to be designed  
for shear forces in the plane of the wall and  
for specified forces out-of-plane of the wall.  
STRUCTURAL PROVISIONS / 321 STRUCTURAL DESIGN  
Seismic Design of Architectural,  
Mechanical, and Electrical  
Components  
The seismic design of such nonstructural ele-  
ments as architectural, mechanical, and elec-  
trical components must also be considered.  
These components are typically not part of the  
structural system either for resisting conven-  
tional gravity loads or seismic forces. However,  
these components, when a permanent part of  
the building, must be seismically restrained.  
Failures of these systems result in a great deal  
of physical damage and are often a factor in  
casualties from earthquakes. Also, life safety  
systems, such as fire sprinklers and electri-  
cal systems, need to be functional after an  
earthquake.

THE BASICS  
For example, suspended ceiling systems  
must be laterally braced to resist  
displacement when they undergo lateral  
movement. Hanger wires must be diagonally  
braced to prevent displacement under lateral  
load. They also must be braced vertically  
as there is often an upward force during a  
seismic event that can dislodge systems not  
braced for reversal of gravity loads.  
Such items as electrical components,  
mechanical equipment, ductwork, cabinetry,  
and access floors must be seismically  
braced.  
Also, such elements as exterior architectural  
veneers, cantilevered exterior elements,  
signs, and building ornament must be  
designed and detailed to resist seismic  
forces. 17  
# Special  
# Inspections and  
# Tests  
Certain construction materials and methods of construction are subject to approval and  
special inspection for quality, workmanship, and labeling. The intent of the provisions  
and requirements contained in Chapter 17 is that materials should have the properties,  
strengths, and performance that are represented and used as the basis for design. For many  
fabricated products, these criteria are applied at the factory. For construction, these criteria  
are applied either during fabrication for shop-fabricated items or at the job site during  
construction. Testing and approval agencies must be acceptable to the building official. The  
building official typically recognizes accreditation by national agencies that certify approval  
processes and inspection protocols.  
Special inspections are required for the manufacture, installation, fabrication, erection,  
or placement of components where special expertise is required to ensure compliance  
with design documents and referenced standards. Such inspections may be required to  
be continuous or periodic, depending on the critical nature of the process and whether  
the inspector can determine compliance without being present during the entire process.  
Testing and sample gathering take place to be certain that materials that are to be covered  
by other construction, such as soils work, footings, or structural elements, are determined  
to meet design and code criteria before they are covered up. Special inspection does not  
take the place of structural observation, which is the visual observation of the construction  
process for the structural system. Conversely, such observation does not take the place of  
special inspection, as observations by their nature are periodic and not continuous. § 1704  
has requirements for structural observations under specified conditions. The definition of  
structural observation in Chapter 2 specifically states that it does not waive responsibilities  
for special inspections required by § 1705. STRUCTURAL OBSERVATIONS  
Where required by § 1704.6, the owner or  
the owner’s authorized agent is to employ a  
registered design professional to perform struc-  
tural observations. Structural observation does  
not include or waive the responsibility for the  
inspections in § 110 or the special inspections in  
§ 1705, or other sections of the code.  
There are broad categories where structural  
observations are required by the code. The struc-  
tural observer is directed by the code to visually  
observe representative locations of structural  
systems, details, and load paths for general con-  
formance to the approved construction docu-  
ments. The requirements for risk category, build-  
ing type, and seismic risk are combined into  
a single set of criteria. The code provides the  
building official the discretion to require such  
inspections for any project.  
Structural Observations for Structures  
Per § 1704. 6.1., structural observations are to be  
provided for those structures where one or more  
of the following conditions exist\:  
1\. The structure is classified as Risk Category III  
or IV.  
2\. The structure is a high-rise building.  
3\. The structure is assigned to Seismic Design  
Category E and is greater than two stories  
above the grade plane.  
4\. Such observation is required by the  
registered design professional responsible  
for the structural design.  
5\. Such observation is specifically required by  
the building official.  
Risk categories of buildings and structures  
from Table 1604.5\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Risk Category I refers to low-hazard  
uses such as agricultural buildings  
and minor storage facilities.  
Risk Category II refers to most  
buildings that cannot be categorized  
into other groups.  
Risk Category III includes buildings  
whose failure would result in  
substantial hazard to human life due  
to use or occupancy.  
Risk Category IV comprises structures  
having essential facilities for post-  
earthquake recovery or a substantial  
amount of hazardous substances.

—THE BASICS SPECIAL INSPECTIONS\: STEEL  
Special Inspections  
§1705 specifies certain types of work that require inspection by  
special inspectors, employed by the owner or the responsible  
design professional acting as the owner’s agent. The special  
inspector is subject to the approval of the building official. The  
registered design professional is to prepare a statement of the  
types of special inspections required per § 1704.2.3. There are  
many areas of construction where special inspection may be  
required. It is assumed by the International Building Code that  
one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses will be con-  
structed and inspected under the International Residential Code.  
A representative list of inspections that can be anticipated on  
most relatively complex projects include the following. Note that  
criteria for some items, such as those for structural steel quality  
assurance, are contained in reference documents external to the  
code. Where that occurs we have included a note about the ref-  
erence document, but we have not shown the specific sections  
from the reference document.

inspection requirements for special systems\:  
•  
Special inspection for smoke control systems  
\(found in atrium buildings, large covered malls,  
or high-rise construction\) \(§1705.19\)  
Where special inspections are required per  
§ 1705, then the registered design professional in  
responsible charge of the project is to prepare a state-  
ment of the requirements for special inspections. The  
statement is to be in accord with the requirements of  
§ 1704.3.  
§ 1705.13 and § 1705.14 specify special inspec-  
tion and testing requirements for seismic designs

332 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS 18  
# Soils and  
# Foundations  
Chapter 16 of the code regulates the design of buildings and  
their foundations in terms of the loads specified in that chap-  
ter. Chapter 18 of the code contains the provisions for the  
design and installation of foundation systems. The quality  
and design of materials used structurally in excavations and  
foundations are to comply with the requirements specified in  
Chapters 16, 19, 21, 22, and 23 of the code. Excavations and  
fills are to comply with Chapter 33 of the code. SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS  
Soil and Foundation Investigations  
The building official will normally require a  
soils investigation to determine the stability  
and bearing capacity of the site soils. The  
height of the groundwater table should  
also be part of the soils investigation, as  
any slabs or occupied spaces below grade  
will require either dampproofing or water-  
proofing, depending on the elevation of the  
groundwater table. The report should also  
classify the type of soil, recommend the  
type of footing, and design criteria for the  
footings. Where buildings are located in  
Seismic Design Categories C or above, then  
this chapter requires additional investi-  
gations for potential earthquake motion-  
related hazards such as slope instability,  
liquefaction, total and differential settle-  
ment, surface displacement due to faulting,  
or seismically induced lateral spreading or  
lateral flow.  
Excavation, Grading, and Fill  
§ 1804 governs excavations, placement of  
backfill, and site grading near footings and  
foundations.  
Height of retained earth  
334 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
6' \(1830\) or greater  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Per § 1803.5.7, where excavation will reduce support  
from a foundation, a registered design professional  
must be engaged to prepare an investigative  
assessment of the structure from an examinaton  
of the structure, a review of available design  
documents, and, if necessary, excavation of test  
pits. If necessary, provide bracing by underpinning,  
sheeting, or by other means acceptable to the  
building official.  
Cut-and-fill grading must not remove lateral support  
for the footings of the proposed building and any  
adjacent buildings. If there is a danger to adjacent  
footings, shoring or underpinning must be installed to  
stabilize the excavation.  
For the design of structures assigned to Seismic  
Design Category D, E, or F, the geotechnical  
investigation is to include the items listed\:  
1\. The determination of lateral earth pressures on  
foundation walls and retaining walls supporting  
more than 6' \(1828\) of backfill.  
2\. The potential for liquefaction and soil strength  
loss.  
3\. An assessment of potential consequences of  
liquefaction and soil strength loss.  
4\. Necessary mitigation measures for earthquake-  
related soils problems.  
The site grading must slope away from footings at  
a 5% minimum slope for at least 10' \(3048\) from  
the footing to prevent ponding of water against the  
footings. Swales with a longitudinal slope of 2% may  
be used if there is not sufficient space to provide this  
drainage. Also, impervious \(paved\) surfaces may be  
provided if they have a 2% or greater slope.  
An exception allows areas where accessibility  
requirements apply to have a 2% maximum slope.  
This is done to reconcile potential conflicts between  
access and drainage slope requirements.  
Fills should be placed in lifts and compacted to  
prevent settlement or displacement.  
Alternate systems, such as drains, may be used in  
conditions where the building is built into a slope. DAMPPROOFING AND WATERPROOFING  
•  
•  
•  
When excavation takes place near existing  
foundations, it should not remove or reduce  
lateral support without first underpinning or  
protecting the foundation against settlement  
or detrimental lateral translation, or vertical  
movement, or both.  
Where underpinning is chosen to provide  
the protection or support, the underpinning  
system is to be designed and installed in  
accordance with Chapters 18 and 33 of the  
code.  
Underpinning is to be installed in a  
sequential manner that protects neighboring  
structures, existing building structures on  
site, and the working construction site.  
§ 1805 requires walls that retain earth and  
enclose interior spaces below grade be  
waterproofed or dampproofed. The loca-  
tion of the water table determines whether  
dampproofing or more extensive waterproof-  
ing is required.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Subsoil Drainage System  
When conditions requiring dampproof-  
ing occur at below-grade rooms, § 1805.4  
requires that additional subsoil drainage  
provisions be made. Such conditions are  
presumed not to have hydrostatic pressures.  
•  
•  
•  
Dampproofing is required when there  
may be moisture present, but not under  
hydrostatic pressure.  
This section specifies that floors and  
walls are to be dampproofed when floors  
and walls are at least 6" \(152\) above the  
groundwater table.  
Walls requiring dampproofing are to be  
treated on the earth side of the wall.  
They are to receive a bituminous coating,  
acrylic modified cement, or any of the wall  
waterproofing treatments noted in the code.  
Slabs are to be protected with an under-slab  
polyethylene membrane at least 6 mil  
\[0.006" \(0.152\)\] in thickness with joints  
lapped and sealed.  
Alternately, a mopped-on bitumen layer or  
4-mil \[0.004" \(0.102\)\] polyethylene  
membrane may be applied to the top of the  
slab when other materials will cover it.  
Floor slabs of basements are to be placed  
over a base course of not less than 4" \(102\)  
of gravel or crushed stone.  
A foundation drain is to be placed around  
the perimeter with gravel or crushed stone  
extending a minimum of 12" \(305\) beyond  
the outside edge of the footing.  
The drain gravel or pipe must be located  
with the water-flow line no higher than the  
floor slab.  
SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS / 335 WATERPROOFING  
Waterproofing is required when the site soils  
investigation indicates that there is water under  
hydrostatic pressure at the site. Waterproofing  
is to be installed unless a groundwater control  
system is installed that lowers the water table  
to 6" \(152\) below the lowest floor level.  
Walls that are to be waterproofed must be of  
concrete or masonry construction. They must be  
designed to resist the anticipated hydrostatic  
pressures along with expected lateral and verti-  
cal loads.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
336 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
The waterproofing is to extend from the  
bottom of the wall to no less than 12"  
\(305\) above the maximum elevation of  
the groundwater table.  
Joints in the wall and between walls and  
floors and penetrations are to be made  
watertight using approved materials and  
methods. The designer should be certain  
that the waterproofing method chosen has  
recommended details and procedures for  
creating waterproof conditions.  
Backfill  
Filter membrane  
Stone filter  
Perimeter drain tile  
Floor waterproofing is to be installed under  
the slab, consisting of a membrane of  
rubberized asphalt, butyl rubber, or a 6-mil  
\[0.006" \(0.152\)\] polyethylene membrane. All  
joints are to be lapped and sealed. LOAD-BEARING VALUES OF SOILS  
Allowable Load-Bearing Values of  
Soils  
Table 1806.2 contains presumptive load-bearing  
values for foundations and lateral pressure,  
based on the observed capacities for various  
types of rock and soils. The use of these allow-  
able pressures for vertical and lateral loads  
determines the size of the footing, based on the  
weight of the structure bearing down on them.  
The allowable vertical pressures vary from  
12,000 psf \(575 kN/m2\) for bedrock to 1,500 psf  
\(72 kN/m2\) for clay soils.  
•  
For example, a footing supported on clay  
soil will need to be eight times larger in plan  
area than one carried on bedrock.  
SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS / 337 FOOTINGS AND FOUNDATIONS  
§ 1808 and § 1809 describe the requirements for  
footings and for shallow foundations.  
•  
•  
•  
Footings are to be placed on undisturbed soil  
or on properly compacted fill.  
Footing tops are to be level, whereas the  
bottom of footings may have a slope of up  
to 10%.  
Footings must be stepped when necessary  
to keep the footings in the ground when site  
slopes exceed 10%.  
•  
Footings are to be at least 12" \(305\)  
below grade, except in conditions  
where frost occurs, in which case the  
footings must extend below  
the frost line of the locality.  
•  
•  
Per § 1808.3.2, no fill or other surcharge  
loads are to be placed adjacent to any  
building or structure unless such building  
or structure is capable of withstanding  
the additional loads caused by the fill or  
surcharge. Existing footings or foundations  
that will be affected by any excavation shall  
be underpinned or otherwise protected  
against settlement, against detrimental  
lateral or vertical movement, or both.  
Footings on granular soils must be located  
so that a line drawn between the lower  
edges of adjoining footings does not exceed  
a 30° \(0.52 rad\) angle with the horizontal.  
•  
At least H/3 or 40' \(12 192\),  
whichever is smaller, to provide  
vertical and lateral support for

FOOTINGS AND FOUNDATIONS  
While there are provisions for alternate materials  
for footings, most footings and foundations are  
made of concrete. We will focus on concrete foot-  
ings and foundation designs.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Concrete foundations are to be of reinforced  
concrete with a concrete mix designed per  
§ 1808.8.1 for strength and per § 1808.8.3  
to minimize segregation during placement,  
whether placed by funnel hopper or by  
pumping.  
Concrete is to be placed to avoid segregation  
using a tremie and not dropped in the pier  
from the top per § 1808.8.3.  
Footing concrete is to have a minimum  
compressive strength of 2,500 psi \(17.2 MPa\).  
Concrete cover over reinforcing steel is to be  
per § 20.5 of ACI 318.  
Light-frame construction footings and  
foundations are to be in accordance with  
Table 1809.7. The number of floors supported  
by the foundation determines the footing and  
foundation wall sizes.  
Concrete or masonry foundation walls for  
below-grade structures where earth is retained  
may be designed by using Tables 1807.1.6.2  
through 1807.1.6.3 \(4\) or by calculation.  
The tables are based on the height and the  
thickness of the wall. They assume steel  
with 60,000 psi \(414 MPa\) yield strength and  
concrete with a compressive strength  
of 2,500 psi \(17.2 MPa\). Reinforcing steel is  
to be placed in the wall based on the tables.  
Alternate reinforcing from that called for in the  
tables may be used as long as an equivalent  
cross-sectional area is maintained and the  
rebar spacing does not exceed 72" \(1829\) and  
the rebar sizes do not exceed No. 11.  
Per § 1809.5.1, frost protection is to be  
provided at exterior landings for all required  
exits with outward-swinging doors. Frost  
protection is only be required to the extent  
necessary to ensure the unobstructed opening  
of the required exit doors. The frost protection  
is to prevent heaving of the foundation or slab  
the door swings over to be certain the exit  
door remains operable in buldings located in  
climates where frost heave occurs. Ground  
frost heave happens when groundwater  
in cold climates changes from a liquid to a  
solid. Water expands as it freezes. This is an  
example detail; confirm appropriate details for  
the climate at the actual building location.  
SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS / 339 DEEP FOUNDATIONS  
When spread footings are not adequate or  
appropriate for a foundation system, pier  
and pile foundations are often used. Both  
systems use columnar structural elements  
either cast in drilled holes or driven into  
the ground to support foundations. § 1810  
describes the requirements for such deep  
foundation systems.  
Chapter 2 defines a “deep foundation” as a  
foundation element that cannot be consid-  
ered a shallow foundation, or in other words,  
not a strip footing, a mat foundation, a slab-  
on-grade foundation, or similar elements that  
are installed relatively close to the ground  
surface.

Per the definition in Chapter 2, “foundation  
piers” are isolated, vertical masonry  
foundation members whose horizontal  
dimension \(h\) does not exceed three times  
their thickness \(t\) and whose height \(H\)  
is equal to or less than four times their  
thickness.  
Belled piers are cast-in-place concrete  
piers having a base that is larger than  
the diameter of the rest of the shaft. This  
enlarged base increases the load-bearing  
area of an end-bearing pier.  
Piles are relatively slender structural  
elements, having lengths exceeding 12  
times their least horizontal dimension.  
§ 1810 covers the design and construction  
of driven piles, such as timber piles and  
precast concrete piles.  
§ 1810 also covers the design and  
construction of cast-in-place concrete  
pile foundations\: augered uncased piles,  
caisson piles, concrete-filled steel pipe  
and tube piles, driven uncased piles, and  
enlarged-base piles.  
Both piers and piles derive their load-  
carrying capacity through skin friction  
\(friction between their surfaces and the  
surrounding soil\), through end-bearing on  
supporting material, or a combination  
of both. 19  
# Building  
# Materials  
# and Systems  
This chapter is a summary of design requirements contained in Chapters 19 through  
33 of the code. Chapters 19 through 23 deal primarily with the structural requirements  
for building materials\: concrete, masonry, steel, wood, and aluminum. We will touch  
on the implications of the structural design requirements on the physical form of the  
building. A detailed discussion of the mathematics of structural design is beyond the  
scope of this book.  
Chapters 24 through 26 cover building materials used primarily for building-envelope  
construction and for finishes\: glass and glazing, gypsum board and plaster, and plas-  
tics.  
Chapters 27 through 29 cover building-code requirements for systems that are  
addressed in other related codes\: electrical, mechanical, and plumbing systems.  
Chapters 30 through 33 deal with miscellaneous items not readily related to other  
code sections\: elevators and conveying systems, special construction, encroachments  
on the public right of way, and safeguards during construction.  
Our discussion will concentrate on the code chapters related to building design. These  
are grouped together into sections for construction materials, finish materials, and  
conveying systems. We will not touch on the other sections noted above, as most of  
the other items are addressed in other codes or by specialized constructors and are  
thus beyond the scope of this book. STRUCTURAL MATERIALS  
The materials chapters of the code are based on  
standards developed by institutions that concentrate  
on developing industry standards for specific materi-  
als. These groups bring together materials experts,  
industry representatives, design professionals, testing  
agencies, and building officials to develop criteria  
for strength, material design calculations, testing,  
and quality assurance for various materials. These  
standards are developed through a consensus pro-  
cess similar to that for building-code development.  
Materials are also subjected to physical tests under  
controlled load or fire conditions to determine their  
performance and develop criteria to be incorpo-  
rated into the standards. These criteria are continually  
updated to incorporate new knowledge learned from  
improvements in design techniques and analyses of  
building performance under actual conditions such as  
wind, fire, and earthquake.  
Chapter 19\: Concrete  
Chapter 19 is based on standard ACI 318, developed  
by the American Concrete Institute. There are certain  
detailed modifications to ACI 318 made in the code-  
development process. These modifications are shown  
in § 1905. Because of these modifications, the code  
must be used for reference during concrete design in  
conjunction with ACI 318. ACI 318 should not be used  
alone for design work that will be undertaken under  
the purview of the IBC.  
§ 1901.2 states that Chapter 19 governs design of all  
concrete, whether reinforced or unreinforced, except  
for slabs on grade that do not transfer vertical or lat-  
eral loads from the structure to the soil. Since most,  
if not all, slabs on grade contained in buildings typi-  
cally meet these criteria in some if not all locations,  
it should be assumed that Chapter 19 effectively  
governs the design of all concrete except for stand-  
alone slabs on grade such as patios or paving. As for  
other materials, concrete is to be designed to resist  
wind and seismic loads in addition to anticipated live  
and dead loads.  
Per § 1901.3, anchoring to concrete is to be in  
accordance with ACI 318 as amended in § 1905. The  
criteria apply to a wide range of anchors, including  
cast-in \(headed bolts, headed studs, and hooked J- or  
L-bolts\), post-installed expansion \(torque-controlled  
and displacement-controlled\), undercut, screw, and  
adhesive anchors.

§ 1902 2 coordinates terminology between  
ASCE 7, Minimum Design Loads and  
Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other  
Structures, and ACI 318, Building Code  
Requirements for Structural Concrete. See  
also § 1905 for IBC modifications to ACI 318.  
•  
Concrete is made up of cementitious  
materials that bind it and other aggregates  
together with a cementing action.  
Concrete is defined as a mixture of\:  
• Portland or other hydraulic cement  
• Water  
• Fine aggregate and coarse aggregate  
with or without admixtures  
Aggregate is a hard, inert, granular material,  
such as sand, gravel, crushed rock, and  
blast-furnace slag, added to a cement paste  
to form concrete or mortar.  
Lightweight aggregate has a dry, loose  
weight of not more than 70 pounds per  
cubic foot \(pcf\) \(1120 kg/m3\).  
Admixtures are added to concrete before  
or during its mixing to alter its properties  
or those of the hardened product.  
Concrete performs much better in  
compression than in tension, so reinforcing  
is introduced to produce a material with  
balanced performance. Reinforcing is  
usually steel, with deformations on the  
surface to increase the bonding between  
the concrete and the steel, placed in the  
concrete in such a location as to resist  
tension, shear, and sometimes compressive  
stresses.  
Reinforced concrete is structural concrete  
reinforced with prestressing tendons or  
non-prestressed reinforcement.  
Plain concrete refers to structural  
concrete having no reinforcement or less  
reinforcement than the minimum specified  
for reinforced concrete.  
Cast-in-place concrete is deposited, formed,  
cured, and finished in its final position as  
part of a structure.  
Precast concrete elements are cast and  
cured in a place other than their final  
location in a structure.

Strength and Durability  
Many factors can affect the ultimate strength of  
concrete. The first is the mix design, which sets  
the ratios of the materials and water. The sec-  
ond is the time that passes between the initial  
introduction of water and the placement of the  
concrete. Concrete setting is not just a drying  
out of the mixture; it is a chemical reaction that  
has a very definite time component. The mixture  
must also be kept from segregating into its con-  
stituent parts by rotating the drum of the mixer  
prior to placement.  
The temperature at the time of placement can  
also affect the strength of the concrete, with  
strengths declining at both high and low place-  
ment temperatures.  
Air is entrained into the concrete for freeze/  
thaw protection based on the anticipated  
weathering severity. The probability of weather-  
ing, shown in ACI 318, places the majority of  
the continental US in the moderate to severe  
weathering probability areas.  
In cold weather areas where de-icing chemicals  
such as salts are used, steps must be taken to  
increase the strength of the concrete and also  
to protect reinforcing from corrosion to resist the  
long-term impacts of weathering and corrosion  
on the strength and durability of the concrete.  
Cylinder Tests  
Concrete is typically mixed in one location and  
placed in another. Because of this, concrete  
must be field-tested to be certain that the mate-  
rial actually placed in the building meets the  
design criteria. Test cylinders are made as the  
material is placed. These cylinders are broken  
in a test machine to determine the strength of  
the concrete. Tests are typically done at 7 days  
to determine the strength trend for the concrete  
and at 28 days, which is the defined time when  
the design strength is to be achieved. Concrete  
mixes are proportioned to achieve workability,  
durability under expected exposure, and devel-  
opment of the desired design strength.

Formwork  
The design, fabrication, and erection  
of formwork is to comply with ACI 318.  
Formwork is necessary to develop the  
required shape and dimensions of concrete  
members in a structure. Forms must be  
substantial and tight enough to prevent  
leakage of cement mortar, be properly  
braced to maintain their proper position  
and shape, and be supported so as not to  
damage previously placed concrete.  
Note that items such as conduits and pipes  
may be embedded in concrete if they are  
not harmful to the concrete and comply  
with the limits set in ACI 318.  
Joints  
Refer to ACI 318 for provisions for construc-  
tion joints between two successive place-  
ments of concrete.

Construction joints must provide for the  
transfer of shear and other forces through  
the joints, usually by means of mechanical  
keys or dowels.  
Construction joints must be located within  
the middle third of floor slabs, beams, and  
girders.  
Construction joints in girders must be offset  
a minimum distance of two times the width  
of intersecting beams.  
Contraction joints are formed, sawed, or  
tooled grooves in a concrete structure  
to create a weakened plane and regulate  
the location of cracking resulting from  
thermal stresses or drying shrinkage.  
Isolation joints separate adjoining parts  
of a concrete structure to allow relative  
movement in three directions to occur  
and to avoid formation of cracks elsewhere  
in the concrete. All or part of the bonded  
reinforcement may be interrupted at  
isolation joints, but the joints must not  
interfere with the performance of the  
structure. CONCRETE  
•  
Beams, girders, haunches, drop panels, and  
capitals are to be placed monolithically as  
part of a floor system.  
Details of Reinforcement  
There are several key elements of con-  
crete and the configuration and place-  
ment of reinforcement as illustrated.  
Per § 1901.7, structural tolerances for  
cast-in-place concrete structural ele-  
ments are to be in accordance with ACI  
117, and for precast concrete structural  
elements, structural tolerances are to be  
in accordance with ACI ITG-7.  
•  
•  
•  
Columns are structural members used  
primarily to support axial compressive loads.  
Spiral reinforcement is lateral reinforcement  
for concrete columns, consisting of  
a continuously wound cylindrical helix  
held firmly in place with vertical spacers.  
Ties provide lateral reinforcement for  
compressive structural members and for  
tension in strut-and-tie models.  
•  
Stirrups provide lateral reinforcement in  
flexural structural members, consisting of  
bent L, U, or rectangular shapes and  
located perpendicular to or at an angle  
to longitudinal reinforcement.

Concrete Cover for Weather, Moisture,  
and Fire Protection  
ACI 318 specifies minimum concrete cover for  
reinforcing steel for several reasons. The cover  
may be to afford fire resistance as required by  
the classification of the structure. The cover  
may be specified in underground situations to  
provide protection for the reinforcing steel from  
moisture in the ground. The cover for above-  
grade concrete exposed to exterior weather  
conditions is to protect the reinforcing steel  
from rain or snow. Typical examples of depth

Structural Plain Concrete  
Per § 1906, it is acceptable to use plain  
unreinforced concrete under certain con-  
ditions, but only for simple structures.  
The design and construction of structural  
plain concrete, both cast-in-place and  
precast, are to comply with the minimum  
requirements of ACI 318, as modified in  
§ 1905\. In most circumstances the use of  
minimal reinforcing to address tempera-  
ture changes and shrinkage cracking is  
recommended practice instead of using  
plain concrete.

Per § 1906 for Group R-3 occupancies  
and buildings of other occupancies less  
than two stories above grade plane and  
of light-frame construction, the required  
footing thickness of ACI 318 is permitted  
to be reduced to 6" \(152\), provided that the  
footing does not extend more than 4" \(102\)  
on either side of the supported wall. Note  
that some foundations in Seismic Design  
Categories C, D, E, and F may require  
reinforcement at the footings per  
§ 1905.1.7.  
Per § 1907.1, ground-supported concrete  
floor slabs are to be a minimum of 3  
1/2"  
\(89\) thick, with a 6-mil \[0.006" \(0.152\)\]  
polyethylene vapor retarder under the  
slab to prevent the transmission of vapor  
through the slab.  
§ 1901.3 specifies that anchoring to  
concrete is to be in accordance with ACI  
318 as amended in § 1905. The criteria  
that used to be covered in Table 1908.2—  
interrelating bolt diameter, embedment  
length, edge distance, spacing, and  
concrete strength—is now addressed  
in ACI 318, which has more up-to-date  
criteria than the older standards found  
previously in the IBC. Chapter 20\: Aluminum  
Chapter 20 is based completely on AA ASM 35  
and AA ADM, both published by the Aluminum  
Association. The code has adopted the industry  
standards for this material without modifica-  
tion. Aluminum structural design criteria are to  
conform to the design loads set forth in Chapter  
16\. § 1604.3.5 refers to AA ADM for deflection  
limit criteria.  
Aluminum members behave similarly to steel  
except that aluminum is more flexible and  
will exhibit greater deformation and deflection  
under the same stress and strain than will steel.  
Thus aluminum structural members are typically  
larger in thickness and/or section dimension  
than steel members under the same load con-  
ditions. Except under specialized conditions,  
where other materials may not be appropriate  
or durable, aluminum is used very infrequently  
as a primary structural material. Aluminum  
members are widely used in secondary struc-  
tural elements such as windows, curtain walls,  
and skylights.  
ALUMINUM  
Aluminum structural elements may be readily  
made into many shapes by extrusion or fabrica-  
tion. The illustrations show typical applications  
that are generally encountered by designers.  
They are consistent with the recommendations  
and requirements of the referenced standards.

BUILDING MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS / 349 MASONRY  
Chapter 21\: Masonry  
Chapter 21 primarily uses standards devel-  
oped by The Masonry Society \(TMS\)\: TMS  
402, TMS 403, or TMS 404. Masonry is defined  
as construction made up of units made from  
clay, shale, concrete, glass, gypsum, stone,  
stone masonry veneer, AAC \(autoclaved aer-  
ated concrete, or other approved units bonded  
together. Ceramic tile is also classified by the  
code as masonry.  
The units may be mortared or not, and may  
be grouted or not, depending on the materials  
and the structural conditions. Typically, most  
masonry units are mortared together between  
units. There are some types of surface bonding  
mortar that hold the units together by covering  
the surface with a mixture of cementitious  
materials and glass fibers. These mortars con-  
sist of cementitious materials and fine aggre-  
gates. Cement lime mortar contains hydrated  
lime or lime putty.  
Masonry is often grouted, especially in condi-  
tions where there are high seismic-resistive  
design criteria. Grout is similar in composi-  
tion to concrete, but with smaller-size coarse  
aggregates.  
•  
•  
350 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
Grouted masonry takes two forms. One is  
where the cells of hollow unit masonry are  
filled with grout.  
The other form is where the space between  
wythes \(walls\) of masonry is filled with  
grout. Reinforcement may be placed in  
either condition depending on structural  
design requirements. MASONRY  
Construction  
§ 2104 provides references for masonry  
construction practices. Requirements  
are contained in the referenced stan-  
dards\: TMS 602 and 604.  
•  
•  
Bed joints are defined as the horizontal layer  
of mortar on which masonry units are laid.  
Head joints are the vertical mortar joints  
between masonry units.  
•  
Bed and head joints are to be 3/8" \(10\) thick,  
except for starter courses over foundations,  
which may vary from 1/4" to 11/4" \(6 to 32\).  
•  
•  
Solid units are to have fully mortared bed  
and head joints. Mortar is to be applied  
to the mortared faces by buttering before  
placement. Mortar is not to be forced into  
joints after placement.  
For hollow units, block shells are to have  
fully mortared bed joints over the face of  
the unit and the head joints to be mortared  
to equal the thickness of the shell.  
•  
Note that masonry units, especially concrete  
masonry units, are described in nominal  
dimensions where the actual dimension  
of the unit is typically less. This is usually  
done to account for the thickness of joints in  
laying out modular dimensions.  
BUILDING MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS / 351 MASONRY  
Code users are required to consult the refer-  
ence standards for procedures for cold-weath-  
er and hot-weather construction. Wind factors  
are also included to address wind chill in cold  
weather and the drying effects of hot winds.  
The basic criteria for masonry units, as well  
as mortars and grouts, apply in cold weather  
when the temperature falls below 40°F \(4°C\)  
and in hot weather when the temperature is  
above 100°F \(37.8°C\) or when there is a wind  
velocity greater than 8 mph \(12.9 km/hr\) and  
the temperature is above 90°F \(32.2°C\).  
•  
•  
Wind and Seismic Design  
Wind and seismic design of masonry, as for  
other materials, depends on the anticipated  
lateral forces in the locale of the building.  
It is acceptable to use masonry for lateral-  
load-resistant systems, as long as the criteria  
for lateral design are met. As for the other  
masonry design elements, these criteria are  
contained in TMS 402.  
•  
352 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED

THE BASICS  
Wall ties are to conform to the  
requirements of the TMS reference  
standards.  
Weep holes are to be installed per the  
requirements of the TMS reference  
standards.  
A critical element for masonry concerns  
partition walls that are not designed to  
resist vertical or lateral loads other than  
that of their own mass. Such walls must be  
isolated from the building structural system  
by elements that accommodate anticipated  
movements in the structure. No seismic or  
wind loads are to be transmitted to or from  
these partitions.  
Movement Design Methods  
Chapter 21 recognizes that there are several alternative  
structural design methodologies for masonry. Designers  
may choose which method to apply using the criteria  
specified in § 2107 for Allowable Stress Design, § 2108  
for Strength Design of Masonry, or § 2109 for Empirical  
Design of Adobe Masonry.  
Allowable Stress Design of Masonry  
Allowable stress design for masonry is to be per  
§ 2107\. Allowable stress design is a structural design  
method that is based on some of the oldest principles  
of structural engineering. First, loads and forces act-  
ing on a structure are determined. Then the ability of  
the structural materials to resist those forces with-  
out encountering elastic deformations is determined,  
based on the sizes of the structural members and the  
allowable forces within them. Then a factor of safety  
is applied to the ability of the materials to resist the  
forces to determine the final design sizes of structural  
members. For masonry, allowable stress design is to be  
per the provisions of Chapters 1 through 8 of TMS 402,  
except as modified by § 2107.2 through 2107.3, which  
are lap and reinforcement splice exceptions to TMS  
402\. Seismic design per § 2106 and the modifications  
contained in § 2107 are to be applied in concert with  
the standard.  
Strength Design of Masonry  
Strength design is based on the principle of shifting  
some of the safety factor from material properties by  
using factored loads. The principle was first applied for  
concrete, which uses this method almost exclusively,  
and has moved into other material design criteria as  
well. The requirements of § 2106 for seismic design and  
the modifications contained in § 2108 are to be applied  
to the provisions contained in the referenced standards\:  
TMS 402 or TMS 403.  
Empirical Design of Adobe Masonry  
The empirical design method described in § 2109 is  
restricted to low-to-moderate seismic and wind-hazard  
areas, and is used for buildings with adobe construc-  
tion. The allowable use of empirically designed adobe  
masonry is intended to be very limited. Where the very  
limited load or height criteria are exceeded, adobe  
masonry structures are to be designed using allowable  
stress design or strength design.  
MASONRY  
Masonry Shear Walls  
•  
Shear walls are to be oriented parallel to  
the direction of lateral forces resisted.  
•  
Masonry seismic design usually limits the  
spacing of masonry shear walls such that  
the length-to-width ratios of floor or roof  
diaphragms transferring lateral forces to  
the shear walls do not exceed specified  
ratios.  
BUILDING MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS / 353 STEEL  
Chapter 22\: Steel  
Chapter 22 divides steel construction materi-  
als into basically four broad classes\: structural  
steel, composite steel/concrete, steel joists,  
and cold-formed steel members. There are also  
provisions for steel cable structures and steel  
storage racks.  
The first broad category is for structural steel  
members, which are rolled steel shapes, usu-  
ally hot-rolled, and not otherwise falling into  
the other two categories. The design of these  
members falls under the specifications of the  
American Institute of Steel Construction \(AISC\)  
360\. There are separate sets of specifications  
for structural steel design depending on the  
design method used—load and resistance fac-  
tor design or allowable stress design.  
Bolts and welding of connections are governed  
by the applicable specifications for each type of  
steel construction. As for other materials, steel  
structures are to comply with seismic and wind-  
design requirements, where applicable.  
The second category recognizes the use of  
steel and concrete framing for columns, beams,  
walls, floors, and roofs in buildings in many  
varied combinations. These types of buildings  
are known as composite steel and concrete  
structures. Systems of structural steel acting  
compositely with reinforced concrete are to  
be designed in accordance with both AISC 360  
and ACI 318, but excluding ACI 318 Chapter  
14\. Where required by the seismic design cat-  
egory of the building, the seismic design of  
composite steel and concrete systems is to be  
in accordance with the additional provisions of  
§ 2206.2.1, “Seismic requirements for compos-  
ite structural steel and concrete construction.”  
Where a response modification coefficient, R, in  
accordance with ASCE 7, Table 12.2-1, is used  
for the design of systems of structural steel act-  
ing compositely with reinforced concrete, the  
structures are to be designed and detailed in  
accordance with the requirements of AISC 341.

—THE BASICS STEEL  
The third category is for steel joists, made of  
combinations of hot-rolled or cold-formed solid  
or open-web sections. Design of steel joists is  
governed by specifications from the Steel Joist  
Institute \(SJI\).  
The fourth widely used category is cold-formed  
steel, made up of members bent from steel  
sheets or strips, including roof decks, floor and  
wall panels, studs, floor joists, and other struc-  
tural members. The design of cold-formed mem-  
bers is governed by the American Iron and Steel  
Institute \(AISI\) Specifications for the Design of  
Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members.  
§ 2211 governs the design of light-framed cold-  
formed steel floor and roof systems, structural  
walls, shear walls, and trusses. Various AISI  
standards are referenced for design and con-  
struction of these systems.  
•  
AISI sets forth criteria for nominal  
shear values for shear walls framed  
with cold-formed steel studs. The  
variables include\:  
•  
Maximum height/length ratio  
•  
Fastener spacing along panel  
edges  
•  
Maximum spacing of framing  
BUILDING MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS / 355 WOOD  
Chapter 23\: Wood  
Chapter 23 governs the materials, design, qual-  
ity, and construction of wood members and their  
fasteners. Wood structures are to be designed  
using one of the approved methods\: allowable  
stress design per § 2304, § 2305, and § 2306;  
load and resistance factor design per § 2304,  
§ 2305, and § 2307; or using conventional  
light-frame construction provisions per § 2304  
and § 2308. Wood-frame construction is very  
prevalent in the United States, especially in  
home-building. The code contains a prescrip-  
tive approach for much of small wood-frame  
construction as it is typically practiced. These  
criteria are termed as conventional light-frame  
wood construction. This is defined as a system  
where the primary structure is made up of  
repetitive wood framing members. We will  
use these conventional construction provisions  
for our illustrations of code-compliant wood-  
frame construction. We have not duplicated the  
illustrations contained in the code, as they are  
self-explanatory. Note that our discussion does  
not include the exceptions to the prescriptive  
requirements. Code-compliant design must take  
all of the code requirements and exceptions  
under consideration for the specific conditions  
of the project.

THE BASICS  
Note that sawn lumber varies from the  
nominal dimensions to actual dimensions.  
Nominal dimensions are based on the size  
of wood members before finish planing  
and before shrinkage. Code dimensions  
and calculations are stated as nominal  
dimensions. Per § 2304.2, calculations for  
structural member sizes are to be based  
on actual dimensions. Factors for the smaller  
actual dimensions are accounted for in  
tables or formulas, unless explicitly stated  
otherwise.  
Nominal dimensions  
Shrinkage of wood due to drying and milling  
operations  
Actual dimensions are less than the nominal  
dimensions.  
For example, a 2 × 4 stud \(nominal\) is  
approximately 11/2" × 31/2" \(actual\). WOOD  
Minimum Standards and Quality  
§ 2303 specifies the minimum standards and  
quality for lumber, sheathing, siding, and other  
wood-based products. Lumber is to be graded per  
the standards of the Department of Commerce  
\(DOC\) American Softwood Lumber Standard,  
PS 20.  
While most wood is not inherently fire resistant,  
there are chemical treatments that can make wood  
“fire-retardant,” which is defined as having a flame  
spread index of 25 or less and not supporting pro-  
gressive combustion in a 30-minute test of specified  
fire intensity. There are two processes recognized in  
§ 2303.2 to provide permanent protection against  
fire damage\: pressure impregnation or impregnation  
by other methods. The “other methods” may not  
include paints, coatings, or stains, but must actually  
penetrate the wood. The methods must be approved  
by the building official for the use intended.  
Wood is also classified as to its natural durability.  
The heartwood for species such as redwood and  
cedar are classified as decay-resistant. Redwood,  
Alaskan yellow cedar, and red cedars are also clas-  
sified as termite-resistant. The code requires the  
use of naturally durable woods or pressure-treated  
woods in certain situations, especially in conditions  
where wood members are close to adjacent soil.  
Each of the criteria is specific to the type of wood  
materials they cover. Wood structural panels are to  
be per requirements of standards DOC PS 1, PS 2,  
or ANSI/APA PRP 210. Structural glued laminated  
timbers are to be manufactured and identified as  
required in ANSI/APA 190.1 and ASTM D 3737.  
Structural capacities for prefabricated wood I-joists  
and structural composite lumber are established and  
monitored in accordance with ASTM D 5055 and D  
5456, respectively.  
Wood structural panels, when permanently exposed  
in outdoor applications, are to be of Exterior Type,  
except that wood structural panel roof sheathing  
exposed to the outdoors on the underside is permit-  
ted to be Exposure 1 type.  
§ 2303.1.4 addresses structural glued cross-lami-  
nated timber. Cross-laminated timber materials are  
made of dimension lumber or structural composite  
lumber \(SCL\), cross-laminated into larger panels  
for use in mass timber construction. They are to be  
manufactured and identified as required in ANSI/  
APA PRG 320.

Wood Trusses  
Wood trusses are to comply with § 2303.4.1  
through § 2303.4.7 and be designed in accor-  
dance with the provisions of the code using  
accepted engineering practice. Members are  
permitted to be joined by nails, glue, bolts, tim-  
ber connectors, metal connector plates, or other  
approved framing devices. Wood trusses today  
are typically fabricated items that are pre-engi-  
neered, based on truss span and spacing. There  
are numerous methods for truss manufacturing  
and a detailed description of the various trusses  
is beyond the scope of this introductory book.  
The code requirements are based on the assump-  
tion that trusses will be manufactured offsite and  
delivered to the project site. The code requires  
that a written, graphic, and pictorial depiction  
of each individual truss is to be provided to the  
building official for approval prior to installation.  
Truss design drawings are to be provided with  
the shipment of trusses delivered to the job site.

With the development of new classifications of  
Type IV mass timber construction, § 2304.10.1  
addresses fire-resistance ratings for connec-  
tions in Type IV-A, IV-B, or IV-C construction.  
The connections are required to be tested as  
part of the rating testing for the overall mass  
timber assembly, or the performance is to be  
demonstrated by an engineering analysis.  
The code states that the fire-resistance of the  
connections shall be determined by one of the  
following\:  
1\. Testing in accordance with § 703.2, where  
the connection is part of the fire-resistance  
test.  
2\. Engineering analysis that demonstrates  
that the temperature rise at any portion  
of the connection is limited to an average  
temperature rise of 250°F \(139°C\), and  
a maximum temperature rise of 325°F  
\(181°C\), for a time corresponding to the  
required fire-resistance rating of the  
structural element being connected. For the  
purposes of this analysis, the connection  
includes connectors, fasteners, and  
portions of wood members included in the  
structural design of the connection.

their wide dimension perpendicular to the wall.  
The size, height, and spacing of wood studs are  
called out in Table 2308.5.1.  
•  
Utility studs spaced at 16" \(406\) on  
center and not more than 8' \(2438\)  
high for exterior and bearing walls  
may support no more than a roof  
and ceiling.  
•  
•

THE BASICS  
For example, 2 × 4 studs in a bearing wall  
supporting one floor, roof, and ceiling are  
spaced at 16" \(406\) on center and may have  
a laterally unsupported height of 10' \(3048\).  
2 × 6 studs in the same situation may be  
spaced at 24" \(610\) on center.  
2 × 6 studs in a bearing wall supporting  
two floors, roof, and ceiling are spaced at  
16" \(406\) on center and may have a  
laterally unsupported height of 10' \(3048\). WOOD  
•  
Bearing and exterior walls are to have  
double top plates overlapped at the corners.  
•  
Not less than three studs are to be installed  
at each corner of an exterior wall.  
•  
End joints are to be offset 48" \(1219\) at plate  
laps and nailed with not less than 8-16d  
common face nails on each side of the joint.  
•  
Where double top plates are less than 2 × 6  
or 3 × 4; studs are spaced at 24" \(610\) on  
center; and the floor joists, floor trusses,  
or roof trusses they support are spaced at  
more than 16" \(406\) on center, the joists, or  
trusses should bear within 5" \(127\) of the  
studs beneath.  
•  
Studs in nonbearing partitions may be  
spaced up to 24" \(610\) on center and may  
be set with their long dimension parallel  
to the wall.  
BUILDING MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS / 369 WOOD  
Cripple Walls  
§ 2308.5.6 specifies that cripple walls—  
walls extending from the top of the foun-  
dation to the framing of the lowest floor  
level—are to be framed with the same size  
studs as the walls above. The studs must  
be 14" \(356\) or more in height; if they are  
not, the cripple wall must be of solid block-  
ing. If the cripple wall studs are more than  
4' \(1219\) high, the wall frame is considered  
to be a story. Cripple walls must be braced  
per § 2308.6.6 as for any other braced wall  
panel.  
Headers  
§ 2308.5.5.1 requires that headers be pro-  
vided over each opening in exterior bear-  
ing walls. The size and spans in Table  
2308.4.1.1 \(1\) are permitted to be used for  
one- and two-family dwellings. Headers for  
other buildings shall be designed in accor-  
dance with § 2301.2, Item 1 or 2. Headers  
shall be of two pieces of nominal 2" \(51\)  
framing lumber set on edge as permitted  
by Table 2308.4.1.1 \(1\) and nailed together  
in accordance with Table 2304.10.2, or be  
of solid lumber of equivalent size.

Cutting, Notching, or Boring  
Exterior wall studs and bearing partition  
studs may be partially cut, notched, or  
bored under certain conditions as pre-  
scribed in § 2308.5.9 and § 2308.5.10.

Nailing at the foundation plate and the top  
plate is not to exceed 6" \(152\) on center.  
For example, nailing for 3/8" \(10\) wood structural  
panels per Table 2304.6.1 would be 6d common  
nails, 6" \(152\) on center at the edges, and 12"  
\(305\) on center in the field of the panel. Closer  
nail spacings are required for higher wind  
speeds than those shown in the table.  
6" \(152\)  
12" \(305\)  
Headers are to be of 2 × material set on edge  
and nailed together per Table 2304.10.2 or  
lumber of equivalent size.  
For example, for a 36' \(10 973\) wide  
building with a 30 psf \(1.44 kN/m2\) snow load,  
a header supporting the roof, ceiling, and one  
clear span floor, a 5'1" \(1549\) opening would  
require a header of either three 2 × 10s with  
two jack studs supporting each end or four 2 ×  
8s with two jack studs supporting each end.  
Using three 2 × 10s would require a wall  
depth of at least 4  
1/2" \(114\) to allow the  
jack studs to carry all three members of  
the built-up header.  
Per § 2308.5.5.1, single-member headers of  
nominal 2" \(51\) thickness may be framed with a  
single flat 2" \(51\) nominal member or wall plate  
not less in width than the wall studs on the top  
and bottom of the header in accordance with  
Figures 2308.5.5.1 \(1\) or \(2\) and face-nailed to the  
top and bottom of the header with 10d box nails  
\[3" × 0.128" \(76 × 3.3\)\] spaced 12" \(305\) on center.  
Exterior wall and bearing partition studs may  
be notched up to 25% of their width.  
Studs may have bored holes up to 40% of their  
width and no closer than 5/8" \(16\) from their  
edges. When bored studs are doubled, holes  
may be up to 60% of the studs’ width.  
Nonbearing partition studs may have notches  
of up to 40% of their width. Bored holes may  
be up to 60% of the stud width with the same  
edge clearance as for bearing wall studs. Bracing  
§ 2308.6 requires that bracing be pro-  
vided per § 2308.6.1 through § 2308 6.10.2,  
depending on the type of bracing used, the  
seismic design category, and the height of  
the building.

BUILDING MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS / 375 GLASS AND GLAZING  
Chapter 24\: Glass and Glazing  
Chapter 24 contains the provisions governing  
the materials, design, construction, and quality  
of glass, light-transmitting ceramic, and light-  
transmitting plastic panels used for glazing.  
The requirements apply to vertical and sloped  
applications such as for windows and skylights.  
§ 2403 requires that glass bear a manufacturer’s  
mark on each pane designating the thickness  
and type of glass or glazing material.  
•  
Glass is to be firmly supported in such a  
manner that the deflection of a pane of  
glass in a direction perpendicular to the  
pane must not exceed 1/175 of the glass  
edge length where the glass edge length  
is not more than 13'6" \(4115\), or 1/240 of  
the glass edge length + 1/4" \(6\) where the  
glass edge length is greater than 13'6"  
\(4115\), when subjected to either positive or  
negative combined loads per § 1605, such  
as dead loads, live loads, wind loads, snow  
loads, or seismic loads.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
376 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—  
THE BASICS  
For load calculations, § 2404 assumes  
that the glass is supported on all four  
sides. Analysis or test data prepared by a  
registered design professional is required to  
verify that glass not supported on four sides  
will meet the code’s safety criteria.  
Tempered glass is heat-treated to  
strengthen it. The treatment also makes  
the glass panes shatter into small granular  
pieces that are much less sharp and  
dangerous than shards from untreated  
glass. However, since the entire pane  
shatters, protection or limitation of the  
panes’ sizes is required by the code.  
Laminated glass is made up of two panes  
of glass with a plastic layer between them.  
Glass fragments are contained by the  
plastic in the event of breakage of the glass  
panes, thus not having the panels fall out  
of their frames or rain glass pieces on the  
area below.  
Wired glass has pieces of wire embedded  
in the glass that act to contain glass  
fragments and keep the pane in place if the  
glass breaks. Sloped Glazing and Skylights  
§ 2405 applies where glazing is installed at a  
slope more than 15° \(0.26 rad\) from the vertical  
plane. These requirements apply to all types of  
glazing materials, but the detailed requirements  
focus on the use of various types of glass. We  
will illustrate basic criteria and exceptions used  
in typical skylight designs glazed with glass.  
Because skylights often occur above walkways  
or occupied spaces, the code places special  
safety requirements on skylight glazing to protect  
building occupants. Special glazing materials or  
protective measures are required.  
•  
§ 2405.3 requires screening of  
noncombustible material not thinner than  
No. 12 B&S gauge \[0.0808" \(2\)\] with mesh  
no larger than 1" × 1" \(25 × 25\) below  
annealed, wired, heat-strengthened, or  
fully tempered glass in monolithic glazing  
systems.  
•  
This screening is also required where  
annealed, heat-strengthened, fully tempered,  
or wired glass is used as the bottom layer in  
multiple-layer glazing systems.  
GLASS AND GLAZING  
•  
This section on sloped glazing and  
skylights applies to the installation of  
glazing materials at a slope greater than  
15° \(0.26 rad\) from a vertical plane.  
•  
•  
Screen should be located a maximum  
of 4" \(102\) below the glazing.  
Screening should be securely fastened  
and be able to adequately support twice  
the weight of the falling glass.  
•  
These screens are intended to protect  
occupants below from falling chunks  
of glass, but they are not often seen in  
practice, due to use of the exceptions  
listed on the following page.  
BUILDING MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS / 377 GLASS AND GLAZING  
•  
The screening required by § 2405.3 may be  
omitted where the sloped glazing consists  
of laminated glass with a minimum 30-mil  
\(0.76\) polyvinyl butyral \(or equivalent\)  
interlayer or of heat-strengthened glass,  
fully tempered glass, or wired glass. This  
also applies where laminated glass forms  
the layer of glazing facing the interior in  
multiple-layer glazing systems.  
•  
Two of the often-used exceptions to  
§ 2405.3 are\:  
1\. Sloped glazing using fully tempered glass  
between intervening floors when the glass  
slopes 30° \(0.52 rad\) or less from the vertical  
and the top of the glass is 10' \(3048\) or less  
above an adjacent walking surface.  
4\. In Group R-2, R-3, and R-4 individual  
dwelling units, fully tempered glass may be  
used in monolithic or multiple-layer glazing  
systems when all of the following conditions  
are met\:  
4.1\. Each pane of glass is 16 sf \(1.5 m2\) or  
less in area.  
4.2\. The highest point of the glass is 12'  
\(3658\) or less above any walking surface or  
accessible area.  
4.3\. The glass thickness is 3/16" \(5\) or less.  
378 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS GLASS AND GLAZING  
Safety Glazing  
A major design consideration is the use  
of safety glazing, primarily tempered glass,  
laminated glass, or impact-resistant plastic  
under certain circumstances. The basic crite-  
ria for safety glazing contained in § 2406 may  
be summarized as requiring safety glazing for  
glass panels subject to human impact under  
normal conditions of use.  
Panes of glass in showers or baths, along  
corridors, at storefronts next to sidewalks,  
adjacent to stairways and ramps, or in  
glass handrails need safety glazing. The  
criteria for safety glazing are set forth in  
16 CFR 1201 by the Consumer Product Safety  
Commission. Glazing complying with ANSI  
Z97.1 may be used at locations where the  
code does not mandate compliance solely  
with the CPSC standard. Under most circum-  
stances, this glazing is basically the same  
type as for skylights, tempered glass, or  
laminated glass. Typically, wired glass does  
not meet the CPSC criteria. There are many  
specific conditions where safety glazing is  
required. We will illustrate them, along with  
some common exceptions that are often  
applied. The locations in § 2406.4.1 through  
§ 2406.4.7 are considered specific hazardous  
locations requiring safety glazing materials.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
24" \(610\) arc  
Safety glazing is required  
\(except at latch side of  
closed door in R-2 dwelling  
units or one- and two-  
family dwellings\).  
§ 2406.4.1\. Glazing in all fixed and operable  
panels of swinging, sliding, and bifold doors  
is to be considered a hazardous location.  
Exceptions are\:  
1\. Glazed openings of a size through which a  
3" \(76\) diameter sphere is unable to pass.  
2\. Decorative glazing.  
3\. Glazing materials used as curved glazed  
panels in revolving doors.  
4\. Commercial refrigerated cabinet glazed  
doors.  
5\. Glazing in doors for hot tubs, saunas,  
showers, and bathtubs, as well as  
compartment glazing that is less than 60"  
\(1524\) above the floor of the enclosure or  
from the water's edge.  
§ 2406.4.2\. Glazing in fixed or operable  
panels where the nearest edge of the  
glazing is within a 24" \(610\) arc of either  
vertical edge of the door in a closed position  
and the bottom edge of the glazing is less  
than 60" \(1524\) above the walking surface.  
This does not apply to glazing perpendicular  
to the plane of the closed door in residential  
dwelling units.  
No safety glazing required when separated  
by a permanent wall or barrier or when  
access is to a closet less than 3' \(914\) in  
depth if glazing complies with § 2406.4 for  
windows.  
Decorative glazing is excepted. Decorative  
glass is defined as being “carved, leaded  
or Dalle glass or glazing material whose  
purpose is decorative or artistic, not  
functional; whose coloring, texture or other  
design qualities or components cannot be  
removed without destroying the glazing  
material and whose surface, or assembly  
into which it is incorporated, is divided into  
segments.”  
BUILDING MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS / 379 GLASS AND GLAZING  
•

Safety glazing is not required for decorative  
glazing or when a protective bar at least  
11/2" \(38\) is installed on the accessible side  
of the glazing 34" to 38" \(864 to 965\) above  
the floor.  
§ 2406.4.3\. When a glazed panel, operable  
or not, meets all of the following criteria, it

BUILDING MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS / 381 GYPSUM BOARD, GYPSUM PANEL PRODUCTS, AND PLASTER  
Chapter 25\: Gypsum Board and Plaster  
Code requirements for the use of gypsum board,  
gypsum panel products, lath, gypsum plaster,  
cement plaster, and reinforced gypsum concrete  
focus on durability and weather-resistance of the  
materials. The standards in Chapter 25 relate to  
quality of construction, not to quality of appear-  
ance. A key measure of where standards for  
exterior walls are to be applied is determined by  
the weather exposure of the surface. Weather-  
exposed surfaces are defined mostly in Chapter  
2, as one might expect, with three exceptions  
that are not to be considered as weather-  
exposed surfaces. This is another reminder of  
how important it is to read and understand how  
the code uses definitions. Weather-exposed  
surfaces are considered to be\:  
1\. Ceilings and roof soffits enclosed by walls,  
fascia, bulkheads, or beams that extend a  
minimum of 12" \(305\) below the ceiling or  
soffit.  
≥2H  
2\. Walls or portions of walls beneath an  
unenclosed roofed area that are located a  
distance from an opening equal to at least  
twice the height of the opening.  
≥ 10'0"  
\(3048\)  
3\. Ceilings and roof soffits located a minimum  
of 10' \(3048\) from the unenclosed edge of  
the ceiling or soffit area.

H GYPSUM BOARD, GYPSUM PANEL PRODUCTS, AND PLASTER  
Vertical and Horizontal Assemblies  
§ 2504 requires wood framing, stripping, and  
furring for lath or gypsum board to be a mini-  
mum nominal thickness of 2" \(51\) in the least  
dimension. Wood furring strips over solid back-  
ing may be nominal 1" × 2" \(25 × 51\) dimension.  
•  
Minimum nominal thickness of 2" \(51\)  
for wood framing and furring strips  
Shear Wall Construction  
§ 2505 permits gypsum board and lath-and-  
plaster walls to be used for shear walls. The use  
is dependent on the type of wall-framing materi-  
als. Wood-framed walls and steel-framed walls  
may be used to resist both wind and seismic  
loads. Walls resisting seismic loads are subject  
to the limitations of Section 12.2.1 of ASCE 7.  
Gypsum Construction  
§ 2508 governs both gypsum board and gypsum  
plaster. They are not to be used where they will  
be directly exposed to weather. Gypsum board  
joints are to occur at framing members except  
where the edges are perpendicular to the fram-  
ing members.  
•  
Per § 2504.1.2, the minimum thickness of  
vertically erected studless solid plaster  
partitions is to be 2" \(51\).  
•  
•  
Fasteners are to be applied so as not to  
fracture the face paper with the fastener  
head. Screws are typically used, driven  
far enough to depress the surface without  
breaking the paper. This allows covering the  
fastener with finishing compounds while  
fastening the material securely.  
With few exceptions, most fire-resistance-  
rated assemblies are to have joints and  
fasteners treated.  
Materials  
§ 2506 and § 2507 specify that gypsum board  
and lathing and plastering materials are to  
meet code-designated AISI, GA, and ASTM  
standards. Materials are to be stored to protect  
them from the weather.  
Gypsum Board in Showers and  
Water Closets  
§ 2509 governs the use of gypsum board as  
a base for tile or wall panels for tubs, show-  
ers, and water closet compartment walls. All  
gypsum board used in these situations is to  
be water-resistant. Note that water-resistant  
gypsum board cannot be used in these applica-  
tions if a vapor retarder is used in shower or bath  
compartments.  
Base for tile in showers and water closets is  
to conform to the requirements of § 2509.2  
and be of glass-mat gypsum backing pan-  
els, nonasbestos fiber-cement backer board, or  
nonasbestos fiber-mat reinforced cementitious  
backer units per Table 2509.2. Note that this list  
does not include water-resistant gypsum board.  
These requirements also apply to the ceilings in  
shower areas.  
BUILDING MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS / 383 GYPSUM BOARD, GYPSUM PANEL PRODUCTS, AND PLASTER  
Cement Plaster  
§ 2510 covers lathing and furring for cement  
plaster. Per § 2510.6, water-resistive barriers  
are to be installed as required in § 1403.2 and,  
where applied over wood-based sheathing in  
dry \(B\) climate zones, the barrier is to include  
one of two optional water-resistive, vapor-  
permeable barriers with a performance at least  
equivalent to two layers of a water-resistive  
barrier complying with ASTM E 2556, Type I.  
The first option consists of the individual lay-  
ers being installed independently, such that  
each layer provides a separate continuous  
plane and any flashing \(installed in accordance  
with § 1404.4\) intended to drain to the water-  
resistive barrier is directed between the layers.  
The second option for dry \(B\) climate zones  
is to use a single layer of Grade D paper or a  
layer complying with ASTM E 2556, Type II,  
separated from the cement plaster with foam  
plastic insulating sheathing or other nonwater  
absorbing layer, or a drainage space.  
The options for moist \(A\) or marine \(C\) cli-  
mates incorporate the two options for dry \(B\)  
climates with some additional provisions.  
§ 2512 requires cement plaster, also called  
stucco, to be applied in three coats over  
corrosion-resistant metal lath or wire fabric  
lath, or applied in two coats over masonry or  
concrete. The three coats have specific names  
and functions. Table 2512.6 specifies curing  
times and miniumum intervals between each  
coat for each of the cement plaster coats.

For moist or marine climates\: Where the  
water-resistive barrier is applied over wood-  
based sheathing in moist \(A\) or marine \(C\)  
climate zones, in addition to the requirements  
for dry climates, a ventilated air space is to  
be provided between the exterior stucco and  
water-resistive barrier to prevent moisture  
from penetrating the water-resistive barrier.  
The base or scratch coat builds up the  
thickness and has a roughened surface for  
increased adhesion of the next layer. Minimum  
curing time is 48 hours, and the interval before  
the second coat is 48 hours for exterior plaster.  
The brown coat, so called because it is a  
darker color than typical finish coats, smooths  
out the scratch coat but still is to have  
sufficient roughness to provide a bond for the  
finish coat. The second coat is to be smooth  
within 1/4" \(6\) in any direction under a 5' \(1524\)  
straight edge. Minimum curing time is 48  
hours and the interval before the final coat is 7  
days for exterior plaster.  
The third or finish coat is applied over the  
second coat.  
The first and second coats are to be applied  
under proper weather conditions and kept  
moist for 48 hours. Wetting and the finish  
intervals are intended to minimize cracking  
of the finished surface. Deviations from the  
application intervals are allowed for certain  
plaster mixes containing admixtures and  
accelerated curing procedures per referenced  
standards.  
There is to be a weep screed at the base  
of the wall to allow moisture that enters  
the plaster surface to drip down the water-  
resistant membrane and escape at the bottom. Chapter 26\: Plastics  
Chapter 26 covers a wide variety of plastic build-  
ing materials that can take many diverse forms.  
Plastic finish and trim, foam plastic insulation,  
plastic veneers, light-transmitting plastics for  
glazing, and plastic composites, including plastic  
lumber, are all covered by this chapter.  
Because plastics are typically flammable, the  
code places restrictions on their use related  
to their flame spread and smoke generation.  
Foam plastics are typically to have a flame  
spread index of no more than 75 and a smoke-  
developed index of no more than 450 when  
tested at their anticipated thickness.

An exception allows for the  
use of foam plastic as part  
of an interior floor finish.  
PLASTICS  
•  
A thermal barrier of 1/2" \(13\) gypsum  
wallboard or heavy timber is to separate  
foam plastic from the interior of a building.  
Equivalent materials may be used if they  
meet the acceptance criteria specified in  
§ 2603.4.  
•  
•  
§ 2603.4.1 allows the thermal barrier to be  
omitted in specific instances as set forth in  
§ 2603.4.1.1 through § 2603.4.1.14.  
The thermal barrier may be omitted if the  
foam plastic insulation is covered on each  
face by at least 1" \(25\) of masonry  
or concrete.  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
A thermal barrier is not required when the  
foam insulation is part of a Class A, B, or C  
roof-covering assembly and if the assembly  
passes specified fire tests,  
Or if the roof assembly is separated  
from the interior of the building by wood  
structural panel sheathing not less than  
0.47" \(12\) thick, is bonded with exterior  
glue, with edges supported by blocking,  
tongue-and-groove joints, or other approved  
type of edge support, or an equivalent  
material.  
In attics or crawl spaces “where entry  
is made only for service of utilities,”  
thermal barriers are not required if the  
foam insulation is covered with any of the  
specified protective materials.  
A thermal barrier is not required to be  
installed on the walking surface of a  
structural floor system that contains foam  
plastic insulation when the foam plastic is  
covered by a minimum nominal ½-inch-thick  
\(12.7\) wood structural panel or approved  
equivalent.  
The thermal barrier specified in § 2603.4 is  
required on the underside of the structural  
floor system that contains foam plastic  
insulation when the system occurs in a  
floor/ceiling assembly and the underside of  
the structural floor system is exposed to the  
interior of the building.  
BUILDING MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS / 385 PLASTICS  
In buildings not of Type V construction, limita-  
tions are placed by § 2603.5 on the use of foam  
plastic insulation in exterior wall assemblies. It  
is acceptable to use this material, which often  
occurs in exterior insulation and finish system  
assemblies and in manufactured exterior pan-  
els, when they meet the code criteria.  
Foam plastic insulation may be used in exte-  
rior wall assemblies of buildings not of Type V  
construction in the following instances\:  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
§ 2603.5.1\: Where the wall is to have a  
fire-resistance rating, the wall assembly  
shall demonstrate that the rating is  
maintained per tests conducted under  
ASTM E119 or UL 263.  
§ 2603.5.2\: A thermal barrier meeting the  
provisions of § 2603.4 is to be provided  
except at one-story buildings. This thermal  
barrier is equivalent to one layer of 1/2" \(13\)  
gypsum wallboard.  
§ 2603.5.4\: Foam plastic materials must be  
4" \(102\) or less in thickness, and shall have  
a flame-spread index of 25 or less and a  
smoke-developed index of 450 or less.  
2603.5.5\: The wall is to be tested per NFPA  
285\. Note also Exception 1 for one-story  
buildings complying with § 2603.4.1.4,  
which allows use of specified foam  
plastics covered with aluminum or steel  
when the building is sprinklered.  
Exception 2 allows wall assemblies where  
the foam plastic insulation is covered on  
each face by not less than 1" \(25\) thickness  
of masonry or concrete with additional  
airspace limits.  
§ 2603.5.7\: Exterior walls with foam plastic  
materials are not to exhibit sustained  
flaming when tested per NFPA 268. As  
an exception, the assemblies may be  
protected with a thermal barrier; 1" \(25\)

Light-Transmitting Plastics  
§ 2606 governs plastics used for ceiling light  
diffusers, glazing in skylights, glazing in parti-  
tions, glazing in shower and tub enclosures,  
awnings and patio covers, greenhouses, and  
solar collectors. These materials are divided  
into two classes based on their burning rate.  
Class CC1 has a burning extent of 1" \(25\) or less  
per ASTM D 635. Class CC2 materials have a  
burning rate of 2  
1/2" per minute \(1.06 mm/s\) or  
less, per the same test.  
§ 2606.7 prohibits the use of light-diffusing plas-  
tic systems in interior exit stairways and ramps  
and exit passageways, or in large assembly and  
institutional occupancies, unless the building is  
sprinklered.  
Light-Transmitting Plastic Wall Panels  
§ 2607 allows plastics to be used as light-  
transmitting wall panels in buildings other than  
Group A-1, A-2, H, 1–2, and 1–3 occupancies.  
There are limitations on area and panel sizes  
based on the location on the property and the  
class of the plastic material. Table 2607.4 lists  
allowable areas, and vertical and horizontal  
separations between plastic wall panels. The  
areas and percentages listed in the table may  
be doubled for buildings that are fully sprin-  
klered. Panels are to be separated by distances  
as noted in the table unless a flame barrier  
extends 30" \(762\) beyond the exterior wall in  
the plane of the floor.  
•  
•  
Light-diffusing panels are to be hung from  
at least No. 12 steel-wire gauge \[0.106" \(3\)\]  
galvanized wire, and individual panels are  
to be no more than 10' \(3048\) in length nor  
more than 30 sf \(2.79 m2\) in area.  
In sprinklered buildings, diffuser systems  
are to be protected above and below unless  
the sprinkler system has been specifically  
approved for installation only above the light-  
diffusing system. The area of light-diffusing  
systems is not limited when the diffuser is  
protected by approved sprinkler systems.  
•  
Note that light-transmitting plastic may  
be used for glazing, both in wall glazing  
systems and in roof panels. However, it may  
be subject to area limitations for individual  
panels and for the percentage of glazed  
openings similar to those for plastic wall  
panels. Many of the limitations for plastic  
glazing are excepted for buildings that are  
fully sprinklered.

# Plumbing Systems  
While the technical requirements for plumbing system design are not usually the purview of archi-  
tects, except for residential or small commercial projects, the determination of the required number  
of plumbing fixtures based on the use of a building is an essential component of early architectural  
schematic design. The number of fixtures for each gender, accessibility requirements, and the pres-  
ence of single-accommodation or gender-neutral toilets all have an impact on building floor planning.  
It therefore often falls to the architect early in the design process to make determinations of plumbing  
fixture counts and how the counts are to be arranged on various floor levels. These decisions will also  
be subject to review by the Authorities Having Jurisdiction \(AHJ\) over the course of a project to obtain  
a building permit. It can be very disruptive to have to find space for additional toilet fixtures or toilet  
rooms late in the construction document preparation process. Therefore, we strongly recommend  
that early analysis of the required plumbing fixture counts be a part of the conceptual and schematic  
phases of the design process.  
The focus of this chapter is the determination of plumbing fixture counts based on the requirements  
of IBC Table 2902.1. We have compressed the table to some extent to focus on frequently occur-  
ring use and occupancy types. We address the relationship of how fixture counts are determined in  
multiple-user toilet rooms, single-accommodation toilet rooms, and all-gender toilet rooms. Note that  
the distribution of types of toilet facilities is a design decision, usually done at the request of the facil-  
ity user or operator. The code does not mandate which facilities are to be provided, but it does address  
how the various facility fixture counts are to be evaluated against the calculated occupant load.  
It is important to understand that while the occupant load factors in Table 2902.1 are related to egress  
occupant loads, they are not used in the same way. The total occupant load for determining plumbing  
fixture count starts with the egress occupant load as determined per IBC Chapter 10, which is then  
divided by 2 to determine fixture demand for male and female occupants. The gender distribution may  
be other than 50/50 where data can be provided to the AHJ that the typical distribution will be oth-  
erwise. For facilities with various user groups where ratios may vary, the 50/50 ratio should be used. MINIMUM NUMBER OF PLUMBING FIXTURES  
IBC Table 2902.1 is maintained under the  
International Plumbing Code but is repeated in  
Chapter 29 of the code for coordination with  
the IBC. The IBC recognizes the role toilet room  
space requirements plays in early design by  
placing the table in the building code, which is  
most likely to be used by space planners, like  
architects or interior designers.  
The table calls out the required number of  
plumbing fixtures for males and females for var-  
ious occupancy classifications. The occupancy  
classifications are based on those in Chapter 3,  
but there are additional details provided in the  
“Description” column that subdivides the occu-  
pancy groups, based on how they operate. Note  
that the descriptions in the table divide occu-  
pancies in different ways than the subdivisions  
of occupancy groups in Chapter 3. For example,  
bars and restaurants are both A-2 occupancies,  
but the occupant load factors are quite different  
for each use in the table.  
Note also that the tables have time factors  
for toilet room use built into them. For uses  
where there is a constant occupant load or a  
constant rate of turnover, the factors are divided  
equally between males and females. For uses  
where there are distinct surges of use, such  
as intermissions at theaters or halftimes at  
sporting events, the table assigns a different  
factor for fixtures for female use to require more  
fixtures for female occupants. This recognizes  
the physical differences of female versus male  
toilet room use, where women occupy water  
closets for a longer time period than men. The  
code intentionally requires higher fixture counts  
for women than men when there are peak use  
conditions anticipated.  
The fixture count table also refers to § 424.2 in  
the International Plumbing Code, which allows  
substituting a certain number of urinals for  
water closets in male restrooms. The code  
allows urinals to be substituted for water clos-  
ets for no more than 67% of the required water  
closets in assembly and educational occupan-  
cies, and for not more than 50% of the water  
closets in all other occupancies. This percentage  
is typically applied to the male fixture layout  
after the usual 50/50 occupant load split is  
made and the water closet occupant load factor  
is applied.  
Fixture counts for residential occupancies are  
expressed in terms of numbers of fixtures per  
dwelling unit, rather than by occupant load.

Note that when the elevator door is  
centered on the elevator car, the dimensions  
are different than those illustrated. See ICC  
A117.1 for further information.  
Hoistways are to have fire-resistance  
ratings as required by Chapters 6 and 7.  
Doors in elevator shafts, including the  
elevator car doors, are to comply with  
the requirements of Chapter 7.  
An emergency two-way communication  
system is to be provided in elevators\: The  
communication system is to allow two-  
way communication for persons who are  
deaf, hearing-impaired, or speech impaired.  
The system shall provide visible text  
and audible modes that meet all of the  
following requirements\:  
1\. When operating in each mode, include  
a live interactive system that allows  
back-and-forth conversation between  
the elevator occupants and emergency  
personnel.  
2\. System is operational when the elevator  
is operational.  
3\. System allows elevator occupants to  
select the text-based or audible mode  
to interact with emergency personnel,  
depending on their communication  
needs. HOISTWAY ENCLOSURES  
•  
•  
Per § 3002.2, when four or more cars  
serve the same portion of a building,  
they are to be located in not fewer than  
two separate hoistways. The purpose  
of this requirement is to minimize the  
chance that a fire or other emergency  
can disable or contaminate with smoke  
all of the elevators in a bank.  
For example, three elevators can be in  
a single enclosure, but five elevators  
would need a shaft division between  
two sets of cars.  
•  
•  
Elevators are typically not allowed  
to be used for egress unless part of  
an accessible means of egress per  
§ 1009.4, or in high-rise buildings per  
§ 403.6.2\. Such egress elevators occur  
very infrequently.  
Per § 3002.3, standardized pictorial  
signage is to be posted near elevators  
not used for egress stating\:  
IN CASE OF FIRE,  
ELEVATORS ARE OUT OF  
SERVICE, USE EXIT STAIRS  
•  
Per § 3002.4, in buildings four stories  
or more in height, at least one elevator  
is to be provided for fire-department  
emergency access to all floors. This  
elevator is to be sized to accommodate  
a 24” × 84” \(610 × 1930\) ambulance  
stretcher, in a horizontal and open  
position \(that is, not partially folded up\).  
This elevator is to be identified with the  
star of life, the international symbol for  
emergency medical services.

Elevator Lobbies  
•  
Per § 3006.2.1, where elevators open into  
a corridor required to have a fire-resistance  
rated per § 1020.2, elevator hoistway  
openings are to be protected as required by  
§ 3006.3, which has three options\:  
1\. Elevator lobbies separating the elevator  
hoistway from the corridor with rated doors.  
2\. Additional doors that close over the  
elevator doors.  
3\. Pressurization of the elevator hoistway per  
§ 909.21 to prevent smoke from entering  
the hoistway. \(Infrequently used.\)  
Fire Service Access Elevators  
•  
•  
•  
•  
§ 3007.6.1 requires the enclosed fire service  
access elevator lobby to have direct access  
from the enclosed elevator lobby to an  
enclosure for an interior exit stairway or  
ramp. An exception allows connection with  
a corridor having increased corridor door  
ratings. See note below.  
The protected path is to be separated  
from the enclosed elevator lobby through  
an opening protected by a smoke and  
draft control assembly in accordance with  
§ 716.2.2.1.  
Per § 3007.3, an approved method is to be  
provided to prevent water from infiltrating  
the hoistway enclosure from the operation of  
automatic sprinklers outside of the enclosed  
fire service access elevator lobby. This is  
typically done with a trench drain outside the  
lobby entry door.  
Access to an interior exit stairway is also  
permitted to be through a protected path of  
travel that has a level of fire protection not  
less than the elevator lobby enclosure per an  
exception to § 3007.6.1. OCCUPANT EVACUATION ELEVATORS  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
•  
Other than independent plumbing for drains  
or sump pumps for the elevator shaft itself,  
elevator shafts are not to be used for plumbing  
or mechanical systems.  
Per § 403.6.1, in buildings with an occupied  
floor more than 120' \(36 576\) above the lowest  
level of fire department vehicle access, no  
fewer than two fire service access elevators  
\(FSAE\), or all elevators, whichever is less, are to  
be provided. Each fire service access elevator is  
to have a capacity of not less than 3500 pounds  
\(1588 kg\).  
Per § 3007.1, fire service access elevators need  
to serve levels at or above the lowest level of  
fire department access. Thus, levels below the  
lowest level of fire department access need not  
be served by fire service access elevators.  
The enclosure for this elevator is to be a 2-hour  
rated shaft complying with § 713.  
The hoistway is to be illuminated with a  
minimum of 1 foot candle \(11 lux\) for its entire  
height when emergency operation is active.  
Elevator lobbies per § 3007.6 are required at  
the fire service elevator.  
Elevator machine rooms or spaces that contain  
the driving machine, and control rooms or  
spaces that contain the operation or motion  
controller for elevator operation, are to have  
an independent ventilation or air-conditioning  
system to protect against overheating of the  
control equipment. The system design criteria  
for temperature control will be determined  
by the elevator-equipment manufacturer’s  
requirements.  
Provisions of the code in § 3008 allow pas-  
senger elevators to be used for occupant self-  
evacuation during fires. The elevators must  
meet the criteria of § 3008 for fire sprinklers,  
shaft protection, elevator lobbies, and commu-  
nication systems. Where elevators compliant  
with this section are provided, per § 3008.1  
they may be substituted for the additional  
egress stair required by § 403.5.2 in buildings  
with occupied floors higher than 420' \(128 m\) in  
building height.  
§ 3008.6.3 requires that other than the doors  
to the hoistway, each doorway to an occupant  
evacuation elevator lobby shall be provided with  
a 3/4-hour fire door assembly complying with  
§ 716\. The fire door assembly shall also comply  
with the smoke and draft control assembly  
requirements of § 716.2.2.1.1 with the UL 1784  
test conducted without the artificial bottom  
seal.  
Occupant evacuation elevators are intended  
for use by building occupants for self evacu-  
ation, using these elevators in lieu of egress  
stairs. Such elevators provide increased access  
to egress for persons with disabilities who  
cannnot negotiate stairs. They are used most  
often in super-tall high-rise buildings, often out-  
side of the United States, where stair cores take  
up floor area on smaller floors. Their use must  
be justified through a rational analyis of egress  
times and their systems must be “hardened”  
to assure continued performance in emergency  
conditions.  
Note that using elevators as a means of egress  
is a new and evolving concept in egress system  
design. The use of elevators for egress under  
§ 3008 should be discussed in detail with the  
AHJ early in the design process.  
ELEVATORS AND CONVEYING SYSTEMS / 399 ESCALATORS  
Per § 3004.2.1, escalator floor openings  
are to be enclosed with shaft enclosures  
complying with § 713 unless the require-  
ments of § 712.1.3 are satisfied. Note  
also that per § 1003.7, escalators are not  
to be used as a component of a required  
means of egress.

# Special  
# Construction  
Chapter 31 of the IBC for “Special Construction” is a bit of a “catchall” for  
miscellaneous building systems or elements that are not large enough occu-  
pancies or uses to merit inclusion in Chapter 4 of the IBC. When confronted  
with an odd situation in a building, it is worth examining this chapter to  
see if it contains guidance for the issue at hand. The elements included in  
Chapter 31 are listed on the following pages, with a brief description of the  
construction elements addressed. We touch in detail upon those elements  
most likely to be found in typical projects. SPECIAL CONSTRUCTION  
§ 3102\: Membrane Structures  
This section includes air-supported, air-inflated,  
and frame structures over which a membrane is  
stretched. Often, these are temporary structures cov-  
ered by the International Fire Code and § 3103. Such  
structures that are to remain in place for more than  
180 days are to comply with this section.  
§ 3103\: Temporary Structures  
Structures intended for use for less than 180 days  
are to comply with this section as well as with the  
International Fire Code. Permits are required and  
the building must provide life safety and means of  
egress systems similar to those required by the IBC  
for permanent structures.  
§ 3104\: Pedestrian Walkways and Tunnels  
There are often covered or enclosed pedestrian  
circulation paths connecting separate buildings on  
the same site, or even crossing over or under streets  
separating buildings on separate sites. This section  
addresses those connections. The code recognizes  
that such connections should not be considered part  
of either of the buildings they connect and states that  
such walkways are not considered to contribute to  
the building area, number of stories, or height of the  
connected buildings.•

—THE BASICS Per § 3104.5, there are four options for  
connecting fire-rated pedestrian walk-  
ways to separate buildings.  
Option 1\:  
§ 3104.5.1 option requires fire  
barriers extend beyond the point  
where the walkway connects to the  
buildings. This is the least desirable  
alternative architecturally since it  
requires increased wall and opening  
protection in the connected buildings.  
Option 2\:  
§ 3104.5.2 applies to walkways  
between buildings more than 10'  
\(3048\) apart.  
Option 3\:  
§ 3104.3 requires the walkway have  
open sides.  
Option 4\:  
§ 3104.4\) requires exterior walls of  
connected buildings to have fire-  
resistance rating greater than 2 hours.

SPECIAL CONSTRUCTION / 403 SPECIAL CONSTRUCTION  
§ 3105\: Awnings and Canopies  
These are both defined terms in Chapter 2 of the  
IBC\:  
”AWNING. An architectural projection that pro-  
vides weather protection, identity, or decoration  
and is partially or wholly supported by the building  
to which it is attached. An awning is composed of  
a lightweight frame structure over which a cover-  
ing is attached.”  
”CANOPY. A permanent structure or architectural  
projection of rigid construction over which a cover-  
ing is attached that provides weather protection,  
identity, or decoration. A canopy is permitted to be  
structurally independent or supported by attach-  
ment to a building on one or more sides.”  
Both awnings or canopies addressed by  
§ 3105 are assumed to have relatively lightweight  
flexible coverings over a rigid frame. Awnings are  
supported by the building they are attached to,  
either as a cantilever or attached to a wall on one  
side and with a supporting stucutre on the other.  
Awnings are usually placed over windows for  
shade or over doorways for shade and weather  
prtoection.  
Canopies may have similar coverings and struc-  
ture but are typically freestanding or may connect  
buildings. Canopies that connect buildings may  
also be treated as covered walkways per § 3104.  
§ 3106\: Marquees  
“Marquee” is a defined term in Chapter 2 of the  
IBC\:  
”MARQUEE. A canopy that has a top surface  
which is sloped less than 25° from the horizontal  
and is located less than 10’ \(3048\) from operable  
openings above or adjacent to the level of the  
marquee.”  
Marquees are typically canopies at entries to  
theaters or movie houses, having a flat area  
under windows adjacent to them and extended  
out to provide announcement space, weath-  
er protection for the main entry, and identity  
for the building. The term is somewhat inter-  
changeable with “canopies” covered by  
§ 3105 but marquees are made of more substan-  
tial materials than fabric-covered canopies and  
may be built more like a balcony able to support  
weight.

THE BASICS  
This awning is attached to the building  
and is supported completely by it. It has  
a metal frame with a fabric covering to  
shade the wall openings below it. It has  
no posts, but could have posts supporting  
the outer edge and still be considered  
to be an “awning.” If not attached to  
the building, the structure should be  
considered to be a “canopy.”  
This canopy could have a covering of  
fabric or translucent plastic for weather  
protection. While this example is  
freestanding and has its own supports,  
canopies may also be supported by  
attachment to a building. If it connects  
two buildings, it could be treated as a  
covered walkway under IBC § 3104.  
Marquees are to be supported competely  
by the building they are attached to.  
They are to be made entirely of  
noncombustible materials. This is the  
major distinguishing difference between a  
marquee and a canopy or an awing.  
Marquees have a prescribed relationship  
of height to projection depth at the  
sidewalk.

§ 3108\: Telecommunications and  
Broadcast Towers  
This is a very specialized type of construction  
that is rarely encountered. It refers to an outside  
standard, TIA 222, by the Telecommunications

These requirements were originally contained in  
the IBC, but this section now cross-references a  
separate code, the International Swimming Pool  
and Spa Code.  
§ 3110\: Automatic Vehicular Gates  
A placeholder for outside standard references

This section refers to a very specialized type of use that  
occurs in parts of the nation subject to high waters in  
coastal or riverine locations. Some toilet rooms may  
need little elevation as shown here; some may need  
a full story of piles to raise the toilet rooms. All such  
toilets should have ramps for accessibility since they  
are for public use.

§ 3115\: Intermodal Shipping Containers  
This section addresses the code requirements for the  
increasingly prevelant repurposing of truck-trailer sized  
steel shipping containers for building construction.  
406 / BUILDING CODES ILLUSTRATED  
—THE BASICS 23  
# Existing  
# Structures  
The requirements for existing buildings, which previously were located  
in Chapter 34 of the IBC, have been removed. Existing buildings are now  
addressed by a separate code, the International Existing Building Code  
\(IEBC\). There are no longer any existing building provisions contained in  
the IBC. Additions and alterations made to existing buildings are to comply  
with the provisions of the International Building Code in the areas where  
new work occurs.  
The scope of the IEBC as stated in Chapter 1 is\: “The intent of this code is  
to provide flexibility to permit the use of alternative approaches to achieve  
compliance with minimum requirements to provide a reasonable level of  
safety, health, property protection, and general welfare insofar as they are  
affected by the repair, alteration, change of occupancy, addition, and reloca-  
tion of existing buildings.”  
The IEBC is applicable to most buildings. An exception, however, allows  
small residential buildings to comply with either the IEBC or the International  
Residential Code. The code text reads as follows\: “Exception\: Detached  
one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses not more than three stories  
above grade plane in height with a separate means of egress, and their  
accessory structures not more than three stories above grade plane in  
height, shall comply with this code or the International Residential Code.”  
“This code” in this context means the IEBC. EXISTING STRUCTURES  
There are five categories of building work that  
can fall under the IEBC. They are\: repairs, altera-  
tions, changes of use or occupancy, additions,  
and relocated buildings. Relocated buildings  
occur much more rarely than the other four  
categories so they will not be discussed here.  
The other categories are encounted often by  
building owners and design professionals. They  
are described graphically below.  
As soon as a building is completed and legally  
occupied, it becomes an “existing building,”  
and any work on such buildings must first be  
analyzed under the IBEC to determine what ele-  
ments of the IEBC are applicable and what parts  
must be done using the IBC.  
With certain exceptions, new work on existing  
buildings is to be done under the IBC. But code  
analysis of existing buildings should always  
begin in the IEBC to be able to determine what  
portions of the building may remain and which  
must be brought into compliance using the  
latest building code. The simplest way to think  
about this is the motto “new work, new rules.”  
Making alterations and additions to existing  
buildings does not automatically trigger bring-  
ing the entire existing building into compliance  
with the new code. Materials already in use  
in a building that were in compliance with the  
codes in effect at the time of their erection are  
permitted to remain in use unless determined by  
the code official to be unsafe.  
IEBC Scope Items  
Repairs  
The IBC defines “repair” as “the reconstruction,  
replacement, or renewal of any part of an exist-  
ing building for the purpose of its maintenance  
or to correct damage.” For maintenance, the  
materials will likely be in-kind replacement or  
repair of existing materials. Repairs of extensive  
damage will likely be more readily done using  
materials approved in the IBC for new construc-  
tion. The use of both paths of repair are permit-  
ted, but must be reviewed and approved by the  
building official.

Repair may be made using

condition unless substantial  
structural damage has  
occurred. The work is not  
allowed to make the building  
less complying than it  
was before the repair was  
undertaken.  
•  
Per the IBC, new materials  
may be used for repairs as for  
alterations and additions. IBC  
materials for new construction  
are to be used for substantial  
structural repairs. Alterations  
The IBC defines “alteration” as “any construc-  
tion or renovation to an existing structure, other  
than a repair or addition.” The principle of “new  
work = new rules” is applied here to use materi-  
als approved in the IBC for new construction.

Additions  
The IBC defines “addition” as “an extension  
or increase in floor area, number of stories, or  
height of a building or structure.” The principle  
of “new work = new rules” is also applied here  
to use materials approved in the IBC for new  
construction.

Additions to any building or structure are  
to comply with the requirements of the

Alterations to the existing building or  
structure are to be made to ensure  
that the existing building or structure,  
together with the addition, are not less  
compliant with the provisions of the IBC  
than the existing building or structure  
was prior to the addition.  
An existing building together with its  
additions are to comply with the heights  
and areas allowable for the occupancy  
classification.  
EXISTING STRUCTURES / 409 EXISTING STRUCTURES  
Change of Occupancy  
The IEBC definition for “change of occupancy”  
reads\: “Any of the following shall be considered as a  
change of occupancy where the current IBC requires  
a greater degree of safety, accessibility, structural  
strength, fire protection, means of egress, ventila-  
tion, or sanitation than is existing in the current  
building or structure\:  
1\. Any change in the occupancy classification of  
a building or structure. The occupancies are as  
listed in IBC Chapter 3.  
2\. Any change in the purpose of, or a change  
in the level of activity within, a building or  
structure.  
3\. Any change of use.”  
The IEBC further defines “change of use” as “A  
change in the use of a building or a portion of a  
building, within the same group classification, for  
which there is a change in the application of code  
requirements.”  
A change of use, which may still be in the same  
occupancy class, could trigger a need to make build-  
ing improvements if, in the opinion of the building  
official, the new use increases the necessary level  
of health, safety, and welfare measures needed by  
building users. For example, a take-out restaurant  
with no seating would still be considered to be a B  
occupancy, but would have different requirements  
for cooking appliances and ventilation than would a  
conventional office space.  
For the examples to the right, it is assumed there  
is no change of building size. There may or may not  
be substantial alterations necessary to make the  
changes. The extent of necessary new work must  
be analyzed on a case-by-case basis in consultation  
with the building official.  
Compliance Methods  
The detailed analysis of compliance methods is  
beyond the scope of this book. Briefly, however, there  
are three compliance methods available for project  
proponents to choose to apply.  
1\. Prescriptive compliance method\: The most likely  
to be used for the widest range of projects.  
2\. Work area method\: Determines criteria for new  
work based on the extent of altered or added  
spaces.  
3\. Performance method\: Applies formulas relating  
work in existing buildings to desired outcomes  
using IBC criteria.

Changes  
Conversion of an existing space to a take-  
out pizzeria would be a distinct change of  
use but would still be a “B” occupancy.  
This would take more modification and  
would likely require more alteration work  
than a change of occupancy to a small  
retail shop.  
New retail shop in an existing office  
building \(or vice versa\) could be done  
with minimal alterations.
